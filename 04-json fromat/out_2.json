DOT arrived in Bothwell on May 13, 2020, and has already taken to the fields of Chatham-Kent to be used in commercial fertilizer application. DOT is a built-in-Canada autonomous farming platform that was first showcased at the 2018 Precision Agriculture Conference in London, Ontario. Chuck Baresich, general manager of Haggerty Creek, attended conference and said, \"the concept of a single power unit with multiple attachments is such an exciting technology. DOT was so far along in development when I first saw them, and I have been following their progress ever since.\" Baresich saw them again at the 2019 Canada's Outdoor Farm Show, and visited their research farm in Regina, Saskatchewan in October. The practical and immediate application for Haggerty Creek is operator efficiency. The operator can be answering calls and providing service to customers while the machine is spreading product in the field. Baresich says, \"there are other things our staff can be doing, rather than driving the machine.\" DOT Technology Corp. (DOT), a leader in autonomous platforms, was purchased by Raven Industries in early May 2020. As an award-winning Raven Industries dealer, Baresich's decision to move ahead with the technology was made, \"I knew there was going to be a solid investment behind this technology. Autonomous farming isn't coming. It's here. DOT is the first step, and we wanted to lead the charge.\" AGRIS Co-operative general manager Jim Campbell says autonomy is the word this year, \"Haggerty and AGRIS are always bringing you what's next. This is what's next.\" Baresich is a big Star Wars fan. \"When I first saw R2-D2 and C3-PO, I've always loved robotics. I imagined what could that do for agriculture. Plus, it's fun,\" he said. Haggerty Creek Ltd. is jointly owned by the Baresich brothers, Chuck and Justin, and AGRIS Co-operative Ltd. Haggerty has been active in precision farming for many years, specializing in controllers and farmer training. Now they are early adopters of autonomous farming equipment with the purchase of the DOT platform and an additional smaller unit for soil sampling and other applications. AGRIS Co-operative Ltd. is a 100 per cent farmer-owned grain marketing and farm-input supply company that serves more than 1,000 farmer-owners in 14 locations in Essex, Kent, Elgin, Middlesex and Lambton counties. They are a leader in precision farming technology, seed, agronomy and petroleum services. The co-operative is a partner of Great Lakes Grain, a grain merchandising company. AGRIS Co-operative is a member-owner of GROWMARK, Inc. and markets products and services under the FS brand. Media contacts: Chuck Baresich General Manager Haggerty Creek Ltd.

(TSXV: BEE) (OTCQB: BEVVF) (CVE: BEE) (the \"Company\" or \"BVT\") today announced it will conduct trials of BVT's natural precision agriculture system on cranberries in Massachusetts and New Jersey , two major cranberry growing regions. This represents an expansion of BVT into a new crop on the heels of its successful commercialization of their product in the strawberry and blueberry markets. The trials will be conducted in collaboration with leading cranberry researchers at the University of Massachusetts and New Jersey's Rutgers University on fields from growers who are part of a major US farmer-owned cranberry cooperative. The Company is also in discussions with US Department of Agriculture (USDA) scientists based in Wisconsin who are interested in following the work in both Massachusetts and New Jersey. An estimated 98% of global cranberry production comes from North America, with approximately 41,500 acres[(1)] and 18,000 acres[(2][)] cultivated across the US and Canada, respectively, on vast commercial cranberry farms in Massachusetts, Wisconsin, New Jersey, Oregon, Washington, Florida, British Columbia, Quebec, Ontario and other parts of Canada. The US is the world's top cranberry producer, with a US$292 million[(][4)] industry that harvests more than 905 million[(3)] pounds of the fruit each year. Cranberry growers constantly battle fruit rot, which is caused by different fungal pathogens, and are increasingly looking for new tools to fight these pathogens as chemical fungicides are being banned or becoming less effective due to resistance development. The trials will begin in late June and will evaluate the efficacy of BVT's proprietary Clonostachys rosea CR-7 beneficial biological fungicide in improving cranberry crop health and mitigating fruit rot. As a biological (a natural pesticide alternative), CR-7 is the right tool at the right time for cranberry growers to utilize in addressing these significant concerns. CR-7 has received a residue tolerance exemption from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which confirms that products with CR-7 are safe for human consumption. Unlike many chemical pesticides, there is no requirement to test crops for residual CR-7, eliminating the grower's risk of crops being rejected, especially in export markets. This is a significant competitive advantage for growers using CR-7 products. \"BVT has been successful in establishing itself in the strawberry and blueberry markets. Cranberries are our next big crop opportunity in America, where we have EPA approval for commercial operations,\" says Ashish Malik, CEO of Bee Vectoring Technologies. \"The farmer-owned cooperative involved with these trials is especially interested in the results since the BVT system aligns closely with their commitment to sustainable agriculture.\" BVT's natural precision agriculture system delivers the biological pesticide alternative CR-7 directly to crop blooms via commercially grown bees. This means growers use a fraction of the crop protection product required with traditional spray applications. Water consumption and use of fossil fuels is also significantly reduced.

AgPrize 2020, the brainchild of Huron County Economic Development in southwestern Ontario, invites Canadians of all ages to help solve a wide range of small, yet important, challenges in the county's agriculture sector. \"There are many great ideas floating around in the heads of people across the country. We want to tap into those ideas,\" says Alex Ripley, economic development officer. AgPrize 2020 participants are being asked to consider real-world challenges that exist for farmers today. \"While there is a lot of cutting-edge technology in precision agriculture, genetics, fertilizers and other inputs, we feel there is room for innovation in the unsung small problems that still exist for small operators. These are the challenges that need another pair of eyes to find a solution,\" explains Ripley. \"A competition is a fun approach to doing just that, while satisfying a pressing need. Solving these problems will help small farm business owners in our region, and beyond, in a variety of ways such as improving on-farm safety, reducing costs, and achieving environmental sustainability goals, among others.\" Each week a specific challenge, currently being experienced by a local farmer in Huron County, will be illustrated in a short online video. Contestants have 12 weeks to come up with a viable solution that is inexpensive, environmentally sound, and quickly and easily implemented. Winning entrants for each question will receive a cash prize of $2,020, but the reward goes beyond that, says Ripley. \"A suite of expertise will be made available to help winners commercialize their projects. This includes legal and accounting advice as well as funding support to take products from prototype to something that can be adopted across the industry - locally, nationally and, potentially, globally.\" The first four challenge question videos are already available online for review, with a submission deadline of July 6, 2020. One focuses on the issue of widely used heat lamps that keep newborn lambs and piglets warm. Existing technology is energy inefficient and can pose a fire risk. It asks, \"Can you make a better heat lamp/heat source - one that is safer, more efficient, and cost effective?\" Another looks at moving heavy farm equipment across different points along a stream in an environmentally sound, safe, durable and inexpensive manner. The final two seek solutions to help a producer deliver vegetables to the marketplace, and to help a farmer explain and demonstrate dairy herd welfare to customers. An additional question will be posted online every week, each with a 12-week deadline to submit. \"Upcoming challenges involve maple syrup production and online sales, to name just two. We will continue to add a question a week until we run out of challenges, or we run out of prize money,\" Ripley says. Adds Ripley, \"Today, especially, we have to be thankful that our food supply and supply chains are working effectively as we move through this crisis. Unfortunately, many people have an outdated or narrow view of Canadian agriculture. The hope is that when looking at the challenges we have posed, and getting to know our farmers, there are positive conversations about how food gets to our table and increased awareness of an industry that works very well in this country.\" As the number one sector in Huron County, agriculture is the economic engine of the region. \"Annually, there is more agricultural dollar value created here than in some entire provinces,\" says Ripley. \"It defines the contours of our county and its identity. But we are not only producers of cash crops such as pulses (legumes), grains and livestock that are consumed locally and shipped internationally. We have a robust agritourism sector that is defined by the farm to table movement and embraced by our local restaurants. We also have a cluster of 14 breweries and wineries that continues to grow because of our unique microclimate.\" Where careers are concerned, there is an emerging need for highly trained talent, says Ripley. \"Each year, about 100,000 jobs in Canadian agriculture go unfilled. As we move further into this century, that will not slow down. While some are labour related, there will be an increasing need for engineers, data analysts, programmers and technicians of all kinds because agriculture is becoming increasingly more hi-tech. That is something for young people participating in AgPrize 2020 to consider for their future.\" Challenge questions, registration forms and additional information are available at huroncounty. ca/economic-development/agprize2020.

The Microsoft co-founder and world's second-richest man has warned us for years, decades even, to take the threat of epidemics and pandemics seriously. Today the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is devoting hundreds of millions of dollars to finding ways to end the COVID-19 pandemic. The effort has evolved into Mr. Gates's highest-profile crusade since the foundation was launched 20 years ago. With an endowment of US$46.8-billion at last count, the foundation has always focused on human health, spending fortunes to try to eradicate polio and malaria, reduce HIV infections and deliver lifesaving vaccines to countries with poorly developed health care systems. The arrival of the pandemic has given Mr. Gates newfound credibility. In a 2015 TED Talk, he said that \"if anything kills more than 10 million people in the next few decades, it's most likely to be an infectious virus rather than a war.\" He repeated the warning in lectures, interviews and medical journals - to little avail. When COVID-19 tore through Wuhan, China, late last year and galloped across the planet, governments and health care systems were largely unprepared. By Friday, there were more than 4.5 million confirmed coronavirus cases globally, with 305,000 deaths - 87,000 of them in the United States. The true figures are probably much higher. I admire Mr. Gates for his prescient warning about the pandemic, his largely apolitical, science-based approach to finding ways to stop it. My problem with his approach is that it's heavily focused on dream technology - as it always is with Mr. Gates, which should not come as a surprise considering he started the Big Tech revolution in the 1970s with the launch of Microsoft (with a market value of almost US$1.4-trillion, the company remains atop of the tech heap). Big money and big tech can be solutions to a health crisis - but are not always the solution. Sometimes the easy stuff can produce wins, too. Mr. Gates ran into this issue a few years ago, when he was pumping the wonders of technology at United Nations food conferences. To boost crop yields, he spouted the alleged benefits of genetically modified seeds and concepts such as \"digital agriculture\" and a \"global productivity target.\" In other words, expensive, long-term projects with uncertain outcomes. Never mind that many farmers in the developing world would be much happier with faster, easier, cheaper solutions such as basic infrastructure - roads and warehouses - to get food to markets before it spoils (the UN says one-third of food production is wasted). Or simple irrigation techniques - in Africa, only 6 per cent of cultivated land is irrigated. So it is with COVID-19. Take masks. More evidence is emerging virtually every day that masks, if widely used, can work well to contain and reverse a pandemic, allowing economies to open more quickly. But in the Western world, far less so than in Asia, masks for the most part are uncomfortable, not as effective as they should be in stopping the tiniest breath particles, too expensive and not widely available. In Italy, the original European epicentre of the coronavirus crisis, inexpensive and effective masks are still absent from most pharmacies - almost three months after the outbreak was detected. If there were ever a time to invent better masks and convince people to wear them, it would be now. Epidemiologists, immunologists, other doctors and researchers are touting the benefits of masks. A research paper published last month by scientists from Cambridge and University College London, among other research centres, concluded that \"without masking, lifting lockdown after nine weeks while keeping social distancing measures will risk a major second wave of the epidemic in 4-5 months' time.\" An open letter signed this week by 100 scientists and health authorities from around the world said that \"requiring fabric mask use in public places could be amongst the most powerful tools to stop the community spread of COVID-19.\" Mr. Gates agrees that masks can play a role in containing the coronavirus. He has used newspaper comment pieces to promote the widespread allocation of masks, gloves and diagnostic tests as part of a co-ordinated global approach to fighting the disease. But he is far more concerned about finding, producing and distributing a vaccine. That's fine - his financial and moral clout will no doubt speed up the development of a vaccine, which may ultimately be the only way to snuff out the disease. His foundation's spending on COVID-19 has already surpassed US$300-million and probably will go much higher, as the disease shows no sign of burning out, even if it is contained in some countries. But by his own admission, an effective vaccine may not emerge from the lab for at least nine months and as long as two years. There is some chance the effort could take longer or prove entirely unsuccessful. If Mr. Gates is looking for a quick win in the global fight to kill off the pandemic, a relatively inexpensive, low-tech solution - a new type of mask - may be his best bet."}, {"title": "AJX AgJunction loses $664,000 (U.S.) in Q1", "article": "AgJunction Inc (TSX:AJX) Shares Issued 117,116,518 Last Close 5/12/2020 $0.175 Tuesday May 12 2020 - News Release Dr. M.

All currency amounts are expressed in U.S. dollars. First quarter 2020 financial summary versus first quarter 2019: - Revenue was $5.2-million versus $14.0-million (first quarter 2019 included $8.7-million of revenue related to the bulk purchase order (BPO)). - Gross margin increased significantly to 56.6 per cent compared with 41.1 per cent. - Operating expenses declined to $3.6-million compared with $5.7-million. - Net loss was $700,000 or one cent per share, versus net income of $100,000 or nil per share. - EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) was $500,000 versus $600,000. Management commentary \"Our first quarter reflected momentum from the refined strategy we announced earlier this year,\" said Dr. M. Brett McMickell, president and chief executive officer of AgJunction. \"As a reminder, our year-over-year comparisons don't paint the whole picture as our first quarter of last year included a significant amount of revenue from a bulk purchase order that was completed in the third quarter of 2019. During the first quarter, sales in our indirect channel exceeded internal expectations as we are now better positioned to meet the specific needs of [original equipment manufacturer] and VAR partners with our flexible modules. Additionally, we experienced an uptick in demand for our direct-to-consumer Wheelman products that exceeded our internal expectations as interest in our unique offerings continue to increase through word of mouth and industry trade coverage. \"As we move forward in this ever changing market environment (due to COVID-19), we continue to operate at full strength and have experienced limited disruptions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we are diligently monitoring the situation, particularly in our global supply chain, and have contingency plans in place in an effort to mitigate risk. Despite these macrochallenges, the ag industry seems to be recovering from a historically difficult 2019, and we do not currently see any factors that we believe will materially impact demand in 2020. In fact, we have generated a higher backlog of orders in our second quarter than we originally anticipated, and our team is doing an excellent job fulfilling the heightened demand. \"Although there is much uncertainty in the market, we remain confident in our refined strategy and continue to expect growing sales by providing technologically advanced modules that are among the most innovative in the industry. Given our strong cash balance and exceptional work force, we believe we are well positioned to weather challenges that may arise in this environment, and look forward to continue meeting the evolving needs of our customers.\" First quarter 2020 financial results Total revenue in the first quarter of 2020 was $5.2-million compared with $14.0-million in the first quarter of 2019. Excluding $8.7-million of revenue generated from the BPO in the prior-year period, revenue in the first quarter of 2020 was nearly flat compared with the first quarter of 2019. Gross profit in the first quarter of 2020 was $2.9-million compared with $5.8-million in the first quarter of 2019. Gross margin increased significantly to 56.6 per cent compared with 41.1 per cent in the first quarter of 2019. The margin improvement was primarily driven by an increase in flexible module product mix sold, a reduced impact of the BPO sales and lower manufacturing costs due to streamlining processes. Total operating expenses in the first quarter of 2020 declined to $3.6-million compared with $5.7-million in the first quarter of 2019. The improvement was primarily driven by cost savings from the reduction in staffing and closure of certain facilities as a result of the company's previously implemented consolidation strategy. Net loss in the first quarter of 2020 was $700,000 or one cent per share, compared with net income of $100,000 or nil per share in the first quarter of 2019. The decline was primarily driven by the aforementioned decrease in revenue related to the BPO. EBITDA in the first quarter of 2020 was $500,000 compared with $600,000 in the first quarter of 2019. Cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2020, totalled $15.6-million compared with $17.2-million at the end of 2019. Working capital was $18.6-million compared with $19.2-million at the end of 2019.

(TSX: AJX) (\"AgJunction\" or the \"Company\") is reporting financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2020. All currency amounts are expressed in U.S. dollars. First Quarter 2020 Financial Summary vs. First Quarter 2019  Management Commentary \"Our first quarter reflected momentum from the refined strategy we announced earlier this year,\" said Dr. M. Brett McMickell, president and CEO of AgJunction. \"As a reminder, our year-over-year comparisons don't paint the whole picture as our first quarter of last year included a significant amount of revenue from a bulk purchase order that was completed in the third quarter of 2019. During the first quarter, sales in our indirect channel exceeded internal expectations as we are now better positioned to meet the specific needs of OEM and VAR partners with our flexible modules. Additionally, we experienced an uptick in demand for our direct-to-consumer Wheelman products that exceeded our internal expectations as interest in our unique offerings continue to increase through word-of-mouth and industry trade coverage. \"As we move forward in this ever-changing market environment (due to COVID-19), we continue to operate at full strength and have experienced limited disruptions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we are diligently monitoring the situation, particularly in our global supply chain, and have contingency plans in place in an effort to mitigate risk. Despite these macro challenges, the ag industry seems to be recovering from a historically difficult 2019 and we do not currently see any factors that we believe will materially impact demand in 2020. In fact, we have generated a higher backlog of orders in our second quarter than we originally anticipated, and our team is doing an excellent job fulfilling the heightened demand. \"Although there is much uncertainty in the market, we remain confident in our refined strategy and continue to expect growing sales by providing technologically advanced modules that are among the most innovative in the industry. Given our strong cash balance and exceptional workforce, we believe we are well-positioned to weather challenges that may arise in this environment and look forward to continue meeting the evolving needs of our customers.\" First Quarter 2020 Financial Results Total revenue in the first quarter of 2020 was $5.2 million compared to $14.0 million in the first quarter of 2019. Excluding $8.7 million of revenue generated from the BPO in the prior year period, revenue in the first quarter of 2020 was nearly flat compared to the first quarter of 2019. Gross profit in the first quarter of 2020 was $2.9 million compared to $5.8 million in the first quarter of 2019. Gross margin increased significantly to 56.6% compared to 41.1% in the first quarter of 2019. The margin improvement was primarily driven by an increase in flexible module product mix sold, a reduced impact of the BPO sales, and lower manufacturing costs due to streamlining processes. Total operating expenses in the first quarter of 2020 declined to $3.6 million compared to $5.7 million in the first quarter of 2019. The improvement was primarily driven by cost-savings from the reduction in staffing and closure of certain facilities as a result of the Company's previously implemented consolidation strategy. Net loss in the first quarter of 2020 was $0.7 million or $(0.01) per share, compared to net income of $0.1 million or nil per share in the first quarter of 2019. The decline was primarily driven by the aforementioned decrease in revenue related to the BPO. EBITDA in the first quarter of 2020 was $0.5 million compared to $0.6 million in the first quarter of 2019. Cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2020, totaled $15.6 million compared to $17.2 million at the end of 2019. Working capital was $18.6 million compared to $19.2 million at the end of 2019. The Company continues to operate debt free and has access to an unutilized $3.0 million line of credit.

AgPrize 2020,the brainchild of Huron County Economic Development in southwestern Ontario, invites Canadians of all ages to help solve awide range ofsmall, yet important, challenges in the county's agriculture sector.\"There are many great ideas floating around in the heads of people across the country. We want to tap into those ideas,\" says Alex Ripley, economic development officer. AgPrize 2020 participants are being asked to consider real-world challenges that exist for farmers today. \"While there is alot of cutting-edge technology in precision agriculture, genetics, fertilizers and other inputs, we feel there is room for innovation in the unsung small problems that still exist for small operators. These are the challenges that need another pair of eyes to find asolution,\" explains Ripley. \"A competition is afun approach to doing just that, while satisfying apressing need. Solving these problems will help small farm business owners in our region, and beyond, in avarietyofwayssuch as improving on-farm safety, reducing costs, and achieving environmental sustainability goals, among others.\" Each week a specific challenge, currently being experienced by alocal farmer in Huron County, will be illustrated in a short online video. Contestants have 12 weeks to come up with a viable solution that THIS is inexpensive, environmentally sound, and quickly and easily implemented. Winning entrants for each question will receive acash prize of $2,020, but the reward goes beyond that, says Ripley. \"A suite of expertise will be made available to helpwinners commercialize their projects. This includes legal and accounting advice as well as funding support totake products from prototype to something that can be adopted across the industry -locally, nationally and, potentially, globally.\" Thefirstfour challengequestion videos are already available online for review, with a submission deadline of July 6, 2020. One focuses on the issue STORY WAS CREATED BY CONTENT of widely used heat lamps that keep newborn lambs and piglets warm.Existingtechnology is energy inefficient and can pose a fire risk. It asks, \"Can you make a better heat lamp/heatsource -one that is safer, more efficient, and cost effective?\" Another looks at moving heavy farm equipment across different pointsalong a stream in an environmentally sound, safe, durable and inexpensive manner. The final two seek solutions to help a producer deliver vegetables to the marketplace, and to help afarmer explain and demonstratedairy herd welfare to customers. An additional question will be posted online every week, each with a 12-week deadline to submit. \"Upcoming challenges involve maple syrup production and online sales, to name justtwo. We will continue to add aquestion a week until we run out of challenges, or we run out of prize money,\" Ripleysays. Adds Ripley, \"Today, especially, we have to be thankful that our food supply and supply chains are working effectively as we move through this crisis. Unfortunately, many people have an outdated or narrow viewofCanadian agriculture. Thehope is thatwhen looking at the challenges we have posed, and getting to know our farmers, there are positive conversations about how food gets to our table and increased awareness of an industry that works very well in this country.\" As the number one sector in Huron County, agriculture is the economic engine of the region. \"Annually, there is more agricultural dollar value created here than in some entire provinces,\" says Ripley. \"Itdefines the contours of our county and its identity. But we are not only producers of cash crops such as pulses (legumes), grains and livestock that are consumed locally and shipped internationally. Wehave arobust agritourism sector that is defined by the farm to table movement and embraced by our local restaurants. We also have a cluster of 14 breweries HURON COUNTY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. and wineries that continues to grow because of our unique microclimate.\" Where careers are concerned, there is an emerging need for highly trained talent, says Ripley. \"Each year, about 100,000 jobs in Canadian agriculture go unfilled. As we move furtherinto this century, that will not slow down. While some are labour related, there will be an increasing need for engineers, data analysts, programmers and technicians of all kinds because agriculture is becoming increasingly more hi-tech. That is something for young people participating in AgPrize 2020 to consider for their future.\" Challenge questions, registration forms and additional information are available at huroncounty.ca/economic-development/agprize2020."}, {"title": "*Grieg Seafood ASA: Q1 2020 results -- Efficient production maintained, earnings impacted by biological challenges in Finnmark", "article": "7 May 2020 00:00 ET Press Release: Grieg Seafood ASA: Q1 2020 results -- Efficient production maintained, earnings impacted by biological challenges in Finnmark  (END) Dow Jones Newswires May 07, 2020 00:00 ET (04:00 GMT)"}, {"title": "BASF Canada donates over $64,000 to Food Banks Canada", "article": "(GlobeNewswire) - BASF will join COVID-19 hunger relief efforts with a $64,398.20 donation to Food Banks Canada.

This marked the most active first quarter in dollar terms on record in the Canadian market, final data released by Refinitiv show. The number of financings in Q1 2020 also rose 3 percent year over year. Early-stage companies accounted for 43 percent of all rounds, more than any prior annual share. Canadian investors reclaimed their top spot in the first quarter, contributing 68 percent of VC invested, up from 45 percent in all of 2019. REPORT SUMMARY Canada venture capital investment totals $1.6 Billion in Q1 Canadian venture capital continued its healthy pace following a record-setting 2019 with $1.6 billion invested across 134 rounds in the first quarter of 2020. This total was up 14% year-over-year, was the strongest first quarter ever recorded, and marked the sixth consecutive quarter with investment greater than $1 billion. Only two venture capital rounds surpassed the nine-figure mark through the end of March, down from the average set by the twelve such rounds completed throughout 2019. Topping the list for the quarter was the $270 million merger between non-destructive testing (NDT) companies Eddyfi and NDT Global, backed with equity provided by Novacap and Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec with additional debt financing from National Bank of Canada and Investissement Quebec. AI-applied traffic management business, Miovision, also raised $120 million in a round led by TELUS Ventures with support from McRock Ventures in order to accelerate growth and hire additional employees. Rounding out the top 3 for the quarter was the $99 million investment into Vancouver-based precision farming platform SemiosBio Technologies, led by the Boston-based Morningside Group. Companies based within Quebec saw $621 million invested across 45 deals, resulting in 7th place for dollar values and 5th place for volumes in the provincial & state rankings. Ontario followed closely behind in both with $599 million financed across 44 deals for dollar and volume rankings of 8th and 6th, respectively. Domestic funds invested $870 million in Canadian companies through the end of March, a 68% share of all disclosed dollars. This was up from the 45% share throughout the entirety of 2019 and higher than any annual share since 2012. Funds located within the United States supplied only 27% of the funding during the quarter, lower than any annual share since the 25% in 2008. A total of 6 Canadian VC funds recorded closes during the first quarter, raising a combined $398 million in commitments, a decrease of 75% compared to a year ago. Round13 Ventures led the way with $225 million in commitments across two funds in the quarter, $125 million going to its second flagship venture fund and $100 million for the first closing of a new growth equity fund. The largest closing during the quarter was $151 million of additional commitments for Georgian Partners Growth Fund V, bringing its total commitments to $1.1 billion. Canadian companies completed 8 VC-backed exits during the quarter worth $2.7 billion, a 33% decline in the number of exits but a 261% uptick in values when compared to the first quarter of 2019. The increase in values was largely thanks to the secondary purchase of Ontario-headquartered Kissner Milling Company by Stone Canyon Industries, a California-based industrial holdings company, with exits by Metalmark Capital Holdings and Silvertree Capital."}, {"title": "AJX AgJunction to release Q1 financial results May 13", "article": "AgJunction Inc (TSX:AJX) Shares Issued 117,072,573 Last Close 4/29/2020 $0.20 Wednesday April 29 2020 - News Release An anonymous director reports AGJUNCTION SETS FIRST QUARTER 2020 CONFERENCE CALL FOR WEDNESDAY, MAY 13, 2020, AT 11:00 A.M.

People involved in P.E.I.'s agriculture industry had a chance to learn about gene-editing for better foods and thermal imaging drones during last month's P.E.I. Soil and Crop Improvement Association Conference. Put on by the P.E.I. Soil and Crop Improvement Association, the annual event brings experts and Islanders together to hear about the latest research in their field. Ian Affleck was one of the visiting speakers. The vice-president of plant biotechnology at Crop Life Canada in Ottawa, he is originally from a potato farm in Bedeque and now works to regulate plant breeding technology and to build public trust. \"Gene-editing is a method that enables plant breeders to make precise changes to the plant's genetic material, which can improve their productivity and sustainability and often mirrors what happens in nature or through traditional breeding.\" Gene-editing holds a lot of promise for the agriculture industry, said Affleck to a crowd of more than 100 who attended a morning session. The gene-editing technology he works with is different from the previous techniques used to develop corn, soybean and canola crops grown now. Those early genetically-modified crops got a bad reputation, he said. But GMO foods aren't inherently unsafe. When the Hawaiian papaya crop was destroyed by ring spot virus in 1998, university researchers genetically engineered a new variety resistant to the disease. \"Eighty-five per cent of all papaya on the market today is GMO,\" said Affleck. \"It's rarely talked about because it isn't owned by a company. It's owned by a university and just given to the growers.\" There are numerous ethical, scientific and government groups at work to ensure Canada's food is safe, said Affleck. \"Helping the public engage in agriculture is really important. Especially on gene-editing, for this to come forward, the government, developers and farmers, we all have a role to play in public trust.\" Right now, there are no gene-edited foods on the shelves and only a few, tightly monitored crops in fields. Now is the time for government, developers and farmers to be talking about plant breeding technology and food safety, said Affleck. Government and developers need to talk to the public \"earlier and more often\", and farmers have to tell their stories about why they're trustworthy developers of food, said Affleck. \"And this is not just about gene-editing. This is right across the board. The public want to know what you're doing, and they want to trust you.\" Trust in the plant science is being built all the time.  When Affleck wanted to help farmers cut down on herbicide-resistant weeds, he went for the bottom line.  But talking money was the wrong approach. \"The number one thing that by far caught people's eye was the idea that you hand your land down to your children. If you don't protect the resistance aspect of it, you'll be handing down something that's broken,\" said Affleck. Precision agriculture is helping farmers protect the soil they hand down to their children as well. Special equipment helps farmers gather precise information and deliver specific treatments to their fields. Felix Weber was part of the trade show in Summerside to introduce the eBeeSQ agricultural drone to farmers. The sleek black drone flies over a field and takes special photographs showing a thermal image.  If the crop is hot, it's thirsty, said Weber. Seeing exactly where the crop needs help makes it easier for farmers to head straight to the problem area and see what's causing the issue. The drone's information will let farmers target irrigation, fertilizers and pest control to areas that need it most.  Being exact with the costly products means less expense and less run-off. Also, targeting just the areas in need means higher, more sustainable yields. Craig Gilbert's company, Cradle Ag Solutions, was demonstrating several innovations at the trade show, including the SmartFirmer. The high-tech, electronic wand attaches to corn planters. It reads the soil temperature, moisture and capacity for nutrient uptake in the seed furrow as the seeds are planted. It's all to help corn plants pop out of the soil at the same time. A difference of more than 36 hours in emergence makes a big difference in yields, said Gilbert. However, the goal isn't just to grow a lot of corn and harvest a big crop. A good yield might \"mine the soil\" and leave it depleted of essential nutrients and organic matter, said Weber. \"Yield monitoring doesn't tell me the potential. It tells me what I removed,\" said Weber.  Sustainable farming ideally increases the harvest as well as the potential for the next year, he said. Ian Affleck is fascinated with the science of farming. Growing up on his family's potato farm in Bedeque, P.E.I., he was keen to learn and apply his knowledge. \"The science aspect of farming always caught my eye,\" said the son of a seed farmer. \"I was always interested in the plant breeding.\" Affleck was one of the presenters at the P.E.I. Soil and Crop Improvement Association Conference in Summerside last month. \"I thought I was going to come home and farm. I thought I was going to get my bachelor's in plant breeding and I was going to come home and maybe we'd do some plant breeding of our own.\" But after getting his undergraduate degree at the Nova Scotia Agricultural College in Truro, now the Faculty of Agriculture at Dalhousie University, Affleck moved on to school in Ontario and fell into opportunity after opportunity in Ottawa. \"It's 50 square kilometres, surrounded by reality,\" said Affleck, quoting his first boss in the city.  \"So it's good to be back in reality discussing farming a little closer to where it happens.\"   Affleck, the vice-president of plant biotechnology at Crop Life Canada, spoke about his company's efforts to build trust in new gene-editing technology used today to develop new crops to help farmers and consumers."}, {"title": "RETRANSMISSION: Bee Vectoring Technologies Sees Strong Endorsement From Georgia Blueberry Growers After Exceptional Preliminary Results", "article": "Mississauga, Ontario and Sacramento, California--(Newsfile Corp. - April 21, 2020) - Bee Vectoring Technologies International Inc. (TSXV: BEE) (OTCQB: BEVVF) (CVE: BEE) (the \"Company\" or \"BVT\") today announced that, with Georgia's blueberry blooming period now complete, growers in the region using the Company's proprietary crop protection system have reported notably-high fruit set and low fruit drop, both typical early indicators of a successful, high-yield harvest. \"BVT continues to positively impact our blueberry operations. We had very high fruit set despite poor weather conditions at times. 2020 will definitely be the highest production year for us and we will continue to use BVT for years to come,\" said Winn Morgan, Co-founder of Major League Blueberries (MLB) and a leading blueberry expert. \"This was our first experience with the BVT system, and we are very pleased with what we saw,\" said John Bennett of Alma Sunbelt Blueberries, a leading Georgia blueberry grower who farms 355 acres of highbush and rabbiteye. \"We are encouraged with the results on our highbush farm and we are going to use the BVT system next year.\" \"We are hearing from growers like MLB and Alma Sunbelt that BVT's natural precision agriculture system is mitigating the long-standing issue of early fruit drop in highbush blueberries,\" said Ashish Malik, CEO of Bee Vectoring Technologies. \"More berries making it to maturity mean higher yields. Feedback from growers who used our system on a combined 750 acres this season has been extremely positive and clearly associated the high fruit set they have seen with use of the BVT system.\" In conventional commercial crops, growers traditionally control disease with chemical pesticide sprays. Now they are adding BVT's natural, 100% organic, precision agriculture system, which uses biological pesticide alternatives delivered directly to blueberry flowers by commercially grown bees. This is improving yields, protecting against disease and reducing the use of water and fossil fuels, all while using a fraction of the product required with traditional spray applications. \"The Georgia growers who piloted our system this season farm on a combined total of about 3,000 acres,\" said Mr. Malik. \"Most are first-time users, and based on this initial success, we anticipate they'll progressively add BVT across their entire operations over the next two to three seasons.\" Up next for BVT is the berry season in the Pacific Northwest. The Pacific Northwest and Southeastern regions of the US have a combined 60,000[(1)] acres of cultivated highbush blueberries, representing two-thirds of the 90,000[(2)] acre US market. With the blooming period in Georgia now complete, harvesting will occur through May and into June. Right now, the blooming period has just started in Oregon, and in Washington state it starts in early May. Yield reports will be compiled after harvesting closes for each region, as the growing season progresses geographically across the US. The Company also announced that it has issued an aggregate of 50,000 restricted share units of the Company (\"RSUs\") to two consultants of the Company under the Company's shareholder approved restricted share unit plan (the \"RSU Plan\") as an incentive for the consultants to drive the growth of the Company. The RSUs vest on the 30[th] day from grant and entitle the holder to acquire one common share (a \"Common Share\") of the Company underlying each such RSU by delivering a notice of acquisition to the Company in accordance with the RSU Plan. In accordance with the RSU Plan, the RSUs were priced at $0.445 based on theclosing price of the Common Shares on the TSX Venture Exchange on April 15, 2020.

Using artificial intelligence and advanced engineering, the company's original solution recreates optimal climatic conditions for market gardening in a fully controlled indoor ecosystem. This innovation paves the way for industrial and large-scale agriculture, while alleviating concerns related to climate, the agribusiness industry and the economy. Water, light, air, and temperature are controlled to take full advantage of agriculture while respecting the principles of biological control. Also known as precision farming, Ferme d'hiver's technology can be installed indoors to complement greenhouse and field farming operations. The building, with a height of up to 8 meters, allows for 3D production and higher crop density per square meter - up to 15 times that of a greenhouse, and 45 times that of field production. A winter strawberry, with a taste of summer The current premises, located in Brossard, on the south shore of Montreal, mostly consist of the research and development laboratory for the complete solution. Through partnerships with market gardeners, the company's 5-year objective is to replace 10% of fresh produce imports and strengthen winter agriculture in Quebec. \"We decided to test our technology on strawberries first because everyone loves Quebec strawberries in the summer. But the seasonality of these berries forces consumers to rely on imported strawberries that can never be as fresh as fruit grown locally. In addition, the use of pesticides and food transportation have a major impact not only on the quality, but also increases the ecological footprint,\" explains Yves Daoust, president and founder of Ferme d'hiver. \"We offer a complementary solution to market gardeners who can grow fresh produce during the off-season, at a price consumers can afford. Strawberry crops are one of the most complex to control.

Using artificial intelligence and advanced engineering, the company's original solution recreates optimal climatic conditions for market gardening in a fully controlled indoor ecosystem. This innovation paves the way for industrial and large-scale agriculture, while alleviating concerns related to climate, the agribusiness industry and the economy. Water, light, air, and temperature are controlled to take full advantage of agriculture while respecting the principles of biological control. Also known as precision farming, Ferme d'hiver's technology can be installed indoors to complement greenhouse and field farming operations. The building, with a height of up to 8 meters, allows for 3D production and higher crop density per square meter - up to 15 times that of a greenhouse, and 45 times that of field production. A winter strawberry, with a taste of summer The current premises, located in Brossard, on the south shore of Montreal, mostly consist of the research and development laboratory for the complete solution. Through partnerships with market gardeners, the company's 5-year objective is to replace 10% of fresh produce imports and strengthen winter agriculture in Quebec.   \"We decided to test our technology on strawberries first because everyone loves Quebec strawberries in the summer. But the seasonality of these berries forces consumers to rely on imported strawberries that can never be as fresh as fruit grown locally. In addition, the use of pesticides and food transportation have a major impact not only on the quality, but also increases the ecological footprint,\" explains Yves Daoust, president and founder of Ferme d'hiver. \"We offer a complementary solution to market gardeners who can grow fresh produce during the off-season, at a price consumers can afford. Strawberry crops are one of the most complex to control. With this first proof of concept, Ferme d'hiver has demonstrated its full potential, and allowed us to imagine the production of a multitude of other fruits and vegetables.\" Support from Investissement Quebec Ferme d'hiver has been counting on significant support from partners and investors, including the Investissement Quebec, the Quebec government's main economic development lever. \"The COVID-19 pandemic has made the citizens of Quebec realize that it is essential to increase our agricultural autonomy and, above all, to support our local producers.

The production is pesticide-free, limits emissions to the environment and is not affected by climatic conditions, which are increasingly unpredictable. Ultimately, the company's goal is to feed the needs of a growing population with fresh, 100% natural, locally produced food while preserving the health of the planet. Because everyone should have access to fresh, affordable and tasty fruits and vegetables year-round.

Moroccan growers are well versed in the use of bumblebees in these crops, so this market is a perfect fit for us.\" Morocco's climate gives the country a distinct agricultural advantage of being able to grow berries 10 months of the year. Strawberries are currently the main berry crop, with tremendous growth in blueberry and raspberry production, tripling over the past few years (5). Bee Vectoring demonstrations will commence in the summer season and will occur as the blooming period for tomatoes, strawberries, blueberries and raspberries occurs over the course of the calendar year. \"These large-scale demonstrations are the first stage in BVT's path to commercialization in Morocco and are the basis for major adoption of new on-farm technology,\" continued Mr. Malik. \"We chose Morocco to launch BVT's efforts in Africa because the country is a large, progressive and growing exporter to the vast European marketplace.\" The sustainable agriculture movement is gaining momentum worldwide, and sustainability is at the heart of Bee Vectoring's technology. The company's natural precision agriculture system replaces chemical pesticides and wasteful spray applications by delivering biological pesticide alternatives directly to crops using commercially grown bees. \"These demonstrations represent an opportunity for the Moroccan agricultural industry, and specifically growers, to see first-hand how well the BVT precision agriculture system works in controlling crop disease and improving yields in their local environment,\" stated Mr. Malik. \"They will help growers see how BVT's unique natural precision agriculture system is able to make their operations more productive, profitable and sustainable.\" (1) (2) Source: Mordor Intelligence, Morocco Fruits and Vegetables Industry: Growth, Trends and Forecast (2020 to 2025).

Fitch views Deere's liquidity as solid and the additional cash will increase the company's flexibility in an uncertain environment. Fitch expects Deere will reverse the increase in debt and leverage over time as economic conditions eventually stabilize. Fitch assumes the impact of COVID-19 will decline later in 2020 and that the most significant effects will dissipate by 2021. Demand disruption associated with COVID-19 is likely to pressure Deere's results in the near term. There is a significant degree of uncertainty, however, about the ultimate duration and severity of COVID-19, and a sustained worsening of the situation could prompt Fitch to reassess Deere's ratings or outlook. Fitch believes longer-term demand drivers remain intact including productivity offered by precision agriculture. New debt issuance combined with economic weakness will increase the company's leverage metrics which are at the high end of mid-cycle levels incorporated in the ratings. At Feb. 2, 2020, FFO-adjusted leverage was 1.8x and total adjusted debt/EBITDAR was 2.2x. The ratings for Deere's equipment operations consider the company's strong positions in global agricultural equipment markets, capabilities around precision agriculture, revenue diversification provided by its construction and forestry equipment businesses, a strong dealer network and solid FCF. Normal cyclicality in Deere's markets, aside from COVID-19, is a concern but the company's operating flexibility and ability to adjust discretionary spending for acquisitions and share repurchases enables it to adjust to changes in market demand. Other rating concerns include low crop prices, a highly competitive environment, and rapidly evolving technology although Deere is well-positioned to strengthen its capabilities in precision agriculture. In addition, economic challenges are contributing to weak sentiment among farmers that can affect equipment purchases. Potential support required from Deere Equipment for John Deere Financial (JDF) represents a risk but is viewed by Fitch as unlikely. Deere's margins are lower than levels during periods of strong demand and the company targets higher margins over the long term. The EBITDA margin as calculated by Fitch was 10.2% as of Feb. 2, 2020 on an LTM basis. Margins should benefit from a continued shift toward precision ag equipment and technology as well as higher-margin aftermarket parts and service. Some of the impact of COVID-19 could be offset by the company's ongoing actions to improve its cost structure. Deere is investing in new technology around precision agriculture, including previous acquisitions, which Fitch expects will further boost the company's competitive position related to connectivity and farm productivity. Deere has expanded its capabilities around machine learning as well as automation and predictive maintenance. Digital technology supports revenue growth and margins and helps differentiate Deere's product line, although other participants in agricultural markets are also developing digital capabilities and could challenge Deere's position. Fitch's ratings and financial measures for Deere's equipment business consider the finance business on an equity basis. Under Fitch's criteria for rating non-financial corporates, Fitch calculates an appropriate debt/equity ratio of 5x at JDF based on solid asset quality, sufficient liquidity and strong funding profile. Actual debt/equity as measured by Fitch, including intangible assets, was 7.8x as of Feb. 2, 2020. As a result, an equity injection of $971 million would be needed to reduce JDF's leverage to 5x. This considers Fitch's reclassification of payables due from JDF as equity. These payables totaled approximately $1.4 billion as of Feb. 2, 2020. JDCC JDCC's long- and short-term ratings are equalized with Deere's ratings, reflecting Fitch's view that JDCC is a core subsidiary of Deere based on the 100% ownership, shared brand name, importance of JDCC to help Deere achieve its strategic objectives and the Support Agreement between the two entities. The Support Agreement requires Deere to maintain 51% ownership of JDCC, maintain JDCC's net worth at not less than $50 million, and maintain JDCC's fixed-charge coverage at not less than 1.05x on a quarterly basis. Beyond these support-driven considerations, Fitch also believes JDCC's consistent operating performance, solid asset quality through cycles, sufficient liquidity, and strong funding profile support the credit rating. These factors are counterbalanced by JDCC's elevated leverage relative to stand-alone finance companies, although its leverage is consistent with that of other captive finance peer averages. Asset quality metrics have been solid at JDCC. Delinquencies greater than 30 days past due as a percentage of total receivables dropped to 1.3% at the end of 1Q20 (Feb 2, 2020) from 1.5% at 1Q19 while non-performing loans remained flat over the same period. Annualized write-offs, net of recoveries were 0.2% of average finance receivables in 1Q20; in line with the four-year average of 0.2% (2016-2019). JDCC's loss reserves amounted to 0.3% of net receivables at 1Q20, lower than 0.8% experienced during the height of financial crisis in 2008. Fitch expects some level of deterioration in credit metrics as a result of the global spread of the coronavirus and the interruption to global economic activities. Operating performance at JDCC has weakened in recent years mainly due to unfavorable financing spreads, partially offset by growth in the loan and lease portfolio. JDCC's annualized pretax return on average assets declined to 1.3% in 1Q20 from 1.6% in the same period last year. Fitch expects operating metrics to weaken in the near term given slower loan and lease growth and a likely increase in provision expense caused by the economic downturn. JDCC's debt-to-tangible equity ratio rose to 8.2x at the end of 1Q20, from 8.1x a year ago, as incremental borrowings were used to finance portfolio growth. Fitch notes that leverage remains consistent with other captive finance peers but higher than many stand-alone finance companies. Fitch does not anticipate any significant changes in JDCC's overall capital structure, but believes Deere would inject additional capital into the finance arm, as necessary, to manage JDCC's overall leverage profile. Fitch believes JDCC's comprehensive funding platform, in combination with the financial strength of its parent, is consistent with other captive finance companies. About 87% of JDCC's debt was unsecured, as of 1Q20; consistent with the prior year. The unsecured funding profile is viewed favorably by Fitch, as unencumbered assets provide balance sheet flexibility in times of market stress. Total short-term indebtedness at Feb. 2, 2020 amounted to $12.6 billion. Should access to the unsecured debt markets become uneconomical, Fitch believes these maturities could be repaid and/or refinanced with cash on hand, available borrowing capacity on credit facilities, operating cash flow, and the ability to pledge meaningful unencumbered assets to secured funding facilities. John Deere Bank S.A. Luxembourg and John Deere Financial Ltd. Australia are wholly owned subsidiaries of JDCC. In addition of guarantying the debt obligations of its wholly owned subsidiaries for full repayment, JDCC also guarantees the debt obligations of John Deere Financial Inc. Canada and John Deere Canada Funding Inc. The guarantee is viewed as the strongest form of parental support, which Fitch believes enhances the rating linkages between JDCC and its subsidiaries. As a result, the IDRs and issue ratings of the above mentioned entities are equalized with those of JDCC. The unsecured debt rating is equalized with the Long-Term IDR, reflecting the firm's largely unsecured funding profile and average recovery prospects for unsecured creditors under a stressed scenario. However, a material increase in the usage of secured debt could result in the unsecured debt rating being notched down from the IDR. Derivation Summary Deere is the largest provider of agricultural equipment in the U.S., particularly in the large equipment market, where it competes with CNH Industrial (CNHI; BBB-/Positive) and AGCO (NR) and has a significant presence in international markets. Deere is geographically diversified and gains additional diversification from its construction equipment business and from the forestry equipment business in North America where it has a leading share. Deere's profile as a capital goods producer is similar to other manufacturers in the agricultural, construction and heavy duty truck markets, all of which are subject to demand cycles. Deere's market positions in turf and construction equipment are competitive albeit smaller than some global competitors such as Caterpillar (CAT; A/Stable) and Komatsu (NR). Deere's EBITDA margins of 8%-14% through the cycle have been somewhat lower than CAT's margins of 9%-18% but are closer to other agricultural equipment producers such as CNHI, which had an EBITDA margin of 10% in 2018. Deere's significant captive finance business and large dealer network support its competitive position, similar to other large global capital equipment producers. Key Assumptions Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for Deere's equipment operations include: --Demand declines in the near term due to difficult global economic conditions; --EBITDA margins are pressured in the near term. Margins could increase over the long term if Deere controls costs effectively and Deere's precision ag strategy continues to be effective; --The company experiences modest operational disruption in the near term as a result of COVID-19 but returns to pre-disruption levels during 2021; --Fitch expects FCF could decline in 2020 but will be near 4% of sales or higher over the long term; --Financial Services continues to perform well, supporting dividends to Deere, although credit quality could see some deterioration when end markets are weak; --Deere maintains a disciplined cash deployment policy and a strong balance sheet, including flexibility around discretionary share repurchases. Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for JDCC include: --JDCC will remain a core subsidiary of Deere based on the 100% ownership, shared brand name, importance of JDCC to help Deere achieve its strategic objectives and the Support Agreement between the two entities; --JDCC's asset quality metrics may deteriorate in the short term, but will remain relatively stable over time; --JDCC will sustain leverage of within the range of 8.0x-9.0x. RATING SENSITIVITIES Equipment Operations Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action --Loss of significant market share in the company's agricultural, construction and forestry equipment markets; --Leverage is above mid-cycle levels expected by Fitch including FFO adjusted leverage below 2.0x and adjusted debt to EBITDAR below 2.0x; --Deere's precision agriculture and other digital strategies become uncompetitive; --Cash deployment for share repurchases or acquisitions leads to materially higher leverage; --Financial Services requires significant support that reduces Deere's liquidity and financial flexibility. Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action --Fitch views a positive rating action as unlikely over the rating horizon due to cyclicality in Deere's agricultural and construction markets and to funding and credit risks at Financial Services. JDCC JDCC's Long-Term and Short-Term IDRs are equalized with those of Deere and would be expected to move in tandem. However, negative rating action could be driven by the following: --A change in the perceived relationship between Deere and JDCC, for example, if Fitch believed that JDCC was no longer core to Deere's strategic operations and/or adequate financial support was not provided to the captive finance company in a time of need; --Significant asset quality deterioration; --Consistent operating losses; --A material change in balance sheet leverage; --Deterioration in JDCC's funding or liquidity profile. Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to a Positive Rating Action Positive rating momentum for JDCC and its subsidiaries would be limited by Fitch's view of Deere's credit profile, as JDCC's ratings and Outlook are linked to that of its parent. Fitch cannot envision a scenario where the captive would be rated higher than its parent. The unsecured debt rating is equalized with the long-term IDR and would be expected to move in tandem. Liquidity and Debt Structure Liquidity at Deere's equipment operations as of Feb. 2, 2020 included cash of $2.7 billion and availability under two $2.5 billion revolvers shared with JDCC that mature in 2023 and 2024. Deere also has a $2.8 billion 364-day facility that is shared with JDCC. The credit agreements require JDCC to maintain minimum fixed charge coverage and maximum debt-to-capital ratios, and Deere Equipment to maintain a maximum debt-to-capital ratio, all of which were in compliance as of Feb. 2, 2020. Liquidity at the equipment business was offset by $989 million of debt due within one year. Debt at the equipment operations of $7.5 billion includes Fitch's $971 million estimate of a hypothetical equity injection to the finance business. Long-term debt is scheduled to mature between 2020 and 2049. Deere's pension plans were 98% funded at the end of fiscal 2019, which provides additional financial flexibility. The company's pension plan was 98% funded at the end of fiscal 2019 but Deere has a relatively large net other post-employment benefit (OPEB) obligation that totaled $4.7 billion. JDCC Fitch believes JDCC's liquidity is sufficient given consistent operating cash flow generation, available cash on hand ($0.6 billion at 1Q20) and undrawn capacity under its credit facilities. JDCC relies on the global debt capital markets, various bank funding programs as well as periodic ordinary support from Deere to provide liquidity for its operations. CP outstanding amounted to $1.2 billion at 1Q20, which is backstopped by a $7.9 billion lines of credit with various banks. JDCC paid $125 million of dividends to its parent in the first three months of 2020, $330 million of dividends in 2019, $375 million in 2018 and $285 million in 2017. The company employs a flexible dividend policy with its parent, in order to manage leverage at the captive. Deere had approximately $45 billion of consolidated debt at Feb. 2, 2020.

Brett McMickell reports AGJUNCTION REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2019 EARNINGS RESULTS AgJunction Inc. has released financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended Dec. 31, 2019. All currency amounts are expressed in U.S. dollars. Fourth quarter 2019 financial summary versus fourth quarter 2018: - Revenue was $3.3-million versus $17.1-million. The fourth quarter of 2018 included revenue of $14.3-million related to the bulk purchase order (BPO). - Gross margin increased significantly to 45.9 per cent compared with 30.9 per cent reflected the company's more normalized margin expectation as the company's mix did not include the lower-margin bulk order referenced herein. - Operating expenses were $4.7-million compared with $4.4-million, reflecting one-time restructuring costs. - Net loss was $3.1-million or (three cents) per share, versus net income of $3.1-million or three cents per share. - EBITDA (net income before interest, income tax, depreciation and amortization) was ($2.3-million) versus $3.7-million. Full-year 2019 financial summary versus full-year 2018: - Revenue was $39.2-million versus $64.5-million. This decline in revenue is driven by the sale of businesses in 2018 and the completion of shipments made under the BPO. - Gross margin increased 50 basis points to 37.4 per cent compared with 36.9 per cent. - Operating expenses decreased to $21.1-million from $25.7-million, reflecting an annual benefit of the sales of businesses. - Net loss was $6.2-million or five cents per share, versus net income of $1.5-million or one cent per share. - EBITDA was ($3.6-million) versus $3.4-million. Management commentary \"Our financial results, particularly the decline in revenue and the increase in margins, reflect the sale of businesses in 2018 and the completion of shipments under the BPO,\" said Dr. M. Brett McMickell, president and chief executive officer of AgJunction. \"During the year, AgJunction continued to make strides in developing innovative automation technology that provides significant benefits to farmers, despite 2019 being a difficult year for the agriculture market as a whole. We completed several important initiatives over the course of the year that we anticipate will set us up for success going forward, including rightsizing our organization and consolidating all facilities to our corporate headquarters in Scottsdale, Ariz. \"As previously announced after an extensive evaluation of the business over the past several months, our new team has implemented a refined strategy that we believe best suits the evolving needs of manufacturers and suppliers within our industry. With a robust intellectual property portfolio already in place, we are going to focus on further developing our products to support customer flexibility by delivering modular components of our software and hardware that can integrate seamlessly into our customers' systems. We are also going to be extending our unique technology beyond auto-steering into more areas of automation where we have strong IP, including obstacle detection, implement steering, task control and many others. \"As we move forward, we expect to grow sales in each of our existing geographical regions through offering adaptable components to current partners, along with new manufacturers and suppliers that are looking for flexible modules rather than a full steering solution. We also remain committed to investing in research and development to continue growing our industry-leading IP portfolio and offering the most innovative components in the industry. Over all, we believe we are well positioned to execute on these initiatives with a reinvigorated team ready to deploy our unique technology and capabilities to an evolving market. \"There is significant uncertainty as to the likely effects of COVID-19, which may, among other things, impact our supply chain and may negatively impact the global agriculture market. While we have not experienced any delays in production at the current time, we are unable to quantify the potential impact this pandemic may have on our future financial statements.\" Fourth quarter 2019 financial results Total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2019 was $3.3-million compared with $17.1-million in the fourth quarter of 2018. The decline was primarily driven by the prior-year period, including revenue generated from the bulk purchase order (BPO). The company completed the final shipments of the BPO in the third quarter of 2019. Gross profit in the fourth quarter of 2019 was $1.5-million compared with $5.3-million in the fourth quarter of 2018. Gross margin increased significantly to 45.9 per cent compared with 30.9 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2018. The lower margins in fourth quarter 2018 were a direct result of the BPO while fourth quarter 2019 higher margins were driven by sales to the existing original equipment manufacturers and value-added reseller customers. Total operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2019 were $4.7-million compared with $4.4-million in the fourth quarter of 2018. The increase was primarily driven by site closure costs, partially offset by lower compensation, consultant and recruitment costs. Net loss in the fourth quarter of 2019 was $3.1-million or three cents per share, compared with net income of $3.1-million or three cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2018. The decline was primarily driven by the aforementioned decrease in revenue related to the BPO. EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2019 was ($2.3-million) compared with $3.7-million in the fourth quarter of 2018. Full-year 2019 financial results Total revenue in 2019 was $39.2-million compared with $64.5-million in 2018. The revenue decline was primarily due to the completion of the BPO. Gross profit in 2019 was $14.7-million compared with $23.8-million in 2018. Gross margin increased 50 basis points to 37.4 per cent compared with 36.9 per cent in 2018. Total operating expenses in 2019 declined to $21.1-million compared with $25.7-million in 2018, primarily driven by a reduction in research and development and sales and marketing costs. Net loss in 2019 was $6.2-million or five cents per share, compared with net income of $1.5-million or one cent per share in 2018. The decline was primarily driven by the aforementioned decrease in revenue related to the BPO. EBITDA in 2019 was ($3.6-million) compared with $3.4-million in 2018. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2019 totalled $17.2-million compared with $21.4-million at the end of 2018. Working capital was $19.2-million compared with $26.7-million at the end of 2018. The company continues to operate debt-free and has access to an unutilized $3.0-million line of credit.

In a report issued on World Water Day, U.N. agencies said global warming would \"affect the availability, quality and quantity of water for basic human needs,\" threatening the right to water and sanitation for \"potentially billions of people.\" But as well as using limited supplies more wisely and fairly, policymakers and businesses should also seek to manage water resources better to economize on the electricity and fuel needed to pump, clean and deliver water, the report said. \"If you save water, you're saving energy and reducing the greenhouse gases to produce that energy to bring the water,\" said Richard Connor, the report's editor. Using less energy cuts down further on the water needed to produce electricity, creating a virtuous circle, he said. Even more water can be saved by switching to less-thirsty clean power sources like wind instead of fossil fuels, he added. Water use has increased six-fold over the past century and is rising by about 1% a year, said the United Nations World Water Development Report 2020. It outlined ways water could be used and recycled more effectively to limit emissions, alongside looking after nature. Restoring and protecting wetlands, for example, is of \"critical importance\" because they store twice as much carbon as forests, while also preventing floods, purifying water and providing a habitat for animals and birds, the report said. Conservation agriculture - a green farming approach that causes minimal disturbance to the soil - also helps reduce carbon emissions and the huge amounts of water needed for crop irrigation in intensive farming systems. Treating more wastewater would also make a big difference, said the report, noting 80%-90% of wastewater is discharged to the environment without any form of treatment. Untreated wastewater is a major source of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, while wastewater treatment accounts for an estimated 3%-7% of all emissions, due to the energy and biochemicals required for the process. The best solution, the report said, is to invest in modern techniques that extract methane from organic matter in wastewater and use this biogas to generate the energy needed to treat the water - a method already used in some water-scarce countries like Jordan, Mexico, Peru and Thailand. As a result, public utilities there have reduced carbon emissions by thousands of tonnes, while making financial savings and providing a higher-quality service, it added. POLICY 'DISCONNECT' One of the main barriers to these types of approaches is a lack of cooperation between government officials working on climate change and those tasked with managing water. \"The disconnect remains abundantly clear at the policy level,\" said Connor. For example, the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change does not mention water, the U.N. report noted. The national climate action plans submitted by countries under that pact generally acknowledge the importance of water, but few have so far presented and costed specific projects, it added. \"When it comes time to move from talk to action - be it finance or otherwise - the talk falls on deaf ears and water gets put aside and ... left behind,\" said Connor. More concrete efforts to adapt to rising water stress and cut emissions from water use will require joint planning between climate change and water specialists, as well as greater investment to put them into practice, the report said. Water management, water supply and sanitation services are under-funded, it added - but by tackling global warming as well as water challenges, projects could aim to capture a larger share of climate finance. In 2016, only 2.6% of $455 billion invested in climate change measures was allocated to water management, it noted. That may be starting to change. In the past four years, the Green Climate Fund, for example, has approved two projects in Sri Lanka to upgrade village irrigation systems, protect water catchments, and promote climate-smart farming practices. \"Water does not need to be a problem - it can be part of the solution,\" said Audrey Azoulay, director-general of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.

According to news originating from Guelph, Canada, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Soil organic matter (SOM) is considered as the backbone of soil health and soil quality. Thus, its' estimation is critical to support the development of management decision including precision agriculture.\" Funders for this research include Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada, Quebec Fund for Research on Nature and Technology. Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the University of Guelph, \"To overcome challenges of laborious, rather expensive and time-consuming laboratory measurements, recent advances in image acquisition systems provided a new dimension of image-based SOM prediction. However, challenges remain in using soil images taken directly in the field due to variable soil surface conditions including vegetation cover, illumination, and soil moisture. Soil moisture can significantly influence soil color and thus confounds the relationship between SOM and soil color. This study quantifies the effects of soil moisture on the relationship between SOM and color parameters derived from cell phone images and establishes suitable SOM prediction models under varying conditions of soil moisture contents (SMCs). To simulate the continuous variation of soil moisture in the field, air-dried ground soil samples were saturated and allowed to dry naturally. Images were captured with a cellular phone over time representing various SMCs (set of images). Final set of images were captured on oven-dried samples. Images were preprocessed using illumination normalization to avoid illumination inconsistencies and segmentation technique to remove non-soil parts of the images including black cracks, leaf residues and specular reflection before modelling. Five color space models including RGB, HIS, CIELa*b*, CIELc*h* and CIELu*v* were used to quantify soil color parameters. Univariate linear regression models were developed between SOM and color parameters and an optimal set of color parameters that are capable of resisting variation in SMC was determined. It was observed that SMC exerted a considerable influence on SOM prediction accuracy when its value reached > 10%. The threshold of 10% SMC was considered as the critical SMC. Consequently, stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR) models were developed for soil samples with SMC below and above the critical SMC. For the soil samples at below the critical SMC, the color parameter R based model produced satisfactory prediction accuracy for SOM with R-cv(2), RMSEcv, and RPDcv values of 0.936, 4.44% and 3.926, respectively. For the soil samples at above the critical SMC, the SOM predictive model including SMC as a predictor variable showed better accuracy (R-cv(2) = 0.819, RMSEcv = 7.747%, RPDcv = 2.328) than that without including SMC (R-cv(2) = 0.741, RMSEcv = 9.382%, RPDcv = 1.922).\" According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"This study showed potential of cellular phone to be used as a proximal soil sensor fast, accurate and non-destructive estimation of SOM both in the laboratory and field conditions.\" The news correspondents report that additional information may be obtained from A.

These new customers will use Bee Vectoring's proprietary bee delivery system, Vectorite with CR-7, on portions of their blueberry and raspberry crops in the coming growing season. The landmark deals extend the company's commercial reach into the U.S. west coast, building on the strong momentum it has seen with southeast-based growers. \"We are excited to be expanding into this new region,\" said Ashish Malik, chief executive officer of Bee Vectoring Technologies. \"These initial grower commitments align with our growth strategy, starting with initial market penetration, moving to customer retention and expansion. We've now successfully penetrated the U.S. southeast blueberry market, the Pacific Northwest blueberry and raspberry markets, and the Florida strawberry market, and anticipate this strong commercial momentum continuing in coming seasons.\" The new deals also mark another important breakthrough: the first commercial use of Bee Vectoring's recently announced patent-pending computer-controlled honeybee hive dispenser system. In the western United States, only honeybees are currently used for commercial pollination since bumblebees are currently not allowed in western United States and Canada. The honeybee hive dispenser thus matches specific market demands and allows Bee Vectoring to address 100 per cent of the U.S. market. The newly contracted growers produce blueberries, raspberries and blackberries across the western U.S. region. The company's system is in the market at the right time. There is a significant need for alternative plant protection products for berry crops as there is increasing evidence that the efficacy of traditional fungicides is declining. Data presented at the 2019 Washington Blueberry Show from Washington State University documented resistance even with newer classes of fungicide chemistry throughout the production areas tested (1). Similar data were presented by Michigan State University. Bee Vectoring's natural precision agriculture system uses commercially reared bees to carry its organic and natural plant protection product, Vectorite with CR-7, directly to blooms throughout the day and continuously for the full bloom period. Traditional spraying is done periodically, and disease pressure can build in between spraying applications. CR-7 provides a new class of all-natural fungicide as an additional tool to be applied throughout the bloom period to enhance disease management and enhance high-yield production. Bee Vectoring's CR-7 also has Organic Materials Review Institute (OMRI) approval for organic production and is exempt from residue tolerance testing, making it an ideal tool for both conventional and organic berry growers. The Pacific Northwest growers are first-time users of the Bee Vectoring system and will pilot Bee Vectoring on a percentage (60 to 80 acres out of a combined 1,800 acres) of their conventional and organic crops. Based on common practice, there is an expectation that they will add Bee Vectoring across their entire operations in the coming two to three seasons based on positive results. The next blueberry season in Oregon and Washington starts with the blooming period in April, 2020, when the Bee Vectoring system is used, continuing until spring/summer harvest. Bee Vectoring is actively pursuing further grower contracts in the lead-up to this season commencing. \"Historically, growers start by using BVT on 10 to 20 per cent of their acreage, and gradually progress to 100 per cent,\" said Mr. Malik. \"Our strategy is to choose influential growers, because their pilot seasons are highly visible to other producers. So, in addition to the initial 60 to 80 acres that can expand to 1,800 acres in future seasons, other growers will take notice and adopt the BVT system in the future, which will increase our market share through new customer acquisition, as well as boosting BVT's share of wallet with its initial growers.\" \"The blueberry market in the U.S. is significant, representing about one-third of global production at 270,000 (2) acres. The Pacific Northwest and southeastern regions together have a combined 60,000 (3) acres of cultivated highbush blueberries, representing two-thirds of the 90,000-acre (4) U.S. market,\" said Mr. Malik. \"For BVT, this represents a major new market for the upcoming growing season and a large growth opportunity in future growing seasons. There is high market demand for Pacific Northwest berries domestically and overseas, with a large export market to Asia in both fresh pack and frozen berries.\" Many West Coast blueberry growers have also expanded into raspberries and blackberries, and there is the potential for them to use Bee Vectoring's system on those crops as well. Within the U.S., Oregon is the biggest producer of blackberries with 6,500 (5) acres, and Washington is the biggest producer of raspberries with 9,500 (6) acres. The company also announces that it intends to seek TSX Venture Exchange approval to extend the expiry date of an aggregate of 12 million warrants previously issued on March 28, 2018, and exercisable at 35 cents per share by one year. The particulars of the proposed extension to the terms of the warrants are as follows: - Twelve million warrants issued on March 28, 2018, with an exercise price of 35 cents per share, which are due to expire on March 28, 2020, will be extended to March 28, 2021. The warrant term expiry date extension is subject to exchange approval. (1) Source: APS Publications. (2) Source: FAO, United Nations, 2017 statistics.

Australia has invested heavily in blockchain for its beef exports. And Israel continues to spend heavily on ag-tech research. The United States - our biggest competitor and ally in the coming agriculture revolution - may also be the most advanced in its use of data.

Ngwenya's farm -in Ntabazinduna, 40 kilometers (24 miles) north of Bulawayo -is so remote that he can go a year or more without seeing the agriculture extension officers who are sent by local charities to assist small-scale farmers like him. \"It has always been difficult to get expert advice. There are no proper access roads here and you drive this far at your car's peril,\" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation as he readied his fields for a crop of maize, tomatoes and cabbages. Then, last year, two extension officers from the consortium Turning Matabeleland Green (TMG) managed to make their way to Ngwenya's farm to show him their solution: climate and crop information collected by satellite and sent to farmers' phones. Zimbabwe has been slow to embrace satellite-based systems for its agricultural sector, but now the country is seeing the benefits of using the technology to help farmers adapt to the impact of climate change, agricultural experts say. More than 7 million people work as communal or smallscale farmers, according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Many still rely on traditional weather-predicting systems and occasional visits by onthe-ground extension officers to get crucial information and advice. But using satellite data, groups like TMG can access weather information that is more accurate than the general forecasts supplied by the meteorological department, said Lwazi Mlilo, an agronomist working with TMG. And with mobile phone technology, they can get that information to farmers faster than they would by sending people out to hard-to-reach farms, he added. Mlilo showed Ngwenya how extension officers can look at the farmer's 27-hectare (67-acre) holding on Google Maps and combine that with satellite data available online to track everything from weather patterns to the health of crops. \"I can monitor the activity on your farm from my office. We do not need to come here to check the progress of your crops,\" he explained to the visibly awed farmer. Experts might then advise farmers in the low-rainfall Matabeleland region on what seeds to plant and which techniques to use to keep their crops thriving, Mlilo said. Because most rural farmers in Zimbabwe have no internet connection -many have no electricity at all -TMG communicates with them via SMS, he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. The organization can quickly tell farmers if a plot in their area has suffered a pest invasion or send out warnings about sudden changes in climate conditions to all the farmers in a particular area at once, he explained. \"Farming is not as tough as some imagine -as long as one has access to relevant, up-todate knowledge, especially now with new technologies,\" Mlilo said. He said about 2,000 small-scale farmers have joined the project since it launched last year. Approximately 80 per cent of Zimbabwe's rural people depend on rainfed agriculture for a living, making them highly vulnerable to more extreme weather associated with climate change, agricultural experts say. Last year, the FAO said satellite data had the potential to help Africa's farmers \"be better prepared for drought and increase agricultural production with less water use.\" Much of the satellite-based information that TMG uses to craft advice it sends to smallscale farmers comes from a new database launched in Zimbabwe last September. It was built as a collaboration between the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the University of Zimbabwe, with information collected by high-resolution satellites. It provides highly detailed information that enables experts to follow the effects of climate change across the country, backers said. A year earlier, the government launched the Zimbabwe National Geospatial and Space Agency (ZINGSA), made up of five departments focused on encouraging the country's economic and social development. Both projects use satellite technology for crop surveil-lance, drought monitoring, tracking soil conditions and documenting the most effective use of water, among other things. All of that information can be relayed to farmers to help them use their resources most efficiently and safeguard their crops against drought, said Elisha Moyo, principal climate researcher at Zimbabwe's agriculture and climate ministry. \"The use of satellite technology is encouraged as an early warning strategy,\" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. The goal is to improve farming yields and shore up food security in a country where, during times of peak production, up to 80% of staple maize is grown by small-scale farmers, according to government figures. Vangelis Haritatos, the Lands, Agriculture, Water, Climate and Rural Resettlement deputy minister, said he is confident satellite technology will help farmers adapt to the country's shifting climate. \"I definitely believe technological interventions will have a great impact on food production and food security as a whole for our nation,\" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. As droughts grow longer and harsher in southern Africa, Zimbabwe is looking for ways to support its embattled farmers. In the latest budget presented in November, the government announced it was setting aside 340 million Zimbabwe dollars ($900,000) towards agricultural extension and advisory services, a significant hike from the previous budget. At the time, finance minister Mthuli Ncube said the funding would go toward spreading the use of new technologies -including precision-farming tools such as satellite and GPS -to track land use and water availability. For many of Zimbabwe's long-struggling farmers, the move to satellite data and other modern technology offers hope that they might break the cycle of poor harvests. Ngwenya, the farmer in Ntabazinduna, said he is willing to try anything that might help. \"What we really need is rain,\" he said. \"But we will certainly appreciate anything that will bring us relief.\""}, {"title": "BEE Bee Vectoring accelerates expiry of 1.25 M warrants", "article": "Bee Vectoring Technologies International Inc (TSX-V:BEE) Shares Issued 79,292,329 Last Close 2/24/2020 $0.55 Monday February 24 2020 - News Release Mr. Ashish Malik reports BEE VECTORING TECHNOLOGIES ANNOUNCES ACCELERATION OF WARRANT EXPIRY DATE Market conditions have triggered the acceleration of the expiry of the following common share purchase warrants of Bee Vectoring Technologies International Inc.: - 1,251,000 unexercised warrants issued on Sept. 19, 2017, that were subsequently extended on Aug. 14, 2019, to expire on Sept. 19, 2020, with an exercise price of 35 cents per common share.

Innovation Center, where the company joins other innovative organizations in the country's flourishing ag-tech community. The move is part of Bee Vectoring's award in the Agri & Co. challenge. \"We are honoured to have been awarded this space as part of the Agri & Co. challenge, and we would like to thank them for their support. The award recognizes BVT as a sustainable alternative to chemical pesticides, something that the European market is eager to adopt,\" said Ashish Malik, chief executive officer of Bee Vectoring Technologies. \"The new office and the accompanying expert resources will help BVT expand into the European market.\" The new location is designed to help Bee Vectoring continue its innovation in biological crop protection delivery systems. It includes a fully equipped laboratory, growth chambers, greenhouse space for trialling (starting in spring 2020) and 95 hectares of land leased to a local grower who will host trials in his fields, as well as office space. In addition, Bee Vectoring will receive the full support of Agri & Co. staff and the Swiss canton of Fribourg's state government, and access to experts in various fields, as well as facilitated research and development collaborations with other ag-tech innovators. \"This is now our regional base for piloting and commercializing our natural precision agriculture technology in Europe. The goal of the BVT Europe office is to co-ordinate registration efforts across Europe, Africa and the Middle East (EAME), enable partnership conversations, and develop our go-to-market strategy with our North American head office,\" said Christoph Lehnen, Bee Vectoring's business manager for EAME. \"As soon as we have Swiss regulatory approval, which we anticipate this year, we will start establishing commercial deals with Swiss growers and gain valuable experience for an eventual launch across Europe.\" Strategically, it is beneficial for Bee Vectoring to have a presence in the Agri & Co. Innovation Center. The vision for the centre is to become the Swiss -- and potentially even a European -- hub for the agri, food and nutrition industry, with a number of start-ups already in place and more companies in talks to occupy a portion of the newly refurbished space. \"Consumer pressure against pesticides is significant in the European market,\" continued Mr. Lehnen. \"The European Union (EU) and Switzerland recently banned chlorothalonil (1), one of the world's most common pesticides, which means another one of very few available contact fungicides is off the market. Growers have access to fewer and fewer tools to manage their crops, while resistance to fungicides is increasing. It's a perfect entry point for crop protection alternatives, like BVT, that are effective and meet strict environmental requirements.\" Switzerland, like the rest of Europe, has targeted to reduce the risks of pesticide use by 50 per cent (2). In the Swiss action plan on pesticides, this involves less pesticide applications, more training and education, the substitution of pesticides posing particular risks, and other target actions. At the same time, new pests (for example, drosophila suzukii) and diseases (for example marssonina coronata) have established a foothold in Europe and, in many cases, cannot be managed with chemical pesticides. Alternatives are needed, and this presents the market opportunity for Bee Vectoring. Today, growers in Switzerland and broader within the EU are increasingly seeking non-chemical alternatives. The overall EU pesticides market is worth approximately $13-billion (U.S.) (3). Bee Vectoring is targeting $1-billion of that for its bee delivery system, a huge opportunity that opens up a new market, helps maintain yields and offers Europe a healthier, less chemically dependent future.

The decider. These entrepreneurs operate all sizes of business and are the backbone of the agriculture sector. As operations become larger and more complex, they will need a combination of leadership and digital expertise to succeed in the transition. The enabler. These are the skilled technicians who supply, service and program the machinery and equipment that enable farms to function. The growing shift to automation is generating a demand for enablers with a combination of skills in software, critical thinking and people management. The specialist. Specialists range from plant scientists and livestock managers to regulatory experts. Technical know-how will be critical in keeping pace with change and a global demand for clean, sustainably produced food - from data analytics and precision agriculture, to blockchain and artificial intelligence. The doer. Many of the farm labourers who can do the \"heavy lifting\" are projected to be replaced by automation over the longer time. However, there will continue to be a demand for jobs that require judgment, fine dexterity and digital skills, which will create opportunities for retraining. The advisor. As markets expand and operations become more complex, agronomists and financial advisors with deep data-driven expertise will be needed more than ever. They will play a key role in helping farmers make critical decisions on everything from capital allocation to business expansion and export strategies. Find more information at rbc. com/agriculture.

According to news reporting originating in Edmonton, Canada, by VerticalNews journalists, research stated, \"Fertilizer applications can enhance soil fertility, pasture growth and thereby increase production. Nitrogen fertilizer has, however, been identified as a significant source of nitrous oxide (NO) emissions from agriculture if not used correctly and can thereby increase the environmental damage costs associated with agricultural production.\" Funders for this research include Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, Campus Alberta Innovation Program, Alberta Economic Development and Trade. The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Athabasca University, \"The optimum use of organic fertilizers requires an improved understanding of nutrient cycles and their controls. Against this context, the objective of this research was to evaluate the scope for reducing NO emissions from grassland using a number of manure management practices including more frequent applications of smaller doses and different methods of application. We used a modified UK-DNDC model and NO emissions from grasslands at Pwllpeiran (PW), UK during the calibration period in autumn, were 1.35 kg N/ha/y (cattle slurry) and 0.95 kg N/ha/y (farmyard manure), and 2.31 kg N/ha/y (cattle slurry) and 1.08 kg N/ha/y (farmyard manure) during validation period in spring, compared to 1.43 kg N/ha/y (cattle slurry) and 0.29 kg N/ha/y (farmyard manure) during spring at North Wyke (NW), UK. The modelling results suggested that the time period between fertilizing and sampling (TPFA), rainfall and the daily average air temperature are key factors for NO emissions. Also, the emission factor (EF) varies spatio-temporally (0-2%) compared to uniform 1% EF assumption of IPCC. Predicted NO emissions were positively and linearly (R 1) related with N loadings under all scenarios. During the scenario analysis, the use of high frequency, low dose fertilizer applications compared to a single one off application was predicted to reduce NO peak fluxes and overall emissions for cattle slurry during the autumn and spring seasons at the PW and NW experimental sites by 17% and 15%, respectively.\" According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"These results demonstrated that an optimized application regime using outputs from the modelling approach is a promising tool for supporting environmentally-friendly precision agriculture.\" For more information on this research see: Optimizing farmyard manure and cattle slurry applications for intensively managed grasslands based on UK-DNDC model simulations.

This is evidenced not only in the way we embrace technology, but also the farm practices we use to ensure that we are competitive, sustainable and profitable - not just for 2020, but for the future generations that farm after us. Many Ontario farmers have invested significantly in environmental stewardship initiatives to mitigate the impact of climate change, that also provide positive long-term benefits to our water, soil and air quality. Conservation tillage, using cover crops in rotations and planting wind breaks are activities that the farming community has largely embraced. These actions demonstrate our ongoing commitment to not only improving soil health but also to sequester carbon to help address climate change concerns. The Ontario Federation of Agriculture (OFA) is working to ensure farmers and the agri-food industry are recognized, and fairly compensated for their work to mitigate the effects of climate change. On-farm stewardship activities have been generating carbon offsets for many years. OFA is particularly focused on raising awareness throughout the industry and all levels of government about the positive contributions agriculture makes in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Current carbon pricing policies are intended to provide economic disincentives to carbon emitters to encourage a reduction in their emissions, but little is being done to compensate those who already follow practices to sequester carbon and reduce emissions. Because there are currently no replacements for fossil fuels for agricultural production, the current carbon tax system cannot drive conservation efforts on farms, it serves only to reduce already thin farm margins. OFA along with our provincial counterparts will continue to advocate with provincial and federal governments to ensure farmers are fairly compensated and incentivized for driving necessary environmental enhancements to address climate change. Adoption of precision agriculture tools across the industry have helped to manage water resources in cropping systems, and result in the most accurate, efficient use of fertilizers and crop inputs in our history. While Ontario farmers have embraced the adoption of farm practices to improve the environment and reduce the impact of climate change, there are areas where we can do more. Precision agriculture tools offer some of the latest, most advanced technology for field crops and livestock management systems, but we shouldn't let the adoption rate be limited by the availability and reliability of broadband and cellular coverage in rural Ontario. Reliable, affordable broadband access to rural and remote areas of Ontario, is critical to enable more farmers to incorporate these environmental benefits to their everyday practices."}, {"title": "RETRANSMISSION: Bee Vectoring Technologies Completes Successful Official Registration Trials Milestone for Commercialization in Mexico", "article": "Mississauga, Ontario and Sacramento, California--(Newsfile Corp. - February 12, 2020) - Bee Vectoring Technologies International Inc.

BVT worked with a Mexican government approved researcher to conduct the biological efficacy trials which are a requirement for the registration process in Mexico. Results confirmed the efficacy of CR-7 in controlling key diseases on the crops as expected, and the trial results will be submitted to Mexican regulatory authorities for review in the coming weeks. The remaining registration dossier is being prepared and is planned to be submitted by spring or early summer of this year. BVT received US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approval back in August 2019. \"As soon as regulatory approval is granted in Mexico, BVT is ready to move into commercial operation and execute on its Mexico market sales strategy,\" says Ashish Malik, CEO of Bee Vectoring Technologies. \"If the regulatory submission process goes as planned without any follow up review required, we could see Mexico registration in place later this year. Having already successfully gone through what many consider a more rigorous process with the US EPA, we are confident that we are poised to complete and achieve this approval in a timely fashion.\" In anticipation of the commercial launch, the Company has already started market development activities of its proprietary bee vectoring system with delivery of VECTORITE(tm) with CR-7 by both bumble bees and honeybees. It has completed demonstration trials with two major Mexican berry growers on blueberries and blackberries. The growers, who farm in multiple states across Mexico, saw positive results and have agreed to continue trials on larger plot sizes in the next growing season. In addition, the company has built partnerships with two major bumble bee companies serving the Mexican market and some large commercial honeybee companies who provide pollination services to growers. The trials also tested the Company's biological fungicide CR-7 as a weekly spray with very positive results: the growers saw a 66% or greater efficacy in incidence and severity reduction over untreated control or standard organic commercially treated crops. This paves the way for a future introduction of a foliar spray end use product containing CR-7. BVT received an exemption from tolerance on CR-7 from the EPA which means all crops that are gown using any end use formulation of CR-7, including a foliar spray product, would not have to be tested for residues of CR-7 by Mexican growers before they export their crops into the US. This is seen as a major benefit in an export-oriented market such as Mexico. \"Currently, Mexico uses US$250 million worth of chemical fungicides per year,\" continued Mr. Malik. \"In addition to the registration trials, BVT has been conducting demonstration trials with local growers to prove out the efficacy of the technology. The use of biologicals in place of chemical fungicides is a fast-growing trend and an increasing number of growers are modifying production practices to meet higher food safety and quality standards with less chemical input.\" At a time of rising food prices, population growth and concerns about global food security, there is a growing need for more sustainable agricultural practices - ones that will help address future food needs and tackle the emerging challenges of climate change and resource conservation.

In addition, the company has built partnerships with two major bumblebee companies serving the Mexican market and some large commercial honeybee companies which provide pollination services to growers. The trials also tested the company's biological fungicide CR-7 as a weekly spray with very positive results: The growers saw a 66-per-cent-or-greater efficacy in incidence and severity reduction over untreated control or standard organic commercially treated crops. This paves the way for a future introduction of a foliar spray end use product containing CR-7. Bee Vectoring received an exemption from tolerance on CR-7 from the EPA, which means all crops that are grown using any end use formulation of CR-7, including a foliar spray product, would not have to be tested for residues of CR-7 by Mexican growers before they export their crops into the United States. This is seen as a major benefit in an export-oriented market such as Mexico. \"Currently, Mexico uses $250-million (U.S.) worth of chemical fungicides per year,\" continued Mr. Malik. \"In addition to the registration trials, BVT has been conducting demonstration trials with local growers to prove out the efficacy of the technology. The use of biologicals in place of chemical fungicides is a fast-growing trend, and an increasing number of growers are modifying production practices to meet higher food safety and quality standards with less chemical input.\" At a time of rising food prices, population growth and concerns about global food security, there is a growing need for more sustainable agricultural practices -- ones that will help address future food needs and tackle the emerging challenges of climate change and resource conservation. Mexico is a significant producer of fresh fruits and vegetables, with $9.1-billion (U.S.) of produce exported to the U.S. annually (1). Bee Vectoring's natural precision agriculture system has tremendous market potential in Mexico's fresh vegetable and fruit production markets, which include 33,800 acres of strawberries, 9,300 acres of blueberries, and over 391,000 acres of tomatoes and peppers (2).

Over 500 people including growers, producers, suppliers and students from Colleges and Universities across Alberta, were present at the summit. Amongst others, attendees included Bayer, Richardson International, Sunterra, Nutrien, BASF Canada Agricultural Solutions, Calgary Coop and United Farmers of Alberta. The consensus, supported by keynote speeches and panel discussion, was that like many other industries, technology and innovation are shaking up Canada's agriculture industry but little is known about this outside of the agribusiness world and better communication with the consumer is needed. Members of the Bennett Jones Agribusiness, Food and Beverage industry group attended this summit with a view to learn more and inform clients about the latest things happening in the agribusiness and agri-food industry.  AgTech and innovation has meant a fundamental shift in the way we farm. This includes smart farming and data analytics, indoor growing technologies and hydroponics, and better product tracking and labelling. What this means is we now have a better understanding of the health of the products, when to water, when to fertilize, when to pick. Additionally, we can optimize resources from the amount of energy we need to use, to the labour we require and we can track and trace where a product originated, across the entire supply chain. Environment, sustainability and governance (ESG) is the latest industry hot topic. Companies need to have a set of operational standards that shows awareness of and adherence to environmental issues and sustainable practices. These companies must also be governed in a way that regular audits take place and shareholder rights are considered. Sustainable agriculture practices have received an increased focus in recent years driven by the needs for transparency and accountability. Consumers want to know how the product is farmed and where it originated, demanding the freshest and healthiest products possible. Consumer-facing companies, also need to demonstrate their commitment to an ESG approach to stay competitive and meet consumer expectations.  Trade and export plays a major role in Canada's economy. Canada is the fifth largest exporter of agricultural goods such as wheat, beef and canola with over 90 percent of Canada's farmers dependent on exports. Canada differentiates itself on the safety of its products and their high quality. But this alone is not enough. Changes to trade and policy need to happen in conjunction with fact-based advocacy in order for us to better compete globally. One solution is to gain industry, government and academic investment, collaboration and support, producing a team Canada approach so that we become the supplier of choice to the world, known for our quality products. These three trends are not the only things happening in the agribusiness space but ones people should be aware of. As stated by the Calgary Chamber of Commerce, agriculture and agri-foods is a large economic driver for Canada and contributes over $100 billion to our economy every year. Therefore it is critical that all levels of government support, advocate and promote Canada's agriculture and agri-food industry not just across Canada but on the world's stage.  With all that said, changes to trade agreements, regulations about investment in agribusiness from countries outside of Canada, as well as water and labour shortages, still mean that getting products from farm to table have many challenges to overcome.

According to news reporting out of Waterloo, Canada, by VerticalNews editors, research stated, \"Nitrogen is one of the most important yield-limiting nutrients for corn (Zea mays). The ability of thermal remote sensing to detect nitrogen deficiency in corn may enable precision agriculture to modify nitrogen rates according to field conditions.\" Funders for this research include Growing Forward 2 (GF2), a federal-provincial-territorial initiative, Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC). Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the University of Waterloo, \"This study applies the exergy destruction principle as a theory to explain the inverse relationship between surface temperature and nitrogen rate. Two hypotheses were developed. First, it was hypothesized that agricultural crops experiencing greater growth and providing greater yield will have lower surface temperature. The second hypothesis was that corn grown under optimum levels of nitrogen will have lower surface temperatures compared to corn grown under nitrogen stressed conditions. Field studies were conducted during two summer seasons (2016 and 2017) on an established long-term field trial of corn yield response to varying rates of nitrogen. It was found that corn surface temperature decreased as the rate of nitrogen increased. A shallow but statistically significant (P < 0.05) negative slope was observed consistently with increasing rates of nitrogen. Surface temperature measurements, however, were variable. This variability was the result of external and weather dependent variables that influenced leaf surface temperature.\" According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Despite this variability, the exergy destruction principle provides a theory from which thermal remote sensing can be applied through the use of surface temperature measurements to detect physiological stress in crop plants.\" For more information on this research see: An Inverse Correlation Between Corn Temperature and Nitrogen Stress: a Field Case Study.

The agriculture tractor market in Canada was worth USD 3.7 billion in 2018 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.8% from 2019 to 2024. The emphasis on increased farm mechanization in Canada is derived from the economic drive for greater productivity and reduced farm labor supply. The most significant influence in the mechanization of the Canadian agriculture industry has been the continuous surge in the use of farm tractors. Tractors allow the use of specialized machinery and power units in agriculture, making agricultural practices more efficient. Moreover, tractors reduce the actual man-hours of labor required in the production, management, and marketing of farm products. Mechanization and utilization of tractors have been moving forward rapidly in Canada. Rising interest rates, inflating commodity prices and moderate growth in farm cash receipts are expected to slow down tractor sales in the market. Key Deliverables  Key Topics Covered: 1.

Celebrating plant health and bringing more awareness to the issue is well worth pursuing. Plants represent about 80 per cent of everything we eat. And animals raised on farms, of course, eat plants. Most Canadians recognize how important plants are to global food systems, but few know how vulnerable our plant-based ecosystem really is. This year should highlight efforts to provide disease resistance for many crops around the world. Many vulnerable crops are grown in regions where plant science is underdeveloped. In fact, diseases threaten foods most of us take for granted. Bananas, citrus, coffee and cocoa are all affected by climate change and relentless diseases. Since most of these crops are grown in impoverished regions where farming practices have hardly evolved over the last several decades, economic powerhouses like Canada should think about supporting production outside our borders. Many Canadians may be unaware of how lucky they are, having access to great food choices, year-round. We are in an era of acute focus on climate change. The impact of weather on plant disease occurrence and development is critical for plants and deserves more support and attention. Every day, Canadians pay for the impact of climate change on crops. We don't know the extent to which food prices are affected but we know that the influence is real. Epidemics and climate events affected leafy greens and many other produce prices in 2019, and we expect more of the same in 2020. The spread of disease and pests, and the introduction of new diseases in a changing climate is something all nations need to mitigate against. And technological advancement hasn't been idle. Despite significant challenges, modern civilization has seen a decent number of successes in plant science. Gene editing and genetic engineering are helping agriculture become more efficient and resilient. The use of phytobiomes, big data in agri-food and the use of precision agriculture are all making farming practices more sustainable. Geographic information systems (GIS) farming and robotic production should also be showcased this year. Our growing rural-versus-urban divide is causing consumers who live in urban centres to be less knowledgeable and appreciative of what modern agriculture is all about. Recent advances are impressive and should be promoted for the betterment of society and for better policies. But again, this is about equal access to technologies, data and knowledge across the entire globe. At the epicentre of agricultural systems are plants. Plant health initiatives should focus on how we share our knowledge and expertise with other nations. Climate change knows no borders and neither should science. And when it comes to plant science, Canada is a force to be reckoned with. But a simple declaration is typically not enough. We should be constantly reminded of what's at stake with the health of plants. The year 2019 was dedicated to the periodic table of chemical elements. Most would agree there wasn't much fanfare about the table in the last 12 months. But picking plant health as a theme has great potential - if the work is put in.

They posited that there must be an underlying factor weakening bees' immune systems. At Le Corum, a conference center and opera house, the pair discussed their findings. They had fed bees with extremely small amounts of neonicotinoids, or neonics, the most commonly used class of insecticides in the world. Neonics are, of course, meant to kill insects, but they are marketed as safe for insects that aren't being directly targeted. VanEngelsdorp and Pettis found that even at nonlethal doses, the bees in the trial became much more vulnerable to fungal infection. Bees carrying an infection will often fly off to die, a virtuous form of suicide designed to protect the larger hive from contagion. The dosages of the pesticide were so miniscule, said vanEngelsdorp, that it was \"below the limit of detection.\" The only reason they knew the bees had consumed the neonicotinoids, he added, was \"because we exposed them.\" Bee health depends on a variety of synergistic factors, the scientists were careful to note. But in this study, Pettis said, they were able to isolate \"one pesticide and one pathogen and we clearly see the interaction.\" In 2013, the European Union called for a temporary suspension of the most commonly used neonicotinoid-based products on flowering plants, citing the danger posed to bees -- an effort that resulted in a permanent ban in 2018. In the U.S., however, industry dug in, seeking not only to discredit the research but to cast pesticide companies as a solution to the problem. Lobbying documents and emails, many of which were obtained through open records requests, show a sophisticated effort over the last decade by the pesticide industry to obstruct any effort to restrict the use of neonicotinoids. Bayer and Syngenta, the largest manufacturers of neonics, and Monsanto, one of the leading producers of seeds pretreated with neonics, cultivated ties with prominent academics, including vanEngelsdorp, and other scientists who had once called for a greater focus on the threat posed by pesticides. captiooon Photo: Philipp Schmidli/Bloomberg via Getty Images The companies also sought influence with beekeepers and regulators, and went to great lengths to shape public opinion. Pesticide firms launched new coalitions and seeded foundations with cash to focus on nonpesticide factors in pollinator decline. The pesticide companies have used a variety of strategies to shift the public discourse. Michael Sanford, a spokesperson for PBS KVIE, which produces \"America's Heartland,\" wrote in an email to The Intercept that \"consistent with strict PBS editorial standards and our own,\" sponsors of the show provided no editorial input. Honeybees have captured almost all the attention for the dangers of neonics, but they are hardly the only species in decline because of the chemical. Other forms of influence have been far more covert. The greatest public relations coup has been the push to reframe the debate around bee decline to focus only on the threat of Varroa mites, a parasite native to Asia that began spreading to the U.S. in the 1980s. The mite is known to rapidly infest bee hives and carry a range of infectious diseases. CropLife America, among other groups backed by pesticide companies, has financed research and advocacy around the mite -- an effort designed to muddy the conversation around pesticide use. Meanwhile, research suggests the issues are interrelated; neonics make bees far more susceptible to mite infestations and attendant diseases. Bayer even constructed a sculpture of the Varroa mite at its \"Bee Care Center\" in North Carolina and at its research center in Germany, hyping its role as the primary force fueling the decline of pollinators. captiooon Photo: Joanna Nottebrock/The New York Times via Redux The stunningly successful campaign has kept most neonic products in wide circulation in commercial agriculture as well as in home gardens. The result is a world awash in neonics -- and massive profits for companies such as Syngenta and Bayer, which now counts Monsanto as a subsidiary. \"Bees are the canary in the cornfield,\" said Lisa Archer, from Friends of the Earth. \"The science linking pesticides to the extinction crisis has grown.\" Scientists are only now taking a closer look at the potential impact of neonics on humans and other mammals. \"Bees are the canary in the cornfield,\" said Lisa Archer, the food and agriculture program director at Friends of the Earth. \"The science linking pesticides to the extinction crisis has grown.\" Dave Goulson, a professor of biology at the University of Sussex, told The Intercept, \"I think perhaps we are reaching a tipping point where people finally begin to appreciate the importance of insects, the scale of their decline, and that blitzing the landscape with pesticides is not sustainable or desirable.\" Bayer and Syngenta reject any claim that their neonic products are harming the environment. \"Neonicotinoid products are critically important tools for farmers, and are approved for use in more than 100 countries due to their strong safety profile when used according to label,\" said Susan Luke, a spokesperson for Bayer Crop Science North America, in a statement to The Intercept. \"This is why Bayer continues to strongly support their continued safe use, even though the manufacture of neonic products is not a major part of our business.\" \"Research claims that have been made questioning neonic safety all share common flaws, such as exposure levels that far exceed real-world scenarios, and the flawed idea that exposure to substances in the environment necessarily means harm,\" adds Luke. \"It does not, otherwise no one would go swimming in chlorine or drink caffeinated coffee.\" \"Since neonicotinoids were introduced in the 1990s, honey bee colonies have been increasing in the United States, Europe, Canada and indeed around the world,\" Chris Tutino, a spokesperson for Syngenta, claimed in a statement to The Intercept. He added that \"most scientists and bee experts agree that bee health is affected by multiple factors, including parasites, diseases, habitat and nutrition, weather and hive management practices.\" Tutino, in his email, noted that the neonic compound thiamethoxam, used in popular Syngenta products such as Cruiser and Dividend, had undergone \"extensive tests evaluating effects on pollinators,\" and provided links to five studies, all of which were produced by Syngenta consultants or employees. Neither company responded directly to questions about the role of neonic products in fueling declines of butterflies, dragonflies, and other insect species beyond bee populations. Both companies highlighted company funding for honeybee health research. The chemical industry's comments were disputed by Willa Childress, an organizer with Pesticide Action Network North America. While it's true, Childress noted, that managed honeybee hive populations are growing, that is because of the commercial value of honeybees in pollinating a vast array of American agriculture. Beekeepers on average now lose around 40-50 percent of hives every year, well up from historical averages of 10 percent. Many commercial beekeepers are forced to constantly divide hives and buy queens to maintain hive populations, with many relying on government subsidies to scrape by. \"So no, honeybees aren't doing 'better than ever,'\" said Childress. \"And the scientists do agree that multiple interacting factors are driving pollinator decline, including, as chemical companies neglect to mention, pesticide use.\" \"Honeybees will not go extinct in our lifetimes,\" noted Childress. But, she added, \"data on native bees and wild pollinators is far more 'apocalyptic' than even the most concerning reports on honey bee losses. Unprecedented numbers of wild pollinators are facing extinction -- and we have very limited data on a number of other pollinators that are at risk.\" The pressure began to build in 2010 after Tom Theobald, a beekeeper in Boulder, Colorado, obtained an internal Environmental Protection Agency report showing that the agency's own scientists had sharply criticized the research used to permit the sale of one of the most popular lines of neonic products. In 2003, Bayer had secured the temporary right to use clothianidin, a neonic used widely for corn and canola, from the EPA -- under the condition that the company conduct a \"chronic life cycle study\" showing how use of the neonic would affect honeybees by the end of the following year. The Bayer-funded study, led by Cynthia Scott-Dupree, an environmental sciences professor at the University of Guelph in Ontario, placed hives in clothianidin-treated fields of canola and hives in untreated fields of canola. The tests found little variation between the two sets of hives, but researchers later pointed out that the hives in the study were placed only 968 feet apart from one another. Honeybees forage for pollen up to six miles from their hives. Scott-Dupree was later appointed the \"Bayer CropScience Chair in Sustainable Pest Management\" at the University of Guelph. Regulators in Canada and at the EPA used the study to clear clothianidin for unconditional use. Internally, however, EPA scientists expressed concerns. Around the country, legislators in states across the country proposed bills to restrict neonics. In Minnesota, a bill was signed into law to prevent nurseries from marketing plants as pollinator-friendly if they had been treated with neonics. For a while, the movement seemed to be gaining traction, which some hoped would lead the U.S. to mirror the EU in moving to regulate the widely used insecticide. After a hearing in which he pointed to pesticides, Jeffrey Pettis told the Washington Post that he was criticized him for failing to follow \"the script.\" In almost every other state, with the exception of Vermont, Connecticut, and Maryland, lobbyists from the pesticide and agribusiness industry successfully killed any significant restriction on neonic products. The scientific community, once focused on studying the impact of pesticides, became splintered, with many of the leading voices going to work for industry or industry-backed nonprofits. Critics of neonics were quickly sidelined. In April 2014, the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Horticulture, Research, Biotechnology, and Foreign Agriculture -- then chaired by Rep. Austin Scott, a Georgia Republican -- convened a hearing to discuss the pollinator crisis. The event featured David Fischer, a Bayer official, and Jeff Stone, lobbyist for commercial nurseries. Both men used the hearing to warn against any restrictions on neonics in response to bee decline. The third, Dan Cummings, a representative of the Almond Board, a trade group for almond growers, focused on the threat of the Varroa mite. And two months after the hearing, according to the Post, Pettis was demoted, losing his role managing the USDA bee lab in Beltsville, Maryland. Pettis later left the government and now serves as president of Apimondia. The Post also details the story of a prominent USDA scientist, Jonathan Lundgren, who researched the dangers posed by neonics to pollinators and spoke publicly about the issue. In 2015, Lundgren suddenly faced suspensions and an internal government investigation over misconduct, a push he believes was motivated by industry for his role in speaking out on pesticides. \"I guess I started asking the wrong questions, pursuing risk assessments of neonicotinoids on a lot of different field crop seeds used throughout the U.S. and how they were affecting non-target species like pollinators,\" Lundgren told The Intercept. The USDA did not respond to The Intercept's request for comment. It told the Post that the suspensions had nothing to do with his research. They were for \"conduct unbecoming a federal employee\" and \"violating travel regulations.\" Lundgren now runs Blue Dasher Farm in South Dakota, a research effort to develop ways to rotate diverse sets of crops as a way to increase yields and suppress pests naturally. There are few institutions, he noted, where researchers can pursue science independent of industry influence. \"Universities have become dependent on extramural funds, entire programs are bankrolled by these pesticide companies, chemical companies,\" he added. The regulatory system in the U.S. assumes chemical products are generally safe until proven hazardous. \"Generally, we see the U.S. waiting longer than the EU to take action on a variety of pesticides and other chemicals,\" said Childress, the organizer with Pesticide Action Network North America. Part of the divergence, Childress continued, stems from a regulatory system in the U.S. that assumes chemical products are generally safe until proven hazardous. In contrast, the EU tends to use the \"precautionary principle,\" removing products that may cause harm, and requiring proof of safety before allowing them to return to market. The pesticide industry also maintains a long history of underhanded methods to discredit its critics. Syngenta became infamous after its tactics against University of California, Berkeley Professor Tyrone Hayes were reported. Hayes's research showed that the company's signature herbicide, atrazine, appeared to disrupt the sexual development of frogs. \"The pesticide industry is using Big Tobacco's PR tactics to try and spin the science about their products' links to bee declines and delay action while they keep profiting,\" said Archer, whose group, Friends of the Earth, has documented the lobbying tactics of pesticide makers. As early as the late 17th century, farmers found that they could grind tobacco plants and use nicotine extract to kill beetles on crops. Nicotine acts as an organic insecticide, binding to nerve receptors and causing paralysis and death in aphids, white flies, and other plant-eating insects. Neonics were hailed as the \"Goldilocks compound\" because they are \"not too hard, not too soft, but just right.\" The new chemical came just in time. Farmers and regulators were seeking alternatives to another class of pesticides -- organophosphates, nerve agents sprayed on crops -- that had been found to cause cancer in humans. Initial studies of neonics showed that the compound was acutely toxic to insects but unlikely to cause harm to mammals. And because seeds could be pretreated with neonics, which were absorbed and expressed through the tissue, nectar, and pollen, they could be also produced on an industrial scale, providing agriculture crops with an efficient insect-killing capability without the need for expensive spray treatments or constant reapplication. In other words, farmers could soak the ground and seeds with enormous amounts of the compound to avoid problems from pests in the future. The delivery mechanism saved money for farmers but set the conditions for chronic overuse of the pesticides. captiooon Map: USGS National Water-Quality Assessment, The Intercept The first commercial neonic, imidacloprid, was registered with the EPA in 1994 and sold as a potato seed treatment. Business boomed as neonic products spread worldwide to Japan, France, Germany, and South Africa. In the U.S., it became a popular standard seed and root treatment for corn, cotton, soybeans, almonds, and a range of fruits and vegetables. Neonics were even used for household applications. Bayer produced imidacloprid as a flea treatment on pets throughout the U.S. The Advantage line of flea control took off, with a marketing campaign featuring the Jack Russell terrier \"Eddie\" from the television show \"Frasier\" and a 30-foot inflatable flea in Times Square. Chemical Week called the introduction of neonics a \"renaissance for the U.S. insecticides industry\" providing \"environmentally friendly products.\" The Columbus Dispatch, in an article for home gardeners about ways to deliver a \"surgical strike\" against pests, called for consumers to consider Bayer's Merit soil treatment, which the paper called \"virtually non-toxic.\" The swift adoption of the compound instantly made Bayer, which had previously profited largely from its pharmaceutical line of products, a worldwide player in the agrochemical industry. \"Imidacloprid is our most important product,\" the head of Bayer's pesticide division told investors in 2008. \"Imidacloprid is our most important product,\" Friedrich Berschauer, then-head of Bayer's pesticide division, told investors during a conference call in 2008, according to a transcript of his remarks. Company disclosures underscore Berschauer's remarks: During that fiscal year, the company reported 932 million euros in sales for its top two neonic compounds. The first restrictions on neonics in the EU, announced late in 2013, raised alarm in the industry. \"The number for the full year as a consequence of the suspension is about $75 million,\" noted John Mack, then-Syngenta's chief executive officer on a call with investors the following year, referring to the decrease in revenue as a result of the decision. The executives were quick to point out, however, the full brunt of the restriction had been limited because many EU states obtained exemptions from the suspension rule. In another call with investors, Mack declared that there \"is no relationship between\" the use of neonics \"and the causality of bee decline,\" and said he was certain regulators in the U.S. would not take the European approach. Speaking with investors 2018, Liam Condon, a Bayer executive in charge of pesticide products, warned that the neonic ban in France alone had cost the firm 80 million euros. The wider restrictions imposed on the chemical, Condon continued, \"drags our entire European results down.\" Bayer no longer breaks out individual product revenue in its investor reports. Previous financial reporting has suggested that neonics represent as much as 20 percent of its sales. The company's annual report in 2018 showed that the company's insecticide division produced more than 1.3 billion euros in revenue. Werner Baumann, chair of Bayer's board, announcing its acquisition of Monsanto in 2016, declared that the deal would create \"a global leader in the agricultural industry,\" delivering insecticides and seed treatments. The global neonic market generated $4.42 billion in revenue in 2018, roughly doubling over the previous decade, according to new figures provided to The Intercept from Agranova, a research firm that tracks the industry. captiooon Photo: Francois Guillot/AFP/Getty Images In the early 1990s, in France, several bee hives near fields planted with neonicotinoids collapsed suddenly, and beekeepers observed mass bee die-offs in the vicinity of sunflower fields treated with Bayer's imidacloprid-based Gaucho. The French beekeepers mounted a sustained pressure campaign, including demonstrations of hundreds marching in Paris and outside of Bayer's factory in Cormery, in central France. The beekeepers observed that their bees were disoriented and unable to forage, and weakened to a point where disease and parasitic infections spread rapidly, destroying thousands of hives. Beekeepers found bees trembling and dying on the ground, a syndrome they nicknamed \"mad bee disease.\" They blamed neonics, but Bayer maintained that the chemicals caused no harm. \"We don't believe the insecticide poses any risks,\" Peter Brain, a regulatory affairs official with Bayer, told reporters. In 2008, officials in Italy, Germany, and Slovenia observed that the sowing of fields with neonic-treated seeds correlated with nearby mass bee die-offs. In one region of Germany, beekeepers reported the loss of 11,500 bee colonies following the planting of nearby canola fields with neonic-treated seeds. Similar observations across the continent led to the temporary restriction of commonly used neonic products in all three countries that year. The mounting pressure created a need for the pesticide industry to push back with its own research. In fact, one of the greatest victories for the industry was its effort to cultivate the most influential bee scientists in the U.S. captiooon Photo: David Yellen The mysterious crisis was termed \"colony collapse disorder\" in the media. Dennis vanEngelsdorp, then-serving as Pennsylvania acting chief apiary inspector and studying at Penn State University, found himself at the center of the story. \"It's just causing so much death so quickly that it's startling,\" he told the Philadelphia Inquirer. He started with autopsies of dead bees in Pennsylvania, but soon came into contact with beekeepers in Georgia, Florida, and California reporting similar losses. A team of other prominent bee experts, including vanEngelsdorp, Washington State University entomologist Walter \"Steve\" Sheppard, and other prominent scientists worked to investigate the crisis. \"This is like C.S.I. for agriculture,\" said one of the academics on the project, Columbia University's W. Ian Lipkin, in an interview with the New York Times. \"Imagine if every one of three cows died. The National Guard would be out,\" vanEngelsdorp said in 2013. The following year, in September 2009, vanEngelsdorp appeared alongside Pettis at Apimondia. During this period in his career, vanEngelsdorp generally suggested in media interviews that several factors were likely to blame for bee loss. The decline, he told a local paper in Missouri in 2007, could be attributed to \"mites and associated diseases, some unknown pathogenic disease and pesticide contamination or poisoning.\" The research he presented at Apimondia concluded that \"interactions between pesticides and pathogens could be a major contributor to increased mortality of honey bee colonies.\" In the following years, vanEngelsdorp used his voice to dismiss concerns with neonics in the media. His shift in rhetoric coincided with a push by the pesticide industry, in response to rising calls for pesticide restrictions to stem bee losses, began a push to rebrand itself as bee-friendly. When asked about his seeming shift, vanEngelsdorp said in an email that his work focused on honeybees, but he is concerned with the threat posed to other pollinators and insect life. In Maryland, he wrote, high levels of mite infestations \"would explain lots of [honey bee] mortality.\" \"I should stress that I am speaking about honey bees, not native bees, and the effects of neonics on non-target non-honey bees (Honey bees have a reserve work force that can be lost without consequence as they are social organisms and other non-honey bee bees don't) is much more pronounced and concerning,\" vanEngelsdorp wrote. In an email, vanEngelsdorp said that although that he has received one grant funding stream from Bayer, that award came in last year and \"it would be hard to argue it influenced past work.\" The funding from Project Apis m. to vanEngelsdorp's Bee Informed Project, he added, came from Costco, not the agricultural industry. Other corporate interests, including the Almond Board of California and the General Mills Foundation, have also directly funded the Bee Informed Project. VanEngelsdorp said that his lab has never received direct funding from pesticide companies. The University of Maryland professor also explained that he felt conflicted about joining Monsanto's advisory board, a position that ended in 2019. \"The purpose of this board is to help guide the development of new tools to help control Varroa, which I think, and the data suggest - are the biggest drivers of loss,\" wrote vanEngelsdorp. \"So it was a big struggle when I was asked to join the advisory board (which included several beekeepers), because - who wants to have an association with Big Ag?\" \"Do I feel conflicted? - all the time,\" vanEngelsdorp told The Intercept. \"But do I think my involvement with encouraging the development of a desperately needed new mite control skews my view of drivers of honey [bee] health. No. I think the data is clear.\" He added, \"The world is a complicated place. Full of gray. I just have to believe the science will show truth, and hope we can get there by keeping things cordial, and respectful of the idea that people taking different paths towards the same end (save the bees) is not bad.\" \"I'm an environmentalist - so have been and continue to be very concerned and vocal about protecting the earth and its biome,\" he wrote. \"I am certain that in all interviews on this topic I clearly say - the widespread use of neonic coated seeds is a short sighted, wasteful and environmentally unsustainable way of using this product. I strongly advocate for wise use. Use it when you know you need it and not unless you know you do.' But that quote never gets picked up. But it's what I think and have thought for a long time.\" Danielle Downey, the executive of Project Apis m., said the group is \"transparent about where donated funds come from and what we use them for, keeping in mind donor privacy,\" in a statement to The Intercept. \"Project Apis m. does keep abreast of the science regarding bee health, which allows us to support industry-relevant projects.\" Downey did not take a position on regulating neonics, and noted that \"regarding bans and regulations of pesticides, countries which apply different precautionary and risk assessment paradigms, may reach different outcomes.\" \"Do I feel conflicted? - all the time,\" vanEngelsdorp said. \"The world is a complicated place. Full of gray. I just have to believe the science will show truth. Marques Chavez, a spokesperson for the Keystone Policy Center, which organizes the Honey Bee Health Coalition, noted in a statement to The Intercept that the group \"supports honey bee health and tackles complex problems in agriculture and beyond by bringing diverse perspectives together.\" The statement did not address the proportion of pesticide industry influence, but said that the group maintains a public charter that \"outlines the structure and decision-making process utilized by the coalition to identify, refine, and finalize the idea and deliverables that reflect the diverse input and collaborative effort of our members.\" captiooon Screenshot: The Intercept VanEngelsdorp's shift away from concern about the role of neonics is captured in another documentary about the plight of the bees. \"I think they were using this group as a PR advantage, but by the same token we have no money in the beekeeping industry,\" Hayes said. \"My association with Bayer has had no influence on my research focus nor my research,\" said Sheppard, in a statement to The Intercept that detailed his work helping Project Apis m. identify research proposals for honeybee health using over $1 million in funding from Bayer. \"I cannot speak for Bayer - but the projects funded with their money and administered through Project Apis m. appear to be completely unrelated to any effort to 'prevent the restriction' of the use of neonicotinoids,\" wrote Sheppard. \"I am not naive enough to think such a major company does not have their own agenda for the promotion or support of their insect control products. However, and emphatically, in the case of the funds distributed by Project Apis m., no such connection was apparent to either Project Apis m. or myself.\" Jerry Hayes retired two years ago from Monsanto after the project he was hired to promote \"just didn't work out.\" He now works as an editor at Bee Culture magazine. In an interview, Hayes said that he was proud of the work the Honey Bee Health Coalition achieved, including the development of guides for beekeepers to manage Varroa infestations. And he views the effort to bring various stakeholders together in one coalition as a unique accomplishment. But he said that pesticide corporations were largely in the drivers' seat. \"I think they were using this group as a PR advantage, but by the same token we have no money in the beekeeping industry,\" said Hayes. \"These guys were funding the organization, they were funding meetings, all of us knew there were perhaps ulterior motives,\" he noted. \"Without those resources, we wouldn't be down the road a little bit to making honeybees a little less endangered.\" Hayes said he had followed the controversies around neonics and was concerned about the growing number of studies showing the threat to nontarget insects. Though he's concerned that restricting the chemical could reintroduce older pesticides with a greater risk to mammals, he added that the drive for profits have fueled the overuse of neonics. \"It all comes down to money. Bayer is taking care of stockholders,\" said Hayes. Hayes said he doesn't believe vanEngelsdorp's views on pesticides have been shaped by his ties to industry. \"He's a good scientist,\" said Hayes. \"Science changes over time. I think that science progresses and data shows different things at times, but I don't think Dennis is influenced by money from these other people.\" \"But,\" Hayes added, when \"chemical companies want to support Dennis because if he can come up with solutions to honey bee health, it takes pressure off of them, doesn't it?\" captiooon Photo: Joe Raedle/Getty Images And vanEngelsdorp played a prominent role in nearly defeating the legislation. In January 2016, the University of Maryland, College Park campus held a summit bringing corporate representatives and researchers together to talk about solutions to the bee crisis. Maryland, California, Massachusetts, and other states were considering restrictions on neonic products. The Obama administration had encouraged an approach that brought together a wide array of stakeholders, known as the Managed Pollinator Protection Plan, or MP3, method of resolving the issue. State officials tapped the Keystone Policy Center -- the same chemical industry-funded nonprofit in charge of CropLife America's Honey Bee Health Coalition -- to manage the process. VanEngelsdorp, addressing the summit, presided over a PowerPoint that listed a Monsanto affiliation in small type at the bottom, according to Luke Goembel, an official with the Central Maryland Beekeepers Association. The presentation, said Goembel, made the case that \"Varroa mites, not pesticides, were the primary cause of hive losses\" and included \"an image of a vampire baby to represent a Varroa mite.\" VanEngelsdorp, he said, made a mocking comparison, showing a graph with a chart showing the rise of pirate next to a chart showing the increasing loss of hives over time, an \"attempt to present the concept 'correlation does not prove causation,'\" and to \"ridicule the concern over increasing pesticide use.\" \"I was shocked,\" Goembel said, \"because the journals are full of research that describes many avenues by which pesticides, especially neonicotinoids, almost certainly lead to hive losses.\" The summit included a broad range of speakers, but beekeeper activists complained the discussion was dominated by pesticide makers. Speaker after speaker claimed that hive loss was only \"due to Varroa mites, not pesticides,\" according to Bonnie Raindrop, another official with the Central Maryland Beekeepers Association, who attended the event. Only a small percentage of the attendees, Raindrop said, were beekeepers, and those who did make it were separated from one another. The rest, she said, \"were people who knew nothing about bees,\" including lobbyists, lawn care professionals, and representatives of agribusiness. \"They had a very controlled format,\" said Raindrop, \"with one beekeeper at each table, the rest industry people, and we were asked to make recommendations for what the MP3 policy should look like.\" Both Raindrop and Goembel brought up the role of neonicotinoids and other systemic pesticides killing bees, but said other participants at the summit shot them down. The Keystone Policy Center moderators kept the conversation focused largely on mites, \"and said beekeepers weren't doing their due diligence to control mites using chemicals,\" she added. One month after the summit, legislators in Annapolis, Maryland, took up a bill to ban consumer neonics. During the House of Delegates debate over the legislation, a panel of opponents -- including representatives from Republican Gov. Larry Hogan's administration, pesticide industry representatives, and the owner of commercial nursery -- repeatedly cited the survey taken by the Keystone Policy Center at the summit as evidence that researchers did not think pesticides were a problem. Several cited vanEngelsdorp by name, claiming the University of Maryland professor had provided research showing that neonicotinoids did not pose a threat to Maryland hives. At the hearing, state delegate Clarence Lam, a Democrat, noted that hundreds of peer-reviewed scientific articles identified neonicotinoids as a prime driver of bee decline and scoffed at the industry attempt to use the MP3 summit as a counterexample. \"Presenting data like this is pretty specious,\" Lam said. \"It's marginally better than presenting data from a Facebook poll and saying this is what the data shows and this is what the science shows.\" In the end, the industry blitz failed, and, later in 2016, Maryland passed the Pollinator Protection Act. A similar measure passed that year in Connecticut to limit the use of neonics on flowering plants, and last year, Vermont enacted restrictions on consumer use of neonics. Gary Ruskin, the co-director of U.S. Right to Know, a watchdog group following pesticide industry influence, which shared some of the emails obtained via records requests between industry and academics with The Intercept, said, \"vanEnglesdorp's close ties to the pesticide industry raise serious questions about the worth and reliability of his research.\" \"As companies are increasingly threatened by scientific findings, they search for ways to blunt any independent science that may detract from profits,\" Ruskin said. \"One great way to do this is to co-opt scientists from public universities, who typically enjoy the public's trust.\" \"Tech team data is confidential so it should not be published -- especially by a chemical company!\" vanEngelsdorp wrote. In a response, Fischer removed the line from Bayer's blog. He also reminded the University of Maryland academic that Bayer had invested significant financial resources into the relationship and made it a priority for the company. \"We value our work with you and other researchers and stakeholders who have committed themselves to addressing this significant problem,\" Fischer wrote. \"As you are aware, perception is everything,\" vanEngelsdorp responded. Nick Surgey contributed research."}, {"title": "UN directs annual spotlight toward plant health", "article": "Every year, the United Nations promotes something it believes warrants attention, and it has declared 2020 the International Year of Plant Health. Celebrating plant health and bringing more awareness to the issue is well worth pursuing. Plants represent about 80 per cent of everything we eat. And animals raised on farms, of course, eat plants. Most Canadians recognize how important plants are to global food systems, but few would understand how vulnerable our plant-based ecosystem really is. This year should highlight efforts to provide disease resistance for many crops around the world. Many vulnerable crops are grown in regions where plant science is underdeveloped. In fact, diseases threaten foods most of us take for granted. Bananas, citrus, coffee and cocoa are all affected by climate change and relentless diseases. Since most of these crops are grown in impoverished regions where farming practices have hardly evolved over the last several decades, economic powerhouses such as Canada should think about supporting production outside our borders. Food consumption is more globalized than ever, and many Canadians may be unaware of how lucky they are, having access to great food choices year-round. We are in an era of acute focus on climate change. The impact of weather on plant disease occurrence and development is critical for plants and deserves more support and attention. Every day, Canadians pay for the impact of climate change on crops. We don't know the extent to which food prices are affected, but we know the influence is real. Epidemics and climate events affected the prices of leafy greens and many other produce varieties in 2019, and we expect more of the same in 2020. The spread of disease and pests and the introduction of new diseases in a changing climate are dangers all nations need to mitigate against. And technological advancement hasn't been idle. Despite significant challenges, modern civilization has seen a decent number of successes in plant science. Gene editing and genetic engineering are helping agriculture become more efficient and resilient. The use of phytobiomes, big data in agri-food and the use of precision agriculture are all making farming practices more sustainable. Geographic information systems (GIS) farming and robotic production should also be showcased this year. Our growing rural-versus-urban divide is causing consumers who live in urban centres to be less knowledgeable and appreciative of what modern agriculture is all about. Recent advances are impressive and should be promoted for the betterment of society and for better policies. But again, this is about equal access to technologies, data and knowledge across the entire globe. At the epicentre of agricultural systems are plants. Plant health initiatives should focus on how we share our knowledge and expertise with other nations. Climate change knows no borders, and neither should science. And when it comes to plant science, Canada is a force to be reckoned with. It's not the first time the UN has focused its energy on plants -- 2016 was the International Year of Pulses. For 12 months, pulses were heavily promoted. As one the world's largest producers and exporters of pulses, Canada benefited from their rise to stardom. A few years later, food policies around the world encourage citizens to consume pulses as much as possible. As a result, more people know what pulses are and include them in their diets. Most would agree that the UN's choice to promote pulses was as appropriate as it was needed, and it was successful. But a simple declaration is typically not enough. We should be constantly reminded of what's at stake with the health of plants. The year 2019 was dedicated to the periodic table of chemical elements. Most would agree there wasn't much fanfare about the table in the last 12 months. Other than acknowledging its existence, there wasn't much promotion of a table that's been in our classrooms and labs for decades. As a result, we barely heard about it. But picking plant health as a theme has great potential -- if the work is put in.

The Supercluster co-invests in ambitious technology development projects and new solutions to improve the sustainability and competitiveness of natural resources, healthcare and industrial sectors and energize the economy. The projects announced today will help create good jobs, drive economic growth, and elevate the reputation of Canada's world-leading digital economy. Developing Talent for Good Jobs The Supercluster's Capacity Building program is focused on talent development, and today's announcement of $5 million in investments across eight Capacity Building projects includes investment from the Government of B.C., Federal Government's Ministry of Innovation, Science and Industry, and other partners. It marks the first in a planned series of investments to develop Canada's talent base for the needs of industry today and tomorrow. The approved projects include: Athena Pathways, Autonomous Systems Technician, Competency Assessment Mapping Platform for Industry Responsive Education (CAMPFIRE), Design for Startups, Diversifying Talent in Quantum Computing, Future Capital - Shape the Future of Funding, HyperTalent, and Women's Entrepreneurship Program. The Supercluster's Capacity Building Program creates digital skills programs and work experience for employees while building a \"job-ready\" workforce for Canadian employers. These projects connect employers, educators and community organizations focused on developing job-ready, world-leading talent. By developing the skilled talent industry needs, the Supercluster is supporting traditional industries in the use of innovation and technology by connecting the jobs of tomorrow with the employees of today. For example, the \"Autonomous Systems Technician\" project will support the development of skills and training for individuals from under-represented groups so that they are \"job ready\" for the digital economy. Through the Autonomous Systems Technician project, Indigenous peoples and women will gain access to digital skills to install and maintain remote telecommunications systems that are being implemented by the resource sector. \"Technology is transforming our industry and helping to improve safety, sustainability and efficiency across the mining sector. This new program will help Indigenous Peoples and women to be part of the technological evolution in mining and take advantage of new opportunities being created,\" said Marcia Smith, Senior Vice President, Sustainability and External Affairs, Teck. The Capacity Building Program aims to capture a broader talent pool for employers by engaging under-represented groups such as women and Indigenous peoples, thereby supporting the growth of diversity and inclusion across multiple sectors. The projects also foster leadership development for entrepreneurs, deliver relevant digital skills for workers in the natural resource sector, engage Indigenous youth in Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM), and support the pursuit of careers in digital technology. Scaling Canada's Digital Economy The Supercluster also announced investments of $20 million in six technology projects. This includes funding from the Federal Government's Ministry of Innovation, Science and Industry, and industry partners. These projects are solving some of the most pressing challenges in the natural resources, healthcare, and industrial sectors such as reducing pesticide use on crops, improving the management of our water resources, and ensuring Canadians have access to the best tools for early diagnosis of disease, regardless of where they live. The approved projects include: Augmented Reality for Maintenance and Inspection, Fresh Water Data Commons, Intelligent Network for Point-of-Care Ultrasound, Personal Health Wallet, Precision Agriculture to Improve Crop Health, and Reducing Opioid Use for Pain Management. The projects announced today in the Supercluster's technology programs demonstrate the benefits of organizations working together to tackle some of the most challenging hurdles faced by major industries and sectors. Climate change, for example, is threatening food crops in Canada and around the world as pests, pathogens and viruses attack and destroy crops. The \"Precision Agriculture to Improve Crop Health\" project will develop new pest and pathogen controls through the use of computational biochemistry, genomics, machine learning, and robotics. This novel approach aims to reduce pesticide use and will initially focus on leaf rust disease, which attacks some of Canada's most important crops, including wheat and barley. Terramera is committed to reduce or eliminate 80% of the synthetic pesticide load in agriculture globally by 2030, and this project helps advance our goal,\" said Karn Manhas, Founder and CEO, Terramera. \"We appreciate the opportunity to lead this important crop health project through the Digital Technology Supercluster and collaborate with universities, government labs and innovative companies from across Canada. It's a novel approach that will impact genomics and digital technology in multiple ways, and can set the stage for other companies to solve problems unique to their fields, impacting both Canada's digital economy, our agriculture economy and the health of Canadians across the country.\" \"The Digital Technology Supercluster is building strong momentum, creating a hotbed of innovation, collaboration and growth here in the Greater Vancouver region, and across B.C. and Canada. Today's projects will have a transformative effect across Canada's economy. They are not only ensuring all Canadians have access to the technology sector's employment opportunities, but are also empowering companies to experiment with new technological solutions for some of our most pressing challenges\" said the Honourable Navdeep Bains, Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry. \"Digital innovation is revolutionizing the workplace, and changing the needs of employers,\" said Supercluster CEO Sue Paish. \"The Capacity Building Program creates opportunities for Canadians to be skilled and job-ready so that our resource, traditional and non-traditional sectors can continue to leverage the opportunities digital transformation delivers. Our technology programs bring our Members together in an effort to solve some of Canadians' most urgent problems in health care, manufacturing, agriculture, and data.\" \"These Supercluster projects are important because they are dedicated to driving diversity and inclusion and provide more opportunities for British Columbians to participate in the everchanging innovation economy,\" said Bruce Ralston, Minister of Jobs, Trade and Technology, Government of British Columbia. \"These initiatives will focus on our priority areas, including agritech and quantum computing.

According to news reporting out of Charlottetown, Canada, by VerticalNews editors, research stated, \"Timely forecasting of crop yield is vital for precision agriculture management practices. This study used on-the-go proximal soil sensing using electromagnetic induction (EMI) readings of apparent ground electrical conductivity (ECa) to map ECa and forecast potato tuber yield in four fields across Atlantic Canada.\" Financial supporters for this research include Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada, Prince Edward Island Potato Board, Canadian Horticultural Council, Potato Board New Brunswick, New Brunswick Department of Agriculture, Aquaculture and Fisheries (CAP program), Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the University of Prince Edward Island, \"The ECa data, measured in the horizontal co-planar (HCP) configuration mode of the DualEM-2 instrument, were segmented to the top 0.30-m thickness of the soil layer using a standard method to compare mapping/prediction accuracy. ECa correlated well (R-2 = 0.81-0.90) with a 1:5 soil-to-water ratio solution's electrical conductivity (EC1:5). The actual tuber yield, which moderately varied (CV = 18.9-27.5%) across the fields and significantly correlated with ECa, explained more than 55% of the yield variability (R-2 = 0.57-0.66). The forecasted tuber yield calculated from cubic regression models of the actual tuber yield versus ECa was non-significantly different from the actual tuber yield (RMSE = 12.2-18.3%; R-2 = 0.57-0.66). Interpolated maps of the predicted and the actual yields, and their correlation analyses, showed similar trends of variations within the study fields (r = 0.69-0.80). The higher values of cation exchange capacity, calcium, phosphate, potash, organic matter and soil moisture content in the New Brunswick soils compared to the Prince Edward Island soils resulted in an overestimation of the predicted tuber yield than the actual yield at the lower ECa values, and an underestimation of the predicted tuber yield at higher ECa values for New Brunswick. The results revealed that the province-based calibrations produced more accurate predictions when compared with the single calibration by combining all of the data from New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island. The non-destructive prediction of potato tuber yield can enable the development of precision agricultural techniques and management practices for yield forecasting, in addition to making informed decisions for enhanced potato productivity. Highlights Potato cropping is highly important to the economy of Atlantic Canada. The DualEM-2 sensor was used to forecast and map tuber yield to advance crop management. The tuber yields significantly correlated with ground conductivity that explained >55% of variability in yield.\" According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The DualEM-2 sensor can accurately predict potato yield under agricultural conditions similar to Atlantic Canada.\" Our news journalists report that additional information may be obtained by contacting A.A.

Forecasting can prove difficult, however. \"There are numbers like 50 per cent of the jobs [of the future] have not yet been defined, and so how does any organization ... prepare for that kind of change?\" Davidson said. A research paper released in 2018 showed half of Canadian jobs will be affected by automation in the next decade, and so-called \"human skills\" such as critical thinking and problem solving will be key to remaining competitive and resilient in an era of disruption and artificial intelligence. The study conducted by RBC Economics found Canada's education system is inadequately designed to help young people navigate the new skills economy. It recommended ensuring every undergrad has the opportunity for an apprenticeship, internship, coop or other \"experiential placement\" before graduation. Universities, however, say they are constantly working with faculty, experts and industry leaders to make sure students are prepared for the changing economic and labour landscape. Susan McCahan, vice-provost of academic programs at the University of Toronto, says so-called \"future-proofing\" is a complex process that involves more than just creating new degrees and programs. It also involves rethinking existing curricula around future career trends, particularly in fields with major exposure to artificial intelligence, she said, offering the example of pharmacy. \"They are imagining that within a fairly short time frame here, the work that pharmacists do will be really vastly different ... than what we experience right now,\" McCahan said. \"How do you train pharmacists to do effective client care, and what does that mean in a world in which your prescriptions are delivered to your home and you don't walk into the Shoppers Drug Mart to find the pharmacist? Or maybe there's a vending machine where your prescription's waiting for you.\" At the same time, McCahan said, not every program needs to have an AI component, and universities have to be careful not to jump on every fad. While some traditional programs get an overhaul, a slew of new programs have also surfaced in recent years as institutions aim to address what they see as significant and emerging needs in society and the workforce. Toronto's York University, for example, recently unveiled a new disaster and emergency management program it says is the first of its kind in Canada, saying incidents like the 2016 wildfire evacuation in Alberta demonstrate a pressing demand for qualified experts in the field. U of T, meanwhile, has begun offering what it calls the country's first undergraduate engineering program in machine intelligence, specializing in the study, development and application of algorithms that help systems learn from data. The University of New Brunswick opened a new cybersecurity institute in 2017 in hopes of establishing an educational hub for a pivotal issue of the digital age. At the University of Guelph's Ontario Agricultural College, there has been a renewed interest in precision agriculture - the use of data to allocate resources more efficiently, among other things - as artificial intelligence has taken centre stage, said the college's dean, Rene Van Acker. The practice can also help reduce the impact of farming on the environment, combining two of the major trends in education and work, he said. \"The overapplication of fertilizer, for example, is a problem in watersheds,\" Van Acker said. \"Technology that could help us to refine our applications to make them more precise would then benefit the environment.\" Many schools say they focus on the underlying skills that will allow students to navigate technological changes in their fields - particularly teamwork, communication and project management, which they say are increasingly in demand with employers. \"That is what the university is uniquely situated to provide, because we don't think about job training, we think about developing the skills and interests of people,\" Alice Pitt, vice-provost academic at York University, said in a recent interview. Developing those skills often means collaborating across fields, she said, pointing to a new pilot program run by faculty in the university's dance department and engineering school that is \"really oriented toward the future of work.\" The cross-campus program brings together fourth-year students in interdisciplinary groups to tackle problems pitched by various industry and non-profit groups, focusing on the skills and abilities needed to address those challenges, Pitt said. Collaboration is also needed in coming up with new courses to prepare students for the issues they will face in the workplace, she said. \"The philosophy department is creating the ethics course that the business people and the engineering people who are doing AI will be exposed to, which is a much deeper, deeper way of thinking about it,\" Pitt said."}]
