In his keynote speech, Pallister spoke of the importance of farmers to Manitoba's economy and the challenges many have faced in recent years related to flooding and water management. \"The realities of climate change mean our province sees unpredictable weather patterns and resulting issues around water management,\" said Pallister. \"This is a challenge we must face together, ensuring we farm the best land better while allowing water to be retained in places that make sense. This will provide protection, not only for our communities downstream, but also for the agricultural producers who help feed Manitobans and countless others around the world.\" The premier announced Manitoba's soon-to-be-revealed green plan will include an overall water management strategy, with measures to address drainage, pursue precision farming to ensure better management of nutrient run-off, accommodate the storage of excess water and ensure the retention of valuable wetlands. In his remarks at Ag Days, Eichler also announced the government's commitment to immediately begin consultations as part of a review of the funding structure of Keystone Agricultural Producers (KAP) under the Agricultural Producers Organization Funding Act. \"The current check-off funding structure creates needless administrative costs for farmers, KAP and purchasers of agricultural products,\" said Eichler. \"A review of the system has long been requested. Our government is listening to Manitobans and we are pleased to be taking this step today.\" Ag Days is the premiere event for agriculture in Manitoba and is the largest farm show in Canada, allowing producers, agri-business and industry professionals to connect and share innovation and expertise. \"The industry benefits generated by Ag Days will ensure that agriculture continues to be a cornerstone of our provincial economy,\" said Eichler. \"It is a tremendous honour to participate in the 40th anniversary of Ag Days as our government pursues strengthened partnerships with Manitoba's agricultural producers.\" - 30 -"}, {"title": "Leading Canadian farming co-op brings in new tech to boost precision agriculture", "article": "Co-op, one of the largest agricultural retailers in Western Canada, is partnering with farm management company Decisive Farming to provide growers with precision agriculture, crop marketing and data management services.

The creation of the Enterprise Machine Intelligence and Learning Initiative was not the impetus for the increased interest in machine learning, but clearly the Manitoba contingent that envisioned the initiative were on the ball and maybe ahead of the curve. Machine learning is a \"subset of artificial intelligence, uses mathematical models (algorithms) to identify trends and patterns in data to predict the possibility of future outcomes,\" the initiative's website states. The fact big data and the Internet of Things is starting to pump out massive volumes of data means the application of machine learning is all of a sudden becoming entirely applicable in so many fields. For example, Farmers Edge, the Winnipeg precision agriculture solutions provider, deploys machine learning. In 2013, its operations were collecting data from 575,000 acres. At the end of 2016, it was up to 8.4 million acres from around the world. It expects to double that coverage by the end of 2017. Wade Barnes, founder and CEO of the company, said deploying algorithms now produces three times better outcomes than a couple of years ago. \"Machine learning will be utterly game-changing for agriculture,\" he said. \"In 2013, Farmers Edge was one of the biggest precision ag providers in the world with 575,000 acres, But to use machine learning (then), we can't really tease out the trends... When you are at 8.4 million acres, that is something different.\" The folks in Winnipeg were clearly not the first or the only ones to identify this. But their initiative, which was in the planning stage before the Trudeau government announced its intention to set up an $800-million innovation fund, now seems even more on the ball as groups in Toronto and Montreal have emerged, making a case for federal funding. The initiative is looking for $100 million in funding over five years. The expectation is a funding commitment one way or the other will be made in the Trudeau government's spring budget. \"Canada is a big country,\" said Vince Barletta, president and CEO of Yes! Winnipeg and a member of the initiative's board. \"There are a lot of interesting activities taking place around machine learning in Winnipeg, Toronto, Montreal and other parts of the country. At the end of the day, the government of Canada's innovation fund will place multiple bets. They won't put all their chips on one square on the board... We are highly optimistic one of those investments will be in Winnipeg.\" Ray Bouchard, CEO of Enns Brothers and chairman of the initiative's board, said because Manitoba has such a diversified economy, it could concentrate on development of machine learning applications -- in the agriculture, resource development, construction and manufacturing sectors. With all the big technology companies such as Google, Apple and Amazon ramping up machine learning applications, it's not to say Winnipeg is ahead in that regard, but it does have some smart companies blazing trails in their own fields such as Farmers Edge, Precision Weather Solutions, Sightline Innovation and Invenia. Those companies are all enthusiastic about the prospects of a machine learning centre of excellence in Winnipeg. Suzi Bonk, president and CEO of Precision Weather Solutions, said her company needs to attract researchers, scientists, technologists and all sorts of human resources to the space. \"Doing it at an individual company level is not impossible,\" she said. \"But to do that kind of work... we need institutions and organizations like EMILI that can mobilize the entire ecosystem for that kind of skill set here.\" martin.cash@freepress.mb.ca"}, {"title": "CSX Clean Seed appoints Rush as COO", "article": "Clean Seed Capital Group Ltd (TSX-V:CSX) Shares Issued 44,278,234 Last Close 1/10/2017 $0.32 Tuesday January 10 2017 - News Release Mr. Graeme Lempriere reports CLEAN SEED APPOINTS COLIN RUSH AS CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER Clean Seed Capital Group Ltd. has appointed Colin Rush as its chief operating officer.

Without data, it's impossible to operate any business. And at long last, all of the agriculture industry will have access to the information it needs to flourish. The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission declared in December that broadband Internet access in Canada is now considered a basic telecommunications service for all. The CRTC intends to invest over $750 million to support this initiative; billions more will be required by private industry. In spite of the lack of details contained in the announcement, this is good news for Canadian agriculture and consumers alike. About 82 per cent of Canadian households and businesses now have the high-speed service that the CRTC says is the target. The commission wants 90 per cent of Canadians to have that level of service by 2021 and 100 per cent of us to be connected within 15 years. That will narrow the great rural-urban Internet - and information - divide. This could be one of the CRTC's greatest gift to Canadians. Most Canadians take the Internet for granted. Only when we are disconnected can we really appreciate how important high-speed Internet is to modern living. In remote areas, the Internet can be choppy simply due to high winds. Even precipitation can slow service down to a point where work becomes impossible. The CRTC's focus on broadband Internet access is timely. When Donald Trump's most outlandish Twitter message can move markets in seconds, farmers need real-time information to keep up. Closing distances in the rural world is a challenge and that makes communication critical. Thus the need for a more efficient, reliable network. From holding meetings to sharing data to anticipating the effects of weather - and climate change - access to data underlies almost every business decision. Crop prices and futures are key for farmers. Finally, the Internet of things (the connection of any device with an on and off switch to the Internet and/or to each other) can become a reality for farmers, allowing them to anticipate future events and tasks. Farmers will have access to an impressive amount of environmental and crop performance data, collected by field sensors and cameras, accumulated by human observations, and recorded via smartphone apps. Farmers will be able to analyze data, filter out worthless information and compute personalized crop recommendations. Without proper, affordable bandwidth, all of this can be very painstaking, at best. Farmers are no longer rustic labourers on tractors. They - and their farms - have changed dramatically. Canada loses farms at a yearly rate of seven to nine per cent, and that means agricultural operations have become much larger - and smarter. Precision agriculture manages resources more sustainably, lowering the carbon footprint of farms. Adapting production input based on the needs of each animal allows better use of resources to protect the environment, while improving the sustainability of the food supply. This is already happening. But Canadian farms can become much more efficient, contributing even more meaningfully to global food systems and increasing food sector profitability. Better Internet capacity can only help. Canadian consumers will also gain. Allowing rural Canada to connect with the rest of the world will help urbanites better understand agriculture. This could be the most significant result of the CRTC's decision. As farmers gain access to more data, so will city dwellers. The great rural-urban divide can narrow, allowing citizens from both groups to understand each other better. Over the last century, public discourse about how we support agriculture in Canada has mostly been fuelled by misconceptions and confusion. Data-driven debates can only bring farmers closer to people's kitchen tables. And better connectivity could lead to better agri-food policies. Canada still has almost 200,000 farms, including many hobby farms. Access to broadband Internet service could make small-scale farms more efficient and offer better market access. And that could result in more variety for Canadians looking for locally-grown products. If rural access to broadband Internet service only accomplishes half of what it's capable of, Canada will gain. We can only hope this access is affordable for farmers, because they need - and want - the power that information brings.

(TSX VENTURE:EUO)(OTCQB:EUCTF), a Canadian public company specializing in the acquisition, development and commercialization of innovative test and measurement technologies for the authentication, verification and certification markets, is pleased to announce that its wholly owned subsidiary Xenemetrix Ltd. has successfully completed feasibility and verification of its precision agriculture technology. Commercialization of this leading edge product and service will commence in 2017 under the name Croptimal through a new wholly owned subsidiary of Eurocontrol by the same name. This disruptive agriculture focused technology provides for in-field testing utilizing a mobile and compact laboratory that automatically prepares samples of soil, water and critical parts of the crops and is equipped with integrated multi-spectral spectroscopy and solution electric measurement units for a full range of material analysis of nutrients and contaminates. This new technology also addresses the well-known need in the agricultural environment for high accuracy and fast measurement of N, P and K (Nitrogen, Phosphorous and Potassium) in all their forms. The full cycle of sample collection, preparation, analysis and submission of results is completed in minutes as compared to the 10 day cycle for present test throughputs using traditional laboratories. These innovations dramatically change the prevailing agricultural testing methodology and should allow a marked increase in crop yield with a seamless customer interface. Croptimal will commence commercialization with pilot customers in Israel where the initial focus will be on crops tested during technology verification and then expanded to intensive crops, basic foods and toxic elements. Croptimal will continue the collaboration with Netafim, an Israeli company that is the global leader in drip and micro-irrigation solutions for agriculture productivity, under the Memorandum of Understanding entered into last year to secure cooperation of prospective clients. The Croptimal service will offer farmers and agronomists a full cycle of sample collection, preparation and testing, and will transmit the analysis results together with recommendations to the customers' mobile phones or smart devices. The collected data will be accumulated in a Cloud-based data base for intelligent recommendations and data mining for trends and patterns within the agricultural sector. The data gathered by Croptimal will generate detailed insights, and provide intelligent, actionable and operational information that should increase yields and boost farmer's revenues while minimizing expenses and the chance of crop failure. Croptimal's target market is the individual farmer and supporting agronomist, and the Cloud-based data base is additionally targeted at organizations dealing with regional, national and global food supplies. The Company's goal is to achieve worldwide commercialization within four years and to leverage the global penetration to expand the scope of its service by collecting and analyzing data from additional in-line and off-line sensors. According to Markets and Markets, the Agricultural Testing Market is valued at between $2.4 and $3.0 billion annually. Eurocontrol believes that Croptimal could achieve a substantial market share due to the innovative nature of the technology coupled with the service concept. Doron Reinis, Chief Operating Officer of Eurocontrol, stated, 'The major challenge faced by the agricultural testing market today is lack of basic supporting infrastructure. Croptimal enables in-field, precise, immediately actionable analysis that can reduce expenses, increase yields and boost revenues. The measured data that is combined with GPS coordinates will form a periodical data-set that can be transmitted per a GIS protocol to a Cloud-based repository which when compared to accumulated data will be scrutinized automatically in relation to pre-set and changeable criteria defined per crop by agriculture specialists. Ultimately the collected data, extended and uniquely matched will provide data mining usage of the data-base accumulated in Croptimal's computers.' Dubi Raz, Netafim's Agronomy Director, said, 'The state of the art technology including the analyzer and the sample preparation technology and method developed by the Croptimal team at Xenemetrix, when paired with the Cloud-based database will enable an autonomous irrigation system for Netafim clients, a significant improvement for growers that should also achieve a positive impact on water management.' On future development he added, 'The strategy of Croptimal to develop an IN LINE / Online water analysis system meshes with Netafim's development plans to further improve crop analysis and optimize irrigation / nutrigation recommendations to growers with the aim of assuring sustainable higher yields while protecting the environment.' Bruce Rowlands, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, added, 'With the world population predicted to rise to 9 billion by 2050 and the accompanying increase in food demand being exasperated by urbanization, scarcity of water and fertile land and extreme weather conditions, current world food production needs to increase by 60% and current crop production needs to double. We believe that our Croptimal initiative could be the fertilizer of this evolution.' In other news, the Company announces that the Memorandum of Understanding with DigiFlex Ltd. that was announced on May 16, 2016 has been terminated. Eurocontrol also announces that it has granted 300,000 options to purchase common shares of the Company at $0.17 per common share for a period of five years to Gilles Leraille, a director, in accordance with the Company's stock option plan.

To a large degree, agricultural success these days is reserved for those who have the time and capacity to figure out which technologies will benefit their farms the most and for those who can implement them in the best way possible. In a climate-controlled cab, while listening to the Blue Jays game, a farmer can control a machine approximately the size of a small house with a simple joystick. He or she doesn't need to steer because the machine does that by itself. The farmer has full control over the machine's thousands of moving parts via a touchscreen monitor. Most combines in circulation now are capable of threshing hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of crop per day. They are also capable of processing and displaying a phenomenal amount of information. The farmer knows exactly how many bushels per acre his or her combine is processing. Farming has become a vocation for the detailed, the tech savvy, the geek. From seeding to spraying to harvesting, and all the minute processes in between, farms are relying on machines capable of gathering and processing awe-inspiring amounts of information. A sprayer that increases dosage in areas of a field that are more disease-prone will increase yield potential, increase profits, and allow that plot of land to generate more food. It's called variable-rate technology. And it's only one example of the way farms have evolved into digital playgrounds to grow more food on a finite supply of acres, feeding a hungry market, and offsetting rising land prices. Companies such as Case IH, John Deere, Caterpillar, and many others have invested millions (if not billions) in developing cutting edge technologies previously used in military applications for the agricultural market. In many ways it's a brave new world. And an intimidating one. Robotics will find their way onto farms sooner than you and I think. Technology is advancing at a pace advantageous to those waiting for what's new to become affordable. In 2014, Grainews reported on ag-based technology that involved an advanced drone mapping a farmer's field for specific weeds then sending that data to a fleet of unmanned tractors that would use it to locate and kill specific weeds on the field. When such technologies become accessible to farmers like, say, me, the farmer will be nearly unrecognizable from a generation ago. And while I'm loath to call technological advancements progress without looking at them critically, I do believe that machinery allowing us to be more precise and effective in our use of chemicals is a good thing. In August 2016, Case IH unveiled an unmanned, autonomous, highhorsepower tractor, a first for the industry. Previous attempts at robotic tractors were on smaller machines. The company has expressed its desire to market this technology to farmers. Right now, on my farm, the tractors we use the most steer themselves. Our combine is a constant learning curve. And what we have is old. The return on investment for a farm this size must be high and nearly immediate for us to consider purchasing the kinds of technology the ag industry would consider new. What is accessible and has my undivided attention is the use of drones for basic agronomy. While there are drones available for mapping and some even have the capacity to spray weeds themselves, my interest in them is much more pedestrian: field scouting. To fly a video drone over areas I can't access via truck, tractor or ATV could be a valuable exercise. Last spring, gophers ate a few acres of my then newly planted soybeans. This problem was new to me. I did what I could to mitigate the damage once an agronomist helped me determine what the problem was (it bewildered a lot of people), but the result was a loss of about two acres, which, at last year's yields and prices, equalled a loss of more than $1,000. In the southwest corner of the field, in an area I couldn't get to nor see, gophers kept eating, a problem I only took stock of once combining. Had I scouted that field and that area with an entry-level drone capable of taking video or stills, it would have paid for itself. Toil is still very much a part of any successful farm, but in many ways it's taking a back seat to buttons, switches, programs, and monitors. This means increased precision and less waste. And it means increased food production on a finite amount of land. Next time you see a farmer, thank them, then assume they are handling technologies that put most things in your house to shame."}, {"title": "EUO Eurocontrol to commercialize agriculture tech in 2017", "article": "Eurocontrol Technics Group Inc (TSX-V:EUO) Shares Issued 90,780,238 Last Close 1/6/2017 $0.17 Monday January 09 2017 - News Release Mr. Bruce Rowlands reports EUROCONTROL TO COMMERCIALIZE PRECISION AGRICULTURAL INITIATIVE; BUSINESS TO BE CONDUCTED THROUGH NEW WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY CROPTIMAL Eurocontrol Technics Group Inc.'s wholly owned subsidiary, Xenemetrix Ltd., has successfully completed feasibility and verification of its precision agriculture technology.

These innovations dramatically change the prevailing agricultural testing methodology and should allow a marked increase in crop yield with a seamless customer interface. Croptimal will commence commercialization with pilot customers in Israel where the initial focus will be on crops tested during technology verification, and then expanded to intensive crops, basic foods and toxic elements. Croptimal will continue the collaboration with Netafim, an Israeli company that is the global leader in drip and microirrigation solutions for agriculture productivity, under the memorandum of understanding entered into last year to secure co-operation of prospective clients. The Croptimal service will offer farmers and agronomists a full cycle of sample collection, preparation and testing, and will transmit the analysis results together with recommendations to the customers' mobile phones or smart devices. The collected data will be accumulated in a cloud-based database for intelligent recommendations and data mining for trends and patterns within the agricultural sector. The data gathered by Croptimal will generate detailed insights, and provide intelligent, actionable and operational information that should increase yields and boost farmer's revenues, while minimizing expenses and the chance of crop failure. Croptimal's target market is the individual farmer and supporting agronomist, and the cloud-based database is additionally targeted at organizations dealing with regional, national and global food supplies. The company's goal is to achieve worldwide commercialization within four years and to leverage the global penetration to expand the scope of its service by collecting and analyzing data from additional in-line and off-line sensors. According to Markets and Markets, the agricultural testing market is valued at between $2.4-billion and $3-billion annually. Eurocontrol believes that Croptimal could achieve a substantial market share due to the innovative nature of the technology, coupled with the service concept. Doron Reinis, chief operating officer of Eurocontrol, stated: \"The major challenge faced by the agricultural testing market today is lack of basic supporting infrastructure. Croptimal enables infield, precise, immediately actionable analysis that can reduce expenses, increase yields and boost revenues. The measured data that is combined with GPS co-ordinates will form a periodical data set that can be transmitted per a GIS protocol to a cloud-based repository, which, when compared to accumulated data, will be scrutinized automatically in relation to preset and changeable criteria defined per crop by agriculture specialists. Ultimately, the collected data, extended and uniquely matched, will provide data mining usage of the database accumulated in Croptimal's computers.\" Dubi Raz, Netafim's agronomy director, said, \"The state-of-the-art technology, including the analyzer and the sample preparation technology, and method developed by the Croptimal team at Xenemetrix, when paired with the cloud-based database, will enable an autonomous irrigation system for Netafim clients, a significant improvement for growers that should also achieve a positive impact on water management.\" On future development, he added, \"The strategy of Croptimal to develop an in-line/on-line water analysis system meshes with Netafim's development plans to further improve crop analysis and optimize irrigation/nutrigation recommendations to growers with the aim of assuring sustainable higher yields, while protecting the environment.\" Bruce Rowlands, chairman and chief executive officer, added: \"With the world population predicted to rise to nine billion by 2050, and the accompanying increase in food demand being exasperated by urbanization, scarcity of water and fertile land, and extreme weather conditions, current world food production needs to increase by 60 per cent, and current crop production needs to double. We believe that our Croptimal initiative could be the fertilizer of this evolution.\" In other news, the company announces that the memorandum of understanding with DigiFlex Ltd. that was announced on May 16, 2016, has been terminated. Eurocontrol also announces that it has granted 300,000 options to purchase common shares of the company at 17 cents per common share for a period of five years to Gilles Leraille, a director, in accordance with the company's stock option plan.

At the end of 2016, Canadian agriculture received the news it had long been waiting for: The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission declared that broadband Internet access in Canada is now considered a basic telecommunication service for all. The CRTC intends to invest more than $750 million to support this initiative. In spite of the lack of details in the announcement, in terms of future costs for Canadians and businesses, it spells good news for Canadian agriculture and consumers alike. You need to experience a complete sense of disconnectedness only once to really appreciate how important high-speed Internet is to modern living. In remote areas, the Internet can get choppy, simply due to high winds. Even precipitation can slow the Internet down to a point where work becomes impossible. The CRTC's focus on broadband Internet access comes at the right time. In agriculture, things will get much more interesting, as getting sound data in real time will play a significant part in most farming businesses. In an era in which Donald Trump's most outlandish message on Twitter can move markets in seconds, farmers need the proper information tools to keep up. Rural reality, of course, makes closing distances a challenge, which in turn makes communication critical. Therefore, the need for better and more efficient communication through a reliable network becomes obvious. For meetings, sharing data and most important, for anticipating unpredictable effects such as climate change, access to data underlies almost every business decision. With devices such as wireless sensor networks, network-connected weather stations, high-tech cameras and smartphones, farmers can obtain an impressive amount of environmental and crop-performance data, collected by field sensors and cameras, and accumulated by human observations, which have been recorded via smartphone applications. Farmers can analyze the data they have, filter out worthless data and compute personalized crop recommendations for any specific farm and commodities. But without proper, affordable bandwidth, all of this can be at best a painstaking process. Farmers are no longer rustic labourers on tractors. If you have not been to a farm recently, you should know that things have changed. Given that Canada is losing farms at a yearly rate of seven per cent to nine per cent, agricultural operations have become larger and smarter, as well. With precision agriculture, resources are managed more sustainably, which lowers the carbon footprint of farms. Adapting production input based on localized needs for each individual animal allows better use of resources to maintain the quality of the environment, while improving the sustainability of the food supply. This is what is happening already. What is not happening enough, however, is any systematic attempt to appreciate how more-efficient Canadian farms could contribute meaningfully to global food supplies, and increase profitability for the sector. Better Internet capacity can only help in this regard. Canadian consumers will also gain on many levels. First off, allowing rural Canada to connect with the rest of the world would help urbanites better understand agriculture. This could be the most significant contribution from the CRTC's decision. Over the past century or so, public discourse about how we support agriculture in Canada has been fuelled too much by misconceptions and confusion. Data-driven debates can only bring farmers closer to people's kitchen tables. Better virtual connectivity could potentially lead to better agrifood policies in Canada. What is more, Canada has almost 200,000 farms, many of which are still hobby farms. With access to broadband Internet service, it could become possible to operate small-scale farms more efficiently, thanks to better market access and perhaps in turn creating more variety for Canadians looking for locally grown products. One day, expectations in grocery stores and in restaurants could be more aligned with how limiting agriculture can be at times. This might be a pipe dream, but if access to broadband Internet service can accomplish only half of what it is capable of, Canada will gain. We can only hope this access is affordable for farmers to use. Sylvain Charlebois is a professor of food distribution and policy at Dalhousie University in Halifax.

We're not there yet, but a recent announcement by the CRTC declaring broadband Internet access a \"basic telecommunications service all Canadians are entitled to receive,\" and setting certain targets for download and upload speeds, is a step in the right direction, according to local industry stakeholders. \"I absolutely believe that making broadband a requirement to deliver, as a necessity, is certainly the right move to make,\" said Ken Naylor, general manager at Morningt onCommunications. The Milverton-based telecommunications co-operative is one of the local players working to expand highspeed Internet services in Perth County. Compared to some of its neighbours, we're in decent shape here already, suggested Naylor. \"I think Perth County is actually a little stronger when it comes connectivity,\" he said, pointing out that smaller towns and hamlets like Monkton and Atwood have had ultra-fast fibre optic connections for a few years now, even before some larger communities in the region. In fact, most of the builtup areas in the county have high-speed Internet access. Some of them approach or even exceed the 50-megabit download and 10-megabit upload targets identified by the CRTC. Some are several times faster than that benchmark. Quadro Communications, another independent telecommunications co-operative serving Perth County, actually offers a gigabit Internet service to its customers, with a fibre connection that provides speeds of up to one gigabit (1,000 megabit) per second for downloads and 100 megabits per second uploads. Not all properties in Perth County have access to the Internet speeds recommended by the CRTC, though. \"Rural farms, that's where there's still a lot of work to be done,\" said Naylor. \"There's literally hundreds of kilometres of fibre that needs to be laid to have those customers connected.\" Running a fibre optic cable down a long rural road to reach a handful of farms is an expensive undertaking, with a much longer payback period compared to a more densely populated urban area. And not all farm owners even want to connect. \"So the business cases are very difficult to make work when you look at those things,\" said Naylor. \"And that's where we need the support.\" In some places, the fibre backbone is in place, but the so-called \"last-mile\" connection to the home or business is the link that needs to be completed. \"Perth County itself is in pretty good shape,\" said Quadro general manager John DeHeer. \"But that doesn't mean we don't need the money to finish it off.\" There are a few wells from which local Internet service providers can potentially draw to help connect rural residents. The federal government recently announced it is investing $500 million to bring high-speed broadband access to rural and remote communities through its Connect to Innovate program. And as part of the CRTC announcement, the regulator said major telecommunication companies will be asked to contribute to a $750-million fund that will be used to help expand broadband services to underserved areas. Closer to home, the SouthWestern Integrated Fibre Technology (SWIFT) initiative is also working to provide an ultra high-speed fibre optic network covering all of western Ontario. SWIFT has asked for a commitment from Perth County of $569,484 ($113,897 per year for five years) for its contribution to the network. The issue was discussed at the Dec. 23 county council meeting, and will come up again through the budget process. In the meantime, councillors endorsed a research project by Mornington and Quadro, with the help of county staff, to identify specific gaps in local broadband infrastructure. That information will help council decide how and where to invest in local connectivity. County chief administrative officer Renato Pullia said councillors may consider supporting SWIFT for improvements to the broadband backbone, supporting local telecommunications companies for the last-mile connections, or some combination of both. And while there's some debate over the best strategy for providing high-speed Internet access to rural residents here, everyone seems to agree that it's needed. \"It's so extremely important,\" said Meredith Forget, Perth County's economic development co-ordinator. It's a necessity not only for rural-based businesses, she said, but also for precision agriculture, and farms that rely on a fast and stable Internet connection to analyze, process, monitor, track and transmit large amounts of data on things like soil conditions and crops. \"The way agriculture is going these days, we absolutely need broadband connectivity,\" said Forget."}, {"title": "Agrium to present at 2017 AltaCorp Capital Institutional Investor Conference", "article": "Release date - 30122016 CALGARY, AB - Agrium Inc.

From farm to fork, food is responsible for about 25 per cent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. And every decision consumers make when selecting food impacts the environment. Many want to do something about it. In Canada, the federal government has decided that means a tax on carbon emissions. The program starts in 2018 with a $10-per-tonne carbon price plan and ramps up to $50-a-tonne by 2022. Many have pointed out that energy costs will rise because of a carbon tax. But little attention has been given to what will happen to food costs. However, the carbon file is filled with food economic nuances. Canadian grocers are likely to continue sourcing affordable food. But Canadian goods saddled with a carbon tax may become much less attractive from a price perspective. This would encourage grocers to import more foods, regardless of the state of our loonie. It's a trend we've seen over the last few years. And importers will likely seek to buy products from regions where carbon performances are less established, raising new environmental concerns. Taxing carbon shouldn't make more Canadians food insecure - the issue is more about food sovereignty for certain sectors. The timing of these changes is not great. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's carbon tax announcement came just weeks before the U.S. election. Now that we know who the next White House tenant is, the carbon tax's implications for the Canadian agriculture and food sector is even more worrisome. With Donald Trump at the helm, the U.S. is likely to remain idle on climate change and that will make our agrifood systems much less competitive. Coupled with a possible reduction in U.S. corporate tax rates, a carbon tax on our agrifood companies could isolate Canada as the only green-focused economy in North America. To make matters worse, our food economy remains vulnerable to currency fluctuations. When the loonie tanks, food prices go up. The emergence of many new greenhouse projects, particularly in Ontario, means the Canadian market should be much less susceptible to abrupt retail price fluctuations. But a price on carbon could slow this trend. Working to protect the environment only makes sense. But we need to move forward with great caution. To give market currency to carbon is a necessary step towards a more sustainable food system, but our policies must reflect the global reality. The aggressive carbon campaign could inspire companies to leave, harming our economy. More than 150 food processing firms have closed or left Canada since 2008, affecting almost 30,000 jobs. Recently, the Mondelez plant in Montreal eliminated more than 400 jobs. A carbon tax will clearly discriminate against certain agricultural sectors. A recent European Union study says a carbon tax would increase prices between 15 and 40 per cent at the farmgate for the most greenhouse-gas-intensive foods, such as beef, lamb and dairy products. As prices rise, consumption could fall by as much as 15 per cent for some products, impacting major economic sectors. However, the same study says health gains could be made, since some of these products are unhealthy if not consumed in moderation. Unlike the cap-and-trade carbon solution, a tax provides certainty on how carbon is priced. But the emissions reductions are difficult to predict. British Columbia's carbon tax, introduced in 2008, has shown mixed results. However, a tax is the most effective instrument the federal government can use to entice provinces to act. Provinces where agriculture is a significant part of the economy could opt for cap-and-trade, which would guarantee emission reductions and reward good stewardship. For example, with no-till farming, precision agriculture and better equipment, Saskatchewan annually sequesters about nine million tonnes in carbon. At $50 a tonne, that sequestered carbon would have a value of more than $450 million. So a hybrid approach could be substantially more powerful. Canadian food consumption trends are mostly environmentally unsustainable. Doing nothing is not an option. But given that we live in a borderless world, Ottawa must recognize that not everyone on Earth wants to save the planet - even one bite at a time.

Patent Issued for Particulate Material Delivery System (USPTO 9516805)", "article": "2016 DEC 26 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Journal of Engineering -- According to news reporting originating from Alexandria, Virginia, by VerticalNews journalists, a patent by the inventors Henry, James W. (Saskatoon, CA); Stuart, Graham D. (Saskatoon, CA); Wolowski, Evan J. B. (Saskatoon, CA); Petruic, Matthew G. (Saskatoon, CA), filed on July 17, 2015, was published online on December 13, 2016. The assignee for this patent, patent number 9516805, is CNH Industrial Canada, Ltd. (Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, CA). Reporters obtained the following quote from the background information supplied by the inventors: \"Modern large acreage seeding implements pneumatically deliver seed, fertilizer, and/or other product to fields. An example is an air cart and an air drill that are pulled together behind a tractor to deliver product. Different seeding styles can be implemented by using different openers on the air drills. Knife, ribbon band, ribbon band sweep, double-shoot, and disk openers can be used for different seeding styles that can open correspondingly different styles of furrows to receive the seed. The air cart pneumatically conveys seed to the air drill for delivery into the furrow(s). Air carts include one or more storage compartments that hold product(s), each of which has an associated metering box. The metering box divides product(s) from the associated storage compartment(s) into equal sections for delivery of equal product volumes. The equally divided product(s) is entrained in an airflow established by a fan and delivered through manifolds and distribution lines that direct the product from the air cart, to the air drill, and to the field being planted with seed.\" In addition to obtaining background information on this patent, VerticalNews editors also obtained the inventors' summary information for this patent: \"The present invention is directed to a particulate material delivery system that allows for variable rate sectional control while delivering particulate material to an agricultural field. The system may be incorporated with air carts and air drills, and that includes a metering system having multiple metering units that are independently controllable. This may allow for individual controlling product delivery rates through metering units so as to independently control the delivery rate(s) to each of multiple secondary distribution headers or manifolds, which may allow for sectional control of product delivery from the air drill. \"According to one aspect of the present invention, a particulate material delivery system is provided that may include an air cart and a planter that are towable behind a tractor. A metering system of the particulate material delivery system receives a product from the air cart and delivers the product to the planter for distribution to the ground, such as an agricultural field. The metering system may include multiple metering units that receive separate portions of the product from the air cart. Multiple prime movers may drive the multiple metering units. A controller is connected to and individually controls the multiple prime movers such that distribution rates of the multiple metering units can be varied independently of each other. The multiple prime movers may be electric motors. \"According to another aspect, each of the multiple metering units may include a metering roller, and a shaft that supports and rotates the metering roller. The electric motors may directly drive ends of the shafts that support the metering roller. \"According to another aspect, each of the multiple metering units may include a metering roller having an external gear at an outer circumferential surface thereof. Each electric motor may directly drive the external gear of a respective metering roller. \"According to another aspect, each of the multiple metering units may include a metering roller having an internal gear at an inner circumferential surface thereof. Each electric motor may directly drive the internal gear of a respective metering roller. \"According to another aspect, an airflow characteristic of an airflow that entrains the product may be controlled based on a delivery rate of at least one of the multiple metering units for pneumatically conveying product from the multiple metering units toward multiple opener units of the drill. The delivery rate of the product to multiple locations of the agricultural field may be individually controlled by controlling the delivery rate of product through each of the multiple metering units and controlling the airflow characteristic. This may allow for providing a particulate material delivery system that provides delivery consistency and control without requiring singulation-type equipment such as row-unit planters, which may provide a relatively simple and cost-effective air-seeder-type particulate material delivery system with a high amount of delivery accuracy. This may allow for delivery rate variability at secondary headers or manifolds of a single drill which allows for site specific precision farming. This may also allow for relatively more application precision by way of variable rate sectional control of a drill as compared to typical drills that each typically allows for delivery rate variability of only the whole drill. \"Other aspects, objects, features, and advantages of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description and accompanying drawings. It should be understood, however, that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating preferred embodiments of the present invention, are given by way of illustration and not of limitation. Many changes and modifications may be made within the scope of the present invention without departing from the spirit thereof, and the invention includes all such modifications.\" Keywords for this news article include: Agricultural, CNH Industrial Canada Ltd.

To make matters worse, our food economy remains vulnerable to currency fluctuations. When our loonie tanks, food prices go up. However, we have seen new greenhouse projects emerge recently, particularly in Ontario, potentially making the Canadian market less susceptible to price fluctuations. A price on carbon might thwart these initiatives. Protecting the environment makes sense, but we need to move forward with great caution. To give market currency to carbon is a necessary step toward a more sustainable food system, but our policies must capture global reality. Due to the aggressive campaign on carbon here, firms could relocate, to the detriment of our economy. We have seen more than 150 food-processing firms close or relocate since 2008 in Canada, costing almost 30,000 jobs. A carbon tax will clearly discriminate against certain agricultural sectors. According to a recent EU study, a carbon tax would increase prices from 15 to 40 per cent for beef, lamb and dairy products. Thus, consumption of some products could conceivably Unlike the cap-and-trade solution, a carbon tax provides certainty on how carbon is priced, but the amount of emissions reductions is always difficult to predict. Mixed results from B.C.'s carbon tax since its inception in 2008 is one example. And who knows what could happen to funds directed to what some consider as the Ottawa budgetary black hole. However, it is the most effective instrument the federal government can use to entice provinces to act. Agriculture-dependent provinces could opt for a cap-and-trade scheme, which would guarantee emission reduction and reward good stewardship. For example, with no-till farming, precision agriculture and better equipment, Saskatchewan annually sequesters about nine million tonnes of carbon. At $50 a tonne, which is the federal carbon price set for 2022, that sequestered carbon would have a value of more than $450 million. Beyond just taxing carbon, a hybrid approach could be substantially more powerful. In the grand scheme of things, it boils down to one thing: Our current food consumption trends in Canada are, for the most part, environmentally unsustainable. The price we pay at the grocery store does not reflect the true cost of food production and distribution. We all know that. So doing nothing is no longer an option and most would recognize that the writing is on the wall. However, given that we live in a borderless world, Ottawa should also recognize that not everyone on Earth wants to save the planet.

From farm to fork, our food is responsible for around 25 per cent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. This is much higher than what most people would think. Whether we realize it or not, every decision a consumer makes when picking what to eat has an impact on our environment, and many want to do something about it. The federal government recently mandated a tax on carbon emissions. A mandatory tax of $10 a tonne is set to start in 2018 and provinces are expected to produce their own plans. While energy prices are expected to rise, the impact on food costs has garnered scant attention. Grocers will likely continue to seek affordable foods for their customer. The concern, of course, is that Canadian goods with a carbon tax may become much less attractive from a price perspective. This would encourage grocers to import more foods, regardless of the dollar's value, a trend we have seen over the past few years. While food prices will likely increase over the next few years, carbon taxes will hardly be to blame since importers have choices about where they buy their products. A tax on carbon won't make more Canadians food insecure - the issue is more about food sovereignty for certain sectors. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's announcement about a carbon tax occurred weeks before a new U.S. administration. With Donald Trump ascending to the White House, the timing of the carbon deal is worrisome for the Canadian agriculture and food sector. Under Mr. Trump, the United States is likely to remain idle on policies to mitigate climate change. This would make our agrifood systems much less competitive.

Among the proposed drivers to spur economic growth is the agriculture and food-processing sector, an unlikely yet important powerhouse that employs one in eight Canadians. Canada is the fifth-largest agricultural exporter in the world, and the sector is undergoing a technological revolution, from the use of drones and satellites that monitor soil moisture and indicate optimum planting times to smart machinery and transportation networks to make and distribute food products. Canada's Dominic Barton, chair of the Canadian Minister of Finance's Advisory Council on Economic Growth, thinks that this kind of innovation in agriculture and food - combined with new free-trade agreements with hungry markets such as China - will help Canada find its next niche in the global economy. The council's first recommendations in October dealt with setting up an infrastructure bank, increasing immigration levels by 50 per cent, and spurring foreign direct investment in Canada. Mr. Barton, who is global managing partner of McKinsey & Co. in London, says the council is now working on its second, and likely final, wave of recommendations, focused on innovation, skills and particular growth sectors for Canada. He expects they will be released by the end of the year. What are the major concerns about Canada's growth and productivity that you're trying to address? What we're most worried about is the long term. If you look out 10 to 20 years, because of demographics and the aging population, we're one of the fastest-aging OECD countries on the planet. We will see our GDP growth rate literally halved, just because we'll have fewer workers in the market. We've enjoyed about a 3.1-per-cent growth rate in the past 50 years; we think that will literally be cut in half. The good news is that we've got a lot of things that we can do to unlock more growth. But if we sit back and do nothing, it would be a pretty ugly picture. What can we unlock? There's a range of things we can do. One of the reasons we picked infrastructure is because it is one of the most powerful ways of improving GDP growth and inclusive growth rates. Innovation is another one, because with all of the changes going on in technology, in particular, but also in biotech, it's probably going to be the most rapid source of good service jobs. Canadian universities and researchers are world-class in invention, but we're not as good as we could be in scaling up those inventions into commercial companies. And then we have sectors where we have some inherent strengths and really good niches where we could get much more growth. What are these sectors and niches? We're picking one in particular, which is agriculture and food, because it can employ a lot of people, there's a lot of innovation technology around it and huge demand. Also Canada is well-positioned. In health care, we have one of the biggest, most comprehensive databases on health in the world, but we're not leveraging that to figure out what we could do to innovate health-care delivery. There's also natural resources and fintech. There's tourism, where there's 400 million Chinese tourist trips going on a year and we don't capture much of that share. And then there's free-trade agreements. We're very keen on free-trade agreements. Why are agriculture and agrifood so important? There's going to be a massive demand for food, for protein, over the next 10 to 20 years. It's also a big employment provider, and we could generate even more employment - and high-skilled employment - because of technology. What are the big markets for agriculture and agrifood? We're going to have about 2.4 billion new middle-class consumers in the world in the next 15 years, and they want to live and eat like we do. Of that 2.4 billion people, at least 1.8 billion will be in Asia. China, India and Indonesia, those are the big three. It's urbanization that's driving this, that's why you see a lot of these countries actually buying land in places like Ethiopia, because food security is critical. How much do you see demand increasing? How can Canada capitalize? Food demand is going to go up by at least 50 to 70 per cent in the next 30 years. The Canadian brand on food is good - we're well positioned. I'm very excited by that opportunity. Again it's protein, and it's primarily Asia, that's why we need more free-trade agreements there. Australia is doing very well on that front; they have a free-trade agreement with China. That's to our disadvantage. We need to get one. You also mention that our farming can be more high-tech. Canada has already done a lot of innovation in agriculture and food. It's a natural area for us. Most people think ag-food is a backward area, an industry that you want to move from. I actually don't think it's that way at all. How can technological expertise improve agriculture production? There's precision agriculture, where you use big data, where you know how much water and how much fertilizer per square metre you should put into the ground, to use resources more effectively and efficiently. And genomics researchers in Canada have done good work in developing a variety of soybeans, which normally need more temperate conditions, to grow on the Prairies. With pulse products there have been good innovations in Saskatchewan in particular. With the demand from Asia for protein, this particularly means soy and pulse products. I think we've got a really good base. What are the challenges ahead for your growth plan? We're not a big enough country to do everything, so the notion of niches is important. We've got to focus, and by focusing that means you're making choices. A lot of people have their own ideas of what is important; that's where the challenge comes in. How do we meet that challenge and see results? It will take a lot of political courage to drive it. It takes deliberate action, it won't just naturally happen. A combination of government and the private sector is needed to push it. It takes muscle, if you will. Otherwise we can't do it.

According to news reporting originating in Truro, Canada, by VerticalNews journalists, research stated, \"The wild blueberry industry is spending over $80 million CAD per year on agrochemicals for 93 000 ha under production in North America. A pressing need to reduce agro-chemical usage and production cost has resulted in the development of a smart sprayer for spot-application of agrochemicals in wild blueberry fields.\" Funders for this research include Doug Bragg Enterprises, Oxford Frozen Foods, Wild Blueberry Producers Association of Nova Scotia, National science and Engineering Research Council of Canada. The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Dalhousie University, \"This paper encompasses the economic analysis to determine the potential savings for spot-applications of agrochemicals using a smart sprayer. The economic analysis compared the smart sprayer with two other commercially available sprayers (basic and swath control). The swath control sprayer and smart sprayer both featured GPS auto-steer and boom section control to reduce over-spray in already applied areas based on GPS position. The basic sprayer used a foam marker for guidance with no swath control management. The smart sprayer featured a machine vision system that automatically detected target areas in the field further reducing agrochemical input by shutting individual nozzles off in non-target areas in the field. The cost analysis was performed to compare the different features of the sprayer technologies, i.e., base sprayer, additional technology, training, usage, repair and maintenance. The additional components installed on the smart sprayer were justified in terms of agrochemicals/water savings via spot-applications, tractor fuel and operator's time. The application total cost was $2052 ha(-1) using the basic sprayer, $1799 ha(-1) using the swath control sprayer, and $1138 ha(-1) using the smart sprayer over a 2 year production cycle of the selected fields that were used in this study. The payback period ranged from 2.0 years (60 ha field size) to 9.8 years (20 ha field size) using the swath control sprayer. The payback period ranged from 11 months (60 ha field size) to 3.5 years (20 ha field size) when using the smart sprayer.\" According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Results revealed that the smart sprayer had significant advantage from both an environmental and economic perspective over the other two sprayers.\" Our news correspondents report that additional information may be obtained by contacting Q.

According to news originating from Vancouver, Canada, by VerticalNews correspondents, research stated, \"In this paper, we propose a received signal strength indication-based distributed Bayesian localization algorithm based on message passing to solve the approximate inference problem. The algorithm is designed for precision agriculture applications, such as pest management and pH sensing in large farms, where greater power efficiency besides communication and computational scalability is needed but location accuracy requirements are less demanding.\" Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the University of British Columbia, \"Communication overhead, which is a key limitation of popular non-Bayesian and Bayesian distributed techniques, is avoided by a message passing schedule, in which outgoing message by each node does not depend on the destination node, and therefore is a fixed size. Fast convergence is achieved by: 1) eliminating the setup phase linked with spanning tree construction, which is frequent in belief propagation schemes and 2) the parallel nature of the updates, since no message needs to be exchanged among nodes during each update, which is called the coupled variables phenomenon in non-Bayesian techniques and accounts for a significant amount of communication overhead.\" According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"These features make the proposed algorithm highly compatible with realistic wireless sensor network (WSN) deployments, e.g., ZigBee, that are based upon the ad hoc ondemand distance vector, where route request and route reply packets are flooded in the network during route discovery phase.\" The news correspondents report that additional information may be obtained from P.

The Edmonton-based engineering and planning company, which bought its first drone three years ago, recently boosted the total to 10 from four when it added new Skycatch equipment, unmanned aerial system operations manager Kevin Grover said Tuesday. The devices, based in eight Canadian and U.S. Stantec offices, will mainly be used for survey mapping, but Grover said staff are looking at how else they can be profitably used. One area is inspecting bridges, dams and other infrastructure, which can probably be done more quickly and safely from the air than by setting up the machinery needed to put a team of workers on the site, he said. \"Instead of a bridge inspector hanging off the Hoover Dam, maybe it makes more sense to have a drone and not put anyone in harm's way.\" It might also be worthwhile flying the small helicopter-like machines over agricultural land to look for pests, poor soil conditions and other farm problems, he said. \"There's a lot of money wasted over-fertilizing or under-watering areas, and crops not being as healthy as they should be. Using aerial sensing ... they can start plugging this (information) into precision farming equipment.\" As well, Grover sees potential for faster, cheaper inspection of construction projects, providing regular up-to-date 3-D images that indicate how work is progressing and showing contractors site features that allow them to do better planning. Drones might also reduce the field work needed for archeology studies typically done before development starts in sensitive areas. Instead of staff walking in a grid to look for artifacts or other historic material, they can be in the office analyzing thermal images and other data that shows what the human eye can't always see, Grover said. Stantec intends within a few months to have about 15 pilots trained to fly drones, which are subject to strict regulatory, insurance and safety rules and run by many companies in the industry. Although the Skycatch systems cost less than $10,000 each, he said it's important to determine where they make business sense rather than rushing out to buy one for every possible application, especially with the technology's rapid evolution. \"We want to be strategic about where and how fast we advance with it ... We don't want to spend a whole bunch of money and find in six months it might not be the best solution.\" gkent@postmedia.com( mailto:gkent@postmedia.com )"}, {"title": "Farmers Edge; Farmers Edge and Blair's Family of Companies Partner to Help Saskatchewan Growers Boost ROI with Decision-Support Data", "article": "2016 NOV 15 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Information Technology Newsweekly -- Farmers Edge(TM), a global leader in precision agriculture and independent data management solutions, announced that it has partnered with Blair's Family of Companies, a regional provider of innovative crop and livestock solutions.

As previously announced, shareholders of both companies overwhelmingly voted to approve the proposed merger of equals. The companies have made good progress with respect to making all required regulatory filings and as expected, have received a supplemental information request from the Canadian Competition Bureau and a second request from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission on November 2, 2016. Agrium and PotashCorp are working through the regulatory process as planned and continue to expect the transaction to close mid-2017, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals. About Agrium About PotashCorp PotashCorp is the world's largest crop nutrient company and plays an integral role in global food production. The company produces the three essential nutrients required to help farmers grow healthier, more abundant crops.

Winnipeg-based Precision Weather Solutions introduced the new product, called WxAgrios (Wx stands for weather) at a recent John Deere dealer conference in Kansas City, Mo. Suzi Bonk, CEO of Winnipeg-based Precision Weather Solutions, said it is an exciting proposition for her company to be able to be connected to a global player such as John Deere. \"We expect it will have a significant impact on our growth,\" Bonk said. \"John Deere is a huge company, and this will be available worldwide.\" Specifically, WxAgrios can layer on predictive weather-forecasting and soil-moisture and temperature data with both John Deere Operations Center and John Deere Field Connect, two separate information technology platforms John Deere equipment users can subscribe to. It will allow growers to better manage all of their field operations by factoring in real-time weather data and forecasting models with their seeding, spraying and harvesting activities. Before WxAgrios, the two John Deere systems did not interact with each other, and in fact, PWS is the first company with an application that can integrate data from both systems, effectively creating a precision farming application for John Deere dealers to promote. Ray Bouchard, the CEO of Enns Brothers, owners of one of the largest John Deere dealership organizations in the country with eight dealerships, said it's an important new tool for its total-field-solution offering. \"The inclusion of predictive weather modelling, from my perspective, is going to be absolutely key to the future of precision agriculture.\" Bouchard said. WxAgrios customers who subscribe to the John Deere Operations Center can analyze current and forecast weather information alongside their field, crop and weather information. They will be able to access weather data from Deere's own weather stations or other approved weather stations including PWS's own equipment. \"We have a wide range of agronomic models that growers can select from depending on what they are growing,\" she said. Bonk founded PWS in 2013 with veteran meteorologist Guy Ash. The company has designed and installs and maintains its own weather stations that can deliver advanced predictive models and customizable prescriptive tools. Through its first two years of operation, it installed about 800 of its own stations but for competitive reasons does not publicly disclose current installations. Bonk said PWS ingests data from about 28,000 weather stations, including its own equipment as well as federal, provincial and municipal stations across Canada and the U.S. \"The neat part of this is they (PWS) have come up a with a way they can pull in data from existing Deere Field Connect systems and also integrate their own and other weather stations,\" said Bouchard. Older John Deere equipment still on the field may not be able to collect and stream data seamlessly, but the convergence of equipment technology and crop science is only a couple of years old. Bouchard believes in five to 10 years about 95 per cent of production agriculture will be utilizing this type of technology. Bouchard believes adding predictive weather modelling to John Deere's precision agriculture offering will \"allow growers to make better business decisions that are going to lead to increased productivity in a more environmentally sustainable manner.\" John Deere has its own weather stations, but Bonk said PWS will be able to leverage its association with the global agri-industry heavyweight and potentially access additional customers for its own weather stations. \"Your ability to gauge how fast you will grow with a relationship like this with John Deere is virtually impossible,\" said Bonk. martin.cash@freepress.mb.ca"}, {"title": "AJX AgJunction loses $14.35-million (U.S.) in Q3", "article": "AgJunction Inc (TSX:AJX) Shares Issued 124,163,674 Last Close 11/9/2016 $0.58 Wednesday November 09 2016 - News Release Mr. Dave Vaughn reports AGJUNCTION REPORTS THIRD QUARTER 2016 EARNINGS RESULTS AgJunction Inc. has released its financial results for the third quarter ended Sept. 30, 2016. During the fourth quarter of 2015, AgJunction successfully completed a merger with Novariant Inc., strengthening its position within the OEM (original equipment manufacturer) precision-guidance and machine-control markets. AgJunction's consolidated third quarter 2016 results are presented as a combined entity. However, the comparative third quarter ended Sept. 30, 2015, does not include Novariant's operations. \"As indicated in our third quarter preannouncement, overall weakness in the agriculture market continued into the third quarter, impacting our sales more than expected,\" said Dave Vaughn, president and chief executive officer of AgJunction. \"However, we continued our focus on best servicing our customers in today's environment and the advancement of our Novariant integration, all while strengthening our cash position. \"Looking ahead, our efforts will focus on effective balance sheet management and opportunistically growing our customer base through the downturn so that we are even better positioned for growth when the industry strengthens.\" Third quarter 2016 financial results Total sales in the third quarter decreased 12 per cent to $6.7-million, compared with $7.6-million in the third quarter of 2015. The decrease was primarily driven by prolonged softening in the agriculture market. Gross profit in the third quarter was $2.2-million, compared with $3.3-million in the third quarter of 2015. Gross margin was 32.9 per cent, compared with 43.6 per cent in the third quarter of 2015. The decrease was primarily due to higher warranty and material costs, which drove gross margin down by 200 basis points and 500 basis points, respectively. In addition, gross margin was reduced by 300 basis points due to the absorption of fixed costs over lower sales volumes. Total operating expenses were $5.3-million, compared with $4.1-million for the third quarter of 2015. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses were 79.1 per cent, compared with 54.1 per cent in the third quarter of 2015. The increase is primarily attributable to incremental expenses associated with the acquisition of Novariant. The company recorded $11.3-million of goodwill impairment in the quarter. This impairment was recorded after an analysis of the goodwill's value in use. Current agriculture market conditions and reduced third quarter results have caused management to re-evaluate assumptions in the financial model for goodwill's value-in-use determination, resulting in an impairment. Net loss including the goodwill charge in the third quarter of 2016 was $14.4-million, or 12 cents per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $800,000, or one cent per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2015. EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) was ($2.6-million), compared with ($500,000) in the third quarter of 2015. The decline was primarily driven by the sales levels and incremental operating expenses discussed above. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the third quarter totalled $15.3-million, an 18-per-cent increase compared with $13.0-million at the end of 2015. The company continues to carry no debt. Working capital was $24.6-million, down slightly from $26.7-million at the end of 2015.

Such participants include: the president and CEO; the senior vice-president of global sales and customer care; and the senior vice-president of global operations.

(TSX: AJX) (\"AgJunction\" or the \"Company\"), a leader in automated steering and machine control technology for precision agriculture, reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2016. During the fourth quarter of 2015, AgJunction successfully completed a merger with Novariant, Inc., strengthening its position within the OEM precision guidance and machine control markets. AgJunction's consolidated third quarter 2016 results are presented as a combined entity. However, the comparative third quarter ended September 30, 2015 does not include Novariant's operations. \"As indicated in our third quarter pre-announcement, overall weakness in the agriculture market continued into the third quarter, impacting our sales more than expected,\" said Dave Vaughn, president and CEO of AgJunction. \"However, we continued our focus on best servicing our customers in today's environment and the advancement of our Novariant integration, all while strengthening our cash position. \"Looking ahead, our efforts will focus on effective balance sheet management and opportunistically growing our customer base through the downturn so that we are even better positioned for growth when the industry strengthens.\" Third Quarter 2016 Financial Results Total sales in the third quarter decreased 12% to $6.7 million compared to $7.6 million in the third quarter of 2015. The decrease was primarily driven by prolonged softening in the agriculture market. Gross profit in the third quarter was $2.2 million compared to $3.3 million in the third quarter of 2015. Gross margin was 32.9% compared to 43.6% in the third quarter of 2015. The decrease was primarily due to higher warranty and material costs which drove gross margin down by 200 basis points and 500 basis points, respectively. In addition, gross margin was reduced by 300 basis points due to the absorption of fixed costs over lower sales volumes. Total operating expenses were $5.3 million compared to $4.1 million for the third quarter of 2015. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses were 79.1% compared to 54.1% in the third quarter of 2015. The increase is primarily attributable to incremental expenses associated with the acquisition of Novariant. The Company recorded $11.3 million of goodwill impairment in the quarter. This impairment was recorded after an analysis of the goodwill's value in use. Current agriculture market conditions and reduced third quarter results have caused management to re-evaluate assumptions in the financial model for goodwill's value in use determination, resulting in an impairment. Net loss including the goodwill charge in the third quarter of 2016 was ($14.4) million, or $(0.12) per diluted share, compared to a net loss of ($0.8) million, or ($0.01) per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2015. EBITDA was ($2.6) million compared to $(0.5) million in the third quarter of 2015. The decline was primarily driven by the sales levels and incremental operating expenses discussed above. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the third quarter totaled $15.3 million, an 18% increase compared to $13.0 million at the end of 2015. The Company continues to carry no debt. Working capital was $24.6 million, down slightly from $26.7 million at the end of 2015. Trading of Common Shares by Insiders AgJunction announces that in accordance with Corporation's Management Retention Plan Agreements (\"MRP Agreements), the Company is required to sell on behalf of the MRP Agreement participants, a sufficient number of their common shares to cover applicable United States and state taxes and fees on 2,122,825 shares vesting November 11, 2016.

The Company will remit such taxes to the United States authorities on behalf of the Insiders. Sales of the common shares will be administered by a third party broker beginning on November 14, 2016.

Reports Third Quarter Results", "article": "The Andersons, Inc. Reports Third Quarter Results Canada NewsWire MAUMEE, Ohio, Nov. 7, 2016 MAUMEE, Ohio, Nov. 7, 2016 /CNW/ -- The Andersons, Inc. (NASDAQ: ANDE) announces financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2016.  The Company reported net income attributable to The Andersons of $1.7 million for the third quarter of 2016, or $0.06 per diluted share, on revenues of $860 million. This represents a $2.9 million improvement compared to the net loss of $1.2 million in the same period in 2015, or ($0.04) per diluted share, on revenues of $909 million. Year to date, the Company has produced net income attributable to The Andersons of $1.4 million or $0.05 per diluted share compared to the prior year when it generated $34.0 million, or $1.19 per diluted share. \"Conditions are improving for our Grain Group and margins are strong for the Ethanol Group, but challenges persist with our Plant Nutrient Group facing weak margins and our Rail Group continuing to experience softening in utilization,\" said CEO Pat Bowe. \"In this mixed environment, the team is making good progress on our $10 million cost reduction initiative and continuing to take action on the items within our control to combat uncertainty in some of our markets.\" Third Quarter Segment Overview Start of the turnaround for the Grain Group In the third quarter, the Grain Group benefited from having shed its underperforming Iowa assets earlier this year and positioned itself to take advantage of improving crop conditions in the Eastern Corn Belt. Overall, grain production in the Eastern Corn Belt has rebounded from last year. Bean yields were strong and corn did well in most markets with some pockets of weaker yields. The table below breaks out the pre-tax income of the Group's Base Grain operations from that of its non-consolidated affiliates (Lansing Trade Group and Thompsons Limited).  Third quarter pre-tax income for the Grain Group was $1.9 million, a $1.8 million increase over the same period last year. Base Grain operations were up $2.5 million year over year, driven by the elimination of losses generated by the Group's assets in Iowa last year. Grain's affiliates continued to lag year over year, but have improved from the losses incurred in the first half of the year. Year to date results for the Group were a pre-tax loss of $28.6 million, a drop of $32.6 million from the $4.0 million in pre-tax income realized in the same period last year. Harvest is well underway in most of our markets and substantially done in some. Factors we are seeing that will impact the Group's results in the fourth quarter and first half of 2017 include:  Ethanol Group benefits from continued strong demand and improved margin conditions The Ethanol Group delivered another quarterly production volume record, producing a third quarter best of 95.4 million gallons compared to the 93.5 million gallons in the same period of the prior year. The Group generated pre-tax income of $9.5 million during the third quarter compared to the $5.9 million generated in the same quarter last year. Ethanol margins rose throughout the quarter as corn prices remained modest and gasoline prices began to return to prior year levels after holding at five year lows for most of the year. Renewable Identification Number (RIN) prices held at strong levels through the quarter, near the $0.90 level, which supports demand for higher blends such as E-85. A portion of the quarters margins were hedged early in the quarter to lock in at attractive levels. The expansion of the ethanol production facility in Albion, Michigan continues to proceed safely, on schedule and on budget. The project will double the joint venture's annual capacity to about 130 million gallons. The Group expects the added capacity to come on line in the first half of 2017. Industry dynamics in the quarter were supportive, with record production levels and historically high levels of gasoline demand driven by low fuel prices. The Group continues to see softness in distiller's dried grain (DDG) prices. Chinese sanctions and higher vomitoxin levels near some of our facilities have had some negative impact on DDG. Oversupply and falling prices continue to challenge Plant Nutrient volumes and margins The Plant Nutrient Group incurred a pre-tax loss of $7.2 million in the third quarter compared to the $11.1 million pre-tax loss in 2015's third quarter. The slightly better performance was derived from expense reductions resulting from integration of the Kay-Flo business and savings generated as part of the Company's productivity initiative. Prior year results also included one-time acquisition related costs. These year-over-year improvements were largely offset by a continuing weak margin environment for nutrients due to oversupply and falling prices in the market. Year to date, the Group has generated $18.0 million of pre-tax income compared to $8.1 million in the first nine months of 2015.  During the third quarter basic nutrient volumes fell in part due to producer and dealer reluctance to buy in a sustained falling price environment. The Group also saw lower advance purchase activity during the quarter. These market forces are expected to persist through the fourth quarter. Industry margin pressures and lower crop prices have weakened near-term Group performance in both the legacy basic nutrients and the more recently acquired specialty products businesses. The Group remains committed of the soundness of its long term strategy to grow its specialty nutrients products that support precision agriculture. However, performance and market conditions have been disappointing this year. At this point the Group expects that the Kay-Flo acquisition will be near breakeven this year. Rail Group performance falls on softer market conditions and timing of car sales income North American rail traffic volume continues to fall year over year and Class I railroad velocities remain high, placing pressure on lease renewal rates and railcar utilization levels.  The Rail Group earned $6.8 million of pre-tax income in the quarter compared to $11.9 million in the same quarter last year. The reduced performance was primarily driven by lower utilization rates that averaged 86.2 percent in the quarter, down from 91.6 percent in the third quarter of 2015. Income from railcar sales transactions was lower during the quarter as these transaction tend to vary quarter to quarter. Railcar repair business continued to perform well, setting its third consecutive record earnings quarter on improved productivity and strong demand. Other pre-tax income was lower due to the exit of the Group's investment in a short line railroad late last year. 7 Nov 2016 16:05 ET Press Release: The Andersons, Inc. Reports Third -2- Year-to-date, the Group has earned $22.7 million of pre-tax income compared to $43.9 million of pre-tax income generated in the same period last year. Roughly half of this variance is due to the $10.6 million gain that the group recorded in the second quarter of 2015 due to a large lease termination settlement. Year to date utilization has averaged 88.8 percent, down from the 92.3 percent average in the first nine months of 2015. Retail Group performance slips on lower same store sales; Group closes underperforming asset The Retail Group had a pre-tax loss of $1.6 million for the third quarter compared to a pre-tax loss of $800,000 in the third quarter last year. Comparable store sales were down 6.1 percent year over year, driving gross margins down $900,000 from the prior year. The Group was able to partially mitigate the loss by instituting labor savings initiatives. On a year to date basis, the Group had a pre-tax loss of $2.6 million compared to a $1.5 million loss for the same period last year. On October 10, the Company announced its intent to close the specialty foods store in Sylvania, Ohio. The site will close by mid-November. The Group continues to operate two stores in each of the Toledo, Ohio and Columbus, Ohio markets. Corporate Undistributed corporate expenses were lower in the quarter by $2.2 million, primarily as a result of beginning to capitalize professional services related to the next wave of IT infrastructure deployments and favorable interest expenses as a result of mark to market gains on certain interest rate hedges contracts compared to mark to market losses recognized in the third quarter of 2015. These gains were partially offset by other slightly higher corporate costs. Conference Call The Company will host a webcast on Tuesday, November 8, 2016 at 11:00 A.M.

(TSX: AGU) (NYSE: AGU) announced today its 2016 third quarter results, with a net loss attributable to equity holders of Agrium of $41-million compared to net earnings of $101-million in the third quarter of 2015. The reduction in net earnings was driven by lower year-over-year nutrient pricing, low pest and disease pressure in the U.S. which limited the demand for crop protection products and application services this growing season, a delayed harvest across North America related to wet weather, and one-time costs primarily related to the proposed merger with PotashCorp. Highlights: Third quarter adjusted net loss was $17-million or $0.12 diluted loss per share. Adjusting for non-operational legal costs, guidance relevant earnings would be a loss of $4-million or $0.03 diluted loss per share. We completed several larger retail acquisitions that added 37 locations in North America this quarter alone, bringing our year-to-date total to 70 locations and representing approximately $500-million of expected annual sales. These recent acquisitions added to our costs this quarter, with the benefits expected to be realized starting in 2017. Agrium reported significant progress towards its Operational Excellence initiatives in the third quarter with Wholesale cash selling and general and administrative costs down 26 percent compared to the same period last year. Retail also achieved further cost reductions which increased Retail EBITDA2 to sales from 8 percent to 9 percent and decrease Retail's cash operating coverage ratio3 by 2 percentage points on a year-to-date basis. Annual guidance range has been revised to $4.60 to $5.00 diluted earnings per share largely due to wet weather across Western Canada and the eastern U.S. 'Agrium continues to focus on what we can control during these times of market weakness,' commented Chuck Magro, Agrium's President and CEO. 'I am particularly pleased with the results of our operational excellence initiatives. Our focus on growing our Retail business continues, with 70 locations acquired year-to-date, representing approximately $500-million of expected incremental annual sales. Looking out for the rest of the year, we expect solid demand for crop nutrients; however, growers have experienced poor fall weather in Canada and pockets of the U.S. which has impacted harvest progress and ammonia applications,' added Mr. Magro. 'Our proposed merger with PotashCorp is a transformational opportunity to create a world class integrated global supplier of crop inputs and services. This merger creates benefits and opportunities that neither company could achieve on its own and will unlock significant value for shareholders of both companies. By generating meaningful synergies, and producing significant combined cash flows, the new company will be positioned for further growth, while benefiting customers, suppliers, shareholders, communities and other stakeholders,' concluded Mr. Magro. Agricultural and Crop Input Fundamentals For the third time in four years, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) projects record production for both global grain and oilseed production and for U.S. corn and soybeans. Crop prices and grower margins weakened throughout much of the third quarter. While favorable weather supported high yields, growers have been conservative with crop input purchases, which has pressured demand and prices for most crop input products. Despite the expected record production levels, U.S. corn prices have been supported in recent weeks by robust export demand as export sales of corn are up 85 percent compared to prior year levels. U.S. harvest is progressing at a near-average pace signifying a wider fall application season versus the previous three years if weather cooperates. However, the Western Canadian harvest has been stalled by early snowfall and cool temperatures, which may negatively impact fall ammonia demand. Nitrogen Urea prices were relatively s in the third quarter, whereas both UAN and ammonia prices declined. In recent weeks urea prices have increased driven by sizeable Indian urea imports and lower than expected export availability out of China. Chinese urea producers' operating rates have been reduced due to lower global prices and higher costs, resulting from an almost 60 percent increase in Chinese bituminous coal prices. U.S. offshore urea imports are down approximately 65 percent so far in the 2016/17 fertilizer year, as prices were below import parity throughout much of the third quarter. Domestic production has increased, and is expected to increase further in late 2016 and early 2017. However, the reduction in U.S. imports is expected to exceed the growth in domestic supply, and we anticipate a need for increased imports in late 2016 and early 2017. Potash The signing of potash contracts with buyers in India and China during the third quarter provided increased confidence to potash buyers globally and led to strong demand in order to refill depleted downstream inventories. The emergence of pent-up demand over the past couple of months has tightened the available supply from producers for the remainder of 2016. Brazilian potash imports were up 21 percent year-over-year in the third quarter and are now ahead of the record 2014 pace on a year-to-date basis. We expect demand to continue to be strong for the remainder of 2016, particularly if fall weather allows for a normal fall application season in the U.S. as the past three years have all been below-average due to weather. Phosphate Weak Indian diammonium phosphate (DAP) imports and recent lack of demand from Brazil have maintained pressure on the phosphate market. While the pace of purchases from India and Pakistan increased in the second half of 2016, it has not been enough to provide support in phosphate markets. While demand has been disappointing, the outlook for the remainder of 2016 and early 2017 is more positive due to reportedly tight phosphate inventories in Brazil and prospects for a year-over-year improvement in U.S. fall demand. 2016 ANNUAL GUIDANCE Based on our Market Outlook, Agrium expects to achieve annual diluted earnings per share of $4.60 to $5.00 in 2016 compared to our previous forecast of $5.00 to $5.30. We have lowered our annual guidance range due to the persistent weakness in global nutrient prices, and low demand for crop protection products and application services during the third quarter. Notwithstanding the current weather issues in Western Canada, our outlook for the fourth quarter is predicated upon a strong North American fall season driving high fertilizer application rates. The lower end of our nitrogen production guidance was increased to 3.6 million tonnes due to higher plant utilization rates while our estimate for potash production was lowered between 2.1 and 2.2 million tonnes. We are reiterating the range for Retail crop nutrient sales tonnes at between 9.8 million to 10.2 million tonnes while lowering the Retail EBITDA range between $1.07-billion and $1.11-billion. Our estimates for the Canada/U.S. foreign exchange rate and NYMEX for 2016 have been updated based on current market conditions. Guidance excludes the impact of share-based payments expense (recovery), gains (losses) on foreign exchange and non-qualifying derivative hedges, and merger related costs. Volumetric and earnings estimates assume normal seasonal growing and harvest patterns in the geographies where Agrium operates.

Today I've invited my colleague Thaddeus Burns, GE's senior IP and trade counsel, to contribute his thoughts on how the Industrial Internet can transform the world, especially in developing countries. He wrote the below with Sebastian Lohse. We would love to hear your thoughts and reactions in the responses below or on Twitter. In September 2015, 193 countries adopted the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The 17 SDGs constitute the most ambitious global agenda ever developed for the social, economic and environmental advancement of the world. They include the objectives to end poverty, abolish hunger, accomplish gender equality, foster equitable economic growth, reduce inequality and address climate changeaEURS-aEURSby 2030 or earlier. Significant gaps towards achieving these goals persist in all, but especially in the developing countries. The digital economy can contribute to closing the SDG achievement gaps in three ways: IT solutions spread and are adopted at unprecedented speed. They permit a very rapid deployment of technology to some of the poorest people in the world, thereby improving access and participation opportunities. A case in point: just 23 years after the first digital mobile phone entered the market, digital networks already cover 70% of Sub-Saharan Africa. Digital technologies place people at the center of products and services, allowing for attractive offerings due to reduced costs, improved sustainability, and user-friendliness. For example, in least developed countries, some health workers are beginning to use mobile-based programs to learn how to administer new treatments. Technologies at issue enable new business models that enhance innovation and growth in a wide range of sectors. The Industrial Internet is expected to transform many industries, producing ground-breaking benefits to the economy and the society on a global scale. While forecast reports vary, according to one study the Industrial Internet will have a potential economic impact of between $3.9 trillion and $11.1 trillion per year in 2025 , which arises mainly from productivity improvements to equipment maintenance, inventory optimization, energy savings and labor efficiencies. Marco has done a lot of work on this too. IoT infrastructures rely on remote data collection, analysis and management facilities, which are often situated in different jurisdictions. However, over the last two decades, governments have increasingly imposed restrictions on flow of data across borders, offering a variety of justifications, such as the public order, privacy, national security, and domestic growth. The barriers include localization requirements, filtering, and specific regulations to protect privacy. Such impediments to cross-border flows erode the spectacular economic potential of the Industrial Internet . In this analysis, we try to do three things: Underscore the importance of the Industrial Internet for sustainable development. Point to the challenges that arise from restrictions on international data flows. Propose a range of plausible measures to eliminate these obstacles so as to ensure that the Industrial Internet can effectively contribute to achieving the SDGs. Driving growth The Industrial Internet is one of the game-changers in the 21st century. A recent study projects that Industrial Internet technologies could increase the real GDP of the countries studied by 1.5% by 2030 (provided they build capacity to absorb these technologies and increase Industrial Internet investment). Another recent study by the World Economic Forum has identified four major types of transformations the Industrial Internet will bring about in the economy and the society at large. First, due to predictive maintenance and remote management, the Industrial Internet significantly enhances operational efficiency , such as improved uptime and asset utilization. Industrial systems can adjust not only to their own environments but also their own \"well-being\": instead of running to failure, machines schedule their own maintenance or modify their control algorithms dynamically to compensate for a worn part before and to communicate that data to other machines and humans who rely on those machines. Second, the Industrial Internet allows businesses to shift from products to outcome-based services , delivering measurable results to customers. Such outcomes may include guaranteed machine uptimes on factory floors, actual amounts of energy savings in commercial buildings, and guaranteed crop yields from a specific parcel of farmland. Third, delivering such outcomes will require new forms of collaboration between business partners , allowing them to combine their products and services to meet customer needs. New cloud-based software platforms will facilitate data capture, aggregation and exchange across the economy. Fourth, the Industrial Internet will drive growth in productivity by presenting new opportunities for people to enhance skills . It will also create new types of jobs. Most business leaders are convinced that the growing use of \"digital labor\" in the form of smart sensors, intelligent assistants and robots will profoundly transform the skills mix and focus of the workforce; 87% believe that the Industrial Internet will contribute to long-term job growth. Driving development The Industrial Internet can make a considerable contribution to meet the SDGs. As the examples given below illustrate, it advances human wellbeing in a range or areas such as healthcare, water, agriculture and livelihoods, natural resource management, energy and infrastructure. Health: E nsure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages (SDG 3) Industrial Internet technologies allow personalizing treatments, collecting clinical data beyond the occasional patient-doctor visits, detecting earlier and proactively treating disease progression, and finding more effective cure for a range of intractable conditions. IoT technologies are also being used to address immediate challenges in humanitarian response. A case in point is Sensor Technology and Analytics to Monitor, Predict, and Protect Ebola Patients (STAMP2), which has been tested on Ebola patients in the United States. Currently it is being scaled up to meet the needs of government agencies such as USAID for its Ebola treatment strategy in Liberia. STAMP2 collects patient data, including ECG, heart rate, oxygen saturation, body temperature, respiratory rate, and position. These data are sent to a central server to support response to disease outbreak. These data are sent to a central server platform so they can be monitored and analyzed over a long period of time and alert physicians of abnormal changes in a patient's behavior or health Deploying solutions such as the STAMP2 sensor improves the Ebola response by decreasing emergency response time in critical areas and enabling emergency responders to detect Ebola patients earlier and monitor them more efficiently. Water: Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all (SDG 6) Industrial Internet solutions can improve clean water delivery and sanitation, of which 1-2 billion people worldwide are deprived. For instance, Sarvajal, an Indian social enterprise, has developed low-cost reverse osmosis technology to provide clean water in rural areas, as well as smart meters to remotely monitor the quality and quantity of water. Moreover, a wireless sensor network (WSN) is being used in the country to improve water management in poor and semi-arid areas. The wireless net measures temperature, humidity, soil moisture, ambient light, and barometric pressure in rural Karnataka. Data from the sensors are visualized on the website for real-time monitoring. Agriculture and Livelihoods: End hunger, achieve food security and improve nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture (SDG 2) Gamaya, a Swiss company, uses Industrial Internet technologies to provide solutions in precision agriculture, a farming management technique based on observing, measuring and responding to inter- and intra-field variability in crops. Images of a field taken from a drone are analyzed by specialized software, which categorizes the land according to crop concentration. The output file is uploaded to the tractor, which passes over the land and dispenses varying levels of fertilizer. Although self-navigating, the tractor overlaps only a few centimeters of land when making its rounds. Gamaya offers analogous solutions for seeding and harvesting, which make use of sensor data on soil content and moisture. All measures combined result in a 30% reduction of fertilizer and chemical usage, a 7-25% increase in crop yield and a 50% decrease in disease- and weed-related losses. Energy/Infrastructure Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all (SDG 7); Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable (SDG 9) Industrial Internet technologies make wind power generation more efficient. GE offers its clients Industrial Internet-based solutions which use data produced from across the wind farm in real time. The technology allows individual turbines to communicate directly with each other, sharing data about the real-time wind conditions. Drawing on this information, turbines can adjust blade angles and turbine settings to maximize their degree of efficiency. The Industrial Internet also enables Smart CitiesaEURS-aEURSurban settlements, that aim to make a better use of the public resources, increasing the quality of the services offered to the citizens, while reducing the operational costs of the public administrations. For example, the Siemens Intelligent Parking Solution relies on a sensor systemaEURS-aEURSconstantly gathering information on the parking situationaEURS-aEURSthat keeps drivers informed from their point of origin to their final destination, making it easier to plan a trip more intelligently, find a parking place and to commute more intelligently. The system uses a combination of ground and overhead sensors to collect real-time parking space availability information, while taking vehicle size requirements into account. Why free movement of data matters The Industrial Internet involves huge volumes of created or captured information that require extensive cloud-based facilities for storage, analysis and management. Rather than being restricted to a single jurisdiction, these essential Industrial Internet infrastructures tend to be distributed around the world due to several factors, such as local workload, environmental conditions (e.g. temperature, sun light), and availability of skilled workforce. Most importantly, only sizeable data infrastructures permit economies of scale, which significantly reduce the costs of offering Industrial Internet solutions. Therefore, unrestricted flow of information across national borders forms a key prerequisite for the effective use and worldwide adoption of the Industrial Interne t, allowing it in particular to unfold its enormous potential for sustainable development on a global scale. However, in recent years, governments have been erecting borders in cyberspace, resorting in particular to data localization requirements. Specifically designed to impede the transfer of data across national borders, these types of measures take different forms: rules that prohibit information to be sent outside the country, that subordinate such data transfers to the express consent of the data subject, that require copies of information to be stored domestically, or that provide for taxation of exported data. To justify restrictions to cross-border data flows, governments offer a variety of reasons, in particular, domestic growth, privacy, and security. Upon closer inspection, restrictions on cross-border data flows more often interfere with each of these goals. One motivation for restricting cross-border data flows, often unstated explicitly, is to advance domestic economic development. Like most protectionist measures, such limitations bring only small gains for a limited number of local companies and workers. At the same time, measures to curb cross-border data flows increase costs for the majority of domestic businesses and customers , especially due to reduced economies of scale. Furthermore, they deprive local actors of access to global services that might improve productivity and enhance innovation. In addition, localization requirements may compromise international trade in goods and services, which hinges upon the unconstrained transfer of data. A further argument stated in favor of restricting data flows involves cybersecurityaEURS-aEURSprotecting information against criminal activities on the part of governmental or nongovernmental entities abroad. In reality, however, restrictions on cross-border data flows can render the data more vulnerable . Entities active in the global market are exposed to international competition as well as the ever-rising sophistication of cybercriminals, which are two key incentives to constantly enhance their own security level. On the other hand, localized data servers facilitate possible attacks in that they reduce the possibility to distribute information and security fixes across servers in different locations. Finally, personal privacy concerns represent another stated reason to limit data flows across international borders. They are legitimate if they relate to the need to protect personal data, i.e., information pertaining to an identified or identifiable natural person. For instance, under Australian law, in order to protect the citizens' privacy and security, e-health record systems must deploy local data centers. In Canada, the legislation in the provinces of British Columbia and Nova Scotia provides that personal information held by public institutions (i.e., schools, universities, hospitals, government-owned utilities, public agencies) to be stored and accessed only in Canada. Healthcare records disclosed to third parties could potentially affect insurance policies and future employment prospects. However, in the context of the Industrial Internet, apprehensions with regard to privacy are largely unfounded given that, to an overwhelming extent, the Industrial Internet relies on machine-to-machine communication of data necessary for the optimal operation of machines (e.g. to verify if the machine is functioning, dispensing properly, or if the most recent updates have been loaded). The use of personal information often aims to make the machine work better, lower radiation or incidence of disease, or to develop aggregate models of care. To minimize risk of re-use, personal information from on Internet connected devices may be aggregated, allowing for the data to be used for research without posing significant privacy risk to individuals . Narrowly tailored data privacy rulesaEURS-aEURSinstead of general data localization requirementsaEURS-aEURScould address the relatively small proportion of cases where Industrial Internet technologies collect and process personal information. Possible solutions The Industrial Internet can make a significant contribution to sustainable development, in particular helping the international community to meet the ambitious SDG agenda by 2030. Given the critical importance of free cross-border data flows for the Industrial Internet, governments and other stakeholders should join forces to remove obstacles that exist in that regard, while taking legitimate concerns about data privacy into account. Both binding and enforceable, international trade agreements constitute appropriate instruments to introduce relevant rules. It will be crucial to achieve a critical mass, that is, to ensure the participation of all major economies. The authors of this paper suggest that policymakers consider the following approaches: develop a plurilateral digital trade agreement at WTO, including a horizontal discipline to deal with all data-related aspects of trades in goods and services; expand and implement the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement to support digital trade; make permanent the moratorium on customs duties on electronic transmissions; clarify the application of WTO members' GATS commitments on digital trade; use the provisions on the free flow of data in the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP) as a model for future international trade agreements; and integrate in the Trade in Services Agreement (TISA) a proposal by Canada, Colombia, Japan, Taiwan, and the US, which would prohibit parties from blocking cross-border information transfers, including personal information when the activity is carried out in connection with the service supplier's business.

(TSX: AGU) (NYSE: AGU) announced today its 2016 third quarter results, with a net loss attributable to equity holders of Agrium of $41-million ($0.29 diluted loss per share) compared to net earnings of $101-million ($0.72 diluted earnings per share) in the third quarter of 2015. The reduction in net earnings was driven by lower year-over-year nutrient pricing, low pest and disease pressure in the U.S. which limited the demand for crop protection products and application services this growing season, a delayed harvest across North America related to wet weather, and one-time costs primarily related to the proposed merger with PotashCorp. Highlights:  \"Agrium continues to focus on what we can control during these times of market weakness,\" commented Chuck Magro, Agrium's President and CEO. \"I am particularly pleased with the results of our operational excellence initiatives. Our focus on growing our Retail business continues, with 70 locations acquired year-to-date, representing approximately $500-million of expected incremental annual sales. Looking out for the rest of the year, we expect solid demand for crop nutrients; however, growers have experienced poor fall weather in Canada and pockets of the U.S. which has impacted harvest progress and ammonia applications,\" added Mr. Magro. \"Our proposed merger with PotashCorp is a transformational opportunity to create a world class integrated global supplier of crop inputs and services. This merger creates benefits and opportunities that neither company could achieve on its own and will unlock significant value for shareholders of both companies. By generating meaningful synergies, and producing significant combined cash flows, the new company will be positioned for further growth, while benefiting customers, suppliers, shareholders, communities and other stakeholders,\" concluded Mr. Magro.  ADJUSTED NET EARNINGS AND GUIDANCE RELEVANT EARNINGS RECONCILIATIONS  MARKET OUTLOOK Agricultural and Crop Input Fundamentals  Nitrogen  3 Nov 2016 07:00 ET Press Release: Agrium Reports Third Quarter -2- Potash  Phosphate  2016 ANNUAL GUIDANCE Based on our Market Outlook, Agrium expects to achieve annual diluted earnings per share of $4.60 to $5.00 in 2016 compared to our previous forecast of $5.00 to $5.30. We have lowered our annual guidance range due to the persistent weakness in global nutrient prices, and low demand for crop protection products and application services during the third quarter. Notwithstanding the current weather issues in Western Canada, our outlook for the fourth quarter is predicated upon a strong North American fall season driving high fertilizer application rates. The lower end of our nitrogen production guidance was increased to 3.6 million tonnes due to higher plant utilization rates while our estimate for potash production was lowered between 2.1 and 2.2 million tonnes. We are reiterating the range for Retail crop nutrient sales tonnes at between 9.8 million to 10.2 million tonnes while lowering the Retail EBITDA range between $1.07-billion and $1.11-billion. Our estimates for the Canada/U.S. foreign exchange rate and NYMEX for 2016 have been updated based on current market conditions. This guidance and updated additional measures and related assumptions are summarized in the table below. Guidance excludes the impact of share-based payments expense (recovery), gains (losses) on foreign exchange and non-qualifying derivative hedges, and merger related costs. Volumetric and earnings estimates assume normal seasonal growing and harvest patterns in the geographies where Agrium operates. 2016 ANNUAL GUIDANCE RANGE AND ASSUMPTIONS  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS November 3, 2016 Unless otherwise noted, all financial information in this Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is prepared using accounting policies in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and is presented in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 - Interim Financial Reporting.

Nitrogen  Potash  Phosphate  Wholesale Other  Expenses  Other EBITDA for our Other non-operating business unit for the third quarter of 2016 had a net expense of $74-million, compared to net expense of $44-million for the third quarter of 2015. The variance was primarily due to:  FINANCIAL CONDITION The following are changes to working capital on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015.  3 Nov 2016 07:00 ET Press Release: Agrium Reports Third Quarter -6-  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Agrium generally expects that it will be able to meet its working capital requirements, capital resource needs and shareholder returns through a variety of sources, including available cash on hand, cash provided by operations, short-term borrowings from the issuance of commercial paper, and borrowings from our credit facilities, as well as long-term debt and equity capacity from the capital markets. As of September 30, 2016, we have sufficient current assets to meet our current liabilities. Summary of Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Below is a summary of our cash provided by or used in operating, investing and financing activities as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:  3 Nov 2016 07:00 ET Press Release: Agrium Reports Third Quarter -7-  Short-term Debt  Capital Management  PROPOSED MERGER WITH POTASHCORP Agrium and PotashCorp entered into an arrangement agreement dated September 11, 2016 (the \"Agreement\"), under which the companies will combine in a merger of equals into a newly incorporated parent entity to be formed to manage and hold the combined businesses of both Agrium and PotashCorp. The Agreement will be implemented by a proposed plan of arrangement (the \"Arrangement\"). The Arrangement is anticipated to be completed in mid-2017, subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory and court approvals and approvals by Agrium securityholders and PotashCorp shareholders. Refer to note 6 of our Summarized Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Agrium and PotashCorp's joint proxy circular, dated October 3, 2016 filed on SEDAR on October 6, 2016 (the \"Joint Proxy Circular\") for further information. SHARE REPURCHASES We have approval from the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) to purchase for cancellation on the TSX or New York Stock Exchange an aggregate of 6,908,450 common shares (5 percent) of our outstanding shares. Repurchases may be made under a Normal Course Issuer Bid (NCIB) approved by the TSX until February 18, 2017. Pursuant to the Agreement we are restricted from purchasing our outstanding shares prior to completion of the Arrangement. There were no shares repurchased under the NCIB for the first nine months of 2016 or the period from October 1, 2016 to November 2, 2016. Shareholders can obtain a copy of the NCIB notice submitted to the TSX from Agrium without charge upon request. OUTSTANDING SHARE DATA Agrium had 138,175,400 outstanding shares at October 28, 2016. At October 28, 2016, the number of shares issuable pursuant to stock options outstanding (issuable assuming full conversion, where each option granted can be exercised for one common share) was approximately 937,528.  The agricultural products business is seasonal. Consequently, year-over-year comparisons are more appropriate than quarter-over-quarter comparisons. Crop input sales are primarily concentrated in the spring and fall crop input application seasons. Crop nutrient inventories are normally accumulated leading up to each application season. Our cash collections from accounts receivables generally occur after the application season is complete, and our customer prepayments are concentrated in December and January.

Risk Management  3 Nov 2016 07:00 ET Press Release: Agrium Reports Third Quarter -17- For our natural gas derivatives designated in hedging relationships, the underlying risk of the derivative contracts is identical to the hedged risk, and accordingly we have established a ratio of 1:1 for all natural gas hedges. Due to a strong correlation between AECO future contract prices and our delivered cost, we did not experience any ineffectiveness on our hedges, and accordingly we have recorded the full change in the fair value of natural gas derivative contracts designated as hedges to other comprehensive income.  There have been no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 or September 30, 2015. We do not measure any of our financial instruments using Level 3 inputs. 4. Expenses  5. Debt  6. Business Acquisitions In September 2016, our Retail business unit acquired 16 farm centers located in the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan from Andrukow Group Solutions Inc. and 18 farm centers located across the northern U.S. Corn-Belt region from Cargill AgHorizons (U.S.) for preliminary purchase consideration of $165-million, subject to working capital adjustments. Benefits of the acquisitions include expansion of geographical coverage for the sale of crop inputs in Canada and the U.S., acquisition of existing customer base and workforce, the value of synergies between Agrium and the acquired businesses and cost savings opportunities. 3 Nov 2016 07:00 ET Press Release: Agrium Reports Third Quarter -18- We have engaged an independent valuation firm to assist in determining the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, including contingent liabilities and provisions, and related deferred income tax impacts. The valuations are in progress and are not complete due to the timing of the transactions' closing dates. Proposed Merger with Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc. (\"PotashCorp\") Agrium and PotashCorp entered into an agreement dated September 11, 2016 (the \"Agreement\"), under which the companies will combine in a merger of equals into a newly incorporated parent entity (\"New Parent\") to be formed to manage and hold the combined businesses of both Agrium and PotashCorp. The Agreement will be implemented by a proposed plan of arrangement (the \"Arrangement\"). Under the Arrangement, Agrium shareholders will receive 2.23 New Parent shares for each Agrium share held and PotashCorp shareholders will receive 0.40 of a New Parent share for each PotashCorp share held. Following the completion of the Agreement, Agrium and PotashCorp will become wholly-owned subsidiaries of New Parent and New Parent will continue the operations of Agrium and PotashCorp on a combined basis. Each of the share-based payment awards for each of Agrium and PotashCorp, whether vested or unvested, that are outstanding immediately prior to the completion of the Arrangement will convert into a New Parent award. The Arrangement is anticipated to be completed in mid-2017, subject to customary closing conditions including receipt of regulatory and court approvals and approval by Agrium securityholders and PotashCorp shareholders. Each of Agrium and PotashCorp have scheduled a special meeting of their securityholders and shareholders on November 3, 2016 to consider, among other things, a resolution to approve the Arrangement. The estimated costs to be incurred by Agrium and PotashCorp with respect to the Arrangement and related matters are expected to aggregate approximately $140-million. The Agreement contains provisions that restrict Agrium's and PotashCorp's ability to pursue alternatives to the Arrangement and, in specified circumstances, Agrium or PotashCorp could be required to pay the other party a non-completion fee of $485-million plus $50-million as reimbursement for related expenses. Additional information and the full text of the Agreement and the Arrangement are included in Agrium and PotashCorp's joint proxy circular filed on SEDAR on October 6, 2016.

Real-time data analytics, sensors and robots are raising the prospect of the \"next green revolution\" and are spurring startups, according to a report by Boston Consulting Group and AgFunder, which connects investors with agricultural companies and proposals online. The investments include research and development, deals, partnerships, equity stakes and technology centres. Early-stage funding from venture capital firms reached US$3 billion globally, up from US$900 million in 2013 and US$400 million in 2010, the groups said. \"The total dollars were impressive,\" said Decker Walker, Boston Consulting Group's managing director in the Chicago office and one of the report's authors. \"It is striking that it's happening at a time when farmer income is declining.\" Slumping grain, meat and dairy prices have eroded agriculture incomes, sparking more farmers to adopt so-called precision-agriculture methods to help increase efficiency. Companies including Deere Co. are joining the race to create new products for the market that Goldman Sachs estimates could be worth US$240 billion by 2050. The U.S. Department of Agriculture said in a report last week that the new technologies are helping to boost profits. \"There is clearly some optimism despite the shrinking farmer wallet size,\" Walker said. The technologies encompass everything from granular data analysis that enhances planting decisions to drones that provide field views around the clock. The report's findings reflect a survey of more than 50 executives from seed, fertilizer, meat, grain and farmequipment companies as well as 15 venture-capital investors. The surge in technology may be coming later than other industries because past challenges have included a lack of connectivity on vast, remote farms, Walker said. The perception of agriculture being a \"sleepy industry\" that's slow to adopt technology is changing, he said. About 80 per cent of large U.S. farmers are using GPS devices to steer their tractors, while 70 per cent to 80 per cent use yield mapping to determine the most productive areas of their land, the USDA estimates. Crop protection and seed companies have invested the highest percentage of revenue in \"agtech,\" according to the private report. Still, the agribusiness investments are often \"cautious\" and \"defensive,\" meaning they are geared to boost core businesses rather than create new ones, according to the report. About 58 per cent of the venture capital firms said they expect their investments in start ups to lead to sales to larger agricultural companies, rather than disrupt the big players, Walker said. To \"win\" in this area, companies should focus products and services around their customers, identify who in the firm is responsible to scout out new investments and ensure access to early-state technologies, according to the report.

Located in Guelph, the organization focuses on ensuring that Ontario producers have access to the latest technologies to compete globally and to develop new market opportunities, many of which are beyond food. Whale said although Ontario is well-positioned to take advantage of changes to enhance its agrifood industry, efforts must be coordinated to reach beyond agriculture for the collective economic and social well-being of the province and its residents. \"We must move beyond traditional markets of food to new health products, industrial feedstock and fuels ,\" he said. Whale gave examples of several up-and-coming technologies such as sensors that can help save 40-50 per cent of food that is wasted daily or the technology that will determine the sex and fertility of an egg. This technology will enable poultry producers to determine which eggs to keep and which to get rid of before they hatch. \"Those are in global demand and are game changers ,\" he said. He spoke of shifting reliance on chemical fertilizers to the use of bacteria that fix atmospheric nitrogen, a move that could decrease the amount of applied nitrogen from 50 to 90 per cent. Egg components are key ingredients in an antidepressant under development by a Canadian company. And Ontario egg farmers will be investing to help the fledgling biotech firm determine if it's as safe and effective for human use, as early tests would suggest. The medication under development is called Rellidep -the name is an abbreviation of Ron Ellis, the retired NHL star who has battled depression and is a spokesperson for the company. At a certain stage in development, a key molecule is extracted from the embryonic stem cells to form the foundation of the medication. An Ontario company has developed an environmentally friendly alternative to the Keurig single cup coffee maker. \"It's a fully compostable single serve coffee pod. Instead of the hard plastic Keurig cup they've developed a soft pod with every component compostable ,\" he said. Last month Loblaw Companies Limited announced the launch of 100 per cent compostable single-serve coffee pods. The Keurigcompatible pods are made almost entirely from plant materials and reclaimed coffee bean skins using Canadian technology from the University of Guelph and Club Coffee of Toronto. Whale predicted a rise in the use of sensors and automation in dairy farming that will create a wealth of data regarding feed, animal health and milk quality. He encouraged farmers to share the information they collect about their farming operations with other producers. He stressed that genetic technology is one of the most powerful change agents in agriculture and food production. \"If you believe in the science of climate change, why don't you believe in the consensus that the scientific community has on genetic modification ? It's got stronger support than climate change in fact.\" As a relatively new science genetic modification should be regulated and scrutinized, but Whale calls it the most powerful kind of science in the fight against climate change and reduction of fossil fuels. \"It's a critical component to the technology that is going to help us solve the problems of food scarcity, food security; that's getting off oil, that's dealing with climate change ,\" he said. Managing change is difficult at the best of times, said Whale, but the alternative is much less palatable. \"If you don't like change you're going to like irrelevance even less ,\" he said quoting U. S. General (Ret.) Eric Shineski, former U. S. Chief of Army staff. Additionally, members acclaimed the Grey County Federation of Agriculture's executive for the coming year.

How will we feed our growing world without compromising the planet's ecosystems? The Canadian agricultural sector produces some of the finest crops and livestock in the world. Farmers have tried to lessen their environmental impact, but agriculture will always consume resources. About 30 per cent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions come from agriculture. Farming is our largest source of water pollution through runoff of fertilizers and pesticides. You might say that our agrifood system often bites the land that feeds us. This week brings government ministers and officials from Canada, the United States and Mexico to Niagara Falls, Ont., to discuss trade, development and co-operation under the annual Tri-National Agricultural Accord. The group will talk about continent-wide issues, but Canada's agricultural sector has a wider opportunity to help feed the world. Here are three agrifood opportunities that delegates at this week's meeting ought to discuss, based on what farming is not. Agriculture is not just about growing food. Certainly, farmers feed people and entire cities. But our agricultural sector also drives economies and communities. Speaking this month at the Public Policy Forum's growth summit in Ottawa, Dominic Barton, chair of the Advisory Council on Economic Growth, pointed to agriculture as one of Canada's strengths. Ontario alone is a food-processing powerhouse, with about 3,000 businesses in the sector employing 100,000 people. Nationally, the agrifood industry employs one in eight Canadians - 2.3 million people. We are the fifth-largest agricultural exporter in the world. Production and trade in the farming sector help pay for health, education and other social services that we all rely on. The agricultural sector also ensures our rural communities remain viable. Agriculture isn't just tractors. In a digital revolution in agriculture, more and more of our farm equipment will consist of smart, data-driven machines. Robotic milking systems are already at work in the dairy industry. Drones and satellites monitor soil moisture to determine irrigation requirements or optimum planting times. Farmers can use a smartphone app to identify insects in their fields and predict and control pest infestations. Imagine self-driving tractors that automatically plant, fertilize and irrigate crops without wasting seed, nutrients or water. In his recent talk, Mr. Barton called for Canada to capitalize on computing power, connectedness and big data. Precision agriculture based on real-time information technology will help us deliver and manage resources to produce food and reduce our environmental footprint. Big data is the new farm nutrient. Agriculture is not just about growing more food. The green revolution of the mid-20th century was about making more food, especially for famine-threatened parts of the developing world. Today, we produce enough food to meet the dietary needs of our world population. The United Nations estimates that there are about 2,850 dietary calories available daily for every man, woman and child on the planet. But we waste almost one-third of the food we make. And what is not wasted is poorly shared. It's not just the amount of food we produce that's important. What will define this century is how we produce and distribute that food. We need to recognize the contributions of the agricultural sector to our economy and our way of life. We need to use information technology and big data to farm smarter. And beyond the Tri-National Agricultural Accord, we need to find better ways to share food for our growing world."}, {"title": "Farmers Edge; P&H Partners with Farmers Edge to Boost Grower Profitability Through Precision Agriculture and Big Data", "article": "2016 OCT 25 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Information Technology Newsweekly -- Parrish and Heimbecker Limited (P&H) announced it has partnered with Farmers Edge(TM), a global leader in precision agriculture and independent data management solutions, to offer world-class agronomic support and precision agriculture solutions for Canadian farm producers.

As the plan won't come into effect until 2018 and is based on provincial reaction, it may be a while before they get any detailed responses. When asked about the plan hours after it was announced by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Agriculture Minister Lawrence MacAulay told the Senate agriculture committee that he wants \"to make sure we do not do anything that hurts agriculture. I'm here to represent agriculture and make sure their issues are at the cabinet table, and that's what I intend to do. \"Without a doubt, there's going to be an enormous amount of discussion as to how these issues will be handled... Every effort I can put forward to protect and help farmers I will do.\" The federal plan is to set a minimum price on carbon of $10 a tonne in 2018; which will rise by $10 a tonne until reaching $50 in 2022 at which time the outcomes will be assessed. The provinces will retain control of how to use the revenues generated, whether a cap and trade or a carbon tax approach is used. Ron Bonnett, president of the Canadian Federation of Agriculture, says the plan \"will pose both challenges and opportunities for Canadian agricultural producers. International competitiveness is a major concern, as prices for many agricultural commodities are set globally and some of Canada's largest competitors have no plans to implement carbon pricing, putting Canadian agricultural exports at a competitive disadvantage.\" \"Farmers will require special consideration as the carbon pricing regulations take effect, due to the additional expenses they will incur.\" Another factor is recognition of the changes to farming practices already implemented to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Bonnett says the industry \"has made impressive gains in improving environmental outcomes and is poised to continue to grow sustainably as it supports Canada's economy and rural communities. \"Therefore, any carbon pricing policy must be developed in close consultation with agricultural producers to address the challenges and take advantage of the opportunities available ,\" he added. Cheryl Mayer, director of policy development with the Canadian Canola Growers Association, shared similar concerns. \"It's important for us to understand how this will impact our members. We're users of fertilizers and fuel and depend on rail transportation to move our product to export terminals.\" Growers are naturally concerned about being rendered uncompetitive by whatever carbon pricing plan is settle on and receiving recognition for reduced emissions. She said canola oil in biodiesel offers an effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Cam Dahl, president of the Cereals Canada, says, \"It is a little premature to comment as we do not know details of how any program may be applied to agriculture.\" His groups wants the carbon plan to be outcome focused and based on sound science. It must be national and market driven, economically sustainable and recognize agriculture's emission reductions. \"Provided that programs are properly coordinated and implemented, producers could benefit from participating in offset protocols that value carbon sequestration and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, through beneficial management practices, innovative technologies and improved efficiency ,\" he adds. Gary Stordy, spokesman for the Canadian Pork Council, says \"producers take their environmental seriously, applying many good environmental practices that benefit the producer and the environment. \"Our success as an industry is due in part to market access and being competitive both in our domestic and international markets ,\" he adds. \"We will be studying the impact on our industry and how each province applies the carbon pricing system.\" \"Our industry has production from coast to coast and it is plausible that one or more provinces will apply a carbon price plan that places a producer a competitive disadvantage when compared to a producer in another province \"The Western Canadian Wheat Growers launched a petition against new carbon taxes on farmers and food and called \"on Ottawa and the provinces to realize the positive environmental story of modern farming, how farmers are sinking carbon, and how carbon taxes will wreak havoc throughout the entire agriculture value chain in Canada. Levi Wood, president of the Wheat Growers, says \"growers use modern farm equipment with cleaner-burning and more efficient engines, we use precision agriculture such as no-till farming, modern crop protection products, and advanced agronomic practices that also reduce carbon -this is all really good news .\"?\" Renewable Industries Canada believes that climate policies such as carbon pricing can be used to support the production and consumption of low-carbon fuels and products. \"Canadian biofuels producers are our country's low-carbon pioneers ,\" said RICanada president Andrea Kent. \"Government policies that reduce emissions and support production and consumption of lowcarbon products are good for the environment and the economy.\" The association says carbon pricing \"will drive clean economic growth if implemented in a way that ensures investors of low carbon products are rewarded.\" \"Biofuels are proven to be the cleanest and most sustainable source of liquid fuel available.

That announcement and the August appointment of a 15-member board followed late July funding from the federal and Ontario governments. They are to contribute $90 million each toward the expected $281 million project cost which seeks to bring \"fibre optic connectivity to every citizen, farm, business and organization.\" At Agriculture 4.0, Hogan is to appear with University of Guelph Rural Development Prof. Helen Hambly. Her 2007 study of rural broadband in Ontario helped highlight the need for improvements in Internet access to support agricultural innovation, organizational partnerships and rural producers' networks. Other speakers are to highlight working examples. The Nov. 3 tour shows offdigital applications in a robotic milking parlour, apple production and craft brewing. Within living memory, there was not even dependable electricity in much of rural Grey County. People in small communities were forced to organize mutual telephone systems and string wire to connect with business and personal contacts in nearby communities. Technological developments during the second half of the 20th century gradually -and at an increasing pace more recently -transformed Ontario agriculture. SWIFT seeks to extend universal, high speed Internet throughout 350 communities in southwestern Ontario and Niagara. The area encompasses a population of 3.5 million that also supplies by far the largest share of agricultural production in a province that leads all other Canadian provinces in agriculture and food processing. Modern agriculture, like modern culture generally, has grown to depend heavily on digital technology. In Grey County dairy barns every day robots milk and feed cows and sweep the floors. Other digitally managed machinery controls ventilation systems, feed inventory, environmental and manure storage systems. Robots wash hog barns and lead boars. They detect heats in sows, sort pigs in pens and feed them automatically. At the most recent Farm Progress Show in Boone, Iowa, the Case IH company unveiled its Autonomous Tractor concept vehicle. That's a field-working robot to operate with Global Positioning Satellite guidance and software to conduct large-scale field work without the need of a human driver. The data such machinery requires and generates becomes useful in farm management decisions to calculate production efficiencies and cost savings. Efficient data transfer becomes part of the equation when farm operators communicate directly with suppliers of fuel and feed, for example, or with customers. In 2014, the European Parliament's joint research centre produced a study which defined precision agriculture roughly as follows: A whole farm management approach using information technology, satellite positioning data, remote sensing and proximal data gathering for the purpose of \"optimising returns on inputs while reducing environmental impacts.\" As Grey County has been saying all along, it's the next big thing."}, {"title": "Small Business Week 2016", "article": "Source: Government of New Brunswick Headline: Small Business Week 2016 FREDERICTON (GNB) - The following message was issued today by Economic Development Minister Francine Landry, who is also minister responsible for Opportunities NB, in recognition of Small Business Week, taking place Oct. 16-22: Small business has a big impact in New Brunswick. There are 25,000 small businesses operating in New Brunswick, employing 96,000 people. This accounts for 32 per cent of employment in the province. As a small business owner, I know that the impact of this employment reaches far beyond what the numbers tell us. Before becoming involved in politics, I worked with my husband in Saint-Jacques where we own and operate a tourism business. Like many entrepreneurs we started small, dreamed big and worked hard. As minister responsible for Opportunities NB, I have the privilege of meeting many new entrepreneurs and small-business owners throughout the province. They are passionate, innovative and driven to succeed. The passion is found in companies like Distellerie Fils du Roy, based in Petit-Paquetville, where Sebastien Roy started a small distillery three years ago. The innovation is found in companies like Fredericton-based Resson Aerospace, a company that uses high-technology drones and advanced bioinformatics to do what farmers have traditionally done on foot. Resson, created in 2013 by two University of New Brunswick graduates, has become a leading precision agriculture company working with some of the world's largest food producers. And the drive is found in entrepreneurs like Matt White, the owner of Sussex Beard Oil, who successfully pitched his business idea on Dragon's Den and secured funding. We will continue to support entrepreneurs and small businesses like these to grow our economy. As a government it is our job to create conditions that allow businesses to thrive and succeed. We have reduced the small business tax to allow businesses to invest more in their own operations. Our ultimate goal is to establish a 2.5 per cent business tax, the lowest rate east of Manitoba. In addition to this, Opportunities NB is working with businesses across the province to develop new high-growth opportunities. They have business development executives in five regional and six satellite offices and they are an excellent first point of contact for entrepreneurs and business owners. Opportunities NB has assisted hundreds of companies to develop growth plans, make connections to export opportunities, make links to a network of like-minded entrepreneurs and gain access to funding. Our government remains focused upon job creation and supporting families. Supporting small business is essential to achieving those goals. Thank you to each and every small business owner in the province for what you contribute to your community and the economy. 14-10-16"}, {"title": "Sensors drive greater data value", "article": "Think Different Sensor research and field testing continues to drive more data to ultimately help farmers make better short and long term decisions. Climate Corporation has unveiled new sensors as well as technologies from outside vendors, all designed to bring more information to its FieldView platform. Also, check out the variable-depth planter prototype under development by engineers at McGill University in Quebec, Canada. Researchers have paired an in-soil temperature and moisture sensors with a varible-depth planter to place the seed according to moisture and temperature for more uniform emergence. Current tests with corn planted at various depths from one to three-inch has shown that root systems planted shallow in wet soils were larger and yields were better than in conventional planting at the 2-in. depth.  While deeper planted corn showed no advantage, researchers suspects that might be different in a dry year. ---------- Precision agriculture technologies are preparing for another leap forward as soil sensor research ramps up on in-field application. At the recent Farm Progress Show near Boone, Iowa, Climate Corporation unveiled prototypes of an on-the-go nitrate sensor and discussed moisture and temperature sensors. Perhaps more importantly, they announced an in-field sensor network to feed information to their Climate FieldView platform, plus added Veris Technologies soil data to the mix.  A thousand miles to the east, researchers at McGill University are developing an on-the-go nitrate sensor, as well sensors to monitor soil moisture, temperature, texture and organic matter on-the-go. Climate Corporation's nitrate sensor is exciting for Tim Malterer, a south central Minnesota farmer and FieldView platform advocate. \"The nitrate sensor should save me money if I don't have to make an application,\" he says. \"It will tell me if I'm short and need to fine tune what is out there.\" While Malterer is more skeptical of university-based research such as McGills that hasn't yet been exposed to on-farm evaluations, Climate Corporation's open source, in-field sensor network could speed his acceptance and others. If so, McGill's moisture and temperature sensors alone could have a significant impact on planting practices. Imagine variable-depth planting \"We have paired our in-soil temperature and moisture sensors with a variable depth planter to place the seed according to moisture and temperature for more uniform emergence,\" says Viacheslav Adamchuk, associate professor, Bioresource Engineering Department, McGill University in Quebec, Canada. \"If the soil is wet, we place the seed closer to the surface to emerge at the same time as seed placed deeper in dry soil. Results seem promising and quite reliable. The recorded data also gives us a very clear picture of the field's ability to hold moisture.\" Using the sensor and a patented mounting system, Adamchuk placed seed where soil water content was at field capacity. This varied from one to three-inch planting depth. He found that root systems planted shallow in wet soils were larger and yields were better than in conventional planting at the 2-in. depth.  While deeper planted corn showed no advantage, Adamchuk suspects that might be different in a dry year. Sensing soil temp and moisture In addition to its nitrate sensor, Climate Corporation is working on its own on-the-go, soil moisture and temperature sensors, however, Mark Young, chief technology officer, doesn't consider Adamchuk and other sensor developers as competitors. In fact, he welcomes their development.  \"We can't do it all,\" says Young. \"We are working on building out our nitrate sensor and other sensors, but we aren't a sensor company.\" That's not to say the company isn't excited about the sensors it is developing. Chief scientist Sam Eathington reports that testing it this summer has demonstrated they can deploy the rugged sensor and it can handle dry and wet cycles, while delivering accurate data. \"We are in the early research and development stages,\" he says. \"We are now testing it to withstand tillage tool mounting and will be in a position to scale up production of sensors for more field testing next year.\" Drive all data to one platform While the sensors are intended to be important tools for farmers, like the company's other tools such as Weather Data and Nitrogen Advisor, they are products designed to push a platform. Climate Corporation is a platform company that seeks to integrate multiple levels of data for analysis and decision-making by the user.   Young compares it to Amazon and Google start-ups. Each developed a successful product that drove people to use their platform to introduce additional innovative products. Climate Corporation is betting the string of products associated with FieldView has created a large enough base (92 million acres at last count, with 14 million paid subscribers) that other companies with innovative products will adopt the FieldView platform. This in turn could attract more growers to use FieldView tools. The company's sensor network and work being done on a variety of sensors are designed to further strengthen the argument. \"We made our announcement in part to let the market know where we are headed and to invite conversations with folks we are not already talking to,\" says Young. \"Our network is an open mechanism to get data to a shared system.\" [CHARTBEAT:3] Veris soil technology joins FieldView Veris Technologies is the first company to take advantage of the sensor network. Their sensing technology maps soil texture, organic matter and pH variabilility across fields.  Young notes that such information, regardless of the quality, has little value until paired with other data and applied to field practices. What the FieldView platform adds is the ability to do the pairing. \"With our data science and analytic capabilities, we can turn that data into value for the grower,\" says Eathington. \"Other companies can access growers while focusing on the unique value their sensor provides. Google and Amazon have revolutionized how consumers use the Internet and how companies use Google and Amazon to reach those consumers. Young sees FieldView having that potential for growers as other developers introduce new data gathering tools.  As an example, a company licensing Adamchuks patent or sensor technology could partner with Climate Corporation. Using their FieldView sensory network to reach growers, they avoid having to build their own cloud system, figure out how to get paid, create relationships with other companies and with customers, explains Young. \"The overhead to bring innovation to market is just too high,\" he says. \"With our network, they don't have to invest in table stakes to bring it to market. Just use our network and bring it.\"   "}, {"title": "Demonstrations highlight farming's future", "article": "NIAGARA-ON-THE-LAKE - Hovering above the grapes growing in the experimental field behind Niagara College's Wine Visitor and Education Centre, the drone represents maybe a few hundred dollars worth of investment. The payload it's carrying, an infrared imaging device, is worth considerably more, and the information it's providing is priceless. On Oct. 5, Dr. Mike Duncan and his team working at the college's research and innovation division provided a demonstration of their work using GPS-equipped tools to gather and analyze enormous amounts of data from farmers' fields. This information will provide farmers with a clearer picture of what's going on with their crops - for example the temperatures on the ground, just above the ground and higher. For the past year, Duncan's team has been working on the Niagara College Crop Portal, an example of what's called precision agriculture. Working with more than a dozen Ontario farmers, the project involves gathering and interpreting the field data with the view to providing these farmers with advice on how to manage their crops with more accuracy. As his team drove four-wheeled rovers up and down the vineyards and flew a pair of drones overhead, Duncan explained the combination of the overhead view and ground measurements will allow them to pinpoint problems as they arise, say for example which vines are being affected by disease. \"We combine the two to find out what, exactly, is going on at any particular point in time,\" he said. \"You end up with many ways of determining when and where diseases are happening.\" The key to all this is the combination of a vast array of satellites providing accurate GPS data and increasingly more accessible and inexpensive robotic technology. By way of example, Duncan estimated the sophisticated drones and rovers used in the demonstration represent less than $3,000 in investment - though the instruments they're carrying may be worth considerably more. With automation, Duncan said, he can envision farmers having these devices constantly examining conditions in the field, taking measurements every 15 cm. \"They don't get tired, so they can go up and down and manage your vineyard day and night,\" he said."}, {"title": "Press Release: Deere plans to further expand customer choice in planter market", "article": "Deere plans to further expand customer choice in planter market Canada NewsWire MOLINE, Ill., Oct. 12, 2016 MOLINE, Ill., Oct. 12, 2016 /CNW/ -- Deere & Company (NYSE: DE) has reached an agreement to enable Ag Leader, a precision agriculture competitor, to offer products currently sold by Precision Planting. The agreement is contingent on Deere completing the acquisition of Precision Planting from The Climate Corporation, a subsidiary of Monsanto Company. The agreement will provide Ag Leader the technologies and licenses necessary to manufacture and sell the Precision Planting SpeedTube and related technology, including vSet, vDrive, and DeltaForce, once the acquisition of Precision Planting is completed. The agreement enables Ag Leader to further develop these products and continue delivering innovative solutions for precision agriculture. It also further enhances competition and innovation in the market and expands customers' choices for planting equipment, whether they are buying new machinery or retrofitting older planting equipment made by various manufacturers with the latest innovations in planting technology. The agreement will expand competition and the availability of various planting solutions as Ag Leader will be allowed to sell Precision Planting products using the current names that farmers have come to trust. Importantly, Ag Leader remains a completely independent competitor to Deere and Precision Planting. In November 2015, Deere signed a definitive agreement to acquire the Precision Planting, LLC. equipment business. In August, the U.S. Department of Justice challenged the transaction, delaying its completion, and Deere announced it would contest the DOJ action. For generations, Deere has helped American farmers successfully compete globally. The proposed acquisition would accelerate the development of new precision equipment solutions to help farmers improve productivity and increase yields to help feed a growing global population. Deere anticipates Ag Leader will sell Precision Planting components to retrofit Deere and other brands of planters and will provide a separate and competitive source of supply for OEM planter manufacturers that choose to equip their products with Precision Planting components.

The current roster of students at Don Bosco Catholic Secondary School tallies in at just over 90 grades 11 and 12 students - or 11 per cent of the school's capacity of 840 students. Those numbers represent a stark contrast to the enrolment picture at the school in 2007, when it boasted 948 students in Grades 9 through 12 (or 113 per cent capacity). In response to those declining numbers, the Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB) has approved the initiation of a Pupil Accommodation Review for Don Bosco, during which board staff are required to provide one or more options to address the challenges associated with the school. According to a TCDSB report tabled back in June, the current staff recommendation is to \"close the Don Bosco facility effective for the 2017-18 school year due to significant under-subscription.\" But TCDSB spokesperson John Yan said that while a \"hard closure\" of Don Bosco is an option, it's not one currently on the table. \"An absolute shut down and sell off? No. Don Bosco is currently not for sale,\" Yan said. \"That sort of stuff would be, I think, the last option - and that would be way down the road.\" To discuss options currently on the table, Yan said the TCDSB has scheduled a public meeting for Tuesday, Oct. 25 at 7 p.m. at Don Bosco, 2 St. Andrews Blvd. (off Islington Avenue, north of Dixon Road). \"It's an open meeting, and basically what it is is community-based decision making,\" Yan said. \"At that time, the superintendent and board officials - and hopefully parents and staff - will be there to discuss some options for moving forward with perhaps new programming for Don Bosco.\" While many factors could be at collective fault for Don Bosco's declining enrolment over the years - including changing neighbourhood demographics and the implementation of a now-defunct self-directed learning program at the school - Yan said the pupil accommodation review committee's task will be to look at new programming models that might help reverse that trend at Don Bosco. One of those potential new models could mean the future implementation of the Specialist High Skills Major (SHSM) program at Don Bosco. SHSM is a ministry-approved specialized program that allows students to focus their learning on a specific economic sector (i.e., agriculture, business, construction, hospitality and tourism, transportation, etc), while meeting the requirements to graduate from secondary school. \"There is currently already a hospitality/culinary arts program at Don Bosco and it's one of their most popular courses,\" Yan said. \"And at one point, Bosco also had a very successful automotive program, so that could have SHSM potential, as well.\" \"All the options are going to be put on the table,\" he added, noting that the accommodation review committee's final report is expected to be presented to the TCDSB board of trustees by early January."}, {"title": "Internet of things set to go into orbit; Vancouver firm's satellites will monitor low-cost Earth sensors", "article": "Vancouver-based Helios Wire is planning to launch 30 satellites into space with enough bandwidth to monitor five billion sensors on Earth and thoroughly disrupt the cost structure of the Internet of Things. Helios plans to send two low-cost satellites into orbit in 2018 and launch about 28 more during the next three years - all for less than $100 million. This in an industry that reckons infrastructure investments in billions of dollars. If that sounds overly ambitious, maybe you haven't met co-founder and CEO Scott Larson, the man who got high-definition cameras installed on the Russian module of the International Space Station for free. Well, almost free. The Russian space agency gets access to highdef images of Russia for its trouble. UrtheCast - now run by Larson's brother Wade - is projecting revenue of more than $60 million this year for its image services. The planned Helios network will use 30 MHz of S-band spectrum to receive tiny data packets from billions of Earth-bound sensors with its satellites and then relay the data back to the surface. \"S-band spectrum is really wellsuited to short pings of data and it will allow us to connect to a huge number of devices,\" said Larson. \"It's going to allow us to build out a space-enabled Internet of Things network.\" What kind of information the sensors send is limited only by the imagination and, perhaps, the technical limitations of sensor technology. A short list would include location, altitude, moisture, temperature, soil Ph, nutrient levels, pressure and even motion, if it's applied to, say, an African rhino. \"The system is particularly wellsuited to monitoring things that are remote or moving over large distances,\" he explained. The first two satellites will only be able to receive and relay data three times a day, so applications that require more frequent data hits - such as transportation logistics - will have to wait. When the full network of satellites is deployed, data packets can be picked up every five minutes as successive satellites pass over sensor locations on Earth. \"In Nigeria, they lose about $3 billion a year from people puncturing pipelines to steal oil,\" he said. \"With frequent data hits they could monitor for drops in pressure or even vibrations on the line.\" Early adopters of the service are likely to be farmers working with precision agriculture systems and utilities using smart meters. The cost of monitoring - perhaps less than $1 per sensor per month, according to Larson - is a fraction the price of typical IoT services. The goal is to put IoT services within the reach of modest-sized businesses. Self-powered sensors about the size of a credit card can be attached to anything from trucks and train cars to soil monitors and elephants. Helios is working on designs for sensors that would last five times longer than conventional GPS sensors, an advantage for applications that present installation challenges. \"If you tag an elephant in the wild with a GPS system, you have to capture and drug that animal every two years to replace the sensor,\" Larson said, noting his company is already in talks with wildlife groups in Africa. Helios is currently armed with $1 million in seed capital acquired from the five co-founders and some friends, enough to start assembling staff. But to pay for two $3-million satellites and their delivery to space, several more rounds of financing will be required, this winter, next spring and early summer. \"We need to raise about $12 million between now and next July,\" he said. The first two backpack-sized satellites are being assembled by California-based Astro Digital. \"They are pretty straightforward as satellites go and Astro Digital had an existing satellite that is perfect for this application,\" said Larson, who expects to have contracts with two launch providers by the end of October. The company's focus will soon turn to sensor design - customized for their clients' needs - and analytic suites their customers can use to make sense of the data coming back from space. Until now, IoT was available only to governments and large corporations. \"Space is hard, but it's getting easier and we think we have the technology now to really democratize the Internet of Things,\" he said. Up to 24 billion IoT devices will be connected to the Internet by 2020, a market that is estimated at up to $6 trillion. rshore@postmedia.com"}, {"title": "Farmers Edge; Farmers Edge Partners with Mazergroup, North America's Largest New Holland Provider, to Expand Precision Agriculture Services in the Canadian Prairies", "article": "2016 OCT 11 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Information Technology Newsweekly -- Farmers Edge(TM), a global leader in precision agriculture and independent data management solutions, announced it has partnered with Mazergroup, North America's largest provider of New Holland equipment and one of Manitoba and Southeastern Saskatchewan's most trusted suppliers of farm machinery and services.

If they're a big enough operation to have hired help, they might able to hand over the reins for a few days. But in Canada, more than 95 per cent of the country's 200,000-ish farms are family farms. Some of the bigger ones have employees who are not relatives. But many count solely on their family to carry the load. That's the way it is with fourth-generation dairy farmer Tim May, 45, of Rockwood, just outside Guelph.  He, his wife Kirsten (a veterinarian), son Andy, 18, and daughter Abby, 15, maintain a very traditional - and very successful - 40-cow dairy operation, by themselves. Like a round-the-clock convenience store, their farm, Mayhaven, is a 24-hour-a day, 365-day-a-year business. Cows need milking not once, but twice, every day. They also need feeding, mucking and sometimes help with birthing, not to mention the regular upkeep on the buildings where they're housed, fed and milked. So for the Mays, every week is Ontario Agriculture Week. Even a small, short getaway requires huge preparation Finally last spring, they decided to go for it. They put their collective heads down, and carved out time for a two-day visit to see relatives, near Kingston. They hired a level-headed neighbourhood kid on a co-op program named Steven Jackson to hold down the fort, and headed off down the 401. Not exactly the Caribbean. But a road trip, nonetheless. Then, though, came the text. Shortly after arriving from their four-hour trek, the Mays received an alarmed message from Jackson, saying a young member of the herd was ready to deliver her first calf. Don't bother calling the veterinarian. Nature wouldn't wait. And there was no way Tim could get back in time. So he rolled up his e-sleeves, hunkered down - and called up FaceTime. Then, for the next 20 minutes, his relatives peered over his shoulder in amazement, as May walked Jackson through the entire delivery preparation on his Smartphone. Jackson held the phone near the cow's reproductive parts, while May told him what to do: reach into the cow's womb, check the unborn calf for a movement response and for correct positioning (to slip easily through the birth canal) and if the cow had dilated enough for delivery. Acting on May's commands, Jackson responded with Doogie Howser-like precision. In the end, the calf - he thinks it's the one they now call Precious - came into the world via the 3x4 screen. Now, it's appropriate that technology would be used to deliver a dairy calf, in particular. Dairy has long been one of farming's most technical and technologically advanced sectors. Producers such as May go to great lengths - and use many precision techniques such as highly detailed, immediate production reports on every cow - to keep their animals healthy and keep milk safe. That means impeccable attention to detail, from start to finish - birthing,  weaning, mixing the right feed rations, providing comfortable housing, and finally, properly storing milk in a bulk tank before it's shipped it off the farm to a processor, every two days. It's a tight ship, even though on the outside it may appear traditional. May once had his eye on a veterinary career. But then his dad Paul, who still works with him from the farm next door, needed a double knee replacement, and couldn't look after things. But it's left him with no regrets. In fact, it turned out to be the start of a 25-year journey that has seen Mayhaven rise to among the most elite dairy herds in Canada. According to the CanWest Dairy Herd Improvement organization, Mayhaven consistently ranks in the top five per cent of the top herds in the province. That's a product of good genetics and good management: the Mays can trace every member of their modern-day herd back to their great-grandfather's original herd. It's also a product of research, which is a strong element of Canada's dairy sector. May's been involved in several on-farm research studies led by the nearby University of Guelph, about methane gas production, insect control, pain management and more. As well, he routinely offers Guelph veterinary students the opportunity to visit and see how a real dairy farm operates. And he's on the third update of his environmental farm plan, a peer-reviewed initiative designed to help farmers find and eliminate unsustainable practices on their farms, such as excessive water run-off from fields into rivers and streams.   May gives the public a peek at Mayhaven through his popular Farmer Tim Facebook page, which now has 9,000 followers. He wades into detailed discussions about hot consumer topics, such as raw milk (\"avoid it\"), genetically modified organisms (\"they're harmless\") and animal welfare (\"check out our cows' rubber mattresses\"). He also takes part in the Ask The Farmers Facebook group, populated by farmers across North America answering questions and clearing up misconceptions about agriculture. The biggest one? \"People sometimes forget farmers have a vested interest in food safety,\" says May. \"But we're consumers too. We have families like everyone else. We eat what you eat; we don't have a separate source of food just for ourselves. We want all food to be safe.\" And any brief, precious holidays to be stress-free.  Food Funding * Futurists predict the next food revolution will be driven by researchers armed with big data, to help make farming more sustainable than ever. But no one thought those researchers would hail from the labs, fields, and classrooms of some of Canada's agriculture and food universities - until now. Earlier this month the universities of Guelph and Saskatchewan received more than $150 million from Ottawa for massive seven-year projects focused on big data and food production. * The University of Guelph's project is called Food From Thought: Agricultural Systems for a Healthy Planet. Its goals are to use big data to enhance biodiversity, produce safe and nutritious food and improve animal welfare and human health. * IBM Canada is participating as a key industry partner. It's helping secure cloud-based storage for the reams of information that will be gathered through super computing, and from precision agriculture technology that has already started appearing on Canadian farms.  * In Western Canada, the University of Saskatchewan is leading a worldwide network of water researchers using big data for a project called Global Water Futures. New science being developing there will help farmers plan for crops that can handle climate extremes and other conditions that affect water. \"Floods kill, but also destroy farms and farmland and disrupt agricultural production, while droughts threaten production and the viability of farms and communities,\" says program leader John Pomeroy. * Support for these projects is coming from the Canada First Research Excellence Fund, which helps top Canadian post-secondary institutions turn their key strengths into world-leading capabilities. Thirteen projects worth more than $900 million were funded.

Farmers Edge will direct the funding to developing the next generation of its hardware, software and agronomic decision support systems, with an explicit focus on developing the environmental sustainability aspects of the system. \"Sustainable Development Technology Canada is proud to support the commercialization of innovative technology from Farmers Edge,\" said Leah Lawrence, SDTC President and Chief Executive Officer. \"This project will create green jobs for the local economy, increase efficiency in the agricultural sector and provide economic and environmental benefits for all Canadians.\" With the SDTC investment, Farmers Edge, alongside its partners, will develop a comprehensive precision data management platform with the ability to capture, visualize and analyze zone-specific information that incorporates multiple variables that impact crop performance, including: weather, soil processes, disease and pest impacts, as well as the constantly shifting interplay of crop prices with input and equipment costs. With this level of data specificity, Farmers Edge is aiming to reduce nitrous oxide emissions by 10%, improve water use by 20%, and significantly cut phosphorous and nitrogen levels in critical water resources. 2016 has been a pivotal year for Farmers Edge as it expanded its global presence into new states in the U.S. and entered the Brazilian and Australian agriculture markets. The company was recently named a Technology Pioneer by the World Economic Forum as well as Canada's Disruptor Innovator of the Year by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC).

Farmers Edge, a precision-farming and data-management specialist, said the three-year project will enable it to further develop and enhance its flagship product -- an integrated farm management software platform called FarmCommand. The platform collects and compiles data from a variety of sources -- satellite imagery, soil testing, data analytics and computer modelling -- to produce a \"variable-rate prescription\" for how farmers should apply fertilizer to their fields, among other things. That includes not only when to apply it, but also where to apply it, how much to use and even which fertilizer to use. The goal is to optimize the return on their fertilizer costs and minimize damage to the environment, said Dan Heaney, vice-president of research and development and agronomy for Farmers Edge. \"If you can optimize the fertilizer use from a crop-production standpoint, that generally results in a better environmental outcome,\" he said. He noted, for example, fertilized crops emit a greenhouse gas called nitrous oxide. \"There is science that shows by improving the management of your nitrogen (fertilizer) by using technologies like variable rates, you can significantly reduce the nitrous oxide emissions from the cropping system,\" he said. \"If you can apply this to millions of acres, it really starts to become a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions associated with fertilizer use.\" If they can reduce the amount of phosphorus from fertilized fields that drains into rivers and streams, that will have a positive effect on the environment, he said. \"This is particularly germane to the Manitoba situation because of the issues around Lake Winnipeg... phosphorus-loading into the lake and the reduction in water quality.\" The company works mostly with farmers in Western Canada, and has some clients in Australia, Brazil and the United States. Heaney said Farmers Edge got a $6.1-million research grant from Sustainable Development Technology Canada (SDTC) to help pay for the project because of its environmental benefits. Navdeep Bains, minister of innovation, science and economic development, announced last week SDTC is investing more than $39.6 million in 14 clean technology projects in Canada. The projects span a number of sectors, including agriculture, waste management, energy utilization, power generation and energy exploration and production. \"The investments... demonstrate clean technology's ability to deliver tremendous economic and environmental opportunities to Canadians,\" SDTC president Leah Lawrence said. \"SDTC works to bring economically viable innovations to market. The goal is to support globally competitive Canadian companies that produce tangible environmental benefits that also make Canada's economy more competitive.\" Heaney said the funding will allow Farmers Edge and its research partners to do more than they could have done on their own and do it faster. \"We're looking at doing in three years what probably would have taken us five or six if we'd been left to our own devices,\" he added. murray.mcneill@freepress.mb.ca"}, {"title": "Deere & Co. wants to make tractors smarter", "article": "Not in the market for a new tractor? Deere & Co. would like to sell you all the equipment to make your older one smart. With slumping crop prices, the Moline, Ill.-based company is seeking to combat slowing sales by selling farmers bolt-on products - modems, navigation devices, sensors and software. In the process, it's joined the race for a \"precision farming\" market that could be worth $240 billion by 2050, according to Goldman Sachs Deere's AutoTrac system includes an auto-steering kit and a monitor that lets farmers set the most accurate course in fields for planting, applying fertilizer and pest control. It's just one component of the company's venture into the world of agriculture technology that promises growers less waste and reduced input costs as they deal with declining incomes. \"It's an important topic for Deere, the industry and investors,\" said Larry De Maria, an analyst at William Blair & Co. in New York. \"Bigger and faster is no longer the mantra. It's about productivity and efficiency.\" What's notable about Deere's technology offerings is that the company is taking an agnostic approach as to whether new devices are added to tractors made by competitors. On its website, the company touts that the AutoTrac Universal 200 package is available in a variety of colours - not just Deere's iconic green and yellow. That approach underscores how much the company's fortunes are tied to the financial health of farmers. In an environment of declining crop prices, many growers aren't willing to purchase new tractors that can cost around $360,000 and are either squeezing production out of existing equipment or turning to auctions for used tractors and combines that cost half as much. The slump for crop prices means analysts expect Deere's profit for its fiscal year that ends next month will fall to the lowest since 2009. Deere is moving toward a \"holistic\" strategy of selling parts that can be used on any machine already working fields, said Ronald Zink, the company's director of on-board applications. Productivity and efficiency have never been more important to farmers, Zink said. In some cases, that means that tractors built before GPS was a part of the world's lexicon are getting an upgrade. Earlier this month, the company released an update to its Harvest Mobile application that can be used with older equipment. One function of the software allows farmers to gauge the performance of different seed varieties, which can help them make early planting decisions for the next season, he said. The increased use of technology can help agriculture overcome what Goldman deems a \"problem of Malthusian proportions\" - an allusion to the scholar Thomas Malthus, who warned of food shortages because of population growth and diminishing arable land. Of course, even with a global population topping seven billion, Malthus has yet to be proven right. Malthus died in 1834, three years before John Deere created the steel plow and founded the company bearing his name. In the almost 180 years that have followed, more powerful machinery coupled with seed technology and improved farming methods have allowed growers to collect ever-expanding grain harvests. Crops can keep getting bigger as Deere, as well as competitors, place an emphasis on so-called variable-rate technology, a process that lets farmers know how much fertilizer, seed or crop protection to apply, when and where. That segment of precision farming has the most near-term momentum, according to Darryl Matthews, senior vice-president at Trimble Navigation, a California-based technology company that said in August its farm data was integrated with Deere's operation centre. The push into technology isn't all smooth sailing for Deere. The Department of Justice last month struck a blow to the company's agriculture technology efforts when it sued to block its purchase of Monsanto's Precision Planting equipment business, saying it would eliminate competition and raise costs for farmers because Deere would control close to 90 per cent of the U.S. market. Both companies said they would contest it. Even as competition heats up, it's unlikely to deter companies from making a bigger push into the industry. Trimble estimates 32 per cent of U.S. farms use some form of variable-rate technology and that 48 per cent will employ it in the next two years. At the same time, companies such as Tel Aviv-based Prospera are focusing on tools that allow growers to monitor the health of their land and crops in real-time. The move to more technology is \"going to grow fast for awhile,\" said Karen Ubelhart, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence in New York. \"We're in the early stages of this digital industrial\" era, she said."}, {"title": "Potash-Agrium deal could face intense scrutiny", "article": "It's unlikely to be easy sailing when Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. and Agrium Inc. take their plans to combine and become the world's top fertilizer company in front of regulators. The blame lies with the timing, said Jonas Oxgaard, a New Yorkbased analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein Co. The Potash-Agrium merger was announced Sept. 12, just two days before Bayer AG clinched a deal to by Monsanto Co. after a months-long chase. Both are among a string of global mega deals that are likely to transform the agriculture industry, something that has sparked protests from farmers. Antitrust officials around the world, who are already grappling with a wave of consolidation across agriculture, will be forced to sort through a new layer of complexities following last week's deals. The grain-market rout has ignited a mergers-and-acquisitions wave as companies that count farmers as their customers deal with falling demand and lower prices. \"Bayer-Monsanto is the big bugaboo, the giant here,\" Oxgaard said. Potash Crop. and Agrium will \"absolutely have a harder, more thorough review,\" in light of the recent deals, he said. Monsanto, the world's largest seed company, accepted Bayer AG's US$66 billion takeover bid seven months after China National Chemical Corp. agreed to acquire Swiss pesticide maker Syngenta AG for about US$43 billion. Meanwhile, DuPont Co. and Dow Chemical Co. plan to merge and then carve out a new crop-science unit. Potash Corp. and Agrium could face scrutiny over the combined company's size, said Seth Bloom, president of Bloom Strategic Counsel, a Washington-based firm that deals with antitrust issues. He estimates that the new company would control the majority of North America's potash production, which could draw the ire of regulators. \"You have two direct competitors with a fairly concentrated market,\" Bloom said in a telephone interview. \"This will attract a lot of scrutiny.\" A combined company would control more than 30 per cent of North American nitrogen and phosphate production, said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Jason Miner. While it's up to Canadian regulators to approve the US$26 billion deal, U.S. producers have already raised concerns with federal agricultural officials about the scope of recent market consolidation, he said. \"Some divestitures will certainly occur,\" Miner said in a telephone interview. \"It's a question of how the U.S. can affect the Canadian thinking if it's anti-competitive.\" Potash Corp. and Agrium expect the transaction will close in mid-2017 and are confident in the value created by the merger and operating efficiencies that will better serve customers, the companies said in an emailed statement. Agrium chief executive Chuck Magro declined to speculate on potential asset divestitures during a call with investors on Sept. 12, but he said the companies \"have every bit of confidence that we can see this transaction go through.\" Members of the National Farmers Union, the second-biggest organization of its kind, met legislators in Washington on Sept. 12 to protest against the deals. Farmer concerns could be a \"big obstacle to the merger,\" for Potash Corp. and Agrium, said Bloom of Bloom Strategic Counsel. Regulators on both sides of the border should consider farmers when they review these deals, said Kolby Nichol, vice-president of business development at Winnipeg-based Farmers Edge Inc., a precision-agriculture company. \"If they're looking to price out fertilizer and they have less people to talk to and less suppliers for that, that's a concern\" for farmers, Nichol said."}]
