[{"title": "Press Release: Agrium Issues 2015 Annual Guidance", "article": "Agrium Issues 2015 Annual Guidance All Amounts Are Stated in U.S.$ CALGARY, AB--(Marketwired - February 23, 2015) - Agrium Inc. (TSX: AGU) (NYSE: AGU) announced today its 2015 annual guidance of $7.00 to $8.50 earnings per share. \"Agrium has implemented annual guidance as part of our ongoing commitment to enhance the level of disclosure and transparency across our business, as the size and stability of our earnings and free cash flow continue to grow,\" said Chuck Magro, Agrium's President and CEO. Prospective 2015 grower cash margins have moved back to historical average levels from the lows experienced in the fall of 2014. We expect the improvement to support normal levels of crop input demand in 2015. Despite some dampening of the crop input market and slightly lower corn acreage, we expect growers will continue to seek out important genetic seed offerings and utilize crop nutrients and crop protection products to ensure they maintain crop yield potential and remain competitive. Under our current North American acreage projections, we expect nutrient demand in North America to be slightly lower than in the preceding fertilizer year, but we anticipate strong spring demand as a result of relatively low fall applications. Based on these and other assumptions, we expect Retail EBITDA to be $1.15-billion to $1.25-billion, and Retail nutrient sales volumes to be 9.7 to 10.2 million tonnes in 2015. Based on our expected increase in utilization rate for our nitrogen assets, we anticipate nitrogen production to total 3.6 to 3.8 million tonnes in 2015. Natural gas prices declined sharply in late 2014, and Agrium has been actively hedging our gas requirements for 2015 since then. Our earnings per share guidance assumes NYMEX gas prices will be between $2.50 and $4.00 per MMBtu in 2015. Agrium's expectation for potash production in 2015 includes incremental production from the expansion project at our Vanscoy mine, for which the tie-in was completed in the fourth quarter of 2014. We expect to produce between 1.9 and 2.2 million tonnes of potash in 2015. Finance costs are expected to be in the range of $215-million to $235-million in 2015, up from 2014 levels. The increase is due to the cessation of capitalized interest on the Vanscoy potash expansion as construction is completed. Agrium's annual effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 27 to 28 percent, which is a return to a more normal level, following a number of adjustments that lowered the effective tax rate in 2014. Total capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $1.2-billion to $1.3-billion, of which approximately $500-million to $550-million is expected to be sustaining capital expenditures. This is a reduction from $2.0-billion of total capital expenditure in 2014, as we complete our Wholesale capacity expansion projects in 2015. Based on the above factors, Agrium expects to achieve annual earnings of $7.00 to $8.50 per share in 2015. These forecasts and additional measures are summarized in the table below.  Guidance excludes the impact of discontinued operations, share based payments expense (recovery), gains or losses on foreign exchange and non-qualifying commodity hedges and non-recurring items. Volumetric and earnings estimates assume normal seasonal growing and harvest patterns in the geographies where Agrium operates.

(TSX:AGU) (NYSE:AGU) announced today consolidated net earnings (\"net earnings\") from continuing operations of $70-million ($0.46 diluted earnings per share) for the fourth quarter of 2014, compared with net earnings from continuing operations of $110-million in the fourth quarter of 2013 ($0.74 diluted earnings per share). The 2014 fourth quarter results included pre-tax share-based payments expense of $25-million ($0.16 diluted earnings per share) and net losses on foreign exchange and derivative positions of $31-million in aggregate ($0.20 diluted earnings per share). The fourth quarter also included a one-time non-recurring tax gain of $7-million ($0.05 diluted earnings per share). Excluding these items, net earnings from continuing operations would have been $115-million ($0.77 diluted earnings per share).(1) On an annual basis, 2014 net earnings from continuing operations were $798-million ($5.51 diluted earnings per share), down from 2013 net earnings from continuing operations of $1.08-billion ($7.31 diluted earnings per share). 2014 net earnings were $720-million ($4.97 diluted earnings per share), compared to $1.06-billion ($7.20 diluted earnings per share) in 2013. Free cash flow was $746-million in 2014 and free cash flow per share was $5.18. \"Agrium once again benefited from the strength of its competitive advantages and diversity, delivering solid fourth quarter earnings across the Company, despite some headwinds in agricultural markets. We undertook downtime to refresh and expand our potash and nitrogen facilities this quarter, which impacted Wholesale earnings in the short term but will drive higher future capacity and utilization rates. Agrium's Retail distribution business demonstrated its operational stability in this environment and achieved record earnings again this year, reporting improvements across all target metrics(2) and with EBITDA(3) surpassing $1.1-billion. Nutrient sales this quarter were impacted by a shortened fall application window due to the late harvest and early onset of winter in the U.S., but this will support demand for the coming spring season.\" commented Chuck Magro, Agrium's President and CEO. \"For 2015, Agrium is focused on executing our strategy and delivering on our operational excellence targets, including ramping up production at Vanscoy, completing the Borger nitrogen expansion and continuing to grow Retail earnings. The recently announced increase to our target dividend payout ratio and share buy-back program is an illustration of our conviction in the strength of our business and future earnings and cash flow generation capability for the company\", concluded Mr. Magro.

Sales Sales decreased by $162-million for the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to the same period last year. Wholesale sales for the fourth quarter decreased as a result of lower potash and nitrogen sales volumes compared to the fourth quarter of 2013 due to an extended outage to complete the tie-in at our Vanscoy potash facility and an outage at our Redwater nitrogen facility. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in the realized selling price for phosphate compared to fourth quarter of 2013, consistent with benchmark pricing. Gross Profit Our gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2014 was $732-million, a decrease of $8-million compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. The main drivers of this variance consisted of:  General and administrative expenses decreased by $13-million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Cash general and administrative expenses decreased by $8-million during the quarter primarily due to a decrease in payroll expense of $5-million. Share-based payments decreased by $3-million due to a lower share price increase during the quarter compared to the same period last year. During the fourth quarter of 2013, we recorded a purchase gain of $257-million from the Viterra acquisition and goodwill impairment of $220-million in Retail-Australia. No goodwill impairment or purchase gain was recorded in 2014. Earnings from associates and joint ventures decreased by $27-million in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to the same period last year due to unscheduled plant outages at our Profertil facility in the fourth quarter of 2014 coupled with the fourth quarter of 2013 having a recovery of $14-million related to a reversal of a gas surcharge provision.  Other expenses increased by $13-million during the fourth quarter of 2014 primarily due to losses on commodity derivatives not designated as hedges due to declining natural gas prices partially offset by a $5-million decrease in potash profit and capital tax related to lower potash production tax accrual in the fourth quarter of 2014. Effective Tax Rate The effective tax rate on continuing operations was (4) percent for the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to 24 percent for the same period last year due to the recognition of a previously unrecognized tax asset. Excluding the recognition of a one-time previously unrecognized tax asset of $7-million, the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2014 would have been 6 percent. BUSINESS SEGMENT PERFORMANCE Retail Retail reported fourth quarter sales of $2.1-billion, which is in line with the $2.1-billion reported in the same quarter last year. Gross profit was a record $614-million in the fourth quarter of 2014, a 5 percent increase from last year's fourth quarter of $586-million. Retail also reported a record EBITDA of $181-million, up $15-million from the fourth quarter of last year (excluding the net effect of one-time acquisition and asset valuation adjustments for Viterra and Retail-Australia made in the fourth quarter of 2013). Retail's international operations supported these record results with higher margins and EBITDA compared to the same period last year. As well, our solid results were achieved in a lower global crop price environment, a late harvest this fall and an early arrival of winter across much of the U.S. compared to last year. This resulted in a shortened application window this fall that reduced demand for nutrients and delayed grower seed commitments this quarter; however, this was offset by strong results for crop protection products. On a full year basis, EBITDA reached a record $1.1-billion in 2014, surpassing last year's record of $957-million (which excludes the one-time items mentioned above). Total crop nutrient sales were $972-million this quarter, down slightly from $1.1-billion in the fourth quarter of 2013. The reduction in sales was due to a 14 percent decline in nutrient volumes in the U.S. this quarter, relative to the fourth quarter of 2013 related to unfavorable weather during the fall nutrient application season. Gross profit for crop nutrients was $156-million this quarter, a decrease of $22-million compared to the $178-million reported in the fourth quarter of 2013. Selling prices for crop nutrients were similar to the fourth quarter of 2013, although per tonne margins declined from $92 per tonne in the fourth quarter of 2013 to $87 per tonne this quarter partly due to a change in the geographic and product mix of the nutrients sold, where a larger percentage of total product sold was outside of the higher profit margin U.S. market. Total crop nutrient margins as a percentage of sales were 16 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014, slightly below the 17 percent reported in the same quarter last year. Crop protection product sales were $552-million in the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to $511-million in the same period last year. Higher sales were seen late in the fourth quarter, particularly wholesale sales to dealers. Gross profit was $260-million this quarter, compared to $205-million reported in the fourth quarter of 2013. Crop protection margins as a percentage of sales were 47 percent this quarter compared to 40 percent in the same period of 2013. Much of the increase in margins was due to higher rebates during the quarter from achievement of certain sales measures with several significant North American suppliers coming later in the year compared to the same period in 2013. Seed sales were $91-million in the fourth quarter of 2014, down slightly from the $95-million reported in the fourth quarter of last year. Gross profit was $50-million this quarter, down from $60-million reported in the same period last year. The reduction in sales revenue and gross profit was primarily due to a decrease in planted winter wheat acres and lower supplier rebates this quarter. Seed margins as a percentage of sales were 55 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014, a reduction from the 63 percent reported in the fourth quarter of 2013. Sales of merchandise in the fourth quarter of 2014 were $211-million, compared to $228-million in the same period last year. Gross profit for this product line was $30-million this quarter, similar to the fourth quarter of 2013. Margins on merchandise sales this quarter were 14 percent, a one percent increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. The lower sales and increase in overall margins as a percent of sales was primarily due to exiting the low-margin wool export business in Australia as well as the implementation of a SKU (stock keeping unit) reduction program for general merchandise in Australia. Services and other sales were $231-million this quarter, compared to the $216-million reported in the fourth quarter of 2013. Gross profit was $118-million in the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to $113-million for the same period last year. The increase was due to strong livestock exports from Australia during the quarter. Selling expenses as a percentage of sales was 25 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014 which is up marginally from the 24 percent reported in the same period last year. Retail selling expenses were $514-million for the fourth quarter, compared to $504-million in the same period last year. This variance was due to additional businesses purchased since the fourth quarter of 2013, as well as a higher benefit accrual for U.S. employees. On an annual basis, our operating coverage ratio declined to 72 percent this year compared to 73(1) percent in 2013 due to our continued focus on Retail's Operational Excellence targets during 2014. Wholesale Wholesale's 2014 fourth quarter sales were $897-million, down from the $1.0-billion reported in the same quarter last year. Gross profit was $130-million this quarter, compared to $172-million in the fourth quarter of 2013. Wholesale Adjusted EBITDA was $150-million in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to $237-million reported in the same period last year. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to the planned downtime at the Vanscoy potash facility to tie-in the one million tonne potash expansion project and lower ammonia sales volumes resulting from the earliest winter season in the U.S. in over ten years. This was partially offset by stronger results for phosphate. Nitrogen gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2014 was $113-million compared to $129-million in the same quarter last year. Nitrogen sales volumes were 879,000 tonnes, a decrease from the 907,000 tonnes in the same quarter last year. The decrease was primarily due to lower ammonia sales volumes which were impacted by the unusually early onset of winter in the U.S. and downtime at our Redwater nitrogen facility to replace the waste heat boiler within the quarter. Realized sales prices and benchmark prices for most nitrogen products were similar to last year, although urea prices were higher year over year. Nitrogen cost of product sold was $331 per tonne this quarter, slightly above the $314 per tonne reported in the fourth quarter of 2013. Cost of product sold per tonne was impacted by extended maintenance work at the Redwater facility related to the planned replacement of the waste heat boiler this quarter. Average nitrogen gross margins were $128 per tonne this quarter, compared to $144 per tonne in the same period last year.  Agrium's average natural gas cost included in cost of product sold (which includes transportation and administration costs) was $3.47/MMBtu this quarter ($3.62/MMBtu including the impact of realized losses on natural gas derivatives), compared to $3.51/MMBtu for the same period in 2013 ($3.39/MMBtu including the impact of realized gains on natural gas derivatives). Derivative gains or losses not designated as hedges are included in other expenses and not in cost of product sold, thus are not part of the calculation of gross profit. The average U.S. benchmark (NYMEX) natural gas price for the fourth quarter of 2014 was $3.94/MMBtu, compared to $3.63/MMBtu in the same quarter last year. The AECO (Alberta) basis differential was a $0.77/MMBtu discount to NYMEX in the fourth quarter of 2014, an increase from the $0.62/MMBtu discount in the fourth quarter of 2013. Potash gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2014 was a loss of $50-million, compared to a profit of $39-million reported in the same quarter last year. Sales volumes were 19,000 tonnes this quarter compared to 344,000 tonnes in the fourth quarter of 2013. The decrease in sales volumes was a result of the Vanscoy mine being out of production for the majority of the fourth quarter to complete the planned tie-in of the one million tonne expansion project. The tie-in was completed and the mine recommenced production in late December 2014. Realized sales prices for potash in North America were $375 per tonne compared to $353 per tonne in the same period last year as all current sales volumes were in the domestic market, which is consistent with a similar increase in benchmark pricing. Gross margin per tonne was impacted by high ongoing costs related to the tie-in activities, which were allocated over very low sales volumes. Phosphate gross profit was $37-million in the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to a loss of $4-million in the same quarter last year. Phosphate sales volumes were 305,000 tonnes in the fourth quarter of 2014, a 7 percent increase from 285,000 tonnes in the same quarter last year due to strong operating rates and good regional demand. Realized phosphate sales prices were $656 per tonne this quarter compared to $560 per tonne in the same period last year, which is consistent with a similar increase in benchmark pricing. Phosphate cost of product sold was $534 per tonne in the fourth quarter of 2014, a decrease of $42 per tonne compared to the same period last year as a result of improved operating rates and efficiencies at the Redwater facility and lower fixed costs per tonne at both the Redwater and Conda facilities. Gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2014 was $122 per tonne compared to a negative $16 per tonne in the same period last year. Ammonium sulfate, Environmentally Smart Nitrogen (\"ESN(R)\", hereinafter referred to as \"ESN\") and other gross profit was $27-million this quarter compared to $14-million in the same quarter of 2013. Ammonium sulfate gross profit was $14-million this quarter, $4-million higher than same period last year due to higher sales volumes and realized sales prices. ESN gross profit was $13-million compared to $2-million in the fourth quarter of 2013. This increase is due to higher realized sales prices and lower production costs in the current quarter. Purchase for resale gross profit for the fourth quarter was $9-million higher than the same period last year due to higher margins in the current period. Wholesale expenses in the fourth quarter of 2014 were $46-million compared to $13-million in the same period last year. The increase is a result of $15-million in natural gas derivative losses in the current quarter (2013 - $3-million gain) largely due to the recent decline in North American natural gas forward curve prices as well as lower realized income from our equity investments in 2014 partly due to a reversal of a gas surcharge provision in 2013. Other EBITDA for our Other non-operating business unit for the fourth quarter of 2014 was a net expense of $78-million, compared to a net expense of $94-million for the fourth quarter of 2013. The decrease was primarily due to a $9-million decrease in general and administrative expenses related to lower share-based payments and payroll expenses and $13-million non-recurring Viterra acquisition costs incurred in 2013. OUTSTANDING SHARE DATA Agrium had 143,729,524 outstanding shares at January 31, 2015. At that date, under our stock option plans, shares expected to be issued for options outstanding were negligible.  The agricultural products business is seasonal in nature. Consequently, comparisons made on a year-over-year basis are more appropriate than quarter-over-quarter comparisons. Crop input sales are primarily concentrated in the spring and fall crop input application seasons. Crop nutrient inventories are normally accumulated leading up to each application season. Our cash collections generally occur after the application season is complete. ADDITIONAL IFRS AND NON-IFRS FINANCIAL MEASURES Certain financial measures in this news release are not prescribed by IFRS. We consider these financial measures discussed herein to provide useful information to both management and investors in measuring our financial performance and financial condition. In general, an additional IFRS financial measure is a measure relevant to understanding a company's financial performance that is not a minimum financial statement measure mandated by IFRS. A non-IFRS financial measure generally either excludes or includes amounts not excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS. Non-IFRS financial measures are not recognized measures under IFRS and our method of calculation may not be directly comparable to that of other companies. These non-IFRS measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. The following table outlines our additional IFRS financial measures, their definitions and how management assesses such measures. As the measures set out below are presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this news release, they are classified as additional IFRS financial measures where they reflect consolidated Agrium and as non-IFRS financial measures where they do not reflect consolidated Agrium, including references to EBITDA when presented on an operating segment basis.  The following table outlines our non-IFRS financial measures, their definitions and usefulness, and how management assesses each measure.  MARKET OUTLOOK Prices for most major grains and oilseeds increased in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to the end of the third quarter of 2014, but remained below year ago levels due to the record global production in 2014. Between September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2014, corn, wheat and soybean prices increased by 24 percent, 23 percent and 12 percent respectively, despite a decreasing commodity price environment. Prospective 2015 grower cash margins have moved back up to historical average levels, which we expect to support normal levels of crop input demand in 2015. North American corn and total seeded acreage is expected to decline slightly in 2015; however, this will be dependent on the final size of the South American crop, where weather conditions have been volatile so far this growing season. The lower crop price environment has had some dampening impact on the crop input market. However, we expect growers will continue to optimize use of crop inputs, including high quality seed offerings, to ensure they maintain crop yield potential and remain competitive. The delayed 2014 harvest in the U.S. combined with historically early arrival of winter weather narrowed the window for application of post-harvest herbicides and crop nutrients. Under our current North American acreage projections, we expect domestic nitrogen, phosphate and potash demand to be slightly lower in 2014/15, but we anticipate that spring demand will be strong as a result of relatively low fall applications. Global urea demand has been supported by unseasonably strong Indian urea import purchases in the first quarter of 2015. U.S. urea import demand has also been strong, as offshore urea imports were up almost 50 percent in the July through December 2014 period compared to the relatively slow import pace from a year ago. China exported a record 13.6 million tonnes of urea in 2014 and we expect similar export volumes in 2015. The change in the Chinese export tariff to a flat rate year round will likely spread the volumes out more evenly throughout the year, leading to a higher proportion of first half exports and lower proportion of second half exports than has been typical in recent years. We expect the combination of more adequate urea supplies in North America and increased first half export supplies from China will lead to less seasonal volatility in urea prices in 2015. The global potash market has been relatively stable in recent months. Tightened export supplies resulting from the flooding of a major Russian mine have been partly offset by uncertainty over Chinese potash supply agreements for 2015. We anticipate relatively tight supply and demand conditions in the first half of 2015 due to low beginning inventories in North America, capacity constraints in Canada resulting from ramp-up of brownfield expansions and expected strong North American potash demand this spring. The phosphate market started the year off with some improvement to market conditions due to relatively strong demand and reduced productive capacity primarily in North America. Brazil imported record volumes of phosphate and other nutrients in 2014, in spite of lower commodity prices. While Brazilian imports are projected to decline slightly from 2014 levels due to expected lower crop area and prices, they are anticipated to remain at historically high levels.

The answer is \"yes\" and \"no.\" There are some long-term consumer trends that the Canadian value chain, from crop developers through farmers and exporters, must address. The broad category of sustainability is one of these areas. As incomes around the world rise, consumers are asking more and more often where their food comes from. These are precisely the consumers that Canada depends upon to pay a bit more for our high quality production. \"Sustainability\" is not a short term fad. It is a consumer trend that food companies (our customers) have been experiencing for years. Canada has a good story to tell when it comes to sustainability. I am happy to go onto the world stage and talk about Canada's clean air, clean water and sustainable production practices. Modern agriculture practices, including the use of varieties derived from modern plant biotechnology and precision farming are improving soil health, conserving water, reducing erosion, improving nutrient efficiency and much more. The Canadian grains and oilseed industry will continue to address this challenge through the Canadian RoundTable for sustainable crops. But addressing consumer trends should not be confused with trying to jump on the bandwagon of the latest Internet and celebrity fads such as gluten free and the Paleo Diet. These fads will fade to the past like the Atkins or the South Beach diets but until they do, farmers and other industry leaders must respond. The first thing we need to do is weed out the fads from the real consumer trends. A good starting point comes from recognizing that a fad is usually a thinly disguised way for a celebrity to make a bit more money, usually by convincing consumers to be afraid of something. By not responding, agriculture is giving permission for the fad to become fact. The low-carbohydrate phase of the past decade did real damage to the reputation of cereal grains and the important role they play in a well-balanced diet. The misinformation at the heart of the current gluten-free fad is further weakening public perception of cereal crops. The Canadian grain industry needs to continue addressing the misinformation behind diet fads. How do we do that? We must respond with solid scientific fact. For example, there is no scientific backing to claims that glyphosate causes autism, and there is no scientific link between modern biotechnology and negative health impacts, despite the many millions of dollars spent searching. Unfortunately, technical scientific journals do not catch on in social media nearly as well as the latest fear-driven fad. We cannot deviate from a solid foundation of strong science, but we can present information in a way that is much more accessible to the ordinary consumer, such as social media. Farmers must be part of this communication effort. Why are modern agricultural practices more sustainable than the ways of our grandparents? Every farmer in Canada can tell this story, and it's a good story. For starters, clouds of dust don't block out the sun from the Rockies to the Ontario border, better water management practices are allowing farmers to produce in years where moisture is scarce and we don't see the grasshopper plagues that past generations recall. On top of that, farmers are producing more, and increasing the quality of the product delivered to world markets. This is a message that everyone can understand, even if they do not have a connection to the farm. But it is not good enough to hear this story from people like me who are paid to support Canadian agriculture. Consumers need to hear this message directly from farmers, through blogs, social media and in direct response to the latest fads based on misinformation. Communicating the message of modern sustainable agriculture should become a part of every farms' marketing plan. Some farmers have made the leap and become social media activists. But Canadian agriculture should not rely on only a few to be their agvocates. Many more producers need to participate.

McMaster, who will receive the Joe Fletcher Memorial Award at the Feb. 14 awards banquet in Marritt Hall at the Ancaster Fairgrounds, was recognized for many accomplishments over the course of her life. Among other things, Cathy and her late husband Hugh owned and operated a Massey-Ferguson tractor dealership in Copetown, in addition to contributing a substantial amount of volunteering. McMaster has been involved in the Hamilton-Wentworth Federation of Agriculture (HWFA) and Hamilton's Agricultural and Rural Affairs Advisory Committee. She is also a member of S.H.A.R.E. Agriculture Foundation (Sending Help and Resources Everywhere), a Canadian non-profit that improves the quality of life in rural South American communities. McMaster said the award is a real honour. \"I will look back on it as capping a very productive few decades of my life,\" she said. The treasurer of the Ontario Massey-Harris-Ferguson Club, the Twin-Power Heritage Association, said her agricultural volunteering really began after her husband passed away. \"I said, 'You know what? I'm going to head out and see what the Federation of Agriculture is all about,\" McMaster said from her rural Troy home, the farm purchased by the family in 1980. \"I've never left.\" She noted she's a HWFA director for Flamborough and has worked extensively as of late on the new rural zoning requirements that will affect Flamborough. In her capacity as a member of the agricultural and rural affairs committee, McMaster said she tries to explain country life to city members of the committee. But McMaster said she's not alone, noting many members of the farming community fight the same battle. \"Sometimes people from the urban core of the city don't understand fully what goes on in the country,\" she explained. McMaster noted she was encouraged to join the city committee, but also felt obliged to take part due to her interest in agriculture and the environment. The Saskatchewan-born and Ontario-raised McMaster noted her volunteering was all done because she thought it was important - the idea of winning an award never crossed her mind. \"I will always look back on (the award) as something that - hey that was just very nice to receive,\" McMaster said.

The United Arab Emirates, neighbour to countries where drones are more associated with military airstrikes than benign hobbyists, wants to rebrand the controversial technology in the first Drones for Good competition. More than 800 drone enthusiasts and robotics firms from around the world have entered the government sponsored contest for commercial use for drones in public health, agriculture, town planning, logistics and the environment. Judges had narrowed the field to 19 semifinalists, whose machines have been buzzing over the palms of Dubai's Internet City, an exotic locale where the white robes of the desert culture mingle with the hornrimmed glasses of the engineers. Among the finalists from the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Germany, Spain, the UK, U.S., Switzerland, Kenya and New Zealand is Calgary startup 4Front Robotics, which is presenting a search-and-rescue UAV, the only Canadian design to make it through to the final round. \"Over the years people have been having this connotation that drones are bad and used for [negative] kinds of activities,\" the company's founder and chief executive, Alex Ramirez-Serrano, said in an interview. \"These machines ... have great potential to improve human life and the quality of life that people have here on the planet.\" Mr. Ramirez-Serrano has been a tech geek since he first saw Star Wars in the seventies. Now dividing his time between the robotics firm he founded in 2012 and the University of Calgary, where he is a professor of mechanical engineering, Mr. Ramirez-Serrano wants people to see drones as more than just military hardware. He expects his UAVs to hit the market by the end of this year. The commercial aspect of the drone industry, until now the purview of the military and hobbyists, is quietly starting to take flight. The sector will grow worldwide from a paltry US$72.5 million in 2015, to nearly US$1.1 billion in 2023, according to aerospace and defence analyst, Teal Group Corp. While Phillip Finnegan, director of corporate analysis at the Teal Group, doesn't think the market for commercial drones will be anywhere near the size of the military one in the near future, he does see it \"growing very rapidly as airspace opens worldwide.\" \"Companies are still developing understanding of what the potential applications are that are commercially viable,\" he said in an interview. As competitors demonstrate their drones in Dubai - anything from small whirring copters to large fixed-wing aircraft - they are no doubt focused on the US$1 million cash prize, as well as the keen interest of large aerospace corporations, looking for the next innovative technology. The Drones for Good campaign has attracted participants showcasing machines in a number of do-good categories. 4Front Robotics' UAV, a twin-propeller, carbon-fibre and titanium prototype is assembled with as many off-the- shelf components as possible, but remains nearly 80% custom-made. It's designed for reconnaissance in the event of fire, collapsed buildings, mines, or other urban and industrial entrapments. \"It takes [rescuers] five to eight hours just to determine it's safe for them to go inside,\" Mr. Ramirez-Serrano said. \"When saving lives, minutes count.\" Because of its high manoeuverability, the drone, about the size of a shoebox, is able to enter a small space and navigate narrow hallways, locate victims and check for vital signs. The drone won't speed up the assessment process, but it will allow responders to perform pinpoint rescues once they've determined it's safe. The Canadian team is not the only entrant looking to make disaster relief quicker and safer. FalconViz, a Saudi Arabian company, aims to map disaster areas using UAVs to drop thermal sensors that scan for signs of life. Similarly, Flyability, a Swiss startup, has created a drone with a protective cage able to navigate unknown areas. The UAV can collide with objects, including walls, without destabilizing and crashing. The company says the drone is safe to fly in crowded places, something a fraction of today's drones are able to do. Environmentally minded drones are also on display in Dubai. BioCarbon Engineering, a British team, hopes to use drones to counter deforestation. Their design maps forests and is able to plant new trees using \"seed pods\" dropped by its UAV. Spanish company, HEMAV, has set its sights on patrolling wildlife preserves. Its drone can detect poachers and return their coordinates to rangers, who can then swing into action. A Munich-based startup, Quantum Systems, has designed a model that surveys farmland, enabling farmers to optimize watering and spot diseased areas. Its drone is capable of taking off vertically like a helicopter, and then tilting its propellers to fly as a typical fixed-wing aircraft, like a Harrier jet. The technology can also be used for humanitarian aid, disaster relief and logistic purposes. Eliminating landmines is also on the agenda. Cat-UAV, a Spanish company, has designed a drone that uses sensors to detect the underground explosives. While current demining methods use metal detectors, animals and ground vehicles, all are slow and dangerous processes. Cat-UAV thinks its technology could revolutionize how war zones are converted back to habitable locales. Regardless of who takes home the prize in Dubai, Mr. Ramirez-Serrano is confident about the commercial drone industry's future. \"The technology's maturing,\" he said. \"People are finding more uses and the regulations are being put in place to be able to use these devices. So I think in the near future, we're going to see these drones being used on a regular basis.\" The winner is announced this weekend during celebrations that will also include scouts from the business and tech sectors. dkennedy@nationalpost.com Drones By Sector Canadian businesses and lawmakers are betting drone technology is more than just hype.

It's the latest development in Farmers Edge's efforts to become the ultimate tool for the productive farmer. The carbon-offset deal is with Edmonton-based Capital Power which operates coal and gas power generating stations. Farmers Edge will integrate Nitrous Oxide Emissions Reduction Protocols (NERP) developed by the Canadian Fertilizer Institute into its on-farm data collection tools. The NERP is certified to be eligible for use by the Alberta Greenhouse Gas Reduction Program. Alberta has the only active carbon-offset program in North America. The general parameters of the carbon offset program in Alberta requires every entity that produces more than 50,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to register with the province and every company that produces more than 100,000 tonnes per year must reduce that by 12 per cent per year. If those entities do not meet the target they must pay $15 per tonne to the province or buy an equivalent amount in a verified and registered offset. The deal between Farmers Edge and Capital Power is about the reduction in nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions emanating from the use of nitrogen fertilizer. N2O emissions are 300 times more damaging than carbon emissions. \"This is a very big deal,\" said Wade Barnes CEO of Farmers Edge. \"There are all sort of dynamics at play here.\" For one thing, it will mean Alberta customers of Farmers Edge precision farming tools will have their costs cut in half from $8 to $4 per acre. Capital Power will pay Famers Edge directly and the Winnipeg company then subsequently gets the information verified after the growing season. Barnes said it is part of a much larger movement by food processors and retails -- companies like Walmart and General Mills -- to source products that are sustainably produced and whose sustainability can be verified. \"Big companies are pushing hard,\" Barnes said. Farmers Edge precision farming tools allow many features of the farming process to be recorded against a benchmark, including fuel consumption and exact deployment of fertilizer. \"It is a bear for farmers to do it (on their own),\" said Barnes. The Farmers Edge service can do it for the farmers and the farmer does not have to change his or her practices. And with the emphasis on sustainability, Barnes said that means companies such as Walmart will be more inclined to have its suppliers use primary producers who can verify their sustainable practices. \"We're trying to streamline (the collection of the information) so that the information that qualified for the NERP is the exact same information that will qualify to make a farmer sustainable and would qualify for fieldprint calculator,\" Barnes said. The fieldprint calculator is a widely accepted tool that allows growers to better understand and communicate how management choices affect overall sustainability performance and operational efficiency. \"Our whole strategy is to build this big-data platform that helps with productivity but also fits the sustainability mandate that has been laid out,\" Barnes said. Chelsea Erhardt, environmental markets specialist for Capital Power, said Farmers Edge is the ideal partner for a process like this. \"You have to be able to track it (nitrous oxide emissions) according to a historical base line level down to a very granular level because you want to make sure the offset you are claiming... is 100 per cent guaranteed,\" Erhardt said. \"You don't want anyone gaming the system or incorrectly verifying the reductions or overestimating the emission reductions. Farmers Edge's technology really brings it all together, enabling the farmers to get a benefit from Capital Power investment in the carbon system also ensuring we are buying high quality offsets.\" Clyde Graham of the Fertilizer Institute of Canada said its protocols are not so much about using less nitrogen-based fertilizer as it just doing more productive farming. \"What we are trying to do is grow more food for every tonne of fertilizer applied,\" Graham said. \"The more fertilizer that goes into the crop and into the food that comes from the crop, the less that is likely to be lost to the environment.\" martin.cash@freepress.mb.ca A closer look at Farmer's Edge The Winnipeg agricultural big-data firm now has more than four million acres of farmland under management. (Farmers pay fees according to the number of acres covered by the service.) The company recently received a multimillion-dollar round of financing from one of the largest and most successful Silicon Valley venture capital firms, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. Farmers Edge uses remote satellite imagery, on-farm weather stations and soil testing and precision technology, to optimize the placement of crop inputs, increase sustainability, productivity, and profitability for agribusinesses worldwide. On Monday, the company announced a new agreement with BlackBridge to expand their use of that company's high-resolution satellite imagery. BlackBridge, a German company, operates a worldwide satellite imagery distribution network. This long-term contract grants Farmers Edge access to historical and cropping season imagery to North America, South America, Australia, and Eastern Europe. \"Farmers Edge has been a BlackBridge partner for a number of years. This new agreement will give Farmers Edge global access to outstanding collection capacity and selection of historical RapidEye satellite imagery,\" said BlackBridge's Clint Graumann. \"Our ability to monitor agricultural areas worldwide combined with Farmers Edge's knowledge at the field level will raise the bar in precision agriculture.\""}, {"title": "Agrium Announces Increase to Target Dividend Payout Ratio and a Normal Course Issuer Bid", "article": "CALGARY, AB--(Marketwired - January 22, 2015) - Agrium Inc.

Pursuant to the Bid, Agrium proposes to purchase through the facilities of the TSX, the New York Stock Exchange (the \"NYSE\") and/or alternative Canadian trading platforms, from time to time over the next 12 months, if considered advisable, up to 7,185,866 common shares, being 5% of Agrium's 143,717,326 issued and outstanding shares as of January 19, 2015. \"Increasing our dividend target payout ratio and putting the Bid in place are in alignment with our company strategy and the strength and diversity of our earnings base\", commented Chuck Magro, Agrium's President and CEO. \"We expect our free cash flow generation to increase significantly as we complete our major production capacity expansion projects for nitrogen and potash this year. We believe that the higher payout ratio strikes a balance between returning significant capital to shareholders, while maintaining our core assets and flexibility for growth. The Bid provides an additional avenue to return capital to shareholders, while we also intend to increase our dividend in step with the growth in free cash flow\". In respect to the Bid, Agrium will be limited to daily purchases of up to 117,313 common shares on the TSX, being 25% of Agrium's average daily TSX trading volume of 469,253 common shares during the six months ended December 31, 2014, subject to certain prescribed exemptions available under applicable Canadian rules. The maximum number of shares which can be purchased per day on the NYSE will be 25% of the average daily trading volume for the four calendar weeks preceding the date of purchase, subject to certain exceptions for block purchases. No purchases of common shares have been made by Agrium under a normal course issuer bid during the past 12 months. Agrium is authorized to make purchases during the period of January 26, 2015 to January 25, 2016 or until such earlier time as the Bid is completed or terminated at the option of Agrium. Any common shares Agrium purchases under the Bid will be purchased on the open market through the facilities of the TSX, the NYSE and/or alternative Canadian trading platforms at the prevailing market price at the time of such transaction. Agrium will rely on an automatic purchase plan during the Bid. The automatic purchase plan allows for purchases by Agrium of its common shares during certain pre-determined blackout periods, subject to certain parameters. Outside of these pre-determined black-out periods, shares will be purchased in accordance with management's discretion. The Bid has been put in place because Agrium believes that the repurchase of common shares is consistent with Agrium's objective of delivering a strong return of capital to its shareholders over time. All common shares purchased through the Bid will be returned to treasury for cancellation.

Bradley Convention Centre in Chatham on Jan 28 and 29 with more exhibitors and an expanded speakers' program. The show, hosted by 20/20 Productions, enjoyed an impressive debut last year, attracting 100 exhibitors and a crowd of 2,600 people over the two-day event. This year's edition will include 120 exhibitors featuring the latest agricultural technology and services, all geared toward farmers in southwestern Ontario. \"Farmers can come in and do business right at the show,\" said show producer Stuart Galloway of 20/20 Productions. \"It's not a viewing show by any means; people can actually get business done by attending the show.\" The emphasis on local dealers and suppliers has been a winning formula as Galloway said the exhibitor space has been sold out for three months. \"We've got a long waiting list for people to get into this show.\" The organizers were impressed and surprised by the interest in the speakers' program during last year's event. As a result, they enlisted the help of Thompsons Ltd. to sponsor and help co-ordinate this year's speaker series. Experts have been lined up to discuss agricultural markets, farm succession planning and environmental stewardship. There will also be a panel discussion each day on precision agriculture and the latest cropping techniques. \"We're trying to address what is current in the farm industry and try and provide education and suppliers that can answer the questions for any emerging technology and farming methods that are pertinent today,\" said Galloway. Noting that the organizers were also surprised that people stayed longer than expected last year, he said the parking area has been increased and two lounges have been created where people can network and also receive faster food service. Galloway added that the show will also appeal to non-farmers who are interested in small tractors, lawn equipment and power tools. \"We're quite pleased with the outcome and, hopefully, we can continue to get the support from local farmers and suppliers and continue doing this in Chatham every year,\" said Galloway. The show hours are 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Jan. 28, and from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Jan. 29. Admission is $5. People under the age of 16 are admitted free of charge.

The answer is \"yes\" and \"no.\" There are some long-term consumer trends that the Canadian value chain, from crop developers through farmers and exporters, must address. The broad category of sustainability is one of these areas. As incomes around the world rise, consumers are asking more and more often where their food comes from. These are precisely the consumers that Canada depends upon to pay a bit more for our high quality production. \"Sustainability\" is not a short term fad. It is a consumer trend that food companies (our customers) have been experiencing for years. Canada has a good story to tell when it comes to sustainability. I am happy to go onto the world stage and talk about Canada's clean air, clean water and sustainable production practices. Modern agriculture practices, including the use of varieties derived from modern plant biotechnology and precision farming are improving soil health, conserving water, reducing erosion, improving nutrient efficiency and much more. The Canadian grains and oilseed industry will continue to address this challenge through the Canadian RoundTable for sustainable crops. But addressing consumer trends should not be confused with trying to jump on the bandwagon of the latest Internet and celebrity fads such as gluten free and the Paleo Diet. These fads will fade to the past like the Atkins or the South Beach diets but until they do, farmers and other industry leaders must respond. The first thing we need to do is weed out the fads from the real consumer trends. A good starting point comes from recognizing that a fad is usually a thinly disguised way for a celebrity to make a bit more money, usually by convincing consumers to be afraid of something. By not responding, agriculture is giving permission for the fad to become fact. The low-carbohydrate phase of the past decade did real damage to the reputation of cereal grains and the important role they play in a well-balanced diet. The misinformation at the heart of the current gluten-free fad is further weakening public perception of cereal crops. The Canadian grain industry needs to continue addressing the misinformation behind diet fads. How do we do that? We must respond with solid scientific fact. For example, there is no scientific backing to claims that glyphosate causes autism, and there is no scientific link between modern biotechnology and negative health impacts, despite the many millions of dollars spent searching. Unfortunately, technical scientific journals do not catch on in social media nearly as well as the latest fear-driven fad. We cannot deviate from a solid foundation of strong science, but we can present information in a way that is much more accessible to the ordinary consumer, such as social media. Farmers must be part of this communication effort. Why are modern agricultural practices more sustainable than the ways of our grandparents? Every farmer in Canada can tell this story, and it's a good story. For starters, clouds of dust don't block out the sun from the Rockies to the Ontario border, better water management practices are allowing farmers to produce in years where moisture is scarce and we don't see the grasshopper plagues that past generations recall. On top of that, farmers are producing more, and increasing the quality of the product delivered to world markets. This is a message that everyone can understand, even if they do not have a connection to the farm. But it is not good enough to hear this story from people like me who are paid to support Canadian agriculture. Consumers need to hear this message directly from farmers, through blogs, social media and in direct response to the latest fads based on misinformation. Communicating the message of modern sustainable agriculture should become a part of every farms' marketing plan. Some farmers have made the leap and become social media activists. But Canadian agriculture should not rely on only a few to be their agvocates. Many more producers need to participate."}, {"title": "SST Software Updates Sirrus(R) App With Planting and Crop Protection", "article": "STILLWATER, OK --(Marketwired - January 15, 2015) - The farming industry will find it easier this season to execute better management decisions while in the field. Sirrus, the precision agriculture app by SST Software, now allows users to record and share tillage, planting, fertilizer, and crop protection operations. Last season, Sirrus was used by thousands of crop consultants and ag service providers to collect field boundaries, record soil sampling operations, and gather scouting operations. This data was then synchronized back to an organization's precision ag specialist who used SST's Summit(r) and FarmRite(r) applications to generate nutrient prescriptions, seeding recommendations, and yield correlation reports. \"The new upgrades to Sirrus are important to the farming community,\" says Drew McMahon, Product Manager for Sirrus, \"because they speed up the data collection to application workflow and provide a greater degree of flexibility when making last minute prescription changes.\" Using Sirrus, ag service providers can now create a custom fertilizer or tank mix, then prescribe it to a field or management zone while scouting a field. The crop consultant can send this recommendation and an associated PDF report directly to the grower and applicator. If last minute adjustments need to be made to fertilizer, planting, or pesticide prescriptions prior to application, Sirrus allows edits to be made from the crop advisor's iPad and then passed on to the applicator. McMahon adds that collecting as many field operations as possible plays an important role in creating nitrogen recommendations and yield correlation reports. \"The more site-specific data you can collect,\" says McMahon, \"the better you can treat specific zones and improve on management practices year over year.\" FOR FURTHER INFORMATION PLEASE CONTACT: Contact: Drew McMahon Product Manager, Sirrus 888-377-5334 dmcmahon@sstsoftware.com"}, {"title": "IoT Perspectives' Top 10 2015 Technology Predictions for the Internet of Things ; Predicts 3B Units in 2015", "article": "SANTA CRUZ, CA --(Marketwired - January 14, 2015) - IoT Perspectives, the online magazine that covers and analyzes the business, markets and technologies of the Internet of Things (IoT) announced its top ten 2015 IoT technology predictions. These predictions include: 1. In 2015 3x More Iot Devices Will Ship Than Smartphones. IoT Perspectives forecasts a 55% increase in IoT units shipped in 2015 over 2014. At three billion units, IoT will exceed the one billion units forecast for smart phones projected for 2015. The growth will occur from embedded systems connecting to the Internet, wearables and home automation. 2. There will be no de facto standard for home automation networks in 2015. There are currently at least five standards that are vying for home automation. These include low-power Bluetooth, low power WiFi, Thread's 802.15.4 mesh network and ZigBee. Home networks face a number of problems, including reliability, latency, cost, ease of installation and security. Whichever network solves all these problems, will become the de facto standard. This won't happen in 2015. Five standards are, in effect, no standard. 3. Thread will release its home automation \"standard.\" The 802.15.4 mesh Thread networking standard is scheduled for release in mid-2015. 4. SMD will ship its Bluetooth IP reference design. Sunrise Micro Devices has received its first reference design chip back from the foundry and will ship its reference design featuring its IoT-optimized low-power low-cost Bluetooth IP design this year. 5. ARM will dominate IoT silicon designs. ARM's processor IP currently is found in 95% of smart phones. Its dominance is due to its high-performance, low-cost architecture. For the same reason, ARM will dominate IoT designs. 6. There will be an explosion of IoT startups and products. The technology infrastructure is there. An entrepreneur who knows how to program C or Java Script can build a working prototype for less than $2000. The \"Maker\" community using design kits from Ti, Intel, Marvell's Kinoma Create and others, as well as open source breadboard devices such as Arduino and Raspberry, is a thriving and growing community and will spur under-employed and/or entrepreneurial engineers and programmers to strikeout on their own. 7. High school students will be designing IoT \"Things.\" For the reasons mentioned in item six above, the barrier to entry and learning curve for producing IoT products is very low. Initiatives such as nonprofit Code.org's Hour of Code, Us-ignite's, Bringing Internet of Things Know-How to High School Students and Marvell's Kinoma Create, which donated their IoT prototype design platforms to the UIST Student Innovation Contest, all foster interest and innovation among high school would-be entrepreneurs. 8. Products based on 14nm silicon technology will ship in 2015 offering smaller, more energy efficient IoT devices. Intel and the three big foundries, TSMC, Global, and Samsung are already sampling or shipping 14 nanometer parts. Watch for the next iPhone announcement in the fall of 2015 to include 14nm technology. This means that 14nm technology will be the standard for low-power high-performance semiconductor content in IoT devices in 2015. 9. IoT skepticism will diminish. Articles, studies and talks appeared in 2014 expressing skepticism about the viability of the IoT market. However, IoT has been around for at least 10 years quietly gaining momentum. It sometimes takes 10 years to be an overnight success. What has changed, are the semiconductor technologies that have made sensors, memory and processors so cheap that they can be deployed economically everywhere. 10. Semiconductor companies will become more systems companies than parts suppliers with improving margins. As semiconductors become more dense and more functionality can be incorporated on a single die, all the complexity of an entire system will fit on a chip. Already semiconductor processor suppliers are supplying compilers, operating systems and design infrastructures with their products. Marvell's Kinoma Create is an example of this trend that will continue in 2015. Technology Editor Ron Bingham of IoT Perspectives said, \"2015 is the year when the Grand Convergence of microprocessors, connectivity, sensors, cloud and design ecosystems turn into the Grand IoT Market Opportunity, when smart homes, smart cities, smart farming, smart retail, smart health, smart cars, smart factories, smart toys and games and smart wearables become a reality.

When you start talking about (UAVs), really the sky is the limit. There is so much here that can benefit agriculture. As the technology develops it's going to be more and more prevalent.\" Some of the benefits of getting a bird's-eye view of the farm include: Being able to make timely decisions, data collection, monitoring of plant and livestock health, and cost savings due to greater precision inputs. Colby said today's farmers are strapped for time and talent, and a UAV will save on both. It will also be good for the environment because farmers can be more precise with their inputs while also raising yields. \"And you can put thermal cameras on (the UAV) and check livestock,\" Colby said. \"There is all kinds of great technology.\" And the price producers will have to fork over to get a well-equipped drone that is designed for the farm is less than $4,000. \"You can buy a great platform for under $4,000 and do some great work in the field,\" Colby said. \"Growers get to see their crop like they have never seen it before and that is what we are talking about.\" Technology is advancing rapidly with better sensors and lenses and easier data collection, which means it is easier to find and quantify the value of a UAV. Plus, it is getting cheaper and cheaper, he said. \"(This year) will be the first time you will be able to get data quick in a way that you've never seen before,\" Colby said.

Amateur artists exhibiting for the first time were on display along with the work of seasoned professionals as the second annual Breaking Barriers art exhibit opened at the Family Service Kent offices in Chatham on March 15.A project of the Prosperity Roundtable, funded by the United Way of Chatham-Kent , Breaking Barriers featured 20 artists and 41 works of art. The barriers referred to in the exhibit's title include poverty and the problems that often accompany it, including homelessness, mental illness and addictions. In preparing for the show, local artists were offered a series of free workshops where they received instruction from professionals, with the goal of providing them with a creative voice. Clara Hughes brought her campaign to end stigma around mental illness to Chatham on March 16-17. The Canadian Olympic athlete spoke about her athletic triumphs and her struggles with depression to a full house at the Ursuline College Theatre. She also spoke at the John D.

So says Clarence Nywening in a commentary posted on the Christian Farmers Federation of Ontario blog. Nywening, a CFFO member, broiler-breeder operator and cash-cropper, is speaking about the government's posting of a proposal for enhancing pollinator health and reducing the use of neonicotinoid pesticides in Ontario. With the posting a month ago, the government unveiled its intent to develop a pollinator health action plan through stakeholder engagement, with public meetings and written submissions. The posting should have come as no surprise, Nywening contends. \"The premier's mandate letter to the Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs tasked the ministry with ensuring a significant reduction in the use of neonicotinoid treated seeds in the 2016 growing season through the use of regulations, permits or other measures,\" he writes. \"The letter showed clearly a sense of urgency on this issue.\" Nywening says Ontario farmers have long been able to conduct their business while enjoying a relatively high level of public trust, and the farming community did not take that trust for granted. \"But, recently, the public's concerns on issues such as animal welfare and environmental protection are on the rise and the farm community's shield of public trust seems to have developed some dents,\" Nywening writes. \"The government has shown it will respond to social and environmental concerns of urban consumers.\" Ontario's political landscape has undergone changes and the balance has tipped in favor of urban matters and concerns, he warns. \"There is also a sincere urban population that has become alarmed by the reports\" of a declining bee population, he writes. \"By acknowledging this reality, the farm community can move forward and continue to work with government to look for solutions.\" michael-allan.marion@sunmedia.ca Twitter.com/EXPMarion"}, {"title": "Malcolm F.

And Moloney, the new CEO and executive director for the Global Institute for Food Security (GIFS) located at the University of Saskatchewan, says GIFS can play a key role in achieving that food security. \"We can do that through supplying (food), but also intervening by developing technologies that are suitable for use in developing country agriculture,\" Moloney said. GIFS was founded by PotashCorp, the Government of Saskatchewan and the University of Saskatchewan. PotashCorp has committed $35 million and the province has committed $15 million over seven years in areas that will provide improvements to technology, nutrition and the environment in the food supply chain both in Saskatchewan and around the world. Moloney, who was named GIFS's executive director and CEO in October, said it is unusual to get such a large commitment from private industry in the area of agriculture and food security. \"There is a unique opportunity here to create something in Canada that we've not really had,\" Moloney said. He said that GIFS's research will produce new high-tech technologies that will have an impact on agricultural productivity in Western Canada - in cereals, pulses, oil seeds and protein crops. Some of those technologies can also be modified so they can be used in developing nations to increase yields. For example, creating a seed that does not need pollination and has traits that can withstand drought or other extremes, Moloney said. \"A smart plant that senses its environment and turns on the right traits for the best yield.\" Moloney grew up in the United Kingdom and attended the University of London, taking courses from a number of Nobel Prize winners. Prior to joining GIFS, Moloney headed Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Research Organization. He has also been director and CEO of Rothamsted Research, one of the oldest agriculture research centres in the world, held a number of positions at the University of Calgary and started his own company SenBioSys Genetic Inc. Moloney said there are endless opportunities for the institute and they will need to prioritize those ideas. \"First we want to do world-class, groundbreaking science,\" Moloney said. \"Secondly, find areas that capitalize on all the skills and competencies that are already here in Saskatoon and this campus. \"Third, to look for things that you can actually determine what type of economic impact you would have if the research is successful.\" Areas of research will include studies in seed biology and looking at what goes on below ground. \"(The soil) is teeming with life,\" he said. \"And we are just at the infancy of understanding the biology of soil.\" Another area is digital agriculture, from global positioning to precision yield monitoring. There will be machinery such as an intelligent seeder that knows to seed at a higher density in one part of the field and less in another section, he said. \"We will be designing novel farming equipment that is essentially autonomous,\" Moloney said. \"You can imagine a situation where an awful lot of what a producer does is done from a control room in a farmhouse.\" Most of the money GIFS has committed so far has been funding investments around campus. \"A year from now, the first of our hired scientists will be here with lab space close by,\" he said. Moloney is keen on doing not only the discovery science, but also seeing that science moved down a path to becoming a commercialized product. Much like how the oil industry has embraced digital technology, agriculture can do the same thing that will create a burgeoning industry of small companies, he said. \"In this area of discovery science and crop innovation and application towards food security, I think there is some great opportunities to build,\" he said. \"We want to be a world leader and the science to be at the cutting edge.\" A(c) Copyright (c) The StarPhoenix"}, {"title": "Remember farmers' commitment to us during this holiday season", "article": "Food is a special part of any holiday, including Christmas. It's a time when we should turn our thoughts to the farmers who produce the bounty on our tables. We commend the efforts of those who cook our food, and praise whatever God we believe in for creating it. But we often skip those in the middle, those responsible for growing it or raising it. We should remember them and their commitment to feeding us. Lately, some people have taken to dumping on farmers. They believe they are getting too big and \"corporate,\" based on what anti-livestock, anti-technology activists tell them, and the odd video clip of huge farm machinery. That's not true, although aspects of food production and farming are less back-breaking than they used to be. Mechanization and technology keep reaching new heights, with machines capable of doing some of the grunt work that farmers used to do. For example, a few farms have robotic milkers for cows, and still more have the likes of GPS-assisted tractors that can steer themselves in a field. There are apps for everything, such as weather and grain and livestock prices. And farmers have been early adopters of social media. Researchers at the University of Guelph and elsewhere are helping create affordable technology to help keep production costs and food prices in check. It's part of a drive toward what's called precision farming, where little on the farm is left to chance or waste. On the livestock side, these include selecting and breeding top livestock with the best genetics for immunity (they need less veterinary care), developing barn lights that help naturally increase egg production, and designing a capsule with a tiny transmitter inside that a cow can swallow and send a signal to a home computer. The readings, which could be done on farm, show minute but important internal temperature variations that could signal illness. As far as crops go, researchers are finding ways to add traits that make plants more robust and better able to withstand the wild swings in climate we've been experiencing. Plus, as they learn more about the specific genetics of plants, rather than add genes, they're trying to remove them - potentially harmful ones, such as the peanut gene that causes severe allergic reactions in some people. We still have a long way to go before R2-D2's name is on the family farm mailbox. But technology has always been an integral part of agriculture, and will continue to be as we try feeding more and more people with the same amount of land, or less. Consumers need to hear more about farming from farmers. I spend a lot of time trying to convince farmers of that, and work with them to develop strategies to communicate with consumers and other decision makers. Despite their significance to society, farmers are not as powerful a lobby group as they once were. That was underlined recently when activists solidly won what's become an unfortunate battleground involving pollinators (such as bees) and pesticides. Farmers thought they were doing the right thing by co-operating with a breadth of stakeholders to create well thought-out, pollinator-friendly policy. And wham, they got flattened. Simply put, they can't afford to respond to activists' agendas. They need to control their own. One group I don't have to convince to speak out is my agricultural communications students. They blog, give speeches and write news stories about agriculture, and are proud and enthused to do so. Happy holidays, everyone."}, {"title": "Birtle farm boy goes global - Farmers Edge gaining worldwide attention on way to becoming a billion-dollar company", "article": "Not so long ago, Wade Barnes was just another farm boy from Birtle with a growing agronomy business and some good ideas about how Prairie farmers could use technology to get more reliable productivity out of their acres. Now he's jetting off to London to hobnob with the likes of Al Gore and the guy in charge of Google Earth. It might not be too long before that does not seem unusual even to Barnes, because he's not the only one who believes his agricultural technology company, Farmers Edge, is on a trajectory to become a billion-dollar company. His recent appearance at a by-invitation-only conference in London might have had something to do with his new best friends at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers (KPCB), the blue-chip Silicon Valley venture capital firm that's backed the likes of Google, Amazon, Twitter, Spotify and Uber. Last month, KPCB quietly closed an equity investment in Farmers Edge, giving Barnes and co-founder Curtis MacKinnon the kind of lofty vantage point on the global marketplace not typically available to independent players in the ag consulting/marketing world. \"We're very odd to them,\" said Barnes, 39. \"Companies that go to them have a certain pedigree. They have an idea, raise a Series A round of capital... there is a formula. We had no formula. We did not fit the mould that they would normally invest in.\" Despite the apparent culture clash, by virtue of its track record, technology, vision, legwork and market timing, it turns out Farmers Edge really does have what the successful Silicon Valley venture capitalist is looking for. \"There are lots of disruptive forces in traditional industries today,\" said Brook Porter, a partner in KPCB's Green Growth Fund, the vehicle that did the Farmers Edge deal. \"We see agriculture as being primed for disruption.\" And they see Farmers Edge as being a likely conduit for some of that disruption. In an interview from his office in Menlo Park, Calif., Porter said the Winnipeg company has all the components KPCB looks for: a disruptive technology in a very large market -- \"food and agriculture is a multitrillion-dollar market where there's plenty of acres to build a big company,\" -- a strong founder and management team and... \"it has to have the potential to be a billion-dollar-plus company.\" It's not as if the company is coming out of nowhere. Farmers Edge has been ranked by Profit magazine in the top 20 fastest-growing companies in the country in recent years. For all of Barnes' talk about his lack of sophistication, Farmers Edge had already received a multimillion investment from Calgary-based Avrio Capital. Aki Georgacacos, one of the founders of Avrio, is on the Farmers Edge board and was very encouraging of the KPCB deal. No financial details have been disclosed, something a little unusual for KPCB, which has done about 800 deals over the last 40 years. (One-third of them have gone public with a market cap totalling about $800 billion.) \"There's some strategy around that,\" said Barnes, about the non-disclosure, including the possibility of another round of financing in the works. \"It was decided to keep the industry guessing a bit. Everyone is watching KPCB wondering what is going on. It's driving everyone crazy. No one knows what the valuation is.\" Farmers Edge provides an la carte menu of services using satellite imagery, on-farm weather stations and other scientific tools to identify and map field variability. The collection of data -- including from farm equipment hardware such as combines, seeders, air sprayers etc. -- to optimize crop inputs, resulting in higher yields, better quality and less environmental impact. The concept is referred to as variable-rate technology. The operational reality is precision farming. \"We provide the best field-centric data anywhere in the world,\" said Barnes. Mark Lepp, one of the owners of local farmer marketing firm, FarmLink Marketing Solutions, has known Barnes for a long time. \"They are for real,\" Lepp said. \"They are one of the pioneers of variable-rate fertility game.\" It's an approach that can be applicable around the world, and Farmers Edge is not the only players in that game. In the last couple of years, Monsanto has spent more than $1 billion on planting technology companies. \"Monsanto is trying to catch up to us,\" Barnes said, only half-joking. Despite Barnes' contention that the ag sector is a bit of a strange duck for KPCB to deal with, Porter said they did a very extensive investigation into the sector and see the disruptive potential of new ag technology. \"I think the chemical and feed companies that are multibillion-dollar companies feel that change and they need to adapt,\" said Porter. Farmers Edge may also have the advantage in that this is all it does. \"The farmer does not necessarily want to turn all their data over to a Monsanto,\" said Porter. \"They feel very skeptical about what that data will be used for.\" Porter and KPCB found plenty of excellent technology out there, but Farmers Edge was the only one that had already convinced farmers to use the service. There are about four million acres of farm land in Canada, the U.S., South America and eastern Europe already paying Farmers Edge per-acre fees. \"People know how to take images and look at farm land and assess fertility,\" Porter said. \"That's not that hard a problem. What is really hard is to put it into a system that is real easy for people to use, farmers trust it and can validate it works with their mode of operations.\" Armed with its new KPCB war chest, Barnes will soon be off to Australia and Brazil to convince farmers around the world of his vision of Farmers Edge as a billion-dollar company. martin.cash@freepress.mb.ca Life on the Edge A closer look at Farmers Edge: 130 employees, including about 45 in Manitoba new U.S. office in Omaha (former head office of FarmCommand, which recently merged with Farmers Edge) board members include Joseph Carvin, one of the founders of Altima Partners hedge fund, Anita Wortzman, CEO of Acumen Corporate Development Inc. and former head of mergers and acquisitions for Assante Corp. and Brian Hayward, former CEO of Agricore United."}, {"title": "Trimble Expands PurePixel Solution to Canadian and European Agriculture Markets", "article": "Release date - 17122014 SUNNYVALE, Calif -Trimble (NASDAQ: TRMB) announced today that its PurePixel Precision Vegetation Health solution is now available in Canada and Europe.

The pheromone aerosol dispenser is part of a custom designed controller and sensor network that gives farmers remote access to the conditions in the field 24/7. Remote Precision Control makes it highly effective Once hung in the trees, the Semios in-field sensors monitor the number of pests and combine this with wind and temperature conditions to optimize pheromone deployment. Most common is a metered puff every 15 minutes, 12 hours a day during evening and nighttime hours through the growing season. The combination of remote access to the fields 24/7 and the aerosol trigger release means farmers can deploy the right amount of pheromones only when needed, making it more effective and a less costly alternative to pesticides. Semios is the only pheromone dispenser that can be controlled remotely. Manus Boonzaier, farm Manager for Canada's largest grower and packer of apples, said, \"We deployed Semios pheromones on 35 acres this past season and did not need to use any pesticides on this crop, however a separate control block that we established needed multiple sprays. It was clear the pheromones were highly effective in disrupting the codling moth.\" A Sustainable Solution Pheromones confuse the male insect so that they are unable to find the female to fertilize the eggs, thus diminishing pest populations without killing the pests or using toxic substances. Codling moth is the number one global pest of apples and pears, and the oriental fruit moth is the second. By switching from pesticides to pheromones, farmers worldwide can produce a safer product with less toxicity to the fruit, workers and environment. As the pheromone only targets the specific pest, pollinators and other beneficial insect species are not affected. Semios also offer organic eligible pheromones.

All currency amounts for financial results are expressed in U.S. dollars. In September 2013, the Company's Outback(TM) Ground Agriculture product line switched to a new \"dealer stocking\" sales model in North America where aftermarket revenues are now recorded at dealer net rather than at MSRP, which is approximately a 20% reduction in revenue on the same volume of goods sold. Although aftermarket revenues are lower under this aftermarket dealer program, there is a decrease in commission expense so that gross margin is not impacted. The new model changes the impact of seasonal timing as Outback dealers now purchase stocking inventory months earlier than in the prior model where product was shipped direct to customers from AgJunction inventory. Third quarter Financial Review For the three months and quarter ended September 30, 2014, the Company reported total revenue of $9.6 million, a 16% decrease from $11.4 million in the third quarter of 2013. The lower revenue numbers for the quarter relate to the general softness in the overall global agriculture marketspace, affecting the Company's Outback retail and OEM product lines, however sales in North and South America for the Company's Air product line increased 12% over the same period of 2013. AgJunction is the market share leader in this segment. \"Seasonally, the third quarter is the lowest activity period for our core customer base,\" stated Rick Heiniger, President and CEO. \"During this period we focus resources on business and market expansion while further streamlining operations. This is evidenced by the CLAAS and STARA OEM factory installation contracts we recently announced. These type of business relationships make it possible to emerge from the current industry downturn we're experiencing as a stronger company.\" Sales by business unit for the third quarter of 2014 and 2013 are as follows:  The declines relate to an overall market downturn within the Outback, OEM and Agronomy Services product lines. Increased demand in the North and South America for the Air product line resulted in an increase of 12% over the same period of 2013. Sales by geographic region for the third quarter of 2014 and 2013 are as follows:  Year-over-year, United States and Canadian revenues were 8% lower compared to the third quarter of 2013 primarily as a result of the new aftermarket dealer program that was implemented during the fourth quarter of 2013. North American sales were generally characterized with ongoing softness in the aftermarket agricultural retail space. European revenues were 39% lower year-over-year as the Company's OEM customers slowed production in response to the softened agriculture market. Combined revenue from other markets, including Australia, South America and Asia was 5% lower. Total international (non-North American) revenue decreased 26% year-over-year to $3.8 million, representing 40% of total Q3 2014 revenue compared to 45% in 2013. Consequently North American revenue represented 60% of total revenues in Q3 2014 compared to 55% in 2013. Third quarter, 2014 consolidated gross margin was $3.9 million (41%) versus $5.2 million (46%) in the comparable quarter. The change is due to a decrease in sales volumes and a change in sales mix, partially offset by a decrease in the estimated warranty reserve for certain product lines in 2013. Total operating expenses were $4.8 million in the third quarter, as compared to $5.2 million in the third quarter of 2013 with the reduction related to several cost saving initiatives and efficiencies realized through the restructuring period in 2013. For the third quarter ended September 30 2014, the Company reported a net loss from continuing operations of $0.8 million, or ($0.01) per share (basic and diluted), compared to net income from continuing operations of $32 thousand, or $0.00 per share (basic and diluted), in the third quarter of 2013. The Company realized a total comprehensive loss of $0.8 million in the third quarter of 2014 compared to total comprehensive income of $3 thousand in the comparable quarter of 2013. For the nine months ended September 30, 2014, AgJunction reported revenues of $34.9 million compared to $44.4 million for the same period in 2013. Gross margin for the first nine months of 2014 was $16.3 million, or 46.7%, versus $20.0 million, or 45.0%, in the comparable period. Operating expenses, excluding restructuring, have declined $1.3 million on a year-over-year basis primarily due to cost reductions within research and development and sales and marketing being partially offset by increases in general and administrative expenses. The additional G&A expenses was related to the Company incurring litigation cost in the year for a lawsuit it brought against a competitor believed to be infringing on the Company's propriety software and intellectual property rights. The infringement does not involve the company's steering patent portfolio. For the nine months ended September 30, 2014, the Company generated a net loss from continuing operations of $140 thousand, or $0.00 per share (basic and diluted), compared to net income from continuing operations of $2.6 million, or $0.04 per share (basic and diluted), during the same period of 2013. At September 30, 2014, the Company held cash and short-term investments of $11.3 million compared to $10.1 million at the end of 2013. Working capital was $23.3 million as of September 30, 2014, compared with $22.9 million at December 31, 2013. The Company had 72,322,063 common shares outstanding at September 30, 2014.

(MORE) PTI CHS STS"}, {"title": "Sustainability not a four-letter word", "article": "A national pollster once told me that \"Canadians really like farmers, but they don't always like what farmers do.\" He followed that up by noting that the second half of the statement was the more important part, and that it is the agriculture industry's responsibility to address the misinformation circulating about modern day farming. Misinformation, unfortunately, is large contributor to Canadian opinion. The majority of consumers have become disconnected from the reality of modern day agriculture. The picture they have in mind as the \"right\" way to do it seems to come out of the 1930s. Farming practices from that era are seen by many as idyllic, pure and healthy. Conversely, farms that don't conform to this image are viewed as somehow unhealthy or unsustainable. This view is inaccurate, but an opinion does not have to be right to have influence. Food companies and marketers know this, and the skewed view of what agriculture is, and what some think it should be, is a big driver behind many of the food fads we see today. Urban consumers in our cities (or even our small towns)don't see the economic powerhouse that agriculture has become. They don't realize that modern agriculture is on the cutting edge of science and technology. They don't understand the benefits of precision agriculture. They don't know about the environmental advancements farmers have made since the dust bowls of the dirty '30s. We need to do a much better job of telling agriculture's story. And by \"we\" I mean every part of the value chain, including crop developers, farmers, grain companies and food companies. Part of telling our story is having the facts to back things up. People are bombarded with \"facts\" today -but many of these facts are not all that factual. Consumers can't be blamed for asking us to prove our claims of environmental sustainability and food safety. Farmers are integral in telling agriculture's story. I know many producers wince when they hear words like \"sustainability\" and \"verification\".But these are not swear words invented in some downtown office and they are not designed to increase farmers' paperwork and costs. It's quite the opposite -these are tools that Canadian agriculture will need to maintain markets and continue to attract a strong premium from domestic and international customers. The industry, including farmers, is working on this issue through the newly formed Canadian Roundtable for Sustainable Crops. This roundtable includes all parts of the agriculture value chain. The goal of all those involved is to add value to Canadian agricultural production. Farm groups from coast-to-c oast are at the table and are able to provide feedback on the work being done to any of their members who are interested. This is an important issue for individual farmers, and I encourage you to become directly involved. I am proud of the Canadian agricultural record. Modern practices like minimum and zero tillage conserve soil and water and help deliver a crop in drought conditions that would have been considered a disaster a generation or two ago. Modern precision agriculture helps ensure that fertilizer and crop protection chemicals are not wasted by running into our streams and rivers.

Top end drones are in the $40,000- $50,000 range.\" He says there are other costs beyond the purchase price. \"These include the time it takes to learn to operate the drone, which may be better spent in other areas of the operation. It's best to use a partial budget when considering any new technology. You need to consider the costs of the investment, repairs, extra labour, management time and time spent interpreting the data.\" On the other side of the partial budget are the positives. \"You have to look at how your business might benefit from the information from a drone, such as better production and management decisions and how it might put more dollars in your pocket.\" The biggest consideration is how the information from a drone will be used. \"For instance, certain producers have said a bird's eye view is worth $1,000 a minute. It's a big advantage to be able to get an overall survey of your field rather than just walking blindly into it hoping to find problems. Some of the aerial views and cameras can really help producers save time and deploy their resources effectively. It really comes down to the cost versus the benefit. \"It's important to set realistic goals for capturing the potential benefits of the images, maps or information gained using drone technology and that additional information being applied to make a more informed production decision. When the benefits outweigh the costs, you have now turned an expensive toy into a valuable business decision-making tool.\""}, {"title": "AJX AgJunction client Claas to use Pilot in its hardware", "article": "AgJunction Inc (TSX:AJX) Shares Issued 72,328,951 Last Close 10/1/2014 $0.59 Thursday October 02 2014 - News Release Mr. Rick Heiniger reports AGJUNCTION PRECISION PLATFORM SELECTED FOR OEM FACTORY INTEGRATION; CLAAS E-SYSTEMS KGAA MBH & CO KG WILL BEGIN FACTORY INSTALLATION OF THE S7 AND S10 GUIDANCE CONTROL TERMINALS WITH GPS PILOT DURING Q4 2014 AT TWO EUROPEAN FACTORIES, INTEGRATING KEY HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED BY AGJUNCTION Claas E-Systems KGaA mbH & Co.

Justin Crownover sold half his crop in May, when a bushel traded at a still profitable level of five bucks. Four months later the season's corn supply is looming like a tsunami and the price is down around $3.25. While the Texas Panhandle farmer hopes for a rally, he's thinking of ways to spend less on machinery and fertilizer. \"Are we concerned?\" he mused earlier this month as he moved some cows down the road. \"Definitely.\" For the first time in almost a decade, American producers of corn, soybeans, and wheat might lose money on all three if prices don't rise. The downturn comes on the heels of the most profitable years in most farmers' lives. Coming into this year, every part of the farm economy was on a roll -- from seeds and fertilizer to tractors and technology. Farmland had become a must-have asset for the smart-money investor. The same applies to the shares of companies lending a hand in feeding the world, as the population grows from seven billion to over nine billion by 2050. High commodity prices led to vast new acres of corn and soybeans. That spurred sales at machinery makers like Deere (ticker: DE), fertilizer vendors like Potash (POT), and seed and herbicide providers like Monsanto (MON). Eyeing this megatrend, you can understand why many folks stopped thinking that the farm business was cyclical. \"I'm one of the people who said there is no more cycle,\" says Martin Richenhagen, the plain-spoken chief executive of AGCO (AGCO), the Duluth, Ga.-based maker of Challenger, Fendt, and Massey Ferguson farm machinery. \"I stand corrected.\" As bumper crop forecasts rose over the summer, Wall Street debated how long and deep the down cycle might be -- and how fully it's priced into ag shares. Deere is down 12% since early May, to $83, and sells for barely nine times its recent earnings. Does that make it and the others value plays? Probably not. The floor for these stocks could be at least another 10% to 15% lower, if farmers put off investments in machinery and fertilizer beyond next year and Wall Street has to lower its estimates of what farm suppliers can earn across the agricultural cycle. Historically, U.S. farmers are slow to downsize production in response to lower prices, says Purdue University agricultural economist Michael Boehlje. \"So the not-so-good times last at least as long, if not longer, than the good times,\" warns the professor. We're talking about farming, so no one knows if a frost or drought might winnow the harvest enough to revive crop prices, just as it was hard to anticipate the supply surge from what Deere Chief Executive Sam Allen wryly describes as the extreme weather event called: \"It's great weather everywhere around the world.\" The lowest commodity prices in seven years have resulted from the combination of extremely good growing weather with the more predictable effects of burgeoning crop yields and the better than 20% increase in U.S. corn acreage over the last decade --not to mention the creation of giant new farms in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso. American corn yields will set a record of 171.7 bushels an acre this year, some 15% above the five-year average, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department's September estimate of world agricultural supply and demand. The soybean crop is also expected to have record yield and production globally. Inventories, the government says, are ample. Supply has caught up because two big drivers of the last decade's growth in demand are spent. American gasoline already has the mandated 10% blend of ethanol. China has wasted little time in reaching Western levels of meat consumption, while developed countries --ironically --are eating fewer grain-fed cattle. The 2015 prices forecast by J.P. Morgan's economic models would leave corn growers' incomes down by a third next year, with soybean profits down at least 15%, and wheat growers' incomes down by more than 40%. At Morgan Stanley, machinery analyst Nicole DeBlase summarized her worried outlook in an August report titled \"AGpocalypse Now?\" Visiting Barron's, AGCO chief Richenhagen warned us not to get overly pessimistic. No one realistically expects a farm bust on the scale of the 1980s. Grain inventories are at reasonable levels. Interest rates are low. And farmers have used the recent years' prosperity to pay down debt on their balance sheets, according to studies by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. Many of those balance sheets boast highly appreciated farmland. Good cropland is scarce in North America, of course. Over the last decade the average value of U.S. cropland rose 240%, according to a report last October by the government's National Agricultural Statistics Service. Those gains worked their wealth-effect on farmers' spending, and delivered uncorrelated returns to some college endowments and hedge funds. But farmland's days of exceptional returns may be waning. A report last month by Purdue's Boehlje and his colleagues Timothy Baker and Michael Langemeier showed that central Indiana cropland has reached an average price that's over 32 times the cash rent (as we show in the chart on page 21), versus a 50-year average of 18 times. \"Help us understand why you would pay today $32 for a dollar of earnings from farmland,\" Boehlje asked Barron's, \"when you can buy an S&P index stock for something no higher than 20?\" Their latest survey, however, indicated that after decades of steady increase, farmland values are leveling off in 2014 and even softening for less-productive acreage. With farmers expecting lower profits next year, one of the first expenditures they can cut is capital equipment. The average age of America's tractors and combines is the youngest it's been in decades, thanks to the recent boom years' cash flows, which manufacturers such as Deere encouraged farmers to spend by trading in their tractors annually. \"We were getting a new fleet every year,\" says Kip Tom, a large grower of corn and soybeansin Leesburg, Ind. \"So if we have to own it now for three years, we certainly can.\" After two years of growth, the unit sales of high horsepower tractors and combines in the U.S. in 2014 have been dropping every month from 2013 levels, according to the Association of Equipment Manufacturers. Greg Peterson has been tracking auctions of used farm machinery since 1989. After a seven-year bubble, his index of used equipment values, which he publishes on his MachineryPete.com Website, started slipping last year, with the decline accelerating over the summer of 2014 for late-model big tractors, combines, and planters. The expiration of accelerated depreciation for federal tax purposes has also slowed sales of new and used equipment, says Peterson. High-horsepower equipment has been the profit sweet spot for Deere, as well as for CNH Industrial (CNHI), the 2013 amalgam of businesses from Fiat, Case, and New Holland. With Deere's commanding share of the thriving North American farm market, its sales rose in the last five years from $23 billion in 2009 to $38 billion in 2013, while earnings rose from $900 million, or $2.06 a share, to $3.5 billion, or $9.09 a share, in 2013. Deere already has told investors to expect a 10% sales drop next year. \"There are very high levels of used equipment at dealers,\" says the company's chief Allen \"The challenge for us is to get as much of that used equipment through the pipeline, so that dealers get comfortable taking trade-ins.\" To that end, Deere announced in August a certified pre-owned equipment program that it hopes will break the log-jam. Allen points out that the company's sales of construction equipment, and even its small tractors for farms, should have a good year, but the importance of big farm machines to Deere's profits can't be overstated. At the same time, Deere announced 600 layoffs and a production slowdown. Morgan Stanley's DeBlase rates Deere shares dead money, with a target price of $84, near the current price. But if \"large ag\" sales drop 29% next year, she fears earnings could sink to near five bucks a share, which at a price/earnings multiple of 15 could drag the stock down to the mid $70s. One reason for the stock's relative buoyancy amid corn's collapse may be the hope that Deere is the kind of entrenched, well-run business that Warren Buffett, already a shareholder, would acquire at the right price. In contrast, AGCO sells smaller machinery. But farmers in regions that matter most to AGCO, Europe and South America, are expected to suffer as much as their North American counterparts. Sales fell 10% in the June quarter, and the company cut production like its rivals. AGCO shares have dropped over 20% this year to $46 on a multiple that's even cheaper than Deere's, but CEO Richenhagen suspects that investors are waiting to see if he can maintain margins through the down cycle -- as he's determined to do. Another line of equipment likely to feel the pinch is the \"precision-agriculture\" technology sold by Trimble Navigation (TRMB). Broad adoption of global positioning system guidance for crop machinery helped drive this segment to a quarter of the company's revenue and supplied much of its recent years' profit growth. But now, with more than two-thirds of large farms already using GPS, sales will mainly come from replacement sales. At $31, Trimble stock goes for more than 30 times trailing earnings -- and the 2015 consensus forecast for $1.30 in earnings per share (using generally accepted accounting principles) looks vulnerable. At Lone Star Family Farms, in Sunray, Texas, Justin Crownover is re-evaluating the higher costs of growing corn, compared with other crops. \"We're normally filling our storage with fertilizer now for next year's crop,\" he says, \"but input costs aren't coming down as fast as the corn market.\" Cotton looks more profitable than corn, for his part of the country. In the Midwest, farmers can switch to beans. Neither of those alternatives would require as much potash or an autumn application of anhydrous ammonia for nitrogen. Widespread rotation from corn would hit CF Industries Holdings (CF), a pure-play on nitrogen fertilizer whose gross margins doubled in the recent corn boom. Although earnings fell 37% in the June quarter, the shares jumped from about $255 to $278 last week when CF said it was discussing a merger with Norway's Yara International (YAR.Norway) to form a nitrogen fertilizer giant. If fertilizer margins fall back and the merger doesn't proceed, earnings could suffer. Should farmers like Crownover draw down the levels of potash in their soil, it would affect the likes of Potash and rivals Agrium (AGU) and Mosaic (MOS). Last year was already tough on the price of potash, as well as the other plant nutrients known as phosphates, as new supplies came to market and India cut government subsidies. Mosaic's chief economist Mike Rahm argues that farmers will still need to replenish the potash and phosphates drained by this year's corn crop, and says that those fertilizers comprise only 15% of the input costs of growing corn, so they're the wrong place to economize. The commodity price crunch comes at a bad time for these companies, however, because more overseas production capacity is expected to come to market in a couple of years -- just when farmers hope that commodity markets will have recovered. Monsanto and its Swiss rival Syngenta (SYT) argue that even hard-pressed farmers won't cut their spending for seeds, herbicides, and pesticides. Pesticide prices have been softening across the industry, however, posing a bigger problem for Syngenta, which gets 75% of its sales from the chemicals. Monsanto generates more revenue from seeds than chemicals these days, and strategy chief Kerry Preete says its premium-priced seeds give farmers the yields they need to compete. Even without much incremental growth in demand from ethanol or China, Monsanto says, corn and soybean yields will need to increase a lot to keep up with the next decade's needs. A bad harvest in the next year or two might be enough to revive commodity prices; otherwise, farmers will have to wait for demand to catch supply. Deere's Allen notes that corn demand has risen, by a lot or a little, every year since 1995. Farmers Kip Tom and Justin Crownover hope he's right. But for now, they're going to watch their pennies. ---"}, {"title": "Prep-Agriculture-Report", "article": "(Ritz-China) Federal Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz has met with China's Minister of Agriculture Han Changfu to work to secure permanent access for Canadian live cattle.

Manitoba Pork says some producers are doing washes by themselves in under 30 minutes -- but the group says a full service wash involves two workers and two hours to complete, putting the quality of some of our self-washes in question.

According to news reporting out of Burlington, Canada, by VerticalNews editors, research stated, \"Few researchers have assessed the important management questions regarding the sensitivity of indicators of aquatic ecosystem condition and the specificity with which anthropogenic development activities are described. Furthermore, there is limited knowledge as to the potential of structural and functional indicators to generate complementary knowledge about ecological condition that can be used to inform watershed management.\" Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Environment Canada, \"We assessed 20 metrics of ecological structure and function at 19 riverine sites across the Red River watershed in the summer of 2010 using a gradient approach to test predictions that: (1) indicator sensitivity would vary with the specificity at which landscape development is described (i.e., coarse - land use [e.g., agriculture], medium - specific human activities [e.g., crop cultivation] and fine management practices [e.g., crop rotation]); and (2) structural and functional indicators respond to different types and specificity of anthropogenic development. Evaluation of indicators revealed that indicator sensitivity was frequently greater for assessment of specific human activities (i.e., wastewater treatment, crop cultivation or livestock production), than for broad land-use categories (i.e., agriculture or urban). Structural and functional indicators were often associated with different types of anthropogenic development suggesting additive rather than redundant assessment information. Structural indicators were almost exclusively associated with crop cultivation and agricultural land cover. In contrast, functional indicators were generally associated with gradients of wastewater treatment and urban land cover. Our results demonstrate that aquatic ecosystem assessment programs would benefit from considering the specific anthropogenic development activity to be assessed and managed in order to evaluate and select the most sensitive indicators of stream condition.\" According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Furthermore, combined use of structural and functional indicators in aquatic monitoring program appears to improve detection of anthropogenic impacts in a multiple stressor environment.\" Our news journalists report that additional information may be obtained by contacting A.G.

According to news reporting originating from Toronto, Canada, by VerticalNews correspondents, research stated, \"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have significant potential in many application domains, ranging from precision agriculture and animal welfare to home and office automation. Although sensor network deployments have only begun to appear, the industry still awaits the maturing of this technology to realize its full benefits.\" Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from Ryerson University, \"The main constraints to large-scale commercial adoption of WSN have been the lack of available network management and control tools, such as for determining the degree of data aggregation prior to transforming it into useful information, localizing the sensors accurately so that timely emergency actions can be taken at an exact location, routing data by reducing sensor energy consumption, and scheduling data packets so that data are sent according to their priority and fairness. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, no integrated network management solution comprising efficient localization, data scheduling, routing, and data aggregation approaches exists in the literature for a large-scale WSN. Thus, we introduce an integrated network management framework comprising sensor localization, routing, data scheduling, and data aggregation for a large-scale WSN. Experimental results show that the proposed framework outperforms an existing approach that comprises only localization and routing protocols in terms of localization energy consumption, localization error, end-to-end delay, packet loss ratio, and network energy consumption.\" According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Moreover, the proposed WSN management framework has potential in building a future 'Internet of Things.\" The news editors report that additional information may be obtained by contacting L.

Our area was well represented at the show by the likes of DeCloet Greenhouses, VandenBussche Irrigation, Cadman Power Equipment, Robert H. Laning, Titan Trailers, R.E. Eggar Truck and Machine, Hal-Nor Equipment, Fletcher's Horse World and Clark Ag Systems --as well as so many other people I ran into on the grounds representing other players in agri-business. Here are some highlights of my day at the show. The fact that agriculture is becoming a global industry was reinforced when I learned that Mahindra, from India, is the number one selling tractor in the world. If my old McCormick had feelings -which I don't think she does -she would shed a tear over that one. The NUHN Lagoon Crawler was an interesting demonstration. This is an agitation boat for manure lagoons with a twist. The crawler has wheels and can drive right into a lagoon. Having grown up throwing hay around, I was impressed with the front and rear unload forage boxes brought in by Meyer Manufacturing from Dorchester, Wisconsin. This is the same principle, but a big improvement over our farm's old forage harvester system. Often drivers are frustrated when stuck behind a combine on a back road when the operator doesn't take the head off. At the same time, I understand the logistics of the farmers who follow the rules, have another operator and tow the head behind with a pick-up. That issue has been resolved with the new foldable head, offered by several combine manufacturers. The evolution of GPS technology is nothing short of what would be considered science fiction when I was growing up on our farm. GPS-assisted agriculture is not new, but it continues to advance. Precision farming was featured by Trimble Agriculture from Westminster, Colorado and Trimble Navigation of Sunnyvale, California. With margins thinner, farmers need to make efficient use of seed, pesticides, fertilizers and machinery. GPS first gained a foothold by ensuring there is no overlap in application of crop inputs, while saving fuel at the same time. That has evolved to auto-steer and changing the application rates of fuel and fertilizer, dependent on the productivity of a particular part of a field. If a particular area is more productive, more seed and fertilizer are applied. If the productivity is limited, seed and fertilizer input will be reduced since the soil can only support lesser plant density. And here is what is around the corner. While auto-steer worked for driving straight rows while seeding, the operator needed to take over to turn the machinery in the headlands. Now, equipment will allow not only turning, but also staged shutdown of planters and applicators as the machinery reaches the end of the row. Seed companies showcased a variety of approaches to the topic of neonics and bee mortality. De Dell Seeds, Canada's only family-owned non-GMO seed corn company, offers both seed treated with neonics, and untreated seed. Syngenta is researching Best Management Practices for handling insecticide-treated seed to reduce dust during planting. The company is involved in a number of other initiatives to support bee health. The Outdoor Farm Show illustrates agriculture continues as a tremendously-evolving industry.

Hortau Inc.'s remote irrigation management system is making the challenging but critical task of judging how much water to use on crops a little easier for Ventura County growers. The Quebec, Canada, company is also aggressively promoting its system as a water savings tool at a time when new mandates and fees are making growers watch their water use more closely than ever before. \"It is a precision farming tool,\" said soil physicist Jocelyn Boudreau, Hortau's co-founder and CEO. The system, which measures soil moisture, \"has been shown to decrease water usage 20 to 35 percent,\" Boudreau said, while also increasing plant yield. See hortau, 3E Anything that can help growers reduce water use without hurting fruit and vegetable production -- the key crops in the county's $2 billion-plus agriculture industry -- attracts attention during the current drought. Hortau says it has 20 to 30 customers in Ventura County alone, and that its California business has grown so much that it has opened an office in San Luis Obispo and is expanding across the country. \"We've been operating behind the scenes up until this drought, when all of a sudden we became hyper-focused,\" said Jeremy Otto, Hortau's business development manager. A recent $6.5 million in venture capital from an agriculture-oriented private equity firm helped pay for this year's expansion, helped along by the third-year drought conditions. Plants need water, but only a certain amount. Too little water and they go into water stress from dry soil, says Hortau. They become more vulnerable to heat stress, effects from salt and pests, and produce less. Too much water and plants suffer from a lack of oxygen, causing them to produce more vegetation but less fruit, or vegetables. They are also more susceptible to root disease, says Hortau's brochure. Hortau's system works by installing sensors into the soil among the roots of plants and under them. The sensors then measure how much effort the roots have to exert to pull water from the soil. \"The sensor acts like a mechanical root that tells the grower when to run that irrigation, and how to manage crop stress, which is a driver in quality and yield,\" Otto said. Growers can then read that data in real-time on mobile devices or on Hortau's website. Graphs and curves, which are easy to read, say the growers, show them whether soils and plants are in the wet zone, which means they are over watering; the dry zone, which means under watering or in the comfort zone, where all is good. That information is \"crucial\" for Will Gerry's 170 acres of blueberries that grow in Camarillo at his Coastal California Blueberry Farm. He installed Hortau's system in July 2012. \"Blueberries are very sensitive to moisture,\" Gerry said. \"They hate to be dry, but don't like wet feet or over watering. It (the system) is helping us be more precise and keep that plant in its happy zone.\" He accesses the system six to 10 times a day, Gerry said, and at night to plan what to do the next day. It's also helped him water and fertilize more efficiently. Several growers say they use the system as a weather station because of its remote access capability, and to call up prior days' weather conditions to see how their fields reacted. Among them is Richard Martinez, who grows organic celery and all sorts of leafy greens and herbs for Deardorff Family Farms on 450 acres in Piru, Santa Paula, Ventura and the Oxnard Plain. He installed his first system about a year and a half ago, and just added seven more. He uses its temperature-sensing capabilities to monitor conditions at fields far away from where he is at the moment. \"If I know what the temperature is in Piru, and it's really hot and there's low humidity, and I know if I have a crew harvesting lettuce there, I can tell the guys to stop harvesting,\" Martinez said, to prevent the plants from dehydrating. Hortau's system works with every crop and soil type, Otto said. The first California customer was an Oxnard strawberry grower in 2008, but now it's used for avocados, citrus, vegetables, grapes and nuts. Growers rent the equipment and can own it after three years, Otto said. Monitoring stations cost about $175 per month for 36 months, which includes field support, training, software and uploading the software. After the three years, the grower pays only a service fee of $35 to $75, depending on the number of monitoring locations, and the services continue. Oxnard strawberry growers Pal Halstead and Will Terry use the system in conjunction with irrigation managers and/or irrigation management plans. They also confirm the data with manual tensiometers. \"There have been some inaccuracies because of the weather,\" Halstead said. On occasion with very high temperatures, the system has indicated soil tension is dry, he said, while his manual devices say the opposite. Several growers say they are watering more efficiently with the system, but not necessarily less overall. Hortau co-founder Jean Caron, now a soil physicist with Laval University in Quebec, is researching soil comfort zones for Hortau in key strawberry areas of Oxnard, Santa Maria and Watsonville. Caron said growers who over watered before installing the system are reducing water by up to 35 percent, although those who had under-watered -- many of the Oxnard growers -- are watering more. But, he added, if growers are irrigating consistently to keep soils in the system's comfort zone, they could see their water use go down. \"I know we are more efficient,\" Gerry said. \"That probably means some water savings.\" hortau from 1E"}, {"title": "Old, new all part of plowing match", "article": "This year's Bruce County plowing match provided a glimpse into the world of digital farming. \"This is the way of the future . . . we are actually leaders in technology . . . on the leading edge of GPS steering the equipment,\" said Peter Johnson, a spokesperson with the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture Food and Rural Affairs. \"A lot of young lads have grown up with this and they are used to the tractor steering itself.\" Johnson showcased some of the newest equipment used for seeding and tilling loaded with the latest technology driving the farm implement market. \"From a field efficiency standpoint if I try to drive I always get some overlap or miss some. Once I go to auto steer that disappears and so our field efficiency goes up, we use less fuel. We're doing a better job across every acre,\" said Johnson. Johnson said as with any new digital technology, the cost drops as it is accepted by manufacturers. When the auto steering technology first came out it cost $60,000. The price now has been reduced to about $20,000. \"Five years from now even a poor farmer like me will be able to afford it because it will be just standard equipment. It's coming for everybody for sure,\" he said. Johnson noted there are many applications of digital technology for all aspects of field work, from auto steering and regulating the application of fertilizer and pesticide to recording yearly crop yields and growing conditions. It is helping make field work easier and more efficient. \"Now on my sprayer when I come up to the end of the field the booms will shut off automatically . . . my booms may be 120 feet wide but if I'm in an odd shaped field it will shut off sections as I come up to the edge. So that means I don't double apply, it saves me product, it's better for the environment and it costs the farmer less,\" he explained. Even the cellphone can play a key role in bringing help to the farmer in the midst of spring seeding or fall harvest. \"I can take a picture of a broken part on my combine and e-mail that to the dealer and he can tell me if he has it in stock or does he have to order it,\" Johnson said. Advances in technology are outpacing ways in which it can be applied. \"We're still scratching our heads asking exactly what should we do with the technology,\" Johnson said. Keeping equipment running during critical times of year such as planting and harvesting is high on the list of priorities for farmers. So dealers have to provide speedy service. \"If a company doesn't have good support for the technology the farmers won't buy the equipment because our planting window is so narrow that every minute of that is incredibly valuable, so you just can not afford downtown. We have farmers in Ontario now farming 30,000 acres. They've got to be up and running,\" Johnson said. Johnson said with such enormous capacity to gather data the challenge now is how to store and manage the different layers of information. \"My topography would be one map, my yield would be another layer, my fertility another level, my phosphorus level another layer, my potash another layer, which ones make a difference and which ones don't is the question. Trying to sort through that and figure out how to put it all together is the challenge,\" Johnson explained. New technology can produce significant gains in productivity which is why more farmers are making the investment in the specialized equipment. \"It looks like toys but it really does save labour, it saves time, it makes equipment safer and easier to operate and you can control the equipment,\" said John Gillespie, a spokesperson with the Bruce County Federation of Agriculture. Crystal McLeod of Arkwright was crowned this year's Queen of the Furrow at the recent Bruce County Plowing match held on August 29 at the farm of Rick and Mike Smith near Ripley. It's her second year participating in the competition. She enjoyed the experience so much in 2013 that she decided to try again this year. \"Last year it was a really good time; it was a fun activity learning to plow with my dad and he is here competing today,\" said McLeod, who is an emergency room nurse at the Hanover hospital and Southampton hospital. The topic of the speech that she gave as part of the competition was about art in agriculture. \"Art,\" she said, \"is a really important way for farmers and people who are passionate about agriculture to spread awareness and motivate other people to come into the industry.\" Although her family are not farmers, her father recently learned to plow using an antique tractor that belongs to the family and was competing this year in the antique trail plow category. As the 2014 Bruce County Queen of the Furrow, she is looking forward to attending next year's International Plowing Match and plowing with her father. Brockton Mayor David Inglis took first place in the mayors and members of council category at this year's Bruce County match.

The agency is seeking bids for what it calls a \"comprehensive\" overall assessment of the country's space activity, and will pay up to $250,000 \"to capture the economic argument for investment in space,\" as well as \"demonstrate the larger socio-economic impacts\" of Canadians' activities, public and private, in the sector, according to a written description of the work. The agency said it could not comment on the study while it is still in the tendering process. \"That's the standard procedure when we have RFPs (requests for proposal),\" said Maya Eyssen, a spokesperson for the agency. \"We're not allowed to answer any questions when there's an RFP that's open.\" But some outside space experts offered their own theories on why the study is being undertaken. \"What I read is perhaps somebody at the (space) agency saying, 'We've got to try to mount a bit of a defence here to shrinking budgets from the government and prove our worth,'\" said Paul Delaney, professor of physics and astronomy at York University in Toronto. \"Is the Canadian Space Agency trying to say to senior government officials, 'Here's a reason why we need to do what we need to do ... please provide us with the appropriate funding,'\" wondered Marc Boucher, interim president of the Canadian Space Commerce Association. The space agency's base budget was initially set at $300 million but this has varied. It received added funds under the government's economic action plan in 2009 following the recession. It is currently working with added funding to help develop the RadarSat Constellation Mission. But the agency's annual base funding has shrunk and is expected to decline further this year, according to the CSA's 2014-15 report on plans and priorities. The proposed wide-ranging study will be shared with senior bureaucrats and comes with an accelerated deadline: it must be finished and in the hands of the space agency by January 2015 - about a month before a federal budget would normally be unveiled. There was no indication whether the report will be made public. But the contract tender says \"the CSA wishes to establish an evidence-based policy and communications tool to detail a 'value proposition' for space.\" This in turn would lead to \"a common narrative on why and how Canada should invest in space.\" Canada's overall space sector, which includes government, commercial, research and academic interests, has been the target of numerous studies in recent years. In 2012, former cabinet minister David Emerson unveiled an exhaustive review of aerospace and space policies in Canada, with several recommendations. The agency itself also publishes an annual State of the Canadian Space Sector report. \"The studies have been ongoing and it's endless,\" said Boucher. The latest assessment will cover issues such as Canada's share of the global market in space commerce, the impact of government spending on the sector, and the sector's benefits for the government's own space policy themes, which range from security and sovereignty to national pride. Whoever wins the tender is expected to look at the sector's contribution to regional economies, spinoffs and \"efficiency gains\" - for example, to what extent data from satellites help with precision farming, or with better navigation for the fishing industry. Futron's 2014 space competitiveness index (an annual comparative analysis of how countries invest in and benefit from space industry) says Canada \"has experienced a small bounce in its space competitiveness and retains a skilled workforce, but ongoing implementation challenges threaten to offset those advantages.\" For his part, Boucher thinks \"there is a bit of disconnect between the government and the sector and how it interacts with the Canadian Space Agency.\" Canadians' interest in space is lively, and educators such as Delaney believe that interest is one way to encourage greater science literacy - and create high-quality jobs in Canada. \"There's a market out there for almost anything that is space-science-related,\" he said.

In order to be eligible for funding within this program, an individual must own or rent at least 320 acres of farmland within the province, earn a minimum yearly income of $35,000 in the year that the application is submitted, and must have a completed environmental farm plan that has been endorsed within the past 10 years. Nye explained that even if farmers do not currently have an Environmental Farm Plan, she is able to assist with the process. \"The board will look over applications after I have offered technical support and see if they make sense from an agricultural production standpoint. Then we offer support for applications for the cost shared funding,\" explained Nye. The main area that Nye covers is Wakaw Lake to beyond the Carrot River area, and every small town in between. As the only Agri-Environmental Group Plan (AEGP) tech in the area, she is also able to work north and south, outside of the watershed. A BMP is defined as a beneficial management practice, and is any agricultural management practice that ensures the long term health and sustainability of land related resources, has a positive impact on long-term economic and environmental viability of agricultural production, and works to minimize negative impacts and risks to the environment. Land, livestock, precision farming, manure management, irrigation management, and pest management are the key areas of focus for the farm stewardship program. Some of the projects require pre-approval, and some work with a rebate system. Any pre-approvals require a site visit, and work can not be underway at the time of pre-approval if implementing BMPs. The Ranch Water Infrastructure Program is yet another cost-share program, available to farmers, ranchers, First Nation Bands, Rural Municipalities and irrigation districts. Much like the Farm Stewardship program, eligible parties must rent or own 320 acres of farmland in the province, and earn a minimum of $35,000 of farm income in a year in order to qualify. \"The ranch water infrastructure program focuses on water development on your farm. If you are looking at digging a new well, or doing old well decommissioning, or remote livestock watering, this is classified as ranch water infrastructure,\" said Nye. \"If you are connecting to a rural water pipeline to water your livestock, those might be eligible for a 50% cost shared through the government. Well decommissioning is 90% coverage. If you have any old water wells on your farm, the government is going to cover 90% if you are eligible, which is a pretty good rebate funding level.\""}, {"title": "Chinese Long March 4B launches Gaofen-2 and BRITE-PL-2.", "article": "The Gaofen satellites are a series of high-resolution optical Earth observation satellites of China National Space Administration.

Star oscillation will be investigated with the help of BRITE satellite constellations, designed within the Bright Target Explorer (BRITE) project and developed as the Canadian-Austrian-Polish cooperation. 2014-08-19 01_46_09-Gaofen-2 & Heweliusz, CZ-4B TSLC - August 19, 2014The satellites will be taking images of the sky with a wide-field camera in order to precisely measure the brightness of the brightest stars. Measuring these stars precisely from the Earth's surface proves to be a difficult task, even though they are easily detectable during a cloudless night. A few hundred (500-800) stars of the Milky Way will be observed during the experiment. Polish scientists intend to investigate the mechanism of convection, which is the transportation of energy that takes place in the hottest stars. This is an important occurrence in nature that physicists have known for over 100 years, however it does not yet have a mathematical description. The BRITE project will help explain the phenomenon. Disturbances in the Earth's atmospheric transparency severely limits the accuracy of the brightness's measurement. A small wide-angle camera sent into space will see a large amount of bright stars, without the distortion and unpredictable impact of the atmosphere. On December 16, 2009 The Minister of Science and Higher Education signed a decision to grant funding (from the Fund for Polish Science and Technology) for the project. 2014-08-19 01_46_49-Gaofen-2 & Heweliusz, CZ-4B TSLC - August 19, 2014The satellite, which is designed to observe the brightest stars in our Galaxy, is the Polish contribution to the BRITE mission, developed by a consortium of Canadian, Austrian and Polish institutes. According to the agreement with the Minister two Polish satellites were been built: Lem and Heweliusz. Lem was launched on 21 November 2013. BRITE's design originates from a Canadian idea developed by Emeritus Professor Slavek Rucinski of the University of Toronto, inspired by technology developed for MOST. All six nanosatellites in the BRITE constellation are built according to that concept. BRITE satellites are so-called nanosatellites weighing less than 10 kg. Poland runs the research program with the Space Flight Laboratory (SFL) of the University of Toronto which specializes in developing and manufacturing such small satellites. According to the agreement with SFL, the Canadian side provided most of the components and subsystems necessary for the integration of the first satellite, the complete documentation, and trained a team of Polish engineers to properly carry out the integration and testing of the satellite before it was launched. In the case of the second satellite the number of components supplied from Canada were limited. What's more, a large part of the subsystems have been developed in SRC PAS and manufactured in Poland. 2014-08-19 01_48_06-Gaofen-2 & Heweliusz, CZ-4B TSLC - August 19, 2014BRITE program is an unprecedented opportunity not only for Polish science, but also for the Polish industry to obtain new technologies and at the same time to create a prestigious international forum for the exploration of space. In this context, the possibility of the implementing a complete integration of both satellites in Poland was very important to Polish authorities, especially regarding completing the tests before launching the satellites into the orbit. Launching a Polish-owned satellite also required taking large formal, administrative and logistical action on a scale not yet implemented in Poland. All spacecraft in the constellation use the GNB (Generic Nanosatellite Bus) platform, referred to as CanX-3, developed at UTIAS/SFL (of CanX-2 heritage). The GNB was originally developed in SFL for BRITE and Can-X-4/5 missions. The satellite measures 200 mm x 200 mm x 200 mm in size, has the mass of about 7 kg and includes a full suite of advanced capabilities. 2014-08-19 01_48_43-Gaofen-2 & Heweliusz, CZ-4B TSLC - August 19, 2014This includes a dual battery, gallium arsenide triple-junction solar cell based power system that includes peak power tracking capabilities; a full 3-axis attitude determination and control system that allows arbitrary inertial or orbit-frame alignment (including nadir, along-track and cross-track). Also, a powerful complement of on-board computer processing systems, include a computer dedicated to payload activities; a flexible TT&C and payload data RF communication system, allowing for variable and high speed data downlinks to the ground. Included is a large accommodation for payloads, including volume, mass, power, and spacecraft surface area; capable of attitude determination of 10 arcseconds and a attitude control accuracy of better than 1.0o; and an attitude control stability of 1 arcmin rms (root mean square). The satellite has a power of 5.4 W to 10 W, a battery capacity of 5.3 Ah, a data downlink capability up to 256 kbit/s and a payload data storage capacity of up to 256 MB. BRITE-PL-2 Heweliusz (also designated CanX-3D) is a 20 x 20 x 20 cm satellite with a launch mass of 6 kg. The small satellite will make photometric observations of some of the brightest stars in the sky in order to examine these stars for variability. The observations will have a precision at least 10 times better than achievable using ground-based observations. The Launch Vehicle: The feasibility study of the CZ-4 Chang Zheng-4 (Long March-4) began in 1982 based on the FB-1 Feng Bao-1 launch vehicle. Engineering development was initiated in the following year. Initially, the Long March-4 served as a back-up launch vehicle for Long March-3 to launch China's communications satellites. After the successful launch of China's first DFH-2 communications satellites by Long March-3, the main mission of the Long March-4 was shifted to launch sun-synchronous orbit meteorological satellites. On other hand, the Long March-4B launch vehicle was first introduced in May 1999 and also developed by the Shanghai Academy of Space Flight Technology (SAST), based on the Long March-4. The rocket is capable of launching a 2,800 kg satellite into low Earth orbit, developing 2,971 kN at launch. With a mass of 248,470 kg, the CZ-4B is 45.58 meters long and has a diameter of 3.35 meters. SAST began to develop the Long March-4B in February 1989. Originally, it was scheduled to be commissioned in 1997, but the first launch didn't take place until late 1999. The modifications introduced on the Long March-4B included a larger satellite fairing and the replacement of the original mechanical-electrical control on the Long March-4 with an electronic control. Other modifications were an improved telemetry, tracking, control, and self-destruction systems with smaller size and lighter weight; a revised nuzzle design in the second stage for better high-altitude performance; a propellant management system for the second stage to reduce the spare propellant amount, thus increasing"}, {"title": "Food should come before fuel and fun", "article": "A few years ago, a gutsy prairie woman told stories at a conference to illustrate her success with herbs, fruits and vegetables, in her garden enterprise. The exact numbers escape my poor memory but I do recall the attention she held in the hall as she challenged burly boys with big equipment, several sections of land and daunting debt to beat her profits per acre. No one contradicted her. She was clearly in the business of food production and some of her audience may also have been growing food crops such as lentils, peas, canola and wheat for pasta or bread. However, good farmland is often dedicated to livestock feed, up to one third by some estimates. Increasingly, crops are also designated for fuel and bio-products. They may displace derivatives from fossil fuels, but further research and life cycle assessments are required to understand full impacts. No doubt, demands for fuel and bio-products will elicit reconsideration of how to manage marginal farmland and how to include such crops in rotation, to maintain good farmland. Some crops are just for fun. The pulp of pumpkins is usually discarded while carving jack-o-lanterns and large acreages of corn are converted to high fructose corn syrup to amuse us with sweetened, flavoured and fizzy water. It is unlikely that a century ago valuable food crops were purposefully grown for entertainment or livestock. Traditionally, food had priority and the best land was used to grow it. Nevertheless, most farms also had some fibre and fuel products. If crops intended for food didn't meet human specifications in a given year, perhaps because of disease or other disruptions, then it became feed for livestock. In turn, food residue from kitchen tables and processing was often fed to pigs and chickens. Humans cannot derive food value from forage crops, such as clover and timothy, but cattle and sheep can convert these special feed plants to meat and milk. Forage plants that would not otherwise nourish humans serve double duty as feed for livestock to provide high-quality protein for people; and as improve soil. Forage crops improve soil quality with their fine root structure and perennial soil cover. In addition, clover, alfalfa and other legumes collaborate with soil bacteria to take nitrogen from the air and make it available to plants. As a consequence, less nitrogen fertilizer is required for subsequent cops. Traditional knowledge and precision agriculture can assist us to characterize and map fields for suitable crop and tree species and varieties, in given areas. In this context, crop rotation, manure applications and other best management practices will maintain ecological integrity and include crops for mixed uses, even if we keep our eye on the prize of food. Prior to the 20th century, meat production was inefficient. For example, chickens formerly ate about seven kilograms of grain to produce one kilogram of meat and now eat less than two kilograms of grain to produce one kilogram of chicken meat. This animal science research delivered a significant benefit. Nevertheless, efforts to improve feed conversion efficiencies will never attain the ratio of one kilogram of meat from one kilogram of grain, even if much of this grain is human food quality. Future research may target similar efficiency, using only feed-quality grain and byproducts. Today there is plenty of food and, therefore, money to be made from other crop uses. However, it is almost certain, that our 22nd century descendants, like our ancestors prior to the 20th century, will focus on food. Given year to year variability, which may be more pronounced in the future, it will be necessary to seed acres of food crops beyond a calculated need, to prevent shortages. In surplus years, if storage and processing options are maximized, then some surplus food may be fed to livestock. My argument is not to dissuade people from eating animal products. Moderate consumption of meat, eggs and dairy products is consistent with human health and healthy agro-ecosystems. Manure enhances soil quality and thus food crops, too. Livestock are like a battery for the nutrients and energy of plants that people cannot digest or use right away. Furthermore, crops can be converted by animals to improve food attributes. Examples are iron and vitamin B12, associated with animal feed assimilation and metabolism. My argument is the primary use for good farmland is to grow food crops. Feed, fuel, fun and bio-product uses are secondary to food production, in a system of sustainable farmland management. As population increases, weather gets wobbly and other challenges ensue, policies and markets will increasingly reflect the value of food plants for human consumption. The prairie gardener who impressed me and others, gets that."}, {"title": "AJX AgJunction receives notices of allowance for 2 patents", "article": "AgJunction Inc (TSX:AJX) Shares Issued 72,316,326 Last Close 8/13/2014 $0.76 Thursday August 14 2014 - News Release Mr. Rick Heiniger reports AGJUNCTION BROADENS PRECISION TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM THROUGH NEW PATENTS The United States Patent and Trademark Office has issued notices of allowance to AgJunction Inc. for two patents extending critical aspects of its industry-leading guidance and automatic steering technology platforms.

All currency amounts for financial results are expressed in U.S. dollars. In September 2013, the Company's Outback(TM) Ground Agriculture product line switched to a new \"dealer stocking\" sales model in North America where aftermarket revenues are now recorded at dealer net rather than at MSRP, which is approximately a 20% reduction in revenue on the same volume of goods sold. Although aftermarket revenues are lower under this aftermarket dealer program, there is a decrease in commission expense so that gross margin is not impacted. The new model changes the impact of seasonal timing as Outback dealers now purchase stocking inventory months earlier than in the prior model where product was shipped direct to customers from AgJunction inventory. Second quarter Financial Review For the three months and quarter ended June 30, 2014, the Company reported total revenue of $10.3 million, a 37% decrease from $16.3 million in the second quarter of 2013. Results for the quarter were down for all business units compared to the same quarter in 2013. The lower revenue numbers for the quarter relate to the general softness in the overall global agriculture marketspace, affecting the Company's Outback, OEM and Air product lines. United States and Canadian combined revenues were down by 30% from the second quarter of 2013 as a result of the new aftermarket dealer program that was implemented during the fourth quarter of 2013, coinciding with expected softness in the aftermarket agricultural retail space. European revenues decreased 40% due to decreased demand from OEM customers. Sales to Australia and other markets, including South America and Asia, declined 46% and 68%, respectively. Adjusting Outback sales in the second quarter of 2013 for the effect of the new aftermarket dealer program, revenues decreased by approximately $1.5 million or 32%. The decline in Agronomy Services revenues is due to a decline in requests for customized development. \"Throughout the second quarter of 2014, AgJunction was impacted by the downturn in agriculture which has led to reduced equipment sales,\" stated Rick Heiniger, President and CEO. \"These business cycles are typical of the industry in which we operate and are being felt by both our customers and competitors. I firmly believe that the cost structure we put in place last year, coupled with a strong balance sheet, solid OEM relationships and upcoming product releases, will allow us to exit the downturn stronger than others\". Sales by business unit for the second quarter of 2014 and 2013 are as follows:  Sales by geographic region for the second quarter of 2014 and 2013 are as follows:  Total international (non-North American) revenue decreased 49% year-over-year to $3.0 million, representing 29% of total Q2 revenue compared to 36% in 2013. North American revenue represented 71% of total revenues as compared to 66% in 2013. Second quarter consolidated gross margin of $5.5 million was $1.5 million lower year-over-year due to the decreased sales volumes in the quarter. Gross margins, as a percentage of revenue, were 53.3% during the quarter compared to 43.0% in 2013 due to a change in sales mix along with a decrease in the estimated warranty reserve for our Outback and Air product lines. Total operating expenses were $6.0 million in the second quarter, as compared to $6.1 million in the same quarter of 2013. The combined reduction of research and development and sales and marketing expenses of $1.4 million relates to an increased focus on non-recurring engineering (\"NRE\") projects and several cost saving initiatives and efficiencies realized through the restructuring period which began in late 2013. These expense reductions were offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses of $1.4 million due to the Company incurring litigation cost for a lawsuit it brought against a competitor believed to be infringing on the Company's propriety software and intellectual property rights. The infringement does not involve our steering patent portfolio. For the second quarter ended June 30, 2014, the Company reported a net loss from continuing operations of $0.6 million, or ($0.01) per share (basic and diluted), compared to net income from continuing operations of $1.1 million, or $0.02 per share (basic and diluted), in the second quarter of 2013. The Company realized a total comprehensive loss of $0.6 million in the second quarter of 2014 compared to total comprehensive income of $0.2 million in the comparable quarter of 2013. For the six months ended June 30, 2014, AgJunction reported revenues of $25.2 million compared to $32.9 million for the same period in 2013. Gross margin for the first six months of 2014 was $12.3 million (48.9%) versus $14.8 million (44.8%) in the comparable period. Operating expenses, excluding restructuring, have declined $0.7 million on a year-over-year basis primarily due to cost reductions within research and development and sales and marketing being partially offset by increases in general and administrative expenses. For the six months ended June 30, 2014, the Company generated net income from continuing operations of $0.7 million, or $0.01 per share (basic and diluted), compared to net income from continuing operations of $2.6 million, or $0.04 per share (basic and diluted), during the same period of 2013. At June 30, 2014, the Company held cash of $12.3 million compared to $2.0 million at the end of 2013. Working capital was $23.6 million as of June 30, 2014, up from $22.9 million at December 31, 2013. The Company had 72,291,438 common shares outstanding at June 30, 2014. As of June 30, 2014, AgJunction determined that a majority of its outstanding shares were held directly or indirectly by U.S. residents.

Really big trends? Then a new report from Bank of America Merrill Lynch and its affiliates is probably right up your alley, as strategists at the U.S. financial giant identified five mega trends that are expected to shape the investment landscape over the next decade. \"In a world where change is both constant and expected, there are basic, everlasting themes that will remain essential,\" said Ashvin Chhabra, chief investment officer at Merrill Lynch Wealth Management. The first of the five themes is the Earth and the steady depletion of basic resources such as food, water and energy. The second is innovation, from genetics to robotics to automation, which will allow new businesses to thrive, often at the expense of more traditional names in the marketplace. The third big trend relates to changing global demographics. An aging population, greater economic equality between men and women, a growing middle class, and a wider gap between the haves and have-nots will increasingly influence investment decisions, the report said. Governments are also expected to be a big force. The report noted the number of U.S. government regulations increased to more than one million by 2012 from 834,949 in 1997, and it remains to be seen how government reform in many countries will increase capital flow and improve equity markets. Lastly, the markets themselves will be a mega trend to watch. In particular, the report highlighted the potential impact that an eventual rise in interest rates will have on asset classes and which sectors should benefit from the expected \"great rotation\" from fixed income to equity. Candace Browning, head of BofAML global research, said understanding these themes will give investors a framework that can be used to anticipate and prepare for changes yet to come. Some of the opportunities related to the five themes identified in the report include biotech companies engineering drought-resistant seeds and companies involved in \"precision agriculture,\" which seeks to optimize crop yields through seed selection, spacing of seeds and planting dates. Companies that develop robotics for manufacturing and energy technology, personalized medicine and mobile Internet usage are also noted opportunities, as are established international brands in a range of industries - including apparel, personal care, automotive and luxury - that could help serve the growing middle classes in emerging markets."}, {"title": "Rural hi-tech great but some still suspicious", "article": "C ountry bumpkins are living beside hi-tech rednecks as the digital age comes to rural Ontario farms. One farmer, sans cellphone, might get a message through friends that he needs to hurry home because of a crisis in the barn. Meanwhile, his neighbour will be getting a similar message on his cellphone from the milker at work in his barn--a robot. Wait, robots don't make phone calls. Actually they do. At least those that milk cows without the help of human hands are able to send messages about malfunctions, full tanks, etc. These robotic milkers have been moving into dairy barns across the continent over the past decade. No less an urban-centric newspaper than The New York Times reported that robots allow the cows to set their own hours, lining up for automated milking five or six times a day-- \"turning the pre-dawn and late-afternoon sessions around which dairy farmers long built their lives into a thing of the past.\" The latter is a bit of stretch yet, but it is the way of the future. With transponders around their necks, the cows get individualized attention. Lasers scan and map their underbellies, and a computer charts each animal's \"milking speed.\" The robots also can monitor the amount and quality of milk produced, the frequency of visits to the machine, how much each cow has eaten, or been allowed to eat by the controlling computers, and even the number of steps each cow has taken per day. Milking units include a mechanical arm, cleaning equipment, computerized displays, a milking apparatus and sensors to detect the position of the teats. In the fields, GPS or global positioning systems are allowing farmers to practise \"precision agriculture.\" Combined with earth-observation satellites the GPS units offer navigation assist for tractors, combines and other farm equipment plus huge amounts of information about soil conditions and crop growth right down to small areas of the farm. Besides rows of corn that are planted as straight as the proverbial arrow, this information allows higher yields with less fertilizer and more effective soil conservation. A U.S. government website devoted to the issue tells us that GPS-based applications allow farmers \"to work during low visibility field conditions such as rain, dust, fog, and darkness.\" Chuckwagon racer Mark Sutherland of Alberta was famously named the \"hi-tech redneck\" several years ago by veteran Calgary Stampede announcer Les McIntyre. The handle came from Sutherland's ground-breaking use of GPS in both training and racing his horses. Although Sutherland was not the only innovator, the idea has caught on in ways that couldn't have been imagined even a decade ago. GPS navigation makes driving almost a non-job. One farm hand told me he doesn't use his GPS in full-bore mode because he's afraid the boredom might lull him to sleep behind the wheel. Then a technology crash could lead to a real-time crash with devastating consequences. Farmers need not have the latest tractors and equipment to take advantage of these innovations. Units can be installed on an after-market basis, just as they are in the cars and trucks. In total, farmers now have at their disposal a new and powerful toolbox full of hi-tech management gadgets. Even though they offer tremendous potential, these developments are viewed with varying degrees of suspicion by those of us still driving our teams with voice commands, while leaning on the country bumpkin side of the fence. jmerriam@bmts.com"}, {"title": "Press Release: AgJunction Q2 2014 Conference Call Notice", "article": "AgJunction Q2 2014 Conference Call Notice Canada NewsWire HIAWATHA, KS, July 22, 2014 HIAWATHA, KS, July 22, 2014 /CNW/ - (TSX: AJX) -- AgJunction Inc. will release financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2014 following close of trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Wednesday August 13, 2014.

Canada is one country that could help feed the planet. China may not yet be the world's largest country by gross domestic product standards, but what happens in the region has a dramatic impact on every other nation around the world. That may be no truer than in the food and beverage industry, where population growth and an expanding middle class is dramatically increasing demand for food. Ernst & Young expects that by 2030, 1 billion Chinese will be part of the middle class, up from 150 million today. Rising median incomes will impact large agricultural industries most, says Marcus Cote, a senior account manager in the food and beverage vertical with GE Capital. people tend to move towards more protein rich diets when their disposable income rises, he explains. Some agricultural commodities in Canada, such as wheat, soybeans, beef and pork, are already seeing an uptick in demand. According to Export Development Canada, agri-food exports reached $50.3 billion in 2013, up from $30 billion in 2005. Strong demand from emerging markets should help exports grow by an additional 19 percent in 2014. There's a good reason why Canada is seeing an increase in demand, says Cote. \"Canada has built a reputation, internationally, as a producer of premium products with high food safety standards,\" he says. \"This perception positions Canadian food manufactures to continue to grow exports and service this growing global middle class.\" To keep up with demand, companies have to increase productivity and capacity. They're doing this by investing more on technology that increases automation. While that helps businesses operate around the clock, it can also help by increasing food safety (less human hands touching the food) and reducing redundant, low-value labor. That helps lower prices and increase competitiveness. John Rogers, senior vice-president with Moody's Investors Service, adds that companies will also need to increase their use of fertilizers, utilize efficient seed technology and tap into advancements in \"precision agriculture,\" a technique for maximizing plant growth via micronutrients. While it may take some investment dollars to get ready for the increasing demand, Canadian companies are in a good position to take advantage of this growth. Our strength, says Rogers, is in knowledge-based, value-added farming. \"As productivity improves in North America,\" he says, \"exports will increase.\" BUDDING BIOTECH INDUSTRY One fast growing part of Canada's agriculture market is biotech food, also known as genetically modified organisms. With 10.8 million hectares under cultivation, Canada is the world's fifth largest biotech crop producer in the world. There are four main crops in Canada getting the GMO treatment - canola, maize, soybean and sugar beet. These foods are being engineered to meet specific needs, says Gord Surgeoner, president of Ontario Agri-Food Technologies, a biotech-related industry association. India, China, Korea and Japan could be lucrative markets for these genetically modified foods, he adds. \"We won't just sell them a soybean,\" says Surgeoner. \"We're going to sell you a soybean that is specifically designed to make tofu.\" 10% Expected increase in food exports to the U.S. in 2014 GE CAPITAL $560 Price per metric ton of soybeans in U.S. dollars in April.

According to news reporting from Montreal, Canada, by VerticalNews journalists, research stated, \"Inferring correlations between yield and soil properties is difficult, because the variables involved vary at different scales. The study goal was to describe the spatial distribution of tuber yield (total yield), plant N accumulation (N-uptake) and soil properties at small and large field scales with a multivariate geostatistical method (Co-Regionalization Analysis with a Drift), allowing for a correlation analysis of crop and soil properties at the same scale of variability.\" The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from McGill University, \"Two sites with similar growing practices but different pedodiversity were instrumented at 108 sampling points. Total yield was represented mostly by a small-scale spatial component (< 12.4 m) at Site 1, whereas the importance of the small-scale variability was minor at Site 2. The N-uptake showed a strong spatial structure at small scale at both sites. Large-scale component of N-uptake was also present at both sites, and correlations with total yield and N-uptake were stronger at this scale. Correlations with soil properties at large scale only indicate a low temperature early in the season and a lack of water later during the season decreased yield whereas lower soil density and higher electrical conductivity increased plant productivity. For high productivity, some irrigation may be needed, even only once during the season. Property measurements should be taken at large scale for precision agriculture by respecting the scale of variability of each property.\" According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Small-scale variability should be used when treatments are of interest, for example, plots no longer than 11 m should be used to compare fertilizer rates at the sites of this study.\" For more information on this research see: Spatial Variability of Potato Tuber Yield and Plant Nitrogen Uptake Related to Soil Properties.

All currency amounts for financial results are expressed in U.S. dollars. In September, 2013, the company's Outback Ground Agriculture product line switched to a new \"dealer stocking\" sales model in North America, where aftermarket revenues are now recorded at dealer net rather than at MSRP (manufacturer's suggested retail price), which is approximately a 20-per-cent reduction in revenue on the same volume of goods sold. Although aftermarket revenues are lower under this aftermarket dealer program, there is a decrease in commission expense, so that gross margin is not affected. The new model changes the effect of seasonal timing, as Outback dealers now purchase stocking inventory months earlier than in the prior model, where product was shipped direct to customers from AgJunction inventory. First quarter financial review For the first quarter ended March 31, 2014, the company reported total revenue of $14.9-million, a 10.1-per-cent decrease from $16.6-million in the first quarter of 2013. Strong OEM (original equipment manufacturer) and air results for the quarter were offset by reduced sales in the Outback and agronomy services product lines compared with the same quarter in 2013. Adjusting the $5.5-million of Outback North America sales in the first quarter of 2013 for the effect of the new aftermarket dealer program would decrease revenue by approximately $1.2-million to $4.3-million. The adjusted comparison results in a quarter-over-quarter decline in Outback North America sales of 46.2 per cent, related to an expected softening of the North American market, as well as delays in buying in Canada due to an unseasonably cold and extended winter. For total revenue, the adjusted comparison results in a quarter-over-quarter decline of 3.1 per cent. \"The historical seasonality of our business has been altered as a result of the increase of our international OEM business and a transition to a dealer-stocking model in our aftermarket retail business,\" stated Rick Heiniger, president and chief executive officer. \"Despite a soft North American market in the first quarter, we are confident in our growth prospects as markets improve. We also believe we are witnessing a general transition in our global markets to OEM for core precision-agriculture guidance technologies and are supporting this trend through our OEM partners.\" Sales by business unit for the first quarter of 2014 and 2013 are as shown in the accompanying table.  Sales by region for the first quarter of 2014 and 2013 are as shown in the accompanying table.  Total international (non-North American) revenue increased 33 per cent year over year to $7.5-million, growing to represent 50 per cent of total first quarter revenue, compared with 34 per cent in 2013. European revenue increased 70 per cent in the quarter to $6.2-million from $3.7-million in the same period in 2013, while sales to Australia and other markets, including South America and Asia, declined 17 per cent and 40 per cent, respectively. North American revenue represented 50 per cent of total revenues, as compared with 66 per cent in 2013. First quarter consolidated gross margin of $6.9-million was $90,000 lower year over year, due to a change in sales mix. Gross margins, as a percentage of revenue, were 45.9 per cent during the quarter, compared with 46.6 per cent in 2013. As a result of management's streamlining initiatives, operating expenses were $5.5-million in the first quarter, down 13 per cent from $6.3-million in the first quarter of 2013. The decrease relates to several cost-saving initiatives and efficiencies realized through the restructuring period that began in late 2013. Management is maintaining tight control of expenses, supporting the overall profitability of the streamlined operating model. In the first quarter of 2014, the company generated income from continuing operations of $1.3-million, or two cents per share (basic and diluted), compared with income from continuing operations of $1.5-million, or two cents per share (basic and diluted), in the first quarter of 2013. For the first quarter of 2014, the company realized comprehensive income of $1.3-million, or two cents per share (basic and diluted), compared with comprehensive income of $4.9-million, or seven cents per share (basic and diluted), in the comparable quarter of 2013.

About 50 engineering students from 12 universities created what could potentially become some of the most advanced unmanned aviation vehicles (UAV) in the country during the Unmanned Systems Canada student competition. \"The results were outstanding. My overall impression is that innovation and solid engineering is alive and well in Canada,\" said chairman of Unmanned Systems Canada Stewart Baillie. Students were tasked with building an unmanned aircraft that could be used in a commercial application. The scenario was a conflict between farmers and a pipeline company, wherein the farmers claimed oil was leaking from the buried pipes destroying their crops; the oil company claimed there have been breaches to their right of way and a rockslide caused the spill. \"They need to map the area for precision agriculture, so we simulated some bad crops in the area and they need to detect that, map it, and tell us where it is. For mining, there are rock stockpiles so they need to determine the volume by taking pictures and recreating a 3D model of it,\" said Charles Vidal, chairman of the student competition organizing committee. According to Vidal, a demand for unmanned systems aircraft in Canada is on the rise from various industries. Aside from the military, Vidal said the top three industries looking at UAV investments are oil and gas, mining, and agriculture. \"It's a business that's grown a lot through the years as more and more people become aware that flying robots exist and they can help out and help them save money on what they need to do. Flying robots are safer, cheaper, and more environmentally friendly than traditional methods,\" he added. In the United States, UAV technology has the potential of injecting$82 billion into the American economy and 100,000 new high paying jobs, according to Doug McDonald, senior associate of Unmanned Applications Institute International based in North Dakota. \"The commercial potential has yet to be realized, but it's going to be huge once (the UAVs) are permitted to travel in international aerospace,\" he said. All the teams at the competition were sponsored by various companies mostly in the energy, technology, and military sectors. Electrical engineer Joseph Patton, a recent graduate from the University of Alberta, and his team built a fixed-wing foam frame aircraft for their American sponsor the Utility Air Regulatory Group, a coalition of power companies. They also received a $5,000 donation from gas giant Shell. \"The main goal was to have a modular unit that was easy to fix and debug,\" said Patton. \"We were tasked to design this project and the best way to show that it was successful was to come to this competition.\" While most of the teams had fixed wing designs, only the team from Ecole de Technologie Superieure in Montreal had a rotary design aircraft, which has the advantage of hovering in an area and completing more specific tasks as opposed to a fixed wing. \"There are only a handful of companies that really try to push its design, so we're trying to see what we can do with it. \"Of course a lot of my colleagues would like to start their companies after graduation and sell these designs. We just want to push the envelope a bit and see what we can do with it,\" said ETS mechanical engineering student Michael McCarthy. UAV companies use the competition as a recruitment camp for interns and full-time employees. In total, $4,500 in prizes were awarded with $2,000 going to the Universite de Sherbrooke, which placed third in the design phase and won first place in operations; and $1,000 to the University of Victoria, which placed third in the operational phase of the competition. Other winners included University of Toronto Aeronautics (first) and Carleton University (second) for design with Ecole de Technologie Superieur(second)rounding out the operational awards. No teams from Manitoba competed. svjetlana.mlinarevic@sunmedia.ca"}, {"title": "Improvements made to help protect farmland", "article": "Federal Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz and Saskatchewan Agriculture Minister Lyle Stewart have announced improvements to the Farm Stewardship Program, which provides support for producers to adopt management practices that maintain or improve the quality of soil, water, air or biodiversity resources. \"The changes being made to this program will enable them to continue producing high-quality agricultural products in a way that is both environmentally responsible and sustainable in the long term,\" Ritz said in a news release.

But after a trip to nearby Fargo, N.D., he was wowed by the use of satellite imagery to identify high nitrogen areas for growing sugar beets and wanted to do something similar for his customers. Back at the fertilizer plant where he worked, he started to build a program. The farmers loved it, but as it reduced the amount of fertilizer the company's best customers were buying, it wasn't good for the fertilizer business. So \"pushed by the farmers\" to start his own business, Mr. Barnes co-founded Farmers Edge Precision Consulting Inc. in 2005. The Winnipeg-based company specializes in precision agriculture - including variable rate technology (VRT) that uses satellite imagery to pinpoint when and where to plant and how much to fertilize - to help growers increase crop production and become more sustainable. The company has operations in Canada, the United States, Eastern Europe and South America. \"Once I saw the differences in the areas of the field, the variability, it opened my eyes,\" Mr. Barnes says. \"I realized how uninformed we were because we didn't have any information to make decisions. We were just winging it and these farmers were spending millions of dollars on fertilizer. The technology allows farmers to optimize their fertilizers. The whole business of farming has changed.\" Fertilizer is a huge issue for farmers and the environment. Since the use of commercial fertilizer correlates directly to increased yield (generally estimated at between 30 to 50 per cent), farmers want to use enough to ensure a good crop. But if too much fertilizer is used - particularly nitrogen fertilizer and other crop inputs such as pesticides and herbicides - the runoff can go into the groundwater, polluting water supplies and damaging natural habitat. The increased use of nitrogen fertilizer has also resulted in the formation of atmospheric nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent greenhouse gas contributing to stratospheric ozone depletion and global warming. But changes in how fertilizer is used - when fields are fertilized and how much is used - can reduce N2O emissions, according to research at the University of California, Berkeley. \"When the harvest is done, the goal should be that very little fertilizer is left in the ground,\" Mr. Barnes says. \" If technology can bridge that gap, to allow the farmer to make good informed decisions about what he's doing, the environment is going to benefit from that. They won't overfertilize. The technology essentially allows farmers to be green, but, at the end of the day, to be green with a purpose and make a lot more money by doing it.\" Recently, Farmers Edge has begun to focus on water, using satellite imagery and real-time information to determine the right amount of irrigation. With droughts occurring in many parts of the world, water is a valuable commodity. \"We build modules into our system so that from a satellite you can start assessing how much nitrogen a crop needs or how much water,\" Mr. Barnes says. \"So we can look at a crop in season and say, that part of the field needs water and that part doesn't. Then we segregate the areas out, fill the prescription map and send it to the irrigation system to put on the exact amount of water.\" Hortau Inc. has also developed high-tech solutions to irrigation, but with an approach centred on the plants. The company, based in St. Romuald, Que., with offices in California and Colorado, offers wireless, Web-based irrigation management systems to about 1,000 growers throughout North America. Their solar-powered technology reports back to the farmer how plants are doing in real time, before plant stresses such as drought can negatively affect the crop. Agriculture accounts for about 70 per cent of water used in the world today. Jocelyn Boudreau, an agricultural engineer who co-founded Hortau in 2002, estimates its technology can save roughly 25 to 30 per cent of that water, as well as the same amount of energy used for pumping the water for irrigation. \"Most farmers tend to overwater to be on the safe side,\" Mr. Boudreau says. \"You can hurt the yield just as much by overwatering as underwatering and the excess water can push the fertilizers down to where the crop can't use them. We're providing them with a tool where they can increase their productivity so they can grow more just by avoiding plant stress due to lack of water or overwatering. At the same time, they use less water, less energy and avoid leeching fertilizers into the water table. It's a very good balance.\" That's a huge advantage for the environment, as well as for the farmers. While the cost to use Hortau's technology can be anywhere from $10 to $100 an acre each year, Mr. Boudreau says it's cost effective with the payback usually covered by the first crop. In some areas where there's restricted water, such as Colorado and Nebraska, or drought-stricken California, Mr. Boudreau says their technology is seen as critical. \"If you only have so many inches of water that you can apply on your field for that year, how do you spread it out?\" Mr. Boudreau asks. \"Depending on the growth stage of the crop, the season, the weather conditions - it's a tricky assessment. You can't do that just by eyeing it. A precision tool comes in very handy.\" Increasingly, sustainability is good business for farmers. Many major food companies have a sustainability mandate, so they only want to do business with growers who are sustainable. That's created a lot of push, not just into VRT or crop fertilizer efficiency or water use efficiency, explains Mr. Barnes, but farmers also need to prove they've done it. Part of Farmers Edge's mandate in developing technology is to build a computer program into the farm equipment so that they're logging information back, so farmers have data to back up their work. \"There's a lot of research being done behind the scenes to validate farmers - to find out how green these practices actually are,\" Mr. Barnes says. \"So we're working on a new initiative, [with Alberta's agricultural producers, Canadian Fertilizer Institute and Capital Power Corp.] regarding carbon offsets. When farmers do these practices, they're being environmentally efficient and creating a carbon offset. We're working on logging that data and being able to crunch those numbers to provide how much of an impact they've made on a reduction of carbon.\" The hope is the farmers will be able to sell that to some of the Alberta industries that need carbon credits. Also, if farmers makes enough money off the carbon credit to pay for technology, they are more apt to adapt it faster - and the more farmers that adapt to the technology, the better it is for the environment. \"It's a circle that could be effective for everybody,\" Mr. Barnes says.\"We've always believed that when growers do VRT, they could be 25 to 35 per cent more efficient - but it was important for the scientific community to step up and do the work and say, 'Yes, that is accurate, and that is making a difference.' We think you're going to see a lot more adaption to this, not only in Canada but all over the world.\" Globe and Mail Update"}, {"title": "Feds invest $2M in Niagara College innovation centre", "article": "Niagara College will be getting $1.75 million in federal funding over five years for the Industry Innovation Centre at the Welland campus.

That was one of the main themes circulating through the first day of presentations at the inaugural Canadian Global Crops Symposium in Winnipeg. Representatives from the pulse, canola, cereals and soybean crop industries each took turns outlining their various wishlists and strategic plans to the roughly 125 people in attendance. Greg Porozni, the chairman of Cereal Millers Canada, said government and customers see a lack of coordination between many of the existing cereal industry reps. Getting a better handle on the quality characteristics that draw a premium from the market and determining what the customer will pay, should be one of the first orders of business. \"Markets are quickly evolving, industry efforts should be focused on demands and competition of the future, not just based on historic indicators,\" he said. That sentiment was picked up by Curt Vossen, the President and CEO of Richardson International. Traceability and food labelling are two issues the public is big on right now, and the Canadian agricultural sector needs to be asking questions of these and other quality requirements, he said. \"Gluten-free came from almost nowhere just a few years ago, now it's a 7 or 8 million dollar market business on a global basis and growing.\" Questions that need to be looked at include: Is the customer willing to pay, would the quality requirements being pushed by the public reduce yields, or is the market so competitive those factors have to be part of the process, regardless of the consumers' ability to pay? Reforming the variety registration and wheat classification systems would give greater flexibility while maintaining the industry's ability to deliver quality characteristics to the market, he added. The chairman of the Canola Council of Canada, Terry Youzwa, outlined his group's main objective of increasing crop yields from the current average of 34 bushels an acre to 52 bushels an acre by 2025. Launched earlier this year, the strategy calls for Canadian canola production to jump from an average of 15.5 million metric tonnes to 26 MMT by 2025. He said the increase will come through harvest management, integrated pest management, fertility management, plant establishment and genetic improvements. Focusing on yields instead of acreage expansion will keep canola from crowding out other crops, help it maintain steady exports and preserve crop diversity, he said. For this to happen elevators, railways and truckers must all be ready for the coming volume, he said. \"If Canada is to reap the full benefits, Canada must get the infrastructure in place.\" One delegate asked if Canada's ports, especially the Port of Vancouver, would be ready to deal with the looming volume requirements. Vossen said he thought the challenges could be met, even if some questions haven't been fully answered. \"We haven't even talked about, what if you increase corn acres in western Canada? Now you start to replace acres that are responsible for 40 to 50 a bushel acre yields with 150 a bushel acre yields, that's going to put new demands on the system.\" Richard Wansbutter, a consultant for Viterra pointed out the problems the flax industry and soybeans sectors have had with trace levels of non-approved GMO products winding up in shipments to Europe. He said it's an issue exporters can't afford to ignore moving forward. \"In essence we lost that market overnight,\" he said, referring to the incident in 2009 that saw Canadian flax shipments to Europe temporarily halted after residues of genetically-modified CDC Triffied wounds up in what were supposed to be GMO-free shipments. Canada simply can't have its supplies being questioned, he said, which is why the government's willingness to adopt the low-level presence policy was a crucial step in alleviating the problem. Brant Randles, the president and CEO of Louis Dreyfus Canada noted that in the past three years they haven't actually seeded all the potential acres in Western Canada. So this season's record-high harvest and resulting transportation slowdown is a good test for future years. Bio-technology and precision farming could well make yields like last year's the new reality going forward, he said."}, {"title": "Government of Canada: Harper Government Boosts Manufacturing Capabilities in the West", "article": "April 11 -- Western Economic Diversification Canada Agricultural machinery and heavy equipment manufacturers across Western Canada will benefit from improved testing capacity of their innovative product designs, thanks to a $2.5 million investment from Western Economic Diversification Canada (WD).

According to news originating from Truro, Canada, by VerticalNews correspondents, research stated, \"Wild blueberry producers apply fungicide uniformly without considering significant bare spots in the field. The wrong or over use of fungicide in bare spots results in an increased cost of production and threatens the environment.\" Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Dalhousie University, \"An automated prototype variable rate (VR) sprayer was used for spot-application (SA) of Chlorothalonil (Bravo(A (R))) fungicide in a wild blueberry field. Eighteen 6.1 m wide test tracks were selected in the field and bare spots were mapped using a real-time kinematics-global positioning system (RTK-GPS). Six plots were selected randomly for three different application rates. Water sensitive papers (WSP) were placed in foliage and bare spots in SA and uniform-application (UA) tracks. The percent area coverage (PAC) of WSP with both SA and UA in foliage and bare spot areas were calculated. Plant growth parameters were measured from all 108 randomly selected plots in SA, UA and control (CN) tracks for comparison. Plant images were taken over six selected plots in each of the 18 tracks. Images were analyzed using custom developed software to calculate the percentage of green pixels (PGP) for determining the effect of Bravo(A (R)) on plant health. Fruit yield parameters were also measured from selected plots for comparison. Non-significance of the t test for SA versus UA plant targets' PAC indicated that there was no significant bias in the SA with saving (9.90-51.22 %) and SA was accurate. Bravo(A (R)) did not show any significant difference on plant growth parameters among SA, UA and CN. However, PGP, floral bud and harvestable yield of SA and UA were significantly increased over CN.\" According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Therefore, a VR sprayer could be used for SA of fungicides in wild blueberry cropping system to reduce chemical usage and maintain crop productivity.\" The news correspondents report that additional information may be obtained from T.J.

This week, let's look at some interesting facts on farming that you might not know. This information is from Farm and Food Care Ontario. Did you know that one acre of corn removes about eight tons of carbon dioxide from the air in one growing season? Did you know that greenhouse gas is not actually gas coming from a greenhouse? It's a series of gases such as methane and carbon dioxide, which act as a shield that traps heat in the earth's atmosphere, much like the way a greenhouse retains heat. Greenhouse gases have been linked to contributing to global warming. Did you know that pesticide use can help protect wildlife? The biggest threat to wildlife is the loss of habitat. Pesticides help farmers produce more food without increasing the area of cultivated land. These pesticides are precise, safe, and stringently controlled. Scientific surveys show that pesticide residues in foods are 100 to 1,000 times lower in Canada that levels considered safe by the World Health Organization. About 30% of Canada's agricultural land is too hilly, rocky, cold, or wet to produce crops. But it can support grazing livestock, which don't compete with people for food grains. In all, about 80% of the feed consumed by cattle, sheep, goats, and horses could not be eaten or digested by humans. Animals convert low-energy and otherwise indigestible plant matter into nutrient and protein rich food, while returning organic matter (manure) to the soil. This is the original recycling program. Soil is made of three things -sand, silt, and clay. On their own, each has its benefits and challenges, but when mixed together to what is called a loam soil, they create a perfect growing environment for plants. The texture of the soil, how it looks and feels, depends upon the amount of each one in that particular soil. In all provinces across Canada, a voluntary program called the Environmental Farm plan is helping farmers audit their operations for environmental concerns, as well as helping them set goals and timetables for improvements. In Ontario, around 70% of our farmers have participated and have invested over $600 million in on-farm environmental improvements over the last 20 years. If you drove your car from Charlottetown, PEI to Vancouver, BC you would use 540 litres of ethanol, produced from one-third of an acre of corn land, which is about the size of a quarter of a Canadian football field. And with ethanol being a form of renewable energy, it emits less carbon dioxide than gasoline. Did you know that 100 acres of soybeans can produce enough soymilk for 500,000 people? Many farmers today rely on precision agriculture through satellite-controlled guidance through GPS on their tractors and equipment to manage their field work, including planting, nutrient and crop protection application, and harvesting. It helps reduce fuel consumption, and helps farmers ensure more efficient use of nutrients, seeds, and crop protection products. Agriculture really is a fascinating and innovative sector. And there are always things to learn. Think about this -Man's way leads to a hopeless end -God's way leads to an endless hope.

The Dover Centre-area company now offers a precision agriculture service, in addition to its long-time seed enterprise and its business of building grain storage, drying and grain handling equipment. Business manager Lisa Devolder says the latest addition to Devolder Farms was launched in February. Working with Illinois-based Precision Agriculture, Devolder is providing products and services to help fine-tune and improve their customers' agricultural practices, especially during the planting season. Those improvements may include a retrofit to planting equipment. Devolder says the new division dovetails neatly with Devolder Farms' other activities. \"It all starts with planting season,\" she said March 20. \"How you plant your crop will determine your entire year. It's vitally important.\" She said Precision Agriculture was started by an Illinois farmer who was making subtle changes to his planting equipment to accommodate new technology, all in an effort to improve his crops' yield. Devolder is the Precision Agriculture representative for Chatham-Kent. The company was praised by the Chatham-Kent Chamber of Commerce on Thursday for its innovation and progress, and was named industry of the month for March. The company was started over 25 years ago by Bob and Diane Devolder, initially as a small custom seed-cleaning business for farmers. The company became a dealer for DeKalb Seed, not only growing pedigreed corn seed on Devolder land, but growing experimental varieties and maintaining select plots. Devolder Farms also processes and packages seed. The company expanded its agricultural scope in 2005 when it started to build grain storage, drying and grain handling equipment. That division of the company includes a sales and design team, installation workers, millwrighting and service crews. The enterprise includes a custom fabrication shop and a fully stocked warehouse. Devolder Farms employs 30 full-time workers, but hires an additional 20 during its busiest seasons. Lisa Devolder says the company's growth has been tremendous over the years, and she pays tribute to her parents' vision and work ethic. \"They started out with no employees, just themselves and their three daughters,\" she said Thursday. \"This has all happened because of their hard work.\" The Devolder family farm now includes three buildings, and Lisa Devolder says the business office has been expanded three times to accommodate the company's growth. Of the grain storage, drying and handling equipment division, she said Devolder started \"as a very small contractor\" but is now a provincial leader in that segment. \"We sell our equipment all over Ontario now,\" she said. Devolder said the company's growth has been phenomenal, but remains a reflection of the tremendous opportunity that resides within Chatham-Kent's agricultural community. \"We live in one of the most prime agricultural areas in all of Canada, and our farm community is composed of some very forward-thinking people,\" she said. \"Our family is passionate about agriculture.\" Devolder added that agriculture remains a sector of opportunity, not only for farmers and landowners, but for those wishing to pursue a career. She said it's sometimes a challenge to attract new employees to the sector because agriculture still carries a stigma with some people, but said there will always be a demand for workers. \"Right now, in fact, we have seven different posting on our website,\" she said. \"We want to hire new employees because we're growing.\""}, {"title": "Devolder is March's feature industry in C-K", "article": "Devolder Farms will be recognized as Chatham-Kent's \"Feature Industry\" for the month of March 2014.

Agriculture is a sexy industry at the moment and one that will rarely find someone unemployed. Progressive farmers are slowly getting younger and much more educated as their business grows in acres and revenue. Outside of above average commodity prices and exceptional crop yields, a large part of that growth has been a result of advancements in genetics, machinery, and technology. When I first entered the grain farming industry in 1998, I got to witness the introduction of GPS and Auto-Steer in equipment. Low and behold, almost perfectly straight lines were made in fields. Now, when you drive around the country and come across a field that doesn't have laser straight lines in it, you're shocked and instantly brought back a whole 15 short years. The speed of technology progress in Agriculture is simply stunning. Instead of GPS that was capable of putting us within a few meters of our previous reference point, we're now sub-inch! If shortage of labor is your issue, why not consider a tractor that can drive itself?! The leader / follower technology is making its way onto the market. Outside of the equip-m ent capabilities and the advancements there, Genetic Engineering (GE) will be a big part of being able to feed 9 Billion people by the year 2050. To put this into perspective, we have to roughly produce the same amount of food in the next 36 years as the globe has produced cumulatively since day ZERO! As much as we love to garden and raise organic produce on our farm, GE will be part of the solution to feeding 9 Billion people. The environmental benefit of GE crops is a huge attraction. Science is experimenting with more drought tolerant species, and plants that are resistant to certain insects and disease therefor farmers wouldn't have to spray insecticides as often. GE crops will produce more bushels on less land, increasing nutrient density in those bushels, and decreasing the amount of inputs needed. GE crops will be part of what enables the world to support 9 Billion people. Drones, yes, the flying little machines once found on Star Wars are coming to a farm near you! We will be able to utilize these flying robots to get very clear imagery in-season to in-accessible areas. I wonder if the oil and gas industry will utilize these for well maintenance... this would drastically reduce the spread of weeds and other diseases carried on the vehicles that they use currently. Variable Rate Technology is rapidly on the upswing, and I think that we'll look back in 5 years at VRT the same way as we have with auto-steer and say, \"Remember when we used to fertilize our fields with the same blend on every acre?!\". Precision Farming allows us to properly allocate resources to areas in the field that need them most whether it be fertilizer, seed, or other crop protection products. Technological advancements are hitting Agriculture a mile a minute these days, making farming more accurate, environmentally friendly and precise."}, {"title": "Press Release: AgJunction Grows 37% on Strong Q4 Revenue", "article": "AgJunction Grows 37% on Strong Q4 Revenue Canada NewsWire HIAWATHA, KS, March 18, 2014 \"International revenue jumps 160% in fourth quarter on OEM growth\" HIAWATHA, KS, March 18, 2014 /CNW/ - (TSX: AJX) -- AgJunction today reported a 37% increase in fourth quarter revenues compared to last year driven by strong OEM growth. On September 5, 2012, the Company announced a corporate restructuring to focus exclusively on its agriculture business, subsequently selling its non-agriculture business on January 31, 2013. To increase clarity of results for continuing operations of the agriculture business after divesting the non-agriculture business, and in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), the Company has reported the divested components of its business as \"discontinued operations\" in a separate line item in both the current and prior comparative periods. All currency amounts for financial results for the three and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2013 are expressed in U.S. dollars. Fourth Quarter Financial Review For the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2013, the Company reported total revenue of $13.9 million, an increase of 37% from $10.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. Total international (non-North American) revenue increased 160% year-over-year to $7.3 million, growing to represent 53% of total Q4 revenue compared to 28% in 2012. European revenue increased 180% in the quarter to $4.3 million from $1.5 million in the same period in 2012. A 120% increase in OEM revenue to $8.2 million was driven by international customers. \"I am pleased to report strong revenue and earnings growth during the fourth quarter \" stated Rick Heiniger, President and CEO. \"Our international OEM business was the core driver behind our fourth quarter growth and is changing the traditional seasonality of our business. We believe our global markets are generally making a transition from aftermarket to OEM for core precision agriculture guidance technologies and is evident in our sales results. We are working closely with our current and new OEM partners to support this trend.\" Revenues during the fourth quarter were as follows:  Fourth quarter revenue growth was driven by solid results in the Company's OEM, Air and Agronomy product lines. Reported Outback revenues in North America declined by 21% as a result of the new aftermarket dealer program that was implemented during the third and fourth quarters. As previously announced, aftermarket revenues are now recorded at dealer net rather than at MSRP, which is approximately a 20% reduction in revenue on the same volume of goods sold. Although aftermarket revenues are lower under this aftermarket dealer program, there is a decrease in commission expense so that gross margin is not negatively impacted. Sales by business unit for the fourth quarter of 2013 and 2012 were as follows:  While year-over-year North American Outback product sales were essentially flat in the fourth quarter, reported revenue declined by 11% from 2012 primarily due to the change to North American aftermarket dealer program pricing changes for the fourth quarter of 2013. North American revenue represented 47% of total revenues as compared to 72% in 2012. In Australia, sales declined by 54% from $0.5 million to $0.2 million due to softening in the aftermarket agricultural retail space. Sales to other markets, including South America and Asia, grew by 251% from $0.8 million to $2.8 million due to strengthening relationships in the OEM and Air markets. Fourth quarter consolidated gross margin was unchanged at 40% or $5.5 million, compared to 40% and $4.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2012. As a result of management's streamlining initiatives, operating expenses were $5.3 million in the fourth quarter down $0.9 million or 14% from $6.2 million (prior to restructuring) in the fourth quarter of 2012. The decrease relates to several cost saving initiatives and efficiencies realized through the restructuring period that began in late 2012. Management is maintaining tight control of expenses, supporting the overall profitability of the streamlined operating model. In the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company generated income from continuing operations of $7 thousand, or $0.00 per share (basic and diluted), compared to a loss from continuing operations of $29.3 million or ($0.45) per share (basic and diluted) in the fourth quarter of 2012, which included a $5.7 million restructuring charge and a $21 million goodwill impairment. For the fourth quarter of 2013 the Company realized a comprehensive income of $6 thousand, or $0.00 per share (basic and diluted), compared to a comprehensive loss of $32.9 million, or ($0.50) per share (basic and diluted), in the fourth quarter of 2012. 2013 12-Month Financial Review For the twelve months ended December 31, 2013, AgJunction reported revenues of $58.2 million compared to $55.4 million in 2012.  Driven primarily by OEM sales growth of 48%, total international (non-North American) revenue increased 47% year-over-year, growing to represent 41% of total revenue compared to 29% in 2012. Year-over-year North American reported revenue declined by 12% from 2012, and represented 59% of total revenues as compared to 71% in 2012. The previously discussed change to the North American aftermarket dealer pricing changes contributed to the year-over-year decrease. In North America, 2013 United States revenue declined 6% and Canada declined by 27%, due primarily to first quarter delays in aftermarket product releases during growing season and the North American aftermarket dealer pricing changes. Revenue in Europe grew by 87% due to strengthening relationships in the OEM market. In Australia, sales declined by 57% due to softening in the aftermarket agricultural retail space and a strengthening US dollar. Sales to other markets, including South America and Asia, grew by 48% in 2013 due to strengthening relationships in the OEM and Air markets. For 2013, strong OEM growth of 48% and Agronomy Services growth of 32% were offset by 24% lower reported revenue in Outback and 3% revenue decrease for Air product lines compared to 2012. 2013 consolidated gross margin was $25.5 million, or 44% versus $24.5 million, or 44% in 2012. Operating expenses before acquisition and restructuring costs was $22.7 million in 2013, down by 12% or $3.0 million from $25.7 million in 2012. The primary driver of the decrease is related to the Company's post restructuring efforts previously discussed. For 2013, the Company realized income from continuing operations of $2.6 million or $0.04 per share (basic and diluted), compared to a loss from continuing operations of $29.0 million or ($0.44) per share (basic and diluted) in 2012. Income from discontinued operations was $2.5 million or $0.04 per share (basic and diluted) in 2013, compared to a loss of $5.5 million or ($0.08) per share (basic and diluted) in 2012. The Company realized comprehensive income of $5.2 million of $0.08 per share (basic and diluted) in 2013 compared to comprehensive loss of $34.6 million or ($0.52) per share (basic and diluted) in 2012. At December 31, 2013, the Company held cash and short-term deposits of $10.1 million compared to $2.6 million at the end of 2012. Working capital was $22.9 million at December 31, 2013, up from $17.2 million at December 31, 2012. The Company had 69,805,628 common shares outstanding at December 31, 2013. Guidance AgJunction is issuing guidance for Q1'14 due to a general softness within its core markets for precision agriculture. Weaker grain prices in 2013 may have tempered market strength typically experienced in the first part of the year. Despite this uncertainty, the Company expects first quarter 2014 financial results to exceed the fourth quarter of 2013, but trail first quarter 2013 reported results. Management maintains confidence for revenue and earnings growth over the long term.

Steve Ashton says he talked on the phone to Canadian Pacific C-E-O Hunter Harrison today, and says Harrison agreed to try to get more grain shipped through the port in Thunder Bay, Ontario. The federal government has set minimum targets for C-P and Canadian National of 11-thousand cars a week, with fines of up to 100-thousand dollars a day for failing to meet that target. (Grain-Backlog-Sask) The Saskatchewan government has released an outline for stiffer federal penalties and targets to clear a grain movement backlog. Agriculture Minister Lyle Stewart suggests many proposals, including the railway penalty be raised to a minimum 250 thousand dollars a day. Stewart is also calling for any penalties to directly benefit farmers. The federal legislation is expected to be tabled when Parliament returns next Monday. (CKRM) (Grain-Backlog-Union) A union spokesman for Canadian Pacific Railway engineers in Western Canada says he has a solution to get more grain moving by rail. Dave Able, Teamsters Canada rail conference general chair for CP Rail engineers, says more manpower and more locomotives is the answer. CP's C-E-O Hunter Harrison has been publicly defending his company's performance moving grain, noting it's been the harshest winter for rail movement in his 40 years in the rail business. Able says the real problem is a shortage of staff and locomotive power, as Harrison has cut thousands of jobs and hundreds of locomotives since taking the reins of the company in 2012.

But controlled traffic farming methods are kicking goals on both sides of the globe in farming country where moisture levels are critical. Steve Larocque farms about 400ha with family at Morrin in Alberta, Canada, about 75 minutes northeast of Calgary and on the eastern side of the Rocky Mountains. It snows there -- lots -- and temperatures can dip to minus 45C. Yet the similarities between farming there and in some cropping areas in Australia are too close to ignore, according to Steve. He travelled to Australia during his Nuffield Scholarship in 2009-10 and visited more than 30 controlled traffic farms in Queensland, Victoria, NSW and Western Australia. What that taught him was that controlled traffic farming, or always going along the same wheel tracks rather than randomly across the paddock, could offer a solution to moisture stress that the crops he was growing back in Canada were suffering. On Steve's farm, the cereal crops are grown in a short period in summer. They are planted in late April to mid May, and sprayed with herbicides in June. Any necessary fungicide treatments go on in late June to mid-July, and a pre-harvest glyphosate is sprayed in early September, to control weeds and to dry down the crops. Then harvest runs from September to the end of October. And all of this is in the northern hemisphere summer. Steve is also a private crop consultant, and leased land to try new techniques after becoming frustrated with a plateau in yields using zero tillage with his clients. \"I leased land because to start a farm from scratch, you have to choose between purchasing land or purchasing equipment,\" he said. \"I can lease land for 2.3 per cent of the land value compared to buying the land, which requires a 25 per cent down payment and 5 per cent interest on principal. \"Leasing makes the most sense. \"I'm also able to test products, theories and take the risk of new farming practices before I recommend them to clients.\" That's exactly what he did with controlled traffic farming. What he saw in Australia convinced him it was a way to manage climate variability. The CTF system has been used on his own farm since 2010, and yields of six tonnes a hectare for wheat, 3t/ha for canola, 4t/ha for peas and 4t/ha for faba beans have been seen with in-crop rainfall of 300mm. Steve concedes evaporation rates are low given the 1000m altitude, but is still convinced the method is a winner. Steve didn't go out and buy all new equipment in his quest to try the new farming method. \"We could have traded equipment or bought new to match our needs but instead we modified all of our equipment to run on 30-foot (9.15m) equipment widths and 121.5-inch (3m) axle widths,\" he said. \"We needed to remember, though, that you don't just flip a switch and go to CTF overnight.\" So convinced is Steve that the CTF is a winner on his own farm that he is now advising clients to begin the transition by starting with tractors, seeders and boom sprayers. Harvest equipment and logistics will be figured out over time.\"The biggest advantages of CTF are water infiltration, soil moisture storage at depth, improved timeliness of applications and the ability to apply precision agriculture technologies, like side dressing nitrogen between the rows, in the growing season, to capture additional yield when moisture allows,\" he said."}, {"title": "CANADA CALLING DIESEL HEADS WANTED", "article": "FANCY fixing tractors on 100,000ac farms? The world's second biggest CASE dealership was in Ireland this week looking for mechanics to work in one of its 38-outlet network in western Canada. \"We're looking for up to 50 ag technicians with a minimum of three years experience to earn up to EUR29/hr, or EUR65,000 a year,\" said Rocky Mountain Equipment director, Jon Beatty. The company, which has been growing sales by 15pc a year to EUR650m in 2013, is struggling to compete with the booming oil and gas industry for local staff. \"There is effectively zero unemployment in western Canada with the strength of the commodity industry for the last decade or more. The worst growth year in recent times was 2009, when growth simply slowed slightly,\" said Mr Beatty. Prospered The farm sector has also prospered, with high prices and yields leading to record output for the sector over the last number of years. \"If we were looking for automotive mechanics or mining mechanics, it'd be a piece of cake. But ag mechanics have a particular skillset in troubleshooting and repairs that you just don't find in other sectors,\" he said. The firm conducted interviews with prospective candidates for the company''s two year temporary foreign worker programme in Kerry, where Mr Beatty addressed Tralee IT's agricultural engineering students. They heard about the massive scale that Canadian arable farmers operate at, with a typical part-time operation at about 6,000ac. Some of the firm''s clients buy up to 10 new combines every two years. \"But that doesn''t mean that all of our employees live out in the middle of nowhere. The furthest anyone would live from a city would be a 2.5 hour drive,\" insisted Mr Beatty. He added that GPS and precision farming technology is standard on all machinery sold in Canada these days by virtue of the huge savings that farmers at this scale make by eliminating overlaps."}, {"title": "Agrium announces new precision agriculture brand, Echelon", "article": "Release date - 04032014 Calgary, Alberta - Agrium Inc.
