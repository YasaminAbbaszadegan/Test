With Climate's analytics-based digital tools, more Canadian farmers will be able to harness their data in one connected platform to identify and more efficiently manage variability in their fields, tailoring crop inputs to optimize yield and maximize their return on every acre. In September 2016, the company first announced the introduction of the Climate FieldView platform in Eastern Canada, where hundreds of farmers across nearly one million acres have been experiencing the value of data-driven, digital tools on their operations. Now, farmers in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta will have the ability to use the Climate FieldView platform to uncover personalized field insights to support the many crucial decisions they make each season to enhance crop productivity. \"The Climate FieldView platform is a one-stop shop for simple field data management, helping Canadian farmers get the most out of every acre,\" said Denise Hockaday, Canada business lead for The Climate Corporation. \"Through the delivery of the platform's powerful data analytics and customized field insights, farmers across Canada have the power to tailor their agronomic practices more precisely than ever before, fine tuning their action plans for the best outcome at the end of the season.\" Over the past year, the Climate FieldView platform had a strong testing effort across many farm operations in Western Canada, enabling the Climate team to further develop the platform's compatibility with all types of farm equipment and crops, including canola and wheat, to collect and analyze field data from multiple sources. \"Part of the challenge with data is managing all of the numbers and having an adequate cloud system to store and effectively analyze the information,\" said farmer D'Arcy Hilgartner of Alberta, who participated in testing the Climate FieldView platform on his operation this season. \"The Climate FieldView platform instantly transfers the field data gathered from my farm equipment into my Climate FieldView account, which is especially useful during harvest season because I'm able to see where various crop inputs were used and analyze the corresponding yield. I've really enjoyed having this digital platform at my disposal, and I'm excited to see the positive impacts on my business this coming year.\" As Climate continues to expand its digital technologies to help more farmers access advanced agronomic insights, additional new data layers will feed the company's unmatched R&D engine, ultimately enabling the development of valuable new features for farmers in the Climate FieldView platform. In August 2017, the company announced the acceleration of R&D advancements through the company's robust innovation pipeline, along with new product features and enhancements to help farmers manage their field variability more precisely than ever before. Launched in 2015, the Climate FieldView platform is on more than 120 million acres with more than 100,000 users across the United States, Canada and Brazil. It has quickly become the most broadly connected platform in the industry and continues to expand into new global regions. Climate FieldView Platform Offering in Western Canada Data Connectivity - Farmers can collect, store and visualize their field data in one easy-to-use digital platform through the Climate FieldView(TM) Drive, a device that easily streams field data directly into the Climate FieldView platform. FieldView Drive works with many tractors and combines across Canada, in addition to anhydrous applicators and air seeders, helping farmers easily collect field data for the agronomic inputs they manage throughout the season. Recently, The Climate Corporation announced a new data connectivity agreement with AGCO, providing more farmers even more options to connect their equipment to the Climate FieldView platform. In addition to the FieldView Drive, farmers can connect their field data to their Climate FieldView account through Precision Planting LLC's monitors, cloud-to-cloud connection with other agricultural software systems such as the John Deere Operations Center, and through manual file upload. Yield Analysis Tools - With Climate's seed performance and analysis tools, farmers can see what worked and what didn't at the field level or by field zone, and apply those insights to better understand field variability by quickly and easily comparing digital field maps side-by-side. Farmers can save regions of their fields in a yield-by-region report and can also save and record a field region report through enhanced drawing and note taking tools, retrieving the report at a later date for easy analysis on any portion of their field to better understand how their crops are performing. Advanced Field Health Imagery - Through frequent and consistent, high-quality satellite imagery, farmers can instantly visualize and analyze crop performance, helping them identify issues early, prioritize scouting and take action early to protect yield. Climate's proprietary imagery process provides consistent imagery quality and frequency by using high-resolution imagery with vegetative data from multiple images, in addition to advanced cloud identification. Farmers can also drop geo-located scouting pins on field health images and navigate back to those spots for a closer look, or share with agronomic partners. Seeding and Fertility Scripting - Farmers can manage their inputs to optimize yield in every part of their field with manual variable rate seed and fertility scripting tools. Through Climate's manual seed scripting tools, farmers can easily create detailed planting plans for their fields to build a hybrid specific prescription tailored to their unique goals, saving time and improving productivity. Additionally, Climate offers a manual fertility scripting tool, enabling farmers the ability to optimize their inputs with a customized management plan for nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and lime tailored to their unique goals. 2018 Availability and Pricing The Climate FieldView platform is currently available for purchase in Western Canada on a per-acre basis so that farmers can begin using it on their farms in time for the 2018 growing season. To experience the complete value of the platform throughout the entire growing season, farmers should sign up for a Climate FieldView account by Jan. 1, 2018.

The public often criticizes the agricultural community for making morally questionable decisions. I am not agreeing with those people. I don't think growing Roundup Ready crop varieties is an unscrupulous decision. I don't think farmers are playing fast and loose with Canada's current tax laws. Ethics are an important part of farming. And if they aren't for you, they should be. There is a growing need in agriculture for farmers and the industries that serve them to reflect on the morals that underpin their actions. Progress begets progress. Innovation begets innovation. And in that flurry, we barely have time to stop and think about things like far-reaching consequences. The agriculture industry makes big moves at a quick pace. Life science companies regularly introduce new recipes promising to maximize crop yields and better feed a growing world. And agricultural technology companies are doing the same, using a similar line. Recently, Farmers Edge President Wade Barnes said the results of the company's partnership with Planet, a San Francisco-based company, is \"going to save agriculture.\" Planet plans to use its fleet of 190 Earth-imaging satellites to communicate with the Winnipeg-based company's precision agriculture technologies in order provide farmers with current and comprehensive data on the growing conditions on each of their fields, including the monitoring of insects and moisture conditions. \"With this technology, we're going to save crops,\" Barnes told media ahead of the October announcement. Many farmers have an insatiable appetite for new technologies. I am one of them, sort of. We're early adopters of patents that will eventually trickle down to the consumer market. And for many, to run a successful farm means adopting new practises and employing new innovations aimed at protecting or growing a profit margin that is always under threat. This, by and large, is not a terrible way of looking at things. But we farmers are susceptible to snake oil and we farmers can easily get ahead of ourselves, adopting technologies we have not fully thought through. What happens when my field is the first to get an infestation of a new-to-the-area insect? Will I be called out? Will the province be called out? Will I have an obligation to tell my neighbours? Where do concerns about my bottom line end and those of the common good begin? \"The new production-based models and metaphors are already so deeply rooted in our social and emotional fabric that it becomes almost sacrilege to question them,\" writes Ursula Franklin, a German-Canadian metallurgist and physicist, in The Real World of Technology. \"Thus one may question the value of people, but not the fundamental value of technology and their products.\" Technology allowing farmers to monitor every aspect of their farms has arrived. We can be precise about virtually everything bit of our operations. And it's getting more and more that way every year. As a new farmer and serial skeptic, I am both enamoured and suspicious. The moneyball technique worked for baseball, but if I were to pit the human against the numbers, I wouldn't be able to pick a winner without considering the fact that my family's farm, which has been a successful operation since the late 1800s, has stayed alive and profitable because of the decisions people have made. Harvest is complete on our farm and much of our crop has already been delivered to market. My parents have started fertilizing their land and I am about to do the same to mine. At the time of this writing, I am sitting in my home watching grain trucks buzz by my office. It's work I would normally do, and I will leave this desk to help once I can. But, I am busy with off-farm work and on-farm office tasks. I may be purchasing my first parcel of land, and I need to make some decisions regarding a field that had patchy growth this past season. So there are a few things going on right now. If ever I'd be prone to quick, reckless decision-making, it's now. If a salesperson were to come to my door with a seed or fertilizer or ag tech recommendation, provide some backup data and offer the product at a price that fits my budget, it would be easy to say yes without bouncing it off a few other minds and without considering the implications. And I'm guessing I'm not alone. Haste is rarely the correct approach. When it comes time to include my fields for monitoring - if, indeed, that is a choice I can make - I don't know what I'll say. Adopting this tech may be the right choice to make. Perhaps not. I don't know the implications of every technology. Some decisions are blind and that is okay. But, as busy as we farmers get, we need to think through the things we do. It will go a long way in rebuilding the trust of the public. Toban Dyck is a farmer and writer based in Manitoba.

To begin with, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization event now falls five days after another big day -- World Obesity Day, established by the World Obesity Foundation in 2015 to highlight the growing epidemic expected to threaten the health of one-third of the world's population by 2025. Meanwhile, farmers in this part of the world have risen to the \"feed the world\" challenge -- so much so that they are caught up in an inverse relationship between increased production and lower prices. University of Nebraska PhD student Michael Castle recently captured that conundrum in his thesis exploring whether \"precision agriculture\" -- high-tech but expensive equipment for precise application of fertilizer and chemicals -- is increasing profits on Nebraska farms. \"In addition to the increased demand from a rising world population, producers are also facing increased pressure for efficiency with the recent downturn in commodity prices and increases in production expense. With commodity prices near and below break-even levels, there is a great need for producers to decrease costs and thus lower their break-even,\" he writes in the introduction to his dissertation. So, if there is increasing world demand for food, why are prices at near and below break-even? Logic would suggest that rising demand should be coupled with increasing prices. Secondly, usual supply and demand pressures would suggest farmers should respond to lower prices by producing less. However in practice, farmers compensate for lower prices by trying to produce more. Disconnects like these explain why we are seeing some shifts in the messaging around food security in the 21st century. Increasingly, the FAO is stepping back from its traditional focus on producing more food to feed a hungry world to highlighting why people don't have enough of the right kinds of food to eat, and the need to focus on sustainable production systems. There is now much more focus on nutrition -- not just calories. Just four years ago, the UN agency was saying the world's farmers must increase production by 70 per cent to feed a population of 9.6 billion by 2050. Today it is saying production must increase 50 per cent to feed 10 billion by 2050. So the need for increased production is shrinking even though population projections are growing. There is also more emphasis on addressing the root causes of hunger -- which almost always come down to various combinations of poverty, environmental collapse and war. \"There is more than enough food produced in the world to feed everyone, yet 815 million people go hungry,\" says the 2017 State of World Food Security and Nutrition report. In fact, after a decade of declines, the number of undernourished people on the planet started to increase again in 2014, rising from 777 million to 815 million in 2016, mainly in regions hardest hit by military conflict and climate change. \"Food security is a complex condition requiring a holistic approach to all forms of malnutrition, the productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers, resilience of food production systems and the sustainable use of biodiversity and genetic resources,\" the FAO report says. However, that often gets lost in the rhetoric promoting production-enhancing technologies to farmers in the developed world, technologies that are of little use to farmers working with hoes. Catherine Bertini, formerly the executive director of the UN's World Food Program, put some context around the productivity challenges facing the world's farmers when she was in Winnipeg to address the Agricultural Bioscience International Conference last month. She said more focus is needed to focus on the productivity of smallholder farmers, many of whom are women. Their needs are deceptively simple: secure access to land, credit, processing and markets. \"We have to support the development of agriculture in poor countries so that people can help build their own economic base so they can become international customers,\" she said in an interview. It seems the best way to achieve global food security -- and to increase demand for what our farmers have to sell -- is to help other farmers grow.

One of the latest is a partnership between Winnipeg-based Farmers Edge and San Francisco-based Planet announced Wednesday, with the two planning to combine precision agriculture programs with what they say is the world's largest fleet of earth imaging satellites to better monitor the health of crops. Wade Barnes, president of Farmers Edge, and a farmer himself, said the technology is one of the most exciting developments in agriculture he's ever seen. \"We're actually going to save agriculture,\" he said. \"With this technology, we're going to save crops.\" The snapshots of the field, taken almost daily by Planet's current 190 earth imaging satellites, provide what they say is a clear and regularly updated picture of the growing conditions in the field, possibly alerting a farmer to something like a growing infestation of army worms eating at their wheat field. \"Suddenly now, I can look inside my fields, I can see a crop problem, and I can act on it, and remedy it,\" said Barnes. For the most part, he added, farmers have had to rely on consultants to physically drive through fields to check on early conditions; once crops start to grow, they've been limited to seeing what's going on from the road. Drones promised to bring an end to that problem, but Barnes said they're proving more difficult to operate than expected. \"Everyone thought drones would fix this problem of frequency, but the problem was drones are just too much work and just weren't logistically feasible.\" The challenges with drones are compounded by the increasing size of farms, said Andrew Pylypchuk, account lead for Farmers Edge at Planet, something he says satellites help address. \"Growers are able, at breakfast time, to have an overview on all their fields and decide where's the most efficient use of their time and resources and pick the fields that need the most help on that particular day.\" The collaboration between the two companies is by no means the first foray into satellite-imagery farming. For years, various government agencies and private satellites have allowed farmers to access a bird's-eye view of their field. Companies like Satshot and Gamaya have relied on this satellite data to provide their own detailed crop assessments to growers, with Gamaya and others also touting the benefits of drones for more detailed and targeted work. Planet's satellite images are generally supplied at a quality of three metres per pixel, which allows a view of colour patterns in the field, but not the precision that can be found on a Google map of major cities. The company has been able to launch many satellites because of their reliance on consumer technology, said Pylypchuk, making the satellites \"orders of magnitude\" cheaper than ones like the Landsat satellites launched by the U.S., and which makes the images available for free. Pylypchuk said the vast array of Planet satellites solve the problem of frequency for those who rely on government satellites, but space is getting increasingly crowded. Heather McNairn, a research scientist at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada who's research focuses on crop assessments from space, said the amount of data available is constantly increasing, with more satellites and more agencies sharing the information. \"We have a much more open data policy now in general with remote sensing satellites, so the data's more available, there's more open access.\" She said the federal government has been making strides in its own crop assessment programs, which focus on radar satellites that can see through clouds to assess soil moisture and even the amount of biomass in the field. Canada plans to launch three satellites with third-generation radar technology next year, which will further boost crop monitoring frequency to near daily as well, said McNairn. She said that the different types of satellites can be complementary, with the government also making use of Planet's satellites, and all are contributing to a better assessment of real-time ground conditions. Overall, she said she's excited by the advancements already made in satellites and what can be done with the data, as well as by the potential that still awaits."}, {"title": "Prep-Agriculture-Report", "article": "(Farm-Satellite-Tech) Winnipeg-based Farmers Edge and San Francisco-based Planet have announced a partnership in the latest venture that uses satellites to help farmers know what's going on in their fields.

(The Canadian Press) --- (Land-Auction) Some land in the untouched, remote corners of Saskatchewan are going up for sale. The Saskatchewan government is in the final stages of preparations for an online auction in which 48 parcels of Crown land will go to the highest bidder. Natural forests, natural prairie grasslands, and natural wetlands are some of the parcels that will be sold off. Environmentalists say they worry that the land might be converted by the new owners into ploughed fields, more profitable for the owners, but not suitable for natural wildlife to live in. (CTV Regina) --- (Corn-Grazing) More cattle producers are looking at grazing whole plant corn as a viable winter feeding option. Corn is a crop that grows up to three times the biomass of small grain cereals on less land. It also exceeds the nutrient requirements of a beef cow in her first and second trimester of pregnancy. Cattle can be selective when grazing corn, picking out the tastier parts of the plant like the cob, which has a lot of starch. Too much starch can result in rumen acidosis.

Planet is an integrated aerospace and data platform company that operates the world's largest fleet of earth imaging satellites, collecting the largest quantity of earth imagery. Farmers Edge is now a sole distributor for Planet in key agricultural regions, with the right to use and distribute high-resolution, high-frequency imagery from Planet's three flagship satellite constellations. Landmark deal delivers Planet's global daily imagery directly to Farmers Edge users. (Photo: Business Wire) Through this multimillion-dollar, multi-year global distribution agreement, Farmers Edge and Planet are significantly expanding their existing partnership. The companies will deliver the vanguard of remote sensing driven and analytics-based agronomy services to growers worldwide. Farmers Edge customers will be among the first to take advantage of field-centric, consistent, and accurate insights from satellite imagery. While traditional imagery products provide only a partial, delayed, or inconsistent view of fields, this partnership equips Farmers Edge growers with comprehensive, high-quality field imagery more frequently updated than any other company in the industry. \"Until now, the challenge with satellite imagery was the data was simply not frequent enough to react to crop stress in a timely manner,\" said Wade Barnes, President and CEO of Farmers Edge. \"At Farmers Edge, providing our customers with the most concise, comprehensive, and consistent data is at the core of what we do. We understand the need for more image frequency, that's why we are partnering with Planet. Daily imagery is a game-changer in the digital ag space.\" The combination of Planet's unprecedented data set and Farmers Edge state-of-the-art image processing technology allows for early crop monitoring and gives growers the best opportunity to correct factors that could limit crop performance and compromise yield potential. Growers will now have a wealth of field-centric data updated throughout the growing season, including early monitoring of crop stand, detection of pest and weed pressure, drainage issues, hail damage, herbicide injuries, nutrient deficiencies, yield prediction and more. \"Farmers Edge is consistently at the cutting edge of innovation in agricultural technology, and we're proud to expand our partnership with them as we work to improve profitability, sustainability, and efficiency for the world's producers,\" said Will Marshall, CEO of Planet. \"The challenges faced by the agriculture industry are complex in nature and global in scale, and we believe our data is uniquely positioned to solve agricultural challenges.\" \"Retailers, co-ops, equipment dealers, agronomists, and all other important advisors to the farmer can now partner with Farmers Edge and leverage this industry changing capability within their business,\" said Ron Osborne, Chief Strategy Officer of Farmers Edge. \"We're pleased to be able to help so many in our industry manage risks, in near real-time. This is great for our customers, our partners, and agriculture.\" In 2016, Planet awarded Farmers Edge its Agriculture Award, recognizing the company's pioneering work with ag-based analytics, Variable Rate Technology and field-centric data management. About Planet About Farmers Edge Contact: Farmers Edge Marina Barnes VP of Marketing"}, {"title": "Local firm gets Edge on rivals", "article": "Winnipeg precision agriculture company Farmers Edge is leveraging its intense deployment of agricultural data sets all the way to the heavens. The company has entered into a strategic partnership with Planet Labs, the San Francisco-based satellite company that operates the largest fleet of Earth-imaging satellites, to exclusively market Planet's imagery to agricultural users in 20 of the most agricultural intensive countries around the world, including the U.S. and Canada. \"This is a game-changer,\" said Farmers Edge founder and CEO Wade Barnes. \"This will really open doors where we have not yet been through.\" The four-year partnership links two companies that are at about the same size and stage of development. Farmers Edge already had a long-standing relationship with a company that Planet recently acquired. Planet's constellation of about 190 satellites takes new pictures of the entire globe every day with the kind of resolution that has never before been possible with such frequency and at such a low cost. Planet's shoebox-sized satellites use new technology to manufacture them at a fraction of the cost of previous satellites. The idea is that Farmers Edge will be able to integrate daily satellite images of farmers' fields into the suite of analytics like soil samples and weather data that it already provides. Farmers Edge has grown its customer base from 500,000 producing acres in 2014 to 18 million acres today, with significant coverage in Canada, the U.S., Brazil, Argentina and Australia. \"When we were looking at the partnership we looked at the landscape and we saw a lot of ourselves in Farmers Edge,\" said Andrew Pylypchuk, a Calgary-based Planet official who is focused on the ag sector. \"It's a young startup with about 500 employees (about the same number Planet has), very aggressive in the market, ahead of the game in their very unique way and really pushing the envelope.\" The partnership with Planet gives Farmers Edge a leg up on the competition, including established players like Monsanto and John Deere, who both have precision agriculture offerings in the market. Planet has been operating since 2010, but in the past year it has been aggressively entering the commercial markets and the agriculture sector is one where they have been getting the best traction and where subscription services, like Farmers Edge, have become more popular. Pylypchuk said he believes the market is ready for this type of imaging technology. \"I think this is the golden age for us and Farmers Edge to bring this to the market,\" he said. \"People have been dreaming of this for some time. All the pieces are finally fitting together.\" Planet is counting on Farmers Edge's to drive and develop the product in the agricultural markets around the world. \"By locking down this technology it gives us a real differentiator between some of the other big companies,\" Barnes said. \"I've been in this space for a long time and I've never seen anything that I believe will make this big of an impact.\" They recently demonstrated the product with one of the largest soy bean producers in the world in Brazil and they were able to show a problem with their planting in a field on the same day. \"Until now, the challenge with satellite imagery was the data was simply not frequent enough to react to crop stress in a timely manner,\" Barnes said. In a prepared statement, Planet CEO Will Marshall said, \"Farmers Edge is consistently at the cutting edge of innovation in agricultural technology, and we're proud to expand our partnership with them as we work to improve profitability, sustainability, and efficiency for the world's producers.\" martin.cash@freepress.mb.ca"}, {"title": "Action plan to bolster LumbyAC/EUR(tm)s economic growth", "article": "Vernon Morning Star -- Lumby council has ratified an eight-point action plan to position the village for economic growth.

Voss has joined forces with and is backed by private investors including Avrio Capital and Lamont Brown Group.

His father's response was that seeding depth isn't so much about inches, as it is about seeding into moisture, Webster told a handful of farmers gathered in a big top tent at Canada's Outdoor Farm Show this week. There was no button to push. Determining optimum planter depth typically meant physically digging into the dirt behind the planter to see whether the soil around the newly planted seeds was moist. The farmer set the seeding depth once, banking that it reflected the moisture conditions throughout the field. \"Guys,\" Webster said with a grin, \"We've got the button now that glows when you are planting into moisture.\" Precision agriculture has come a long ways from the early days in the 1990s when farmers first started buying harvesting equipment with yield monitors. Even before they could measure it, farmers knew some parts of their field yielded better than others. In rolling country, the hilltops are almost always lower-yielding than the low areas because of tillage and wind erosion. Yield monitors allowed them to track those fluctuations and using GPS, they could create a map of their field's productivity zones. Then they could investigate the reasons and take remedial action. The introduction of variable rate application technology has allowed them to adjust the rates of seed and fertilizer they apply to either limit their losses or maximize the potential. Webster, touted as one the leading precision agriculture gurus in North America, was in Ontario to spread the word about a concept in seeding that few farmers have even considered -- multi-genetics planting. Webster works for Precision Planting, a company that specializes in technology that helps farmers fine-tune their seeding efficiency. New products not only allow the farmer to vary the amount of seed and fertilizer as they move across the field, they also monitor depth, moisture and residue conditions. Now, farmers can even adjust the genetics of seed they are putting into the ground based on fluctuations in the soil conditions within the same field. The farmer can equip the planter with two types of seed, an \"offensive\" hybrid and a \"defensive\" one. The offensive -- or racehorse variety -- goes into the areas where yield potential is high and where potential stressors are limited. The defensive hybrid -- or workhorse -- has lower yield potential, but is hardier and better able to withstand the conditions that go with low organic matter, such as poor moisture holding capacity and low microbiological activity. The seeder is equipped with a device that flips back and forth between the two hybrids based on what the yield map of the field's productive zones identifies. The system is so accurate that some farmers have used it to incorporate designs into their field using different hybrids. But in order for the technology to work, the farmer must develop an accurate field zone map that can be fed into the computerized seeding prescription. In corn, Webster said payback from multi-hybrid planting is as high as $40 per acre. In soybeans, it could be as high as $100 per acre. Webster said while the technology currently targets corn and soybean growing areas, the same concepts would be coming soon to small grain crops such as wheat and canola. It's all part of a new wave of technological innovation in agriculture that integrates equipment and genetics with data management. Precision Planting was recently acquired by farm equipment manufacturer AGCO and ClimateCorp., a subsidiary of Monsanto. These tools are part of the Climate Corp's FieldView platform, a bid to drive data-driven decision-making on the farm. \"We're not just creating another digital ag product, we are actually creating a digital ecosystem that brings different sources of information together and helps look at that information all together as well,\" ClimateCorp's Denise Hockaday. Whether it lives up to the company's promise to \"transform the future of farming\" remains to be seen. But it's sure to have an impact. Laura Rance is editorial director for Glacier FarmMedia.

A few days later, Karuranga, who then lived in Canada, working as a professor of International Business at Laval University, among his other globetrotting academic duties, was invited to a Ministry of Agriculture workshop in Kigali to discuss where how Precision Agriculture could save the countrys agriculture and lift more people out of poverty. From there I was invited to the officers mess in Kimihurura to talk about the same. In all these gatherings I could observe both enthusiasm and skepticism, says the former Chairperson of the Rwandan Diaspora of Canada (2011 to 2015). So, I decided to come back to Rwanda and do it myself, in 2017, as nothing had emerged from my previous public talks. Karuranga returned home in 2016 and talked to potential partners. Kibungo Catholic Diocese, he says, was among the institutions that understood the concept of precision agriculture. We registered a joint venture at Rwanda Development Board and started our operations in 2017. Precision agriculture also referred to as satellite farming or site specific crop management [or site-specific agriculture] is a farming management concept based on observing, measuring and responding to inter and intra-field variability in crops. It is reported that this new approach to farm management was born with the introduction of GPS guidance for tractors in the early 1990s. It is one of many modern farming practices that make production more efficient. Literature indicates that with precision agriculture, farmers and soils work better. Growers are able to take large fields and manage them as though they are a group of small fields and in the process, reduce misapplication of products and increases crop and farm efficiency. Today, Karuranga who holds a PhD in Strategic Management is farming on 60 hectares in Ngoma District, Eastern province. A test was made during this dry season on 10 hectares with zero rainfall at the top of Zaza hill. We deployed climate resilient solutions using local inputs based on precision agriculture principles. Hopefully, he says, satellite farmers from the neighbouring Sake region will soon join the optimization platform. Karurangas initial motivation was a so much needed knowledge transfer from Diaspora. He put on hold his university career to help those who are lifting our people out of poverty. The goal of his novel project in Zaza, he explains, is to connect roofs of multiple buildings and harvest 5,000,000 liters of rain water, enough to water 160,000 plants and cope with any drought for four months. The idea is based, he said, on four courses he teaches at different universities. The courses are Business Intelligence, at Laval university in Canada; Optimization of Industrial Value Chains, at Tecnologico de Monterrey (Mexican equivalent of MIT but bigger with 33 campuses and more than 90,000 students). Others are Operations and Total Quality Management, in addition Strategic Modeling, which he teaches in the country, at the Adventist University of Central Africa (AUCA) in Kigali. In all these courses, the binding thread is: how do you take the best decision in different contexts manufacturing, building, agriculture, services, and others? In Mexico, my university has 180 hectares for applications in agriculture. We harvest as much as 600 tons of tomatoes per hectare, for example, in a controlled environment. In Zaza, the goal during this dry season is 250 tons per hectare in open field. Rwandans usually harvest from one to three tons, for the luckiest! Last week, an insurance company and local authorities visited his farm for a risk mitigation assessment. With the watering infrastructure, our total preventive maintenance policy for diseases, adequate mulching and organic fertilizers, he is hoping for a reasonable insurance cost. Support for climbing vegetables are elected to increase productivity and workers are laying thousands of pipes to channel rain water to artificial lakes once the rain season comes. Most importantly, the Zaza Precision Agriculture project is expected to fix the unacceptable soil erosion that regularly affects the area. Among others, on the top of the hill in Zaza, 50,000 tomatoes in a nursery are doing well. Sustain five-month drought Karuranga is unfazed if the artificial lakes dry up during the long dry spell, because the mathematical modeling of water harvest from roofs and water needs of the vegetables shows there is enough water to sustain a five-month drought. In the model we compute ground square meters of our buildings, rain fall, speed and direction of wind, slope and materials of the roofs, temperature and we include water needs for each and every plant at different stages of growth. Our algorithm takes care of seasonal variations whenever they occur. We tested the robustness and stability of our simulated solution on the ground using portable rain guns among other techniques. And, believe me, it works! Their vegetables are growing fast, he elaborates, simply because photosynthesis process by which plants use energy from sunlight to produce sugar is at its best in the dry season. In addition, he says, water flow to plants is regulated. Here, you have a perfect illustration of the system dynamics approach which lacks a lot in our classrooms: mixing different disciplines to forge sustainable solutions. In our case, mathematics, statistics, meteorology, architecture, biochemistry, software engineering, economics, crop production, fluid mechanics are mixed to produce what you will see when you come for a visit. I strongly believe that we can change the fate of agriculture using a system dynamics approach. Among his other duties ever since he returned home, Karuranga is now Board member at the Rwanda Initiative for Sustainable Development (RISD), a local non-governmental, non-profit organization which mainly focuses on policy action oriented research and advocacy, where he lends a hand in research and strategic development."}, {"title": "Press Release: Agrium to present at the Credit Suisse 30th Annual Basic Materials Conference", "article": "Agrium to present at the Credit Suisse 30th Annual Basic Materials Conference CALGARY, AB--(Marketwired - September 08, 2017) - Agrium Inc.

According to news reporting originating from Ottawa, Canada, by VerticalNews correspondents, research stated, \"High spatial resolution hyperspectral data often used in precision farming applications are not available from current satellite sensors, and difficult or expensive to acquire from standard aircraft. Alternatively, in precision farming, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are emerging as lower cost and more flexible means to acquire very high resolution imagery.\" Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from Carleton University, \"Miniaturized hyperspectral sensors have been developed for UAVs, but the sensors, associated hardware, and data processing software are still cost prohibitive for use by individual farmers or small remote sensing firms. This study simulated hyperspectral image data by fusing multispectral camera imagery and spectrometer data. We mounted a multispectral camera and spectrometer, both being low cost and low weight, on a standard UAV and developed procedures for their precise data alignment, followed by fusion of the spectrometer data with the image data to produce estimated spectra for all the multispectral camera image pixels. To align the data collected from the two sensors in both the time and space domains, a post-acquisition correlation-based global optimization method was used. Data fusion, to estimate hyperspectral reflectance, was implemented using several methods for comparison. Flight data from two crop sites, one being tomatoes, and the other corn and soybeans, were used to evaluate the alignment procedure and the data fusion results. The data alignment procedure resulted in a peak R-2 between the spectrometer and camera data of 0.95 and 0.72, respectively, for the two test sites. The corresponding multispectral camera data for these space and time offsets were taken as the best match to a given spectrometer reading, and used in modelling to estimate hyperspectral imagery from the multispectral camera pixel data. Of the fusion approaches evaluated, principal component analysis (PCA) based models and Bayesian imputation reached a similar accuracy, and outperformed simple spline interpolation. Mean absolute error (MAE) between predicted and observed spectra was 17% relative to the mean of the observed spectra, and root mean squared error (RMSE) was 0.028.\" According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"This approach to deriving estimated hyperspectral image data can be applied in a simple fashion at very low cost for crop assessment and monitoring within individual fields.\" The news editors report that additional information may be obtained by contacting C.Q.

EU authorities worry that the deal - which would create the world's largest seeds and pesticides company - could reduce competition and result in \"higher prices, lower quality, less choice and less innovation\". Bayer and Monsanto both submitted plans to address those concerns at the end of July, but the Commission said those commitments were \"insufficient to clearly dismiss its serious doubts as to the transaction's compatibility with the EU Merger Regulation\". Brussels will now launch an in-depth investigation into whether competitors will find it more difficult to access distributors and farmers once Bayer and Monsanto bundle together their pesticide and seeds businesses. Authorities said access was particularly worrying given the rise of \"digital agriculture\", which sees companies collect information about farms in order to deliver tailored advice or aggregated data to farmers - a business that both Bayer and Monstanto have been exploring. It comes amid a series of global deals that have effectively shrunk the agribusiness market, including ChemChina's 44 billion US dollar (PS34 billion) takeover of Syngenta and the 130 billion US dollar (PS101 billion) merger of Dow Chemicals and Du Pont. The EU's competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager said: \"Seeds and pesticide products are essential for farmers and ultimately consumers. \"We need to ensure effective competition so that farmers can have access to innovative products, better quality and also purchase products at competitive prices. \"And at the same time maintain an environment where companies can innovate and invest in improved products.\" It throws a spanner in the works for German pharma giant Bayer, which had been courting the US crops and seeds specialist for months before reaching a deal with Monsanto last September. Bayer said at the time that sales in the combined agriculture business would be worth as much as 23 billion euro (PS21 billion), based on 2015 figures, adding that its annual research and development budget could total 2.5 billion euro (PS2.2 billion). The EU Commission said it is now cooperating closely with antitrust watchdogs in other markets where Bayer and Monsanto operate, including the US, Australia, Brazil, Canada and South Africa, to conduct its probe.

That is the core rationale for ABIC (Agricultural Bioscience International Conference), whose 17th conference is being held at the RBC Convention Centre from Sept. 25 to 28. The four-day event will include speakers like Catherine Bertini, a former CEO of the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP); Rohit Shukla, an advocate in the venture capital arena of transforming ideas into enterprises that \"feed the world, fuel the world and heal the world\" and Carlos Saviani, vice-president of the World Wildlife Foundation. It's billed as the premier global meeting promoting innovation in bioscience. Industry leaders, policy-makers and researchers from around the world will gather to discuss the latest ideas and technologies in the global bioscience and technology sectors. The conferences take place under the auspicious of the Saskatoon-based ABIC Foundation. In the past five years conference have been in Calgary and Saskatoon; Melbourne, Australia; Rotorua, New Zealand and Fargo, N.D. Next year Beijing, China will host the event. Tracey Maconachie, president of the Life Science Association of Manitoba (LSAM) and a member of the conference organizing committee, said in addition to traditional agriscience technologies the Winnipeg event will try to incorporate ideas about how technologies like artificial intelligence are being deployed to enhance food security and food production. \"We wanted to expand the conversation a little,\" she said. \"There has been lots of time spent on talking about crops. We wanted to make sure we represented the animal side of food production as well as sustainability and where big data fits in... They are all things that will be part of the solution of trying to feed the world. We wanted to make sure we had a strong representation from those types of folks.\" Wade Barnes, CEO of Winnipeg precision farming company, Farmer's Edge, will be speaking as well as Wally Trenholm, CEO of Sightline Innovation, an outspoken advocate for more Canadian education and development in machine learning. Art Froehlich, a Calgary-based farmer and businessman, is vice-chair of the ABIC Foundation. He's attended all 16 of the conferences, and said registrations range from about 300 to more than 1,000 and each conference organizing committee designs programs most appropriate to their regions. The 2009 ABIC event in Bangkok was the first in Asia and attracted the largest number of attendees. \"Their focus was on aquaculture rice and fruits,\" he said. \"There have been two ABIC events in Calgary one that focused on the science and one on the business\" of promoting the application of agricultural biotechnology to solve global problems and find solutions that benefit everybody. Maconachie said that among the solutions that are contributing to increasing success in being able to feed the world include how people consume nutrition and making our food more nutritionally dense. \"There always has to be a balance between food production and environmental challenges,\" she said. \"When we get to 2050 (when experts believe global population will peak) we may be able to feed the world but what are the environmental challenges that we may face or what will be the impact on that much crop or animal production on the environment\" Those are the kind of issues that ABIC events seek to address. martin.cash@freepress.mb.ca"}, {"title": "Agriculture industry needs a climate plan", "article": "It's been a great summer for beach-goers and there is no end in sight to the hot, dry weather. It hasn't been quite as nice for farmers watching their crops wither and ripen prematurely. The scorching heat and shortage of rain will make collecting this year's crop easier, as there's a lot less out there to harvest. But it's also less rewarding. Farmers further west are baling cereal crops to use for livestock feed. Drought has decimated northern U.S. crops. In Europe, a heat wave nicknamed Lucifer is keeping people indoors. All of the above pales in comparison to the deepening drought-induced hunger crisis affecting people living in East African countries. Crops have failed, livestock are dying and people, most of whom are farmers, have lost their ability to feed themselves. Climate watchers say this could be the new normal as global temperatures continue to rise. The American Meteorological Society reported last week that 2016 was the warmest year on record, topping the previous record-setter -- 2015. \"For any given month during 2016, 12 per cent or more of global land was experiencing at least severe drought conditions, the longest such stretch in the record,\" the report said. This year is on track to be equal or beat 2016's heat. While many still debate whether global warming is caused by humans, it's getting harder to deny that it's occurring. Another recently released study, this one in the journal Nature, pointed out that it's taking longer for regions affected by drought to fully recover. Yet the time in between droughts is getting shorter. It's an inverse correlation with potentially disastrous effects. The researchers said that drought on top of drought eventually pushes an ecosystem to a \"tipping point\" that affects plants' ability to return to normal function. Markets have been volatile this summer, but huge crops coming off in the Black Sea region are keeping a lid on global cereal markets for now. The long-term outlook is less sanguine. It's well reported the demand for food crops will continue to rise as the world's population continues to grow. Plus, growing incomes in developing countries is allowing for a more diversified diet. So it's a little unnerving to read through the recently released Agricultural Institute of Canada (AIC) report documenting the widening gaps in Canada's agricultural research and innovation process, arguably our best hope of preparing farmers to meet growing global demand in an uncertain production climate. The report notes that total government support for agriculture has dropped over the past decade, and most of what is offered goes into direct farm supports rather than investing in new options for the future. Research investment by governments has been declining over the past three decades despite the fact that every dollar invested results in between $10 and $20 returned by way of productivity gains. Private sector investment is waning as well, \"due to low short-term returns on investment or insufficient incentives,\" the report said. It's not just a declining commitment to research that's limiting the sector's growth. Adoption of new technologies, such as precision agriculture, has been slow due to a lack analytical support and poor rural broadband services. Plus, there is a shortage of human capital, which is affecting research and extension capacity as well as on-farm production, the AIC says. The AIC report says the lack of research investment will impede Canada's ability to take full advantage of growing global markets. Canada is currently the world's fifth-largest exporter, but some are predicting it could grow to being the second-largest. However, it also reflects poorly on this country's food system to respond to changing environment conditions. Despite efforts to attract greater investment from the private sector, public sector investment is still the greatest source of funding for agricultural research and development in Canada. Governments must realize that building soil and water quality will be key to the sector's resilience in a changing climate. Neither is likely to attract private investment. Taxpayers need to invest in agricultural research and development for the long haul. The sooner governments step up, the better. Laura Rance is editorial director for Farm Business Communications.

Complete corrected text follows. Agrium Reports Robust 2nd Quarter Results; Delivers Record Retail 1st Half Earnings ALL AMOUNTS ARE STATED IN U.S.$ Agrium Inc. (TSX: AGU) (NYSE: AGU) announced today its 2017 second quarter results, with net earnings to equity holders of Agrium of $557-million ($4.03 diluted earnings per share) compared to net earnings to equity holders of $564-million ($4.08 diluted earnings per share) in the second quarter of 2016. The slight reduction in net earnings was driven by weaker nitrogen and phosphate benchmark prices, which were partially offset by higher Retail earnings, strong potash results and lower fixed costs across our Wholesale business. Highlights: 2017 second quarter guidance relevant earnings were $566-million or $4.09 diluted earnings per share1. Our Retail business achieved a first half EBITDA2 record of $821-million supported by strong margins, with EBITDA to sales of 10.3 percent, compared to 9.8 percent last year and the highest since 2008. Wholesale grew its second quarter sales volumes and reduced costs across our operations to achieve EBITDA similar to last year, despite a 7 percent decline in North American nitrogen prices this quarter. Record first half potash production achieved with successful post expansion ramp-up. Our new urea facility at Borger, Texas was successfully commissioned and reached designed operating rates in the second quarter. Agrium has updated our 2017 annual guidance to a range of $4.75 to $5.25 diluted earnings per share. 'Agrium continued to deliver robust results this quarter due to our integrated business model and focus on operational improvements and execution. Retail set a first half earnings record with the highest EBITDA to sales in almost a decade while Wholesale delivered strong operational results, which together allowed us to generate $1.2-billion of EBITDA in the first half of 2017,' commented Chuck Magro, Agrium's President and CEO. 'We look forward to the completion of our merger with PotashCorp which is anticipated near the end of the third quarter of this year and continue to make significant progress on integration preparations,' added Mr. Magro. Effective tax rate of 28.5 percent for the second quarter of 2017 was used for the adjusted net earnings, guidance relevant earnings and per share calculations. These are non-IFRS measures which represent net earnings (loss) adjusted for certain income (expenses) that are considered to be non-operational in nature. We believe these measures provide meaningful comparison to our guidance by eliminating share-based payments expense (recovery), gains (losses) on foreign exchange and related gains (losses) on non-qualifying derivative hedges and significant non-operating, non-recurring items. Our guidance is forward-looking information. We present guidance relevant earnings (loss) per share to provide an update to this previously disclosed forward-looking information. These should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS and may not be directly comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.

Refer to section 'Non-IFRS Financial Measures' in the Management's Discussion and Analysis. MARKET OUTLOOK Agriculture and Crop Input Outlook 2017 started with excellent growing conditions in Brazil, which produced record yields and depressed international crop prices. However, wet weather across North America impacted crop input applications this spring, and since then dry conditions across much of North America and in Australia have lowered crop yield potential and lent support to crop prices. U.S. corn and soybean condition ratings are the lowest since the 2012 drought, which has led some analysts to reduce yield forecasts. Furthermore, global wheat prices have risen due to the reduction in wheat acreage and dry conditions in the U.S. and drought in parts of Australia. Higher wheat prices are expected to result in increased winter wheat planting in the fall of 2017 and are expected to support crop input demand for wheat, which has been pressured by the acreage loss over the past two years. The current United States Department of Agriculture ('USDA') forecast of global grain yields for 2017/18 is near trend-levels, which would be a reduction from the record yields of 2016/17. Based on industry yield estimates, there is likely more downside to the current 2017/18 projections. There are indications that pest pressure may be elevated this growing season in parts of the U.S., while in the Western U.S. the season has been delayed. These factors are expected to support demand for crop protection products in the third quarter. However, in regions where dry weather persists, there may be some impact on demand for fungicides. Nitrogen Outlook Global nitrogen capacity additions, and lower than expected demand in China and India so far this year, have weighed on global nitrogen markets. However, nitrogen supplies have been impacted by continued low operating rates in China. The year-over-year reduction in production in these two countries has more than offset increased production in the U.S. and other countries this year. Indian urea demand started 2017 relatively weak. However, the strong start to the monsoon season and the decision by the Indian government to apply a 5 percent sales tax on fertilizer, rather than the 12 percent implemented on the sale of most goods, should lend support to domestic demand in the second half of the year. North American urea prices were the lowest benchmark in the world throughout the second quarter. This led to a significant reduction in imports and even led to some exports offshore. This in turn has tightened the North American nitrogen inventory levels which should support a strong summer fill season. A normal fall application season, weather permitting, would be a significant improvement over last year across much of the Corn Belt and Western Canada. Nitrogen prices are expected to continue to be cost-driven in the second half of 2017. Costs for most marginal nitrogen production are flat to higher than year-ago levels, which should limit any downside in prices from current levels. Potash Outlook The global potash supply and demand balance was tight throughout the first half of 2017. Despite high producer shipments this year, we believe there has been little build-up in downstream inventories, which is expected to support the continued strong demand in the second half of the year. Year-over-year, potash imports increased by 15 percent in Brazil, 95 percent in India and 17 percent in China in the first half of 2017, adding 2.7 million tonnes of trade in total. In the U.S., offshore imports were more than double the same period last year. There has been limited growth in global potash supply so far in 2017, outside of increased production by existing Saskatchewan producers. The additional supply in the second half of the year is expected to be relatively small. Phosphate Outlook Global phosphate prices have been pressured from increased availability from Morocco, China and Russia in 2017, which more than offset increased import demand in Brazil, the U.S. and Pakistan. Furthermore, capacity additions in Morocco and Saudi Arabia are expected to add to global supplies in the second half of the year. Global demand in the third quarter is expected to be strong, due to a seasonal increase in the pace of imports into India and Brazil, the key diammonium phosphate (DAP) and monoammonium phosphate import destinations, respectively. Declining raw material prices have also weighed on finished phosphate prices, particularly the price of ammonia, which has traded as much as 45 percent below April 2017 levels in recent weeks. 2017 ANNUAL GUIDANCE Based on our assumptions set out under the heading 'Market Outlook', Agrium expects to achieve annual diluted earnings per share of $4.75 to $5.25 in 2017 compared to our previous estimate of $4.75 to $5.75 per share. We have lowered the upper end of our annual guidance range due to an expected weak nitrogen pricing environment and the challenging weather conditions this spring which impacted North American Retail crop nutrient margins and sales volumes. We have also narrowed the range width encompassing approximately $100-million of EBITDA variability. Second half earnings for 2017 are expected to have a similar quarterly earnings profile to 2016. We have updated our Retail EBITDA range from $1.150-billion to $1.20-billion compared to our previous guidance of $1.125-billion to $1.250-billion. Based on our expected utilization rate for our nitrogen assets, we are updating our nitrogen production range to between 3.5 and 3.6 million tonnes. Our earnings per share guidance assumes NYMEX gas prices will average between $3.00 and $3.30 per MMBtu for 2017. Agrium's potash production in 2017 is now expected to range between 2.5 and 2.7 million tonnes. Total capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $650-million to $700-million, of which approximately $450-million to $500-million is expected to be sustaining capital expenditures. Agrium's annual effective tax rate for 2017 is expected to range between 27 and 29 percent. Guidance excludes the impact of share-based payments expense (recovery), gains (losses) on foreign exchange and non-qualifying derivative hedges, and merger related costs. Volumetric and earnings estimates assume normal seasonal growing and harvest patterns in the geographies where Agrium operates.

The Audit Committee reviews and, prior to publication, approves this disclosure, pursuant to the authority delegated to it by the Board of Directors. No update is provided to the disclosure in our annual MD&A except for material information since the date of our annual MD&A. In respect of Forward-Looking Statements, please refer to the section titled 'Forward-Looking Statements' in this MD&A. Retail's sales primarily decreased in the second quarter and first half of 2017 due to lower crop nutrient prices. Despite this, Retail's gross profit increased as a result of higher sales volumes in the quarter and increased sales of proprietary products, which have higher margins. Except for higher selling prices for potash, we realized lower selling prices for all Wholesale product lines resulting in lower sales and gross profit in the second quarter and first half of 2017. This was partially offset by higher nitrogen and potash sales volumes and lower cost of product sold for potash. Expenses Selling expense was consistent for the second quarter compared to the same period last year. For the first half of 2017, selling expenses increased by $38-million as a result of the recent Retail acquisitions but remained consistent as a percentage of sales. We had lower share-based payments expense of approximately $15-million in the second quarter and first half of 2017 due to decreases in our share price. Earnings from associates and joint ventures decreased by $18-million in the second quarter primarily due to a reversal of gas provision in Profertil S.A. ('Profertil') in the prior year. In the first quarter of 2017, we recognized a foreign exchange gain in Misr Fertilizers Production Company S.A.E. ('MOPCO') from the devaluation of the Egyptian pound. In combination, these two factors resulted in consistent year-over-year results. Other expenses decreased by approximately $10-million for the second quarter and first half of 2017. In 2016, we incurred losses from the termination of a distribution agreement and cancellation of a Canpotex terminal. There were no similar losses in 2017. We incurred merger and related costs of $15-million in the second quarter and $31-million for first half of 2017. Depreciation and amortization expense increased in the second quarter and first half of 2017 primarily due to the expansion at our Borger nitrogen facility and increased depreciation at the Conda phosphate mine. Effective Tax Rate The effective tax rate of 28.5 percent for each of the second quarter and first half of 2017 was higher than the tax rate of 27.5 percent for each of the same periods in 2016 due to a decrease in certain U.S. manufacturing tax deductions. BUSINESS SEGMENT PERFORMANCE Retail Retail reported a record first half EBITDA, and the second highest ever second quarter EBITDA. EBITDA to sales increased to 10.3 percent for the first half of 2017 compared to 9.8 percent for the same period last year. These results were in part driven by strong performance from our higher margin proprietary product lines. Total proprietary product sales as a percentage of total product line sales grew to 19 percent this quarter compared to 17 percent in the same period last year. Retail selling, general and administrative expenses were up slightly over last year due to acquisitions made over the prior year. Retail North America EBITDA increased in the second quarter despite the impact from challenging weather conditions this spring, with excess moisture impacting the application season in many areas, and drought conditions in the U.S. southern plains. On a regional basis, EBITDA in the U.S. this quarter was up 4 percent over the same period last year, while Canadian results were slightly lower. EBITDA for our Retail International operations also increased for the current quarter, as Australia continued to deliver strong performance with EBITDA up 27 percent over last year, despite dry conditions across most of Australia this year. South American results were down slightly primarily due to lower crop protection product margins. Crop nutrients Total crop nutrient sales decreased by 9 percent compared to the prior year, due to the decline in nitrogen and phosphate prices this quarter. Nutrient sales volumes were up 3 percent in North America this quarter due to the acquisitions made over the past year, as well as a catch up in sales volumes that had been delayed from the first quarter. International volumes were lower primarily due to dry weather conditions in Australia. Total nutrient gross profit declined by 3 percent due to lower fertilizer margins this year. North American crop nutrient margins on a per tonne basis were down 7 percent this quarter due to localized pricing pressure in key U.S. growing regions this spring, partly associated with adverse weather conditions during the application and seeding season. Crop protection products Total crop protection sales were similar to last year's level. Sales were impacted by the delays in applications as growers were more focused on completing seeding than on applying crop protection products this quarter. The reduction in U.S. wheat acreage, combined with the late spring snowfall, followed by drought conditions in the southern U.S. wheat crop, negatively impacted crop protection product applications this quarter. Gross profit was 3 percent higher than the prior period due to higher proprietary product line sales and strong margins. Gross margin as a percentage of sales increased by 1 percent, due to new products and strong demand for our Loveland proprietary product line. Seed Total seed sales increased significantly-up 17 percent compared to the second quarter of 2016. After normalizing for program changes on technology fees and agency revenues, the increase in sales was approximately 10 percent. The improvement was due to increased wholesale seed sales, higher volumes and the increase in soybean acres in the U.S., which tends to favor Agrium's proprietary seed sales. Merchandise Merchandise sales increased 8 percent, due to strong general merchandise sales in Australia. Services and other Sales for services and other decreased due to lower livestock export shipments in Australia compared to the same period last year. Wholesale gross profit this quarter was marginally lower than the same period last year due to lower global prices for nitrogen and phosphate products and higher reported depreciation related to the recent expansion at our Borger nitrogen facility and higher depreciation at the Conda phosphate mine. This was partially offset by overall cost reductions, as well as stronger results from our potash operations, which benefited from higher selling prices, higher sales volumes and lower cost of product sold per tonne. EBITDA in the current quarter was similar to 2016. Nitrogen Nitrogen gross profit was down 24 percent compared to the same period last year due to lower North American nitrogen prices and higher average natural gas input costs. Average realized selling prices for urea and ammonia were down 7 percent compared to the same period last year. Total sales volumes were up 1 percent over the same period last year, despite wet conditions across Western Canada and portions of the U.S. during the quarter. Sales volumes for ammonia and other nitrogen products were higher than last year, while urea sales volumes declined slightly due to strong first quarter 2017 demand in Western Canada. Cost of product sold per tonne increased slightly compared to the same period last year due to higher natural gas input costs, which were partly offset by overall lower fixed costs. In the second quarter of 2017, we successfully commissioned and have achieved designed operating rates of the new urea facility at our Borger nitrogen operations. The new facility has a 610,000 tonne urea production capacity, including 100,000 tonne urea equivalent of Diesel Exhaust Fluid. Further, commissioning of both rail and truck load out systems was completed this quarter, including shipment of multiple unit trains. Potash Potash gross profit almost tripled compared to the same period last year, due to a combination of higher selling prices and higher production and sales volumes. Sales volumes were 2 percent higher in the current period, with international volumes up 31 percent on strong global demand. The strong demand from international markets this quarter led to lower product availability for domestic markets, resulting in domestic volumes being 14 percent lower than the same period last year. Average realized selling prices increased 8 percent over the past year with realized North American prices up 16 percent on strong demand and tighter inventories. Our cost of product sold per tonne was 13 percent lower than the same period last year due to higher production and sales volumes, reducing fixed costs on a per tonne basis, and a higher proportion of sales to Canpotex, which do not incur freight charges. Gross margins were up $39 per tonne or almost 3 times higher than last year's levels, while cash margins came in at $106 per tonne this quarter. Phosphate Phosphate gross profit was slightly higher than the same period last year due to lower input costs. This was partially offset by lower realized phosphate prices and a reduction in total sales volumes. Sales volumes were down 9 percent compared to the same period last year. This is mostly due to lower opening inventory levels this quarter resulting from strong demand pull in the first quarter of 2017. Overall gross margin per tonne this quarter improved by $10 compared to 2016. This was related to a 9 percent decline in cost of product sold per tonne due to lower input costs and fixed cost improvements. Wholesale Other Gross profit from Wholesale Other was lower than the same period last year driven by a combination of lower realized selling prices and slightly higher input costs for ESN. Expenses Wholesale expenses remained flat in the second quarter compared to last year as lower earnings from associates and joint ventures were offset by lower expenses. Lower earnings from associates and joint ventures were due to a reversal in 2016 of a gas provision in Profertil, while lower expenses were due to cost savings initiatives and one-time expenses, which include the losses from the termination of a distribution agreement and cancellation of a Canpotex terminal, incurred in 2016. Other EBITDA for our Other non-operating business unit for the second quarter of 2017 was a net expense of $14-million, compared to a net expense of $5-million for the second quarter of 2016. The variance was primarily due to: Lower gross profit recovery of $13-million as a result of a lower decrease in intersegment inventories held by Retail at the end of second quarter. Merger and related costs of $15-million. This is partially offset by a lower share-based payments expense of approximately $15-million primarily due to a decrease in Agrium's share price. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Agrium generally expects that it will be able to meet its working capital requirements, capital resource needs and shareholder returns through a variety of sources, including available cash on hand, cash provided by operations, short-term borrowings from the issuance of commercial paper, and borrowings from our credit facilities, as well as long-term debt and equity capacity from the capital markets. As of June 30, 2017, we have sufficient current assets to meet our current liabilities. Our total capital expenditures decreased in the second quarter and first half of 2017 compared to the same period last year as we completed the construction of our Borger expansion project at the end of 2016. In 2017, pre-commissioning and commissioning costs were incurred related to this project. We expect Agrium's capital expenditures for the remainder of 2017 to approximate $350-million to $400-million. We anticipate that we will be able to finance the announced projects through a combination of cash provided from operating activities and existing credit facilities. Short-term Debt Our short-term debt of $1.2-billion at June 30, 2017 is outlined in note 5 of our Summarized Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Our short-term debt increased by $623-million during the first half of 2017, which in turn contributed to a decrease in our unutilized short-term financing capacity to $2.2-billion at June 30, 2017. Capital Management Our revolving credit facilities require that we maintain specific interest coverage and debt-to-capital ratios, as well as other non-financial covenants as defined in our credit agreements. We were in compliance with all covenants at June 30, 2017. Our ability to comply with these covenants has not changed since December 31, 2016. OUTSTANDING SHARE DATA Agrium had 138,177,162 outstanding shares at August 4, 2017. At August 4, 2017, the number of shares issuable pursuant to stock options outstanding (issuable assuming full conversion, where each option granted can be exercised for one common share) was approximately 1,380,868. The agricultural products business is seasonal. Consequently, year-over-year comparisons are more appropriate than quarter-over-quarter comparisons. Crop input sales are primarily concentrated in the spring and fall crop input application seasons. Crop nutrient inventories are normally accumulated leading up to each application season. Our cash collections from accounts receivables generally occur after the application season is complete, and our customer prepayments are concentrated in December and January.

With about 25 farms to manage, he's signed up with a service that plants weather stations throughout his properties to tell him whether the wind is calm enough to spray his fields or if it's dry enough to till the earth. \"It's more high-tech than ever. We have weather stations on our farms, they're telling us wind speed, wind direction, temperatures high and low, rainfall amounts on almost every one of our farms.\" Farmers like Foster are on a never-ending quest for more detailed weather forecasts as they try to increase yields on larger plots while contending with more extreme weather, such as the record rains that have drenched parts of southern Ontario this year, or the droughts that have left vast fields bone dry in Saskatchewan. Foster installed the weather station system at the encouragement of seed companies, since knowing exactly how much rain has fallen allows him to buy specific seeds, depending on conditions. That kind of data could prove especially useful this year, with some of Foster's farms soaked with triple the rainfall compared with last year. In Saskatchewan, Todd Lewis is dealing with the opposite problem. The area south of Regina where he farms has experienced some of the driest months on record. Lewis uses a service that sets up personalized weather stations to better manage the grains and pulses on his family farm.

All currency amounts are expressed in U.S. dollars. Second quarter 2017 financial summary versus second quarter 2016: - Revenue was up 12 per cent to $13.3-million; - Gross margin increased 110 basis points to 41.3 per cent; - Operating loss improved to $500,000, compared with a loss of $1.3-million; - Net loss improved to $500,000 or nil per share, compared with a loss of $1.2-million or one cent per share; - Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) improved to negative $0.0-million, from negative $700,000. Management commentary \"Our second quarter marked the return to organic revenue growth on the back of strong sales to our large OEM customers in France and Germany,\" said Dave Vaughn, president and chief executive officer of AgJunction. \"While we remain cautious about the near-term industry growth dynamics, we are ahead of our plan for the year and continue to effectively manage working capital and increase free cash flow. We grew cash on a consecutive quarter basis by approximately $3-million, while investing $1.8-million to repurchase our own stock (22.5 U.S. cents per share; 29.7 Canadian cents, representing a 50-per-cent discount to the closing price of 60 Canadian cents on the date of the transaction). Given our overall business outlook, we are confident this will prove to be an accretive use of our company's capital. \"Looking to the remainder of 2017, we believe the steps we have taken to strategically invest in intellectual property, innovate our product portfolio and improve our balance sheet has positioned AgJunction for further growth as our markets strengthen.\" Second quarter 2017 financial results Total sales in the second quarter of 2017 increased 12 per cent to $13.3-million, compared with $11.9-million in the second quarter of 2016. This was driven by 51-per-cent sales growth in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region due to strong OEM (original equipment manufacturer) business. Gross profit in the second quarter of 2017 increased 15 per cent to $5.5-million, compared with $4.8-million in the second quarter of 2016. Gross margin increased 110 basis points to 41.3 per cent, compared with 40.2 per cent in the second quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily due to the absorption of production overhead by the higher sales volumes. Total operating expenses declined to $6.0-million, compared with $6.1-million in the second quarter of 2016. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses were 45.3 per cent, compared with 50.9 per cent in the second quarter of 2016. Net loss in the second quarter was $500,000 or nil per share, compared with a net loss of $1.2-million or one cent per share in the second quarter of 2016. EBITDA in the second quarter of 2017 improved to negative $0.0-million, compared with $700,000 in the second quarter of 2016. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the second quarter of 2017 totalled $18.8-million, compared with $12.9-million at the end of 2016. Working capital was $24.8-million, up from $22.4-million at the end of 2016. The company continues to carry no debt and has access to its full $3.0-million line of credit.

Non-IFRS (international financial reporting standards) measures This press release uses adjusted EBITDA, which is a financial measure that does not have any standardized meaning prescribed under international financial reporting standards. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income before interest, income tax, depreciation and amortization.

As this measure does not have a standard meaning prescribed by IFRS, it may not be comparable with similarly titled measures presented by other publicly traded companies, and should not be construed as an alternative to other financial measures determined in accordance with IFRS. This non-IFRS measure is provided as additional information to complement IFRS measures by providing further understanding of operations from management's perspective. Accordingly, non-IFRS measures should never be considered in isolation nor as a substitute to using net income as a measure of profitability or as an alternative to the IFRS consolidated statements of income or other IFRS statements.

Complete corrected text follows. Agrium Reports Robust 2nd Quarter Results; Delivers Record Retail 1st Half Earnings CALGARY, AB--(Marketwired - August 9, 2017) - ALL AMOUNTS ARE STATED IN U.S.$ Agrium Inc. (TSX: AGU) (NYSE: AGU) announced today its 2017 second quarter results, with net earnings to equity holders of Agrium of $557-million ($4.03 diluted earnings per share) compared to net earnings to equity holders of $564-million ($4.08 diluted earnings per share) in the second quarter of 2016. The slight reduction in net earnings was driven by weaker nitrogen and phosphate benchmark prices, which were partially offset by higher Retail earnings, strong potash results and lower fixed costs across our Wholesale business. Highlights:  \"Agrium continued to deliver robust results this quarter due to our integrated business model and focus on operational improvements and execution. Retail set a first half earnings record with the highest EBITDA to sales in almost a decade while Wholesale delivered strong operational results, which together allowed us to generate $1.2-billion of EBITDA in the first half of 2017,\" commented Chuck Magro, Agrium's President and CEO. \"We look forward to the completion of our merger with PotashCorp which is anticipated near the end of the third quarter of this year and continue to make significant progress on integration preparations,\" added Mr. Magro. (1) Effective tax rate of 28.5 percent for the second quarter of 2017 was used for the adjusted net earnings, guidance relevant earnings and per share calculations. These are non-IFRS measures which represent net earnings (loss) adjusted for certain income (expenses) that are considered to be non-operational in nature. We believe these measures provide meaningful comparison to our guidance by eliminating share-based payments expense (recovery), gains (losses) on foreign exchange and related gains (losses) on non-qualifying derivative hedges and significant non-operating, non-recurring items. Our guidance is forward-looking information. We present guidance relevant earnings (loss) per share to provide an update to this previously disclosed forward-looking information. These should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS and may not be directly comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. (2) Earnings (loss) from continuing operations before finance costs, income taxes, depreciation and amortization and net earnings (loss) from discontinued operations. This is a non-IFRS measure. Refer to section \"Non-IFRS Financial Measures\" in the Management's Discussion and Analysis. ADJUSTED NET EARNINGS AND GUIDANCE RELEVANT EARNINGS RECONCILIATIONS  MARKET OUTLOOK Agriculture and Crop Input Outlook  Nitrogen Outlook  10 Aug 2017 18:49 ET Press Release: CORRECTION - Agrium Reports Robust -2- Potash Outlook  Phosphate Outlook  2017 ANNUAL GUIDANCE Based on our assumptions set out under the heading \"Market Outlook\", Agrium expects to achieve annual diluted earnings per share of $4.75 to $5.25 in 2017 compared to our previous estimate of $4.75 to $5.75 per share. We have lowered the upper end of our annual guidance range due to an expected weak nitrogen pricing environment and the challenging weather conditions this spring which impacted North American Retail crop nutrient margins and sales volumes. We have also narrowed the range width encompassing approximately $100-million of EBITDA variability. Second half earnings for 2017 are expected to have a similar quarterly earnings profile to 2016. We have updated our Retail EBITDA range from $1.150-billion to $1.20-billion compared to our previous guidance of $1.125-billion to $1.250-billion. Based on our expected utilization rate for our nitrogen assets, we are updating our nitrogen production range to between 3.5 and 3.6 million tonnes. Our earnings per share guidance assumes NYMEX gas prices will average between $3.00 and $3.30 per MMBtu for 2017. Agrium's potash production in 2017 is now expected to range between 2.5 and 2.7 million tonnes. Total capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $650-million to $700-million, of which approximately $450-million to $500-million is expected to be sustaining capital expenditures. Agrium's annual effective tax rate for 2017 is expected to range between 27 and 29 percent. This guidance and updated additional measures and related assumptions are summarized in the table below. Guidance excludes the impact of share-based payments expense (recovery), gains (losses) on foreign exchange and non-qualifying derivative hedges, and merger related costs. Volumetric and earnings estimates assume normal seasonal growing and harvest patterns in the geographies where Agrium operates. 2017 ANNUAL GUIDANCE RANGE AND ASSUMPTIONS  August 9, 2017 Unless otherwise noted, all financial information in this Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is prepared using accounting policies in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and is presented in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 - Interim Financial Reporting.

The variance was primarily due to:  FINANCIAL CONDITION The following are changes to working capital on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Agrium generally expects that it will be able to meet its working capital requirements, capital resource needs and shareholder returns through a variety of sources, including available cash on hand, cash provided by operations, short-term borrowings from the issuance of commercial paper, and borrowings from our credit facilities, as well as long-term debt and equity capacity from the capital markets. As of June 30, 2017, we have sufficient current assets to meet our current liabilities. Summary of Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows 10 Aug 2017 18:49 ET Press Release: CORRECTION - Agrium Reports Robust -6- Below is a summary of our cash provided by or used in operating, investing and financing activities as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:  Short-term Debt  Capital Management  OUTSTANDING SHARE DATA Agrium had 138,177,162 outstanding shares at August 4, 2017. At August 4, 2017, the number of shares issuable pursuant to stock options outstanding (issuable assuming full conversion, where each option granted can be exercised for one common share) was approximately 1,380,868.  The agricultural products business is seasonal. Consequently, year-over-year comparisons are more appropriate than quarter-over-quarter comparisons. Crop input sales are primarily concentrated in the spring and fall crop input application seasons. Crop nutrient inventories are normally accumulated leading up to each application season. Our cash collections from accounts receivables generally occur after the application season is complete, and our customer prepayments are concentrated in December and January.

(\"PotashCorp\") Agrium and PotashCorp entered into an agreement dated September 11, 2016 (the \"Arrangement Agreement\"), under which the companies will combine in a merger of equals into a newly incorporated parent entity, which will be named Nutrien, to be formed to manage and hold the combined businesses of both Agrium and PotashCorp. The Arrangement Agreement will be implemented by a proposed plan of arrangement (the \"Arrangement\"). Under the Arrangement, Agrium shareholders will receive 2.23 Nutrien shares for each Agrium share held, and PotashCorp shareholders will receive 0.40 of a Nutrien share for each PotashCorp share held. Following the completion of the Arrangement Agreement, Agrium and PotashCorp will become wholly-owned subsidiaries of Nutrien and Nutrien will continue the operations of Agrium and PotashCorp on a combined basis. Each of the share-based payment awards for each of Agrium and PotashCorp, whether vested or unvested, that are outstanding immediately prior to the completion of the Arrangement will convert into a Nutrien award. On November 3, 2016, shareholders of both Agrium and PotashCorp approved the Arrangement. The Arrangement is anticipated to be completed near the end of the third quarter of 2017, subject to customary closing conditions including receipt of regulatory and court approvals. The estimated costs to be incurred by Agrium and PotashCorp with respect to the Arrangement and related matters are expected to aggregate approximately $140-million. The Arrangement Agreement contains provisions that restrict Agrium's and PotashCorp's ability to pursue alternatives to the Arrangement and, in specified circumstances, Agrium or PotashCorp could be required to pay the other party a non-completion fee of $485-million or $50-million as reimbursement for related expenses. The Arrangement Agreement also restricts Agrium and PotashCorp from increasing dividends or repurchasing their shares before completion of the Arrangement. Additional information and the full text of the Arrangement Agreement and the Arrangement are included in Agrium and PotashCorp's joint proxy circular filed on SEDAR on October 6, 2016.

All currency amounts are expressed in U.S. dollars. Second Quarter 2017 Financial Summary vs. Second Quarter 2016  Management Commentary \"Our second quarter marked the return to organic revenue growth on the back of strong sales to our large OEM customers in France and Germany,\" said Dave Vaughn, President and CEO of AgJunction. \"While we remain cautious about the near-term industry growth dynamics, we are ahead of our plan for the year and continue to effectively manage working capital and increase free cash flow. We grew cash on a consecutive quarter basis by approximately $3 million, while investing $1.8 million to repurchase our own stock (US$0.225 per share; CA$0.297, representing a 50% discount to the closing price of CA$0.60 on the date of the transaction). Given our overall business outlook, we are confident this will prove to be an accretive use of our Company's capital. \"Looking to the remainder of 2017, we believe the steps we have taken to strategically invest in intellectual property, innovate our product portfolio and improve our balance sheet has positioned AgJunction for further growth as our markets strengthen.\" Second Quarter 2017 Financial Results Total sales in the second quarter of 2017 increased 12% to $13.3 million compared to $11.9 million in the second quarter of 2016. This was driven by 51% sales growth in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region due to strong OEM business. Gross profit in the second quarter of 2017 increased 15% to $5.5 million compared to $4.8 million in the second quarter of 2016. Gross margin increased 110 basis points to 41.3% compared to 40.2% in the second quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily due to the absorption of production overhead by the higher sales volumes. Total operating expenses declined to $6.0 million compared to $6.1 million in the second quarter of 2016. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses were 45.3% compared to 50.9% in the second quarter of 2016. Net loss in the second quarter was $0.5 million or $0.00 per share, compared to a net loss of $1.2 million or $(0.01) per share in the second quarter of 2016. EBITDA in the second quarter of 2017 improved to $(0.0) million compared to $(0.7) million in the second quarter of 2016. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the second quarter of 2017 totaled $18.8 million compared to $12.9 million at the end of 2016.

As a result, it will limit money managers' ability to show on its website and in its database, the performance of hedge funds before they turn into mutual funds. The late August move will mean Morningstar will take a different approach to displaying that performance than what the SEC allows fund firms to advertise in their own marketing materials and filings. It identified about 115 funds with roughly $17B in assets that will be impacted by its planned change. Morningstar made the shift after analysts noticed the performance of hedge funds often deteriorated after they became mutual funds. They said some performance information displayed by funds that convert could be misleading or cherry picked to make a manager look good prior to the change.

Speakers in attendance included Gurcharn Brar from the University of Saskatchewan, Ron Knox of AAFC Swift Current and Mitch Flaman of Flaman Grain Cleaning. From the day's seminar, producers were encouraged to take an integrated disease management approach for fusarium and other diseases. \"All the guest speakers were wonderful.

Wednesday was the annual NARF and (Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada) AAFC field day. It featured topics such as biochar, herbicide options for faba bean, drones, rotational management of disease and 4R fertilizer management among others. Speakers included Raju Soolanayakanahally of AAFC Saskatoon, Terry Kowalchuck from the Ministry of Agriculture, Jessica Weber of Western Applied Research Foundation and Lena Syrovy from the University of Saskatchewan among others. Syrovy presented her findings on drones stating they can have benefits on crop scouting, identifying the issues in the fields. \"I don't know if it'll replace scouting the field entirely but it definitely will help focus the attention in certain areas that are looking different,\" Syrovy said. \"I think in the future, precision agriculture will be a big thing. Drone images will allow more detail mapping to different areas of the fields and allow different areas to be identified relatively quickly, \"she added. The third trip on Thursday was a forage seed field tour. Hosted by NARF, AAFC and the Saskatchewan Forage Seed Development Commission (SFDC).

Topics will range from precision agriculture to the outlook for the energy sector. Canada, which turned 150 this July 1st, has long seemed to outsiders to be a citadel of decency, tolerance and good sense. Modern Canada's social safety net is stronger than America's; its gun-control laws saner. Today, in its lonely defense of liberal values, Canada seems downright heroic. In an age of seductive extremes, it remains reassuringly level-headed. The prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has become a symbol of a progressive nation. Canada welcomes refugees; it has made significant advances in its climate policy; and the government recently announced a $120bn infrastructure-investment plan that highlights support for projects reducing greenhouse-gas emissions. But is the current state of affairs sustainable? How can a small, open, liberal economy survive and thrive in a world heading towards protectionism? What does the Trump era mean for trade, clean energy and Canadian businesses overall? \"The year of Canada's 150th birthday is an occasion both to reflect on past achievements and to look at the challenges ahead. The special edition of The Economist's Canada Summit in September will explore what makes the country distinctive, especially compared with the United States under Donald Trump, and ask the key question for the future: how can success be sustained?\" said Daniel Franklin, Executive editor of The Economist and chair of the conference. \"2017 also marks the 375th anniversary of the founding of Montreal,\" said Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard \"therefore, it is an opportune moment to welcome the Canada Summit to a city that embraces its cultural diversity as a driver of economic growth. From our innovative spirit to our support of sustainability and creativity, Montreal and Quebec together exemplify some of Canada's most admired qualities on the world stage.  We welcome the opportunity to host this global gathering.\" Held on Thursday, September 7th, the event will tackle the tough issues pertinent to Canada's present and future. Some of the speakers participating in the event include: *Ailish Campbell, chief trade commissioner, Global Affairs Canada *Guy Cormier, president and chief executive, Desjardins Group *Hugo Larochelle, lead, Google Brain *Michael Sabia, president and chief executive, Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec *Dominique Anglade, minister of economics, science and innovation, Quebec *Hunter Tura, chief executive, Bruce Mau *Merran Smith, founder and executive director, Clean Energy *Wade Barnes, president and chief executive, Farmers Edge *Marcia Moffat, Head of Canada, BlackRock *Shawn Qu, Chairman and chief executive, Canadian Solar *Jonathan Tetrault, executive vice-president, chief operating officer and chief business officer, Cirque du Soleil With a growing global circulation and a reputation for insightful analysis and perspective on every aspect of world events, The Economist is one of the most widely recognised and well-read current affairs publications. The paper covers politics, business, science and technology, and books and arts, concluding each week with the obituary.

You may have seen me taking photographs at the Melfort Exhibition, Kerry Vickar Centre concerts, business grand openings, Melfort Mustangs games and Comets football matches among others. Assimilating to an area and embracing the culture is the reason why I wanted to be a journalist. You get accustomed to the town you're in, the people involved and gain a new perspective on life.

The patent's assignee for patent number 9684956 is DELAVAL HOLDING AB (Tumba, SE). News editors obtained the following quote from the background information supplied by the inventors: \"Body condition scoring is a method of evaluating fatness or thinness in cows according to a scale, e.g. a five-point scale, where a score of one denotes a very thin cow, while five denotes an excessively fat cow. Research and field experiments have shown that body condition influences productivity, re-production, health and longevity. Thus, thinness or fatness can indicate underlying nutritional deficiencies, health problems, or improper herd management. As a mean to detect problems within the herd, body condition scoring is a good aid in improving the health and productivity of a dairy herd, when done on a regular basis, thus acting as an efficient tool in good herd management. Body condition scoring is better for monitoring body energy reserves than body weight. Body weight can change due to changes in body fat, frame size, gut size, udder size, pregnancy status, and intake of food and water. \"The body condition of a normal, healthy, cow fluctuates over the lactation periods, as can be seen in FIG. 1. At calving, a recommended body condition score may be 3.25 to 3.75 or somewhat lower. At early lactation the cow increases the production of milk until peak milk production is reached. During this period the cow uses its body reserves to get the energy necessary as food intake will lag behind requirements in the first six to eight weeks of lactation. The goal is to have a loss in the body condition of 0.5 to 0.75 in early lactation. At mid-lactation the body condition score should slowly increase to reach the same recommended value of 3.25 to 3.75 as at calving at the end of late lactation. It is important not to attempt to correct the body condition of the cow during the dry period as this will affect the weight of the calf more than the weight of the cow. \"Over-conditioning, or fatness, usually begins during the last three to four months of lactation, when milk production has decreased, but grain and total nutrients levels have not been reduced accordingly. At the time of calving, a cow with a body condition score over 4.0 often results in reduced feed intake and increased incidence of peripartum problems and other difficulties at calving. A fat cow is more susceptible to metabolic problems and infections. Over-conditioned cows tend to have problems with retained placenta, gastroparesis leading to calcium deficit, fat cow syndrome, fatty liver and mastitis. They might even collapse under their excessive weight. \"Under-conditioning, or thinness, occurs when a cow has been ill for a longer period, or if not enough energy has been added to the diet during mid- and late lactation. Under-conditioning at calving with a body condition score of less than 3.0 often results in lower peak milk yield and less milk for the entire lactation. It is a health risk in the early lactation when the cow uses much of its body reserves. Also cows should not lose more than 1.0 body score during early lactation as excessive loss of body condition in early lactation has been shown to reduce reproductive efficiency. Under-conditioning can frequently lower production and milk fat levels because of insufficient energy and protein reserves. Thin cows often do not show heat or conceive until they start to regain--or at least maintain--body weight. In feeding these animals, care must be taken to maintain production while increasing body reserves. \"A five-point scoring system was developed to measure the relative amount of this subcutaneous body fat. Most body condition scoring systems in dairy cattle use the five-point scoring system with quarter point increments. Instructions for a body condition scoring system have been devised to assess the body condition of a dairy cow at any point during the production cycle. For accurate scoring, both visual and tactile appraisals of back and hind quarters are necessary. The parts considered are the thoracic and lumbar regions of the vertebral column (chine, loin and rump), spinous processes (loin), tuber sacrale (hooks), tuber ischii (pin bones), and anterior coccygeal vertebrae (tail head) which are shown in FIG. 3. A single factor may be misleading; however, all factors considered together provide an accurate score. Each condition score was assessed by the criteria simplified in FIG. 4. \"Although the benefits of regular body condition scoring are intuitive to most dairy producers, nutritionists, and consultants, relatively few dairy farms have incorporated it as a part of their dairy management strategy. There are many reasons for the lack of adoption of this system, mostly related to its subjectivity, costs and time commitment required. It is hardly practical in a computerized herd management system. \"Dairy scientists have not yet developed the necessary objective research to be able to advice farmers properly. Therefore, there is a need to develop methods to determine the body condition score of individual cows in an automatic manner, which would be more cost effective, objective and easy to connect with data from a herd management system. \"Pompe V. J deGraaf, R. Semplonious, and J. Meuleman, 'Automatic body condition scoring of dairy cows: Extracting contour lines' Book of Abstracts, 5th European Conference on Precision Agriculture, 2nd European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming, 243-245, 2005 used black-and-white photography and a line laser to collect a series of images from the rear of the cow. A three-dimensional analysis of the images provided an outline of the left pin, left hook, and tailhead. No statistical analysis comparing image analysis with BCS was reported. \"T. Leroy, J.-M-Aerts, J. Eeman, E. Maltz, G. Stojanovski, and D. Berckmans, 'Automatic determination of body condition score of dairy cows based on 2D images' Precision Livestock Farming 05: 251-255, 2005 used ordinary two dimensional images from the rear of the cow, to obtain a silhouette image. Their study shows that it is possible to evaluate the body score automatically with an accuracy of the result at the same order of magnitude as the error of human evaluation. \"Some extensive work on automated body condition scoring for dairy cattle was conducted by Coffey et al. at the Scottish Agricultural College. Light lines were created on the back of the cow by using a red laser light shone through a prism. The camera was positioned at a 45.degree. angle to the horizontal plane of the cows back and the laser lines were used in manual extractions of curvatures over the cow's tailhead and buttocks. The curvature of these shapes was then modelled. The study found a large correlation, with a correlation coefficient of 0.55, between the tailhead curvature and observed BCS, whereas the correlation coefficient of the curvature of the right buttock as measured across the pin bone was 0.52. \"An extensive study was produced by J. M. Bewley, A. M. Peacock, O. Lewis, R. E. Boyce, D. J. Roberts, M. P. Coffey, S. J. Kenyon, and M. M. Schutz 'Potential for Estimation of Body Condition Scores in Dairy Cattle from Digital Images' Journal of Dairy Science, 91:3439-3453, 2008. Using digital images taken from above, the angles produced by the hook bones were extracted from a contour image. 99.89% of the automatically extracted body condition scores were within 0.5 points of actual score, and 89.95% were within 0.25 points. \"In the study of the body condition score of Mediterranean buffaloes using ordinary two dimensional image analysis, P. Negretti, G. Bianconi, S. Bartocci, S. Terramoccia, and M. Verna in 'Determination of live weight and body condition score in lactating Mediterranean buffalo by Visual Image Analysis' Livestock Science 113:1-7, 2008 confirmed that computerized image analysis is an effective measuring system. The Italian group also reached important conclusions showing that the automatic measurements of the angle between the back and the hook bones, and automatic measurements of the surface area behind the hook bones, where significantly correlated to the body condition score. \"EP 1537531 discloses an imaging method and system for use in automatic monitoring the body condition of an animal. A predetermined region of interest on the animal body is imaged, and data indicative of the acquired one or more images is processed to obtain a three-dimensional representation of the region of interest. The three-dimensional representation is analyzed to determine a predetermined measurable parameter indicative of a surface relief of the region of interest which is indicative of the body condition of the imaged animal. The technique of the present invention is useful for determining the energy balance condition of the animal (e.g., dairy cow) or the tendency in the energy balance change, to thereby enable appropriately adjusting nutrition of the specific animal; as well as for determining the existence of in coordination and/or locomotion in the animal's natural marching.\" As a supplement to the background information on this patent, VerticalNews correspondents also obtained the inventors' summary information for this patent: \"A disadvantage of the approaches disclosed above is that detected shapes depend heavily on the movement, background environment, and relative position of the cow with respect to the vision system. \"Further, the body condition scorings may not be reliable, accurate, or precise due to limited two-dimensional image data used in the image analysis. \"Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an arrangement and a method for determining a body condition score of an animal, which lack the above described disadvantages and limitations. \"It is a further object of the invention to provide such arrangement and method, which are automatic, robust, effective, fast, precise, accurate, reliable, safe, easy to use, and of reasonable cost. \"These objects among others are, according to the present invention, attained by arrangements and methods as claimed in the appended patent claims. \"According to one aspect of the invention an arrangement for determining a body condition score of an animal is provided, the arrangement comprising a three-dimensional camera system directed towards the animal and provided for instantaneously recording at least one three-dimensional image of the animal; and an image processing device connected to the three-dimensional camera system and provided for forming a three-dimensional surface representation of a portion of the animal from the three-dimensional image recorded by the three-dimensional camera system; for statistically analyzing the surface of the three-dimensional surface representation, in particular analyzing the unevenness, irregularity, or texture of the surface of the three-dimensional surface representation; and for determining the body condition score of the animal based on the statistically analyzed surface of the three-dimensional surface representation. \"The three-dimensional surface representation of a portion of the animal is advantageously a representation of a region of the back of the animal located in front of the tail head and narrow enough to not include the hip or pin bones of the animal. \"Preferably, the three-dimensional camera system is a time of flight range camera or an active wavefront sampling camera which provides a two-dimensional image of the animal, wherein, for each pixel of the two-dimensional image, the distance between the three-dimensional camera system and the respective object point imaged is provided. \"Yet preferably, the three-dimensional camera system is located above and optionally behind, the animal and is directed downwards, and optionally forward, towards the back of the animal to give image information from the dorsal and posterior portions of the animal. \"According to a further aspect of the invention a method for determining a body condition score of an animal by using the above described arrangement is provided. \"Various embodiments of the invention are set out in the dependent claims. \"The statistical analyzing may involve statistical analysis of surface gradients, surface normals, and/or range or depth values of the surface of the three-dimensional surface representation. \"Additionally or alternatively, the statistical analyzing may involve statistical analysis of spectral measures of the unevenness of the surface of the three-dimensional surface representation. \"Still additionally or alternatively, the statistical analyzing may involve statistical analysis of surface curvatures or spin-images of the surface of the three-dimensional surface representation. \"Advantageously, the statistical analyzing includes the calculation of statistical properties of a histogram of a feature parameter of the surface of the three-dimensional surface representation. The statistical properties may comprise mean value, standard deviation, smoothness, skewness, uniformity, entropy, the width of the histogram, the width at the half maximum value, and/or parameters of a curve fitted to the histogram. \"Advantages of the present invention as compared to the usually conducted and manually performed body condition scoring by experienced herdsman via visual inspection and contact include the following. \"The automatically performed body condition scoring of the invention is not subjective; it is not influenced by environment such as lighting, impression, knowing of animals, or personally dependent. \"Further, it is cost efficient and no time consuming work by skilled herdsman is required. The invention can easily be employed in large herds with high number of animals on a daily basis. The trend of body condition score can thus be traced and tracked frequently. \"Still further, the BCS resolution can be increased. The reliability and accuracy can be increased. \"Several of the advantages are equally valid when comparing the invention with the automatic and semi-automatic approaches disclosed in the background section. \"In particular, the statistical analyzing of an instantaneously recorded three-dimensional surface representation of a portion of the animal may provide accurate and reliable body condition scores. \"According to further aspects of the invention there are provided an arrangement and a method for determining a body condition score of an animal. The arrangement comprises a three-dimensional camera system and an image processing device connected to the three-dimensional camera system. At least one three-dimensional image of a portion of the animal is recorded by the three-dimensional camera system. A three-dimensional surface representation is formed from the three-dimensional image; the three-dimensional surface representation is normalized; and the body condition score of the animal is determined based on the surface of the normalized three-dimensional surface representation. \"The normalization is preceded by searching for reference points, e.g. the spinal ridge and the pin or hook bones, in the three-dimensional surface representation of the portion of the animal, which will serve as control points for the normalization. \"Preferably, the three-dimensional surface representation of the portion of the animal is normalized by means of rotation, translation, and scaling based on the location of the reference points such that the spinal ridge is essentially parallel with a first axis of a Cartesian coordinate system, the connection line between the tips of the pin or hook bones is essentially parallel with a second perpendicular axis of a Cartesian coordinate system, and the scaling of the three-dimensional surface representation is made depending on the distance between the tips of the pin or hook bones. \"By such normalization body condition scores can be determined irrespective of the recording angle of the three-dimensional camera system. The image can be recorded while the animal is walking or moving. \"According to still further aspects of the invention there are provided an arrangement and a method for determining a body condition score of an animal. The arrangement comprises a three-dimensional camera system and an image processing device connected to the three-dimensional camera system. At least one three-dimensional image of a portion of the animal is recorded; a three-dimensional surface representation is formed from the three-dimensional image; anatomical features are recognized in the three-dimensional surface representation; feature parameters of the recognized anatomical features are calculated; and the body condition score of the animal is determined based on the calculated feature parameters of the anatomical features recognized in the three-dimensional surface representation. \"Further characteristics of the invention and advantages thereof, will be evident from the following detailed description of preferred embodiments of the present invention given hereinafter and the accompanying FIGS. 1-16, which are given by way of illustration only, and are thus not limitative of the present invention.\" Keywords for this news article include: Livestock, Agriculture, DELAVAL HOLDING AB, Risk and Prevention.

Agriculture itself is a technology, and one on which all of human civilization was founded, no less. In today's informationage, a collectionof new data-driven technologies are poised to transform agriculture once again. \"The idea is to provide the growers with technologies that enable what we call precision agriculture,\" says Saad Chafki, the Vice President of IT and PMO in La Coop federee's Agribusiness Division. \"We're using big data, connected objects, and the Internet of Things to collect and analyze real-time data that can help the growers improve the productivity of their farms.\" That may sound very abstract, but the results are absolutely concrete. \"For example, we can use several source of data such as satellite imagery, soil analysis, and yields of previous years, and using predictive algorithms we can recommend to the grower the right quantity of the fertilizer to use in a specific area of the field,\" says Chafki.\"The bottom line is that the grower saves on the cost of the input (fertilizer) for the same or better results, as well as realizing a positive impact on the environment.\" The real power of these data-driven technologies is that they integrate so easily into existing farming processes. The basic processes of growing crops and raising livestock remain the same, but these technologies make them dramatically more efficient. This efficiency sells itself, and the new tech-savvy generation of farmers is embracing the innovations that enable it. They're digital natives, after all. They're used to having access to robust information at their fi ngertips on their computers, tablets, and smartphones.

To date, Ontario organizations and collaborations have completed 195 projects through Growing Forward 2 (GF2), and funding for 385 projects totaling $33.3 million has been approved by the AAC board over the past four years. The program was launched in 2013 and demand remained strong until the final application deadline this past April. GF2 officially ends March 31, 2018. \"The AAC is a strategic enabler. Projects funded have played a significant role in raising the standard and profile of Ontario's agriculture, agri-food and agribased products sector,\" said AAC Chair Kelly Duffy in her remarks to the audience. \"I know that if we continue to invest in the sector, we will produce long-lasting benefits that will impact future generations.\" Ontario Agri-Food Technologies is currently leading a project on open agri-food data collaboration, Ontario Precision Agri-Food (OPAF). It's assessing where Ontario and Canada are with precision agriculture and what needs to be done to manage and enable data for future global market access and sustainability. OPAF is collaborating with an initiative called FIWare Mundus that is creating a global Future Internet (FI) ecosystem to enable easy, fast data sharing. \"We're on the cusp of an evolution; data is at its centre and it's the new commodity in agriculture,\" said OAFT president Tyler Whale. \"OPAF is a facilitator that creates trusted relationships amongst value chain partners to integrate new and existing data resources.\" The Ontario Produce Marketing Association is tackling the issue of food waste through a GF2 funded project, and according to lead researcher Martin Gooch of Value Chain Management International, there is a compelling business case for addressing the problem. \"People outside of the industry are often staggered by the amount of waste in food. This is the first project of its kind in North America,\" said Gooch. The OPMA program includes a series of workshops and a handbook with 10 easy to follow steps for identifying where waste happens in farm, processing or retail processes. According to Gooch, a soonto-be-released case study clearly shows the opportunity of addressing food waste: a 29 per cent increase in gradeout of potatoes resulted in a 74 per cent increase in producer margin. \"A big thank you to AAC for providing the funding; it's great working with an organization that encompasses the entire chain,\" Gooch added. Harry Pelissero of Egg Farmers of Ontario spoke briefly about one of EFO's latest projects involving gender detection in unhatched eggs. The non-invasive scanning technology developed at Mc-Gill University can identify the gender of day-old eggs before they are incubated. This means female eggs can be incubated for hatching and infertile or male eggs can enter the table or processing egg streams, eliminating the need to hatch male eggs. \"AAC gave us the support to take this from the lab to preprototype and then prototype stage,\" explained Pelissero. \"The investment that AAC has put into this provides an economical solution to a challenge in the industry; this is an outcome that will literally go around the world.\" Duffy also used the opportunity to highlight overall GF2 program successes. Funding through this federal-provincial-territorial initiative has resulted in innovative research results, increased knowledge and awareness, access to new markets, and supported the overall competitiveness of the sector. In addition to delivery of GF2 and other programs, AAC also supports two federally funded research clusters led by the Canadian Food Innovators and the Canadian Ornamental Horticulture Alliance. \"At the AAC, we've been experts at delivering funding programs and administration services for both levels of government and industry organizations for the past 21 years,\" Duffy said and added that she is optimistic about the organization's future. \"The opportunities for innovation are greater than ever and I believe AAC can play a great role in helping the industry move forward.\""}, {"title": "Upon Closure of the Merger Transaction, Agrium and PotashCorp will become Nutrien", "article": "Release date - 22062017 SASKATOON, SK and CALGARY, AB - Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc.

By these measures, Canada is doing pretty well, ranking third of 25 countries next to France and Japan for its overall performance. The Barilla Center, based in Italy, is using the index to focus attention on three deepening paradoxes affecting the global food system. Every year, it says one-third of the food produced in the world goes to waste. \"Food waste corresponds to four times the amount needed to feed the people suffering from undernutrition worldwide,\" it says. There are issues with sustainability, which it defines as \"the ability of the food system to be maintained without depletion and exhaustion of its natural resources or compromises to its health and integrity.\" For example, it says a large portion of the world's crop and food production is funnelled into animal feed or biofuels, at the expense of people who don't have enough to eat. It's suggesting that use of food crops for biofuel be limited to no more than five per cent of production and that biofuel mandates be relaxed. That said, it points to the ongoing need for innovation, noting that 77 per cent of the growth in crop production between 1961 and 2005 came from yield growth, whereas only 14 per cent from the expansion of arable land. Thirdly, the Barilla Center cites the concurring crises of hunger and obesity. \"For every person suffering from undernutrition there are two who are overweight or obese,\" it says. Global rates of obesity have tripled since the 1960s. It's a health epidemic that affects both poor and wealthy countries. So even as the world's population continues to grow and hunger rates continue to decline, there needs to be a more holistic approach to nutrition. \"The food system must ensure this growing population has access to the nutrition it needs to flourish, especially as climate change re-shapes agricultural production,\" it says. \"This means tackling the twin nutritional challenges facing the world: hunger and nutrient deficiencies, along with unhealthy diets and obesity.\" Working with the Economist Intelligence Unit, the Barilla Center has come up with a series of benchmarks based on 35 indicators in eight categories assessing a country's performance. The higher the score, the better a country is doing. Interestingly, Canada is ranked second only to Germany under the pillar of sustainable agriculture, earning its relatively high score for the \"quality of agricultural subsidies, diversification of the agricultural system and agricultural productivity.\" Germany received top marks for its use of precision agriculture to reduce its use of pesticides and fertilizers without compromising yields. Canada falls to fourth below Argentina, Australia and Brazil for its management of food loss and waste. However, it got a failing grade for management of food waste at the household level. When it comes to its management of nutritional challenges, Canada falls to 10th position, behind places such as France, which leads the world in all categories, the U.K., China, Colombia and South Korea. Canada scored failing grades on three nutritional scores: the prevalence of overnourishment, physical activity levels and the number of people per fast-food restaurant in this country. What does all this mean in the context of the Canadian discussion around national food policy? It means farmers and the agricultural value chain may have to grow more accustomed to thinking about what they do in a more nuanced way. Globally, attention on the food system is shifting away from the concept of achieving food security simply by producing more calories and placing more focus on nutrition and environmental sustainability. \"The growing necessity for a balanced relationship with food calls for strategies to pursue food security goals and envision a new concept of well-being. It is a complex challenge that cannot be addressed in isolation,\" the Barilla Center says. As one of the world's leading agricultural exporters, Canada's food policy affects more than its own citizens. Laura Rance is editorial director for Glacier FarmMedia.

Bell said that it has already completed successful trials of the low-power, wide-area LTE-M technology and has deployments with pilot customers. Category M1 LTE is one of several options for lightweight LTE deployments for serving IoT devices with power efficiency and less cost; Cat M1 is the lowest power, least expensive implementation of LTE. This type of coverage is expanding in North America via a number of carriers. Verizon turned on its domestic LTE-M network at the end of March. AT&T was active in turning on its first LTE-M site late last year and announced full network deployment in mid-May. Earlier this week, Bell announced a CAD$500,000 contribution (about US$374,000) to the University of Manitobas Front and Centre campaign to launch the Bell MTS Innovations in Agriculture Program, which is geared toward IoT smart farming initiatives. The telco said that IoT applications can help improve the production of food resources through managing the location and performance of farm machinery, remote analysis of soil samples, field conditions, seeding rate and crop health, and monitoring of storage and processing operations. Bell demonstrated its first Cat M1 LTE use case earlier this year with industrial IoT company BeWhere, with an emphasis on real-time asset tracking and monitoring for emergency responders. The two companies said they are also testing environmental sensors and asset monitoring devices for an Ontario winery. LTE-M makes it possible to have many thousands of smart sensors collecting and sending data over a wider range and with better battery life than other connectivity options, said Stephen Howe, Bells CTO, in a statement.

But it does provide another warning bell of sorts that significant change is occurring -- the digital economy is shaking the foundations of legacy industries. And that digital economy needs to be funded, a need that has created real opportunities for a new type of investor class -- angel investors. They have become more sophisticated and better organized, but are still a private and ad hoc assortment of players, making it very hard to quantify their impact. The National Angel Capital Organanization (NACO), which held a Western Canada summit in Winnipeg earlier this week, has been trying to do that for a few years. It just released its seventh annual Report on Canadian Angel Investing Activity that shows significant growth in investments -- $157.2 million invested in 2016, compared to $20 million in 2010, and 418 deals last year, which is double the total from 2013. But because of the private nature of the investing, Yuri Navarro, NACO's CEO, is the first to point out that his numbers capture only a small portion of the activity. \"It's taken us seven years to build it up to this but even so we are probably seeing only 15 to 20 per cent of the angel community represented in there and only 30 to 40 per cent of the deal flow,\" he said. A case in point is that one of the more active angel investor groups in Winnipeg, the Manitoba Knights, is not a member of NACO and does not share its investment information, even though it has a high profile and talks publicly about some of its deals. One of its lead members, Harry Ethans, participated in a panel discussion this week and is an enthusiastic supporter of Winnipeg startups. Navarro said his goal is to increase the profile of the angels' successes, thus making the asset class better known, enticing more investors into the game and allowing momentum to build. As far as that goes, the successful growth and sale of the Winnipeg company SkipTheDishes is the classic example. Skip's founders were notoriously private about its financing all the way up to its $200-million sale to the U.K. firm Just Eat last December. But along the way, the company had rounded up a substantial amount of angel investment from locals and from across the country, as well as later rounds of more structured venture capital deals. For all of them, their investment in Skip became the proverbial home run. Navarro said, \"The really interesting thing is that there are multiple members from multiple provinces who came together to help fund the company. Then to see that turn into an exit... it was fantastic because it had reverberations throughout the ecosystem -- multiple members now get cash back out and they can reinvest that capital into new companies.\" Josh Simair, the CEO and one of the founders of Skip, is now the poster child for Canadian angel investors. Not one to blow his own horn and still very circumspect when it comes to talking about finances, Simair acknowledges he has become an angel investor but won't say which companies he's invested in. \"It is exciting now because we are able to use our capital to help fund other startups,\" he said. \"I love Winnipeg and the Prairies. \"We have a number of startups in the works right now, both local and from elsewhere in Canada.\" It's that process of successful exits begetting investments in new companies -- that then hopefully generate more exits -- that has created such a jackpot of cash in Silicon Valley. Navarro said in Toronto, for the first time, there is competition for deals among angel investors. The disappointingly small turnout at the NACO event in Winnipeg was further evidence that the activity is still in its early days here. But the sale of Skip and the successful venture capital financing of the precision-agriculture firm Farmers Edge is casting a nice little light on the Winnipeg scene. \"That is the positive momentum you want to generate,\" Navarro said. What is not in doubt about Winnipeg is the presence of winning ideas, talent and good old-fashioned hard work here. For instance, Winnipeg companies Permission Click and Portray Advertising won the startup of the year award in 2014 and 2015 at NACO's National Angel Summit. The entire Winnipeg ecosystem will be on display in the second weekend of June when North Forge Technology Exchange puts on Ramp Up Weekend 10, where teams of would-be entrepreneurs come up with actual product launches over the course of 55 hours. martin.cash@freepress.mb.ca"}, {"title": "Eurocontrol's Xenemetrix Receives SICPA Order", "article": "Sydney - Thursday - June 01: (RWE) - US$250,000 Order in Support of Fuel Marking Project TORONTO, ONTARIO.

Madam Heather Cameron, the Canadian High Commissioner, addressing a reception to commemorate her country's 150th Anniversary and 60 years of diplomatic relations with Ghana, pledged to strengthen the relations for the advancement of humanity and the promotion of the rule of law. Canada has pledged to commit more than $120 million dollars for the Planting for Food and Jobs Project towards the provision of improved seeds, extension services, marketing and e-agriculture. Vice President Mahamudu Bawumia, who pursued his doctorate degree in Canada, graced the occasion and expressed Ghana's goodwill and appreciation to the country. Madam Cameron said both countries championed the values of Good Governance, Inclusiveness, tolerance, Respect for Human Rights and Gender Equality in a Peaceful world. She said Canada chose to become a multicultural society and bilingualism at the time of its founding; and it had demonstrated its tolerance and goodwill through the years by encouraging legal and safe immigration. This year, it would welcome nearly 300,000 permanent residents and more than 25 million visitors, including Ghanaians. Over the past 15 months, it has also given refuge to more than 40,000 Syrian refugees, who have been assisted by volunteers and ordinary citizens. More than 1,300 Ghanaians are also studying in Canada, Madam Cameron said. She said her country had learned from her mistakes in the past and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was prioritising reconciliation with the indigenous people of the land. Throwing more light on the bilateral relations, she said investments in Energy, Mining, Education, Water and Sanitation, Democracy and Food Security, had been key with Canadian investors putting more than two billion dollars in the mining sector. These companies, she said, had promoted high ethical standards in the sector and had made significant development in their local communities. Canada, she said, had also supported the training of Ghana's Armed Forces and Peace Keeping operations. The country supported the founding of the Kofi Annan Peace Keeping Training Centre with three million dollars, personnel and expertise. Mr Boakye Agyarko, the Energy Minister, who delivered Ghana's Goodwill message, said the country looked forward to receiving Madam Marie-Claude Bibeau, Canada's Minister for International Development, in July. He commended Canada for standing by Ghana through the years and welcomed the support to transform the agricultural sector to propel national prosperity. He also commended Canada's contribution to democracy in Ghana, particularly the $1.4 million dollars, which supported the work of the Electoral Commission and the National Peace Council in the last general election. According to official information on the site of the Canadian High Commission, in 2015 Ghana became Canada's fourth largest market for exports in Sub-Saharan Africa, after Botswana, South Africa and Nigeria. Exports in that year totalled $215.5 million, while Canada imported $49.8 worth of Ghanaian goods. Ghana mainly exports cocoa, wood, and vegetable products, while Canada mainly exports vehicles and parts, machinery, cereals and textiles to Ghana.
