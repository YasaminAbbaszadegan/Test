[{"title": "MIL-OSI United Nations: An uncertain future for migrant workers, in a post-pandemic world", "article": "Source: United Nations 2 UN News: are migrants more likely to have lost work, due to the economic crisis? Gary Rynhart: Job losses have often hit migrant workers hardest, because they are more likely to work in informal jobs which can lack safety nets, in case of job loss or illness. This is particularly the case for migrants in developing countries, and temporary migrants, such as seasonal workers, where social protection tends, at best, to be limited to work injury compensation or health benefits. Over thirty countries in the world get more than 10 per cent of their GDP from remittances. This money sent home by around one billion workers overseas or internally to their families is collectively higher than either foreign direct investment or official development assistance. It was almost three-quarters of a billion dollars last year. The World Bank estimates a drop of 20% this year. Families across the developing world are being impacting, creating ripple effects throughout their economies. IOM/Thierry Falise Burmese migrants work in fishing boats and coastal communities in Phang Nga, Southern Thailand. UN News: will migrants be able to find jobs, once the global economy recovers? Gary Rynhart: The disruption to supply chains and closed borders resulting from the pandemic will probably lead to more firms turning to technology, automation and Artificial Intelligence. In a recent survey by accounting firm EY, around half of company bosses surveyed, in 45 countries, said that they are speeding up plans to automate their businesses, and some 41 per cent said they were investing in accelerating automation, as businesses prepared for a post-crisis world. This is potentially bad news for migrants. Southeast Asia is a case in point: take the garment factories in the region, which is mostly filled with internal migrants, or the shrimp peeling industry in Thailand, which is done by Myanmar migrants. Technology to reduce, or eliminate, the need for human workers in these industries already exists. Even call centres in the Philippines, which benefited from outsourcing that began in the 1990s, are affected. It's estimated that up to 90 per cent of these 'new' jobs are under high threat from automation. That's one million jobs, accounting for around seven per cent of the country's GDP. UN RWANDA Stephen Rodriques, (2nd left) UNDP Rwanda Resident Representative pose for a group photo with Rwanda government officials as well representative of Zorabots, after handing over the robots in Kigali. Manufacturing, retail, health care and hospitality will be significantly impacted sectors. In the Japanese healthcare sector robotic care workers, or 'carebots' are increasingly deployed to, quite literally, do the 'heavy lifting'. This does away with many of the physically demanding orderly positions traditionally filled by migrants. The retail sector has typically relied on migrant workers, but the COVID-19 pandemic has seen a dramatic growth in online shopping. In the hospitality sector, automated experiments include robots that provide bartending services on cruise ships and in airports, and that deliver food to hotel guests' rooms. More hotels are offering automated check-in via app or even, in China, via facial recognition. Alexa-enabled speakers in hotel rooms let guests ask for sightseeing tips and order toothbrushes without talking to staff. Using GPS technology, robots can be used in precision agriculture for weed control and harvesting. The pandemic may also have given another nudge to technology for Driverless cars which could soon see taxi driving, another job many migrants do, fall by the wayside. ILO Photo/Marcel Crozet A school teacher in France connects with her students remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic. What the last few months have shown is that an awful lot of processes and meetings (e.g. doctors' appointments, visa renewals) can be done online. There has been a surge in telemedicine, and, as video technology improves, diagnostics such as measuring temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure may also be done via a webcam. Certain elements of teaching can be done through digital platforms, and there is currently a big increase in internet-based education services. Improvements in virtual reality, augmented reality, hologram technology, and collaboration tools will make all of that even easier. Many administrative functions can be carried out remotely: There are many new employment opportunities here, which could reduce the need for migration, and remote working could open the door for women to access opportunities commensurate with their talent by going elsewhere virtually, without moving physically. This is especially important in regions where there are cultural biases against women actively searching for jobs: platforms have been found to help women find work, and remote working can offer them an important veil of anonymity. UN News: has the pandemic affected attitudes towards migrants? Gary Rynhart: There has been an increase in discrimination, in particular anti-Asian discrimination specifically related to COVID 19, and some populist political parties have sought to scapegoat migrants (we've seen this in Italy, Spain, Greece, France, and Germany, amongst others). Hassan Akkad, a BAFTA-winning filmmaker and health worker from Syria, now living in the United Kingdom., by (c) Hassan Akkad But the post-pandemic world is not necessarily all bad news, and there are signs that it may bring about new opportunities for migrants, and even improved perceptions. For example, many migrants are filling frontline medical roles or providing essential services like stacking supermarket shelves or cleaning hospitals. Additionally, we have seen some softening of restrictions on foreign-trained and foreign-born health workers in high-income countries to cope with the crisis: refugee doctors without recognized qualifications were called up in Germany, and had recognition of their qualifications fast-tracked in the UK, some US States have allowed foreign-trained doctors to work, and Australia lifted working hour caps on foreign-trained nurses. In fact, despite recent populist rhetoric, attitudes towards migrants have been steadily, and markedly, improving in recent years. According to a survey of 18 countries published last year, 63 per cent of US citizens felt immigrants were a burden on the country, back in 1994, and only 31 per cent felt they strengthened it. Fast forward 25 years and the figures are reversed. By a ratio of two to one US citizens are pro-migration. According to the same survey, majorities in top migrant destination countries, which host half of the world's migrants, say immigrants strengthen their countries. Majorities in the UK, France, Spain, Australia, Canada, Sweden and Germany all agree with the statement 'migrants make my country stronger'. Maybe one outcome of this crisis will be more inclusivity, and more diversity, in the global workplace, and an improvement in some of the factors that drive people to leave their homes and countries, in search of better livelihoods."}, {"title": "Development of a farm-efficiency and traceability platform", "article": "New technology will play a dual role for the plant-protein sector WINNIPEG, MB, Sept. 16, 2020 /CNW/ - Today, Protein Industries Canada announced a co-investment into a new platform intended to increase the efficiency of farmer decision-making and expand Canada's plant-protein market opportunities. The $21 million project is being led by Farmers Edge Inc. and OPIsystems Inc., with a co-investment from Protein Industries Canada. Farmers Edge and OPIsystems are capturing farm-level data related to crop and storage health management. This data in turn will be used to develop predictive models that use artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to help farmers enhance production practices, as well as make better storage and marketing decisions. This is expected to increase return on investments related to all areas of seed selection, irrigation, equipment selection and post-harvest management. Once the initial phase is complete, Farmers Edge and OPIsystems will partner with the Standards Council of Canada to improve traceability along the plant-protein value chain. By using the data captured on farms, the partners will use a comprehensive digital platform to show consumers and trade partners how the products they're buying were produced and managed. The platform will include transparency related to production practices and any applicable regulatory or trade compliance checkoffs. \"The Protein Supercluster is serving as a hotbed of innovation for the plant-protein ecosystem, bringing together technology companies that can address emerging farming challenges. This SME-led project is a great example of how data science and advanced technology such as artificial intelligence is helping to improve the health and quality of protein crops,\" said the Honourable Navdeep Bains, Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry. \"Canada's farmers are on the cutting edge of technology, which gives consumers around the world the best quality food products. Enhanced traceability across the plant-protein value chain will help our farmers expand market opportunities and boost consumer confidence in our protein crops,\" said the Honourable Marie-Claude Bibeau, Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food. When complete, the final products from both phases of the project will provide full traceability along the entire plant-protein value chain. This platform is expected to lead to approximately 200 new Canadian jobs by 2025. \"The markets this platform could open for the plant-protein sector is incredible to think about,\" Protein Industries Canada CEO Bill Greuel said. \"From a single sign-in, our buyers will be able to access all of the compliance information they need related to the plant-protein commodities they're buying. And our consumers can check in to rest assured the food they're eating was produced in the manner they value most.\" Farmers Edge and OPIsystems are together investing $13.6 million into the project, with Protein Industries Canada investing an additional $7.4 million. The companies' past technological experience is expected to be an asset in the project's development; as a global leader in digital agriculture, Farmers Edge provides its customers with field-level analysis and predictive modelling daily, while OPIsystems uses innovative technology to help producers dry, condition and store grain in ways that optimize quality while reducing energy consumption and spoilage losses. \"We're excited to work with OPIsystems, the federal government and Protein Industries Canada on this important project,\" Farmers Edge CEO and co-founder Wade Barnes said. \"The expertise OPIsystems brings in remote grain monitoring combined with our robust data sets, comprehensive platform and AI-driven technologies will forever transform the plant-proteins sector, ensuring high-quality crop production and complete traceability from field to market. The value of data is priceless for growers and consumers alike; growers will be able to share verified crop records with a simple click, opening doors to new market opportunities, and consumers will gain transparency on the origin of their food, enhancing their level of trust with farms across Canada.\" \"OPI is grateful for the support Protein Industries Canada has provided, and excited about the opportunity to partner with Farmers Edge,\" co-founder and CEO of OPIsystems Dave Crompton said. \"The knowledge and expertise Farmers Edge brings to the project is key to our ability to deliver an end-to-end solution that can benefit everyone across the agricultural value-chain, from producers to consumer alike. This is where the rubber hits the road in terms of turning the ever-increasing volumes of data we generate into tangible benefits to the agricultural community. We very much look forward laying the groundwork in a platform solution that can extend out to partnerships across our industry, from field to fork.\" Protein Industries Canada and its industry partners have invested more than $163 million into projects that will advance Canada's plant-protein sector; this is its 11th project announcement.

The trailblazing deal centers on a unique digital infrastructure that combines highly precise, site-specific datasets with science-based analytics and Artificial Intelligence to transform traditional parametric coverage models into scalable and profitable solutions for all stakeholders; growers gain top quality crop protection and instant payouts while insurers gain key insights and tools to more confidently mitigate risk, automate claims, and provide faster payouts to customers. Agricultural parametric insurance covers areas that are excluded from all-risks indemnity policies, such as excess moisture or heat, to protect growers against unpreventable high-intensity and catastrophic losses. These policies are designed to offer claim payouts as soon as events are triggered, eliminating the typical loss adjustment and reporting period. However, these parametric weather policies may carry significant risk across data-sparse regions due to insufficient publicly available data. The collaboration puts Farmers Edge and Munich Re at the forefront of insurance innovation, combating risks associated with parametric coverage while also establishing business resiliency amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Farmers Edge risk management platform--FarmCommand(r)--provides a powerful avenue to securely automate all data transactions between growers and insurers, resulting in lower administrative costs and improved scalability. The platform delivers hyper-local, high-density insights, fueled by AI and robust datasets, such as daily satellite imagery and site-specific weather conditions, to detect claims and trigger instant payouts. Its Smart Claim(tm) and Smart Reporting(tm) tools power automated record-keeping, claim predictions and notifications, claim adjustments, crop classifications, and fraud detection. One crucial piece are the Farmers Edge weather stations installed directly on the farm. This acute level of precision, combined with Munich Re 's vast reinsurance expertise, provides growers with secure protection that mirrors the impact of weather events as they occur on their fields. While traditional claims can take months, these new, parametric solutions are designed to be completely automated by data and InsurTech features. FarmCommand houses and analyzes all data to detect and trigger claims automatically, creating more utility, security, and transparency for all stakeholders. \"As a farmer myself, it was paramount for us to provide a solution to help growers across data-sparse regions access more protection,\" says Wade Barnes, Farmers Edge CEO and co-founder. \"By working together, we're able to bring the highest degree of accuracy available and couple it with intuitive tools to deliver instant payouts and superior risk management solutions that support global sustainability. This collaboration completes the missing piece of the longstanding parametric puzzle--controlling risk with better data--and gives insurers a clearly defined competitive advantage to attract new customers and enrich existing relationships.\" \"Protecting agribusinesses against risks arising in agricultural production has been a longstanding tradition within Munich Re . Our aim is to improve the access to required coverages by extending the boundaries of insurability,\" says Rainer Hartmann, Head of AgRisk Partners in Munich Re . \"The collaboration with Farmers Edge brings an important piece to the table. The performant accessibility to accurate data allows the design of individual coverages on a parametric basis addressing the specific risks and helping commercial operations to manage their exposures.\" About Munich Re Munich Re is one of the world's leading providers of reinsurance, primary insurance, and insurance-related risk solutions.

Advancements in technology have changed how business is conducted, with some industries undergoing dramatic changes since the dawn of the 21st century. While agriculture might not be the first industry people think of when reflecting on the changing nature of industry, The National Institute of Food and Agriculture notes that modern farms are vastly different than those from a few decades ago. Farmers have long relied on technology to make their operations as efficient, productive and profitable as possible. Precision agriculture, which refers to technological advances designed to propel agriculture into the modern, computerized and information-based world, is helping the agricultural sector become more profitable and efficient while also improving safety and making agriculture more eco-friendly. In addition, the NIFA notes that the modern agricultural industry employs technology such as robots, temperature and moisture sensors, aerial images, and global positioning systems. If it sounds complicated, that's because it is. For example, modern sensors can detect soil conditions, potentially producing hundreds of readings per second. These sensors help farmers know the best possible time to plant seeds so they can reach their full potential. That improves both the efficiency of modern farms as well as their output. The NIFA also notes that agricultural technology has reduced waste. For instance, thanks to agricultural technology, farmers no longer have to apply water, fertilizers and pesticides uniformly across entire fields. Technology has shown that farmers can simply target specific areas or even treat individual plants differently. That saves time and allows farmers to use only minimal quantities of water, fertilizer and pesticides. In addition, according to the NIFA, employing agricultural technology in this fashion leads to higher crop productivity and reduces runoff of chemicals into rivers and groundwater, thereby reducing the farm's impact on local ecosystems. Modern farms are technological marvels where various technologies are being employed to produce crops more efficiently and safely than ever before."}, {"title": "Hexagon furthers autonomy in agriculture through new positioning and sensing kits demonstrated by pioneering R&D tractor", "article": " CALGARY, Alberta, Sept. 9, 2020 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Hexagon's Autonomy and Positioning division has launched its first autonomy positioning and sensing kits for the agriculture market and validated these solutions in its new autonomous research and development tractor.

The Farmers for Climate Solutions (FCS) is calling on federal policymakers to incentivize farmers to turn their farms into green energy powerhouses and provide incentives for climate-friendly farming. They are also calling for help turning farmers into mentors and increased supports for new and young farmers. They also want to see farmers who reduce their climate risk rewarded. Brenda Barritt, a rancher who operates Earth Work Farms near Alix, said FCS wants policymakers to help producers turn their land into climate solutions instead of carbon producers. \"I really want to see programs in place that really just help us invest in those practices that give us longterm benefits and then even help us out economically,\" said Barritt. Barritt said producers don't want government handouts that dictate what changes they make on their farms. Instead, she said they need incentives that will help farmers implement practices that create a healthy future and improve their bottom line. \"So no-till cropping, I understand you get carbon credits for that. That's excellent because that's a nudge forward, but when we convert tilled land back into grassland pasture, right now, as far as I understand, there's no carbon credit for that,\" said Barritt. \"How do we start to not only think of our carbon credit system around agriculture about doing less bad, but also incentivize to be part of the solution?\" The calls come as the government looks towards an economic recovery plan in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. FCS is lobbying the government to keep food producers in mind as they build that plan. The pandemic hit Alberta's food supply line particularly hard as outbreaks at the Cargill slaughterhouse in High River and the JBS food processing plant in Brooks led to thousands of cases. The Cargill plant, which has been linked to 1,500 cases, was forced to close for weeks before reopening with additional safety measures. Barritt said governments need to build up medium and small scale producers so the supply line doesn't remain so heavily centralized. \"What we saw was an increased demand for our product, but the infrastructure was missing around the medium-sized and small abattoirs,\" said Barritt. \"I truly believe a resilient economy is built on local medium-sized and large scale. So there's room for all of us.\" James Watson, a spokesman for Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, said farmers are stewards of the land and are on the front lines of climate change. He said the federal government is committed to helping producers become more climate resilient. \"The $3 billion federal, provincial and territorial Canadian Agricultural Partnership offers on-farm programs that will help farmers capitalize on opportunities for sustainable growth by adopting precision agriculture technologies, tools, and practices that help reduce GHG emissions and store even more carbon in the soil - all while increasing overall production,\" said Watson."}, {"title": "CGY Calian acquires wireless antenna manufacturer Tallysman", "article": "Calian Group Ltd (TSX:CGY) Shares Issued 9,716,729 Last Close 9/3/2020 $63.61 Thursday September 03 2020 - News Release Mr. Kevin Ford reports CALIAN ACQUIRES CANADIAN MANUFACTURER OF WIRELESS ANTENNAS Calian Group Ltd. has acquired Tallysman Wireless Inc., a leading manufacturer of precision global navigation satellite system (GNSS) antennas and related components.

After a rousing speech fro guest speaker Karla Nielsen, graduate Dixon Tattrie gave the graduates salute to the community, noting their achievements \"would not have been possible without the support of the school and community.\" \"Without the never waning support, guidance and assistance from teachers and staff we never would have been able to make it through the last 12 years of school.\" He noted the staff encourage them to be role models for younger students and the community at large, and \"helped us gain a valuable set of skill to take into this ever changing world.\" Graduate Faith Stringer noted she had no clue how to start the speech. \"Every year we sit in those exact chairs and watch our friends and family slowly graduate one by one thinking that our time is never going to come fast enough.\" \"Well here we are and all I'm saying is this moment came way faster than I thought it was going to.\" \"I know we are all ready and excited to start the rest of our lives as individuals and go out into the world,\" she added. Graduate Spencer Hogan thanked the parents on behalf of each graduate in his speech, giving thanks for their efforts for each graduate on the stage. Graduate Spencer MacMillan informed the group what each of the graduates had planned in the coming years. \"As we prepare for our future lives after Grade 12, we all have a road mapped out and this is where our planned routes will take us. Tattrie, MacMillan said, had been accepted into the Animal Science Technology program at Lakeland College on a rodeo scholarship. Hogan, he noted, would be attending his first semester of Olds College virtually, taking an Precision Agriculture Techgronomy course. Stringer, MacMillan said, would be attending the University of Calgary for a degree in Sociology. As for himself, MacMillan said that he would not be attending Olds College as planned in the fall due to COVID, but would be waiting for it to return to in person classes as he planed to take Heavy Duty Mechanics. Tattrie gave the valedictorian address noting that the group had \"troubling times\" over the past few months due to the pandemic. \"There's two things I've really learned; you can either be a victim of circumstance or a victor of circumstances.\" \"I also came to learn that you have to enjoy the little things in life.\" \"I thought having to stay at home for a couple of months was going to be a breeze. Needless to say it was anything but that.\" Having missed out on his final chance at the National High School Rodeo in the US due to COVID after electing not to go, Tattrie said, \"I consistently said to myself 'you just gotta keep rolling with the punches.'\" \"Social distancing made me realize I needed to start to focus more on the little things and enjoy them more,\" Tattrie said. He noted he missed out on conversations with his classmates, saying good-bye to friends and teachers, and writing his last diploma and walking out the doors of the school with his head held high. \"I hope when the pandemic finally ends and we aren't six feet apart we can share a handshake and a chuckle. And when we look back we are able to say we were a victor of circumstances, not just because we survived but because we were able to enjoy the things in life that are really important.\" \"With a quote from Dolly Parton I will leave you, 'everybody wants happiness, nobody wants pain, but you can't have a rainbow without a little rain.'\""}, {"title": "Farming plays role in anoxic waters", "article": "Pungent, rotten smells have been wafting from the head of Murray River over the past few weeks as waters turned milky, lime green in colour.  \"That sounds like anoxia,\" said Cindy Crane, a surface water biologist who monitors waterways with the province's Department of Environment Water and Climate Change.  Anoxic water events have been confirmed in at least 15 rivers and one pond on the Island so far this summer. They include: Souris River in Kings County as well as Mill River, Mill Creek, Montrose River and Trout River in Prince County.  When sea lettuce, phytoplankton or other types of algae die, the decay process uses oxygen. When all of the oxygen is stripped from water it's considered anoxic. The lack of oxygen, the die-off process and affiliated bacteria usually cause the water to turn milky, murky white or green colour and to smell like rotten eggs or turnips. Ms Crane's department checked the upper portion of the Murray River on August 25 and 27 and detected signs of anoxic waters like some discolouration, the distinct rotting smell and dead sea lettuce along the shoreline.  When water oxygen levels were checked she said they were on the low side but not low enough to be considered anoxic at the time. \"We feel the area is  recovering from an anoxic event that occurred earlier,\" she said. \"I wouldn't call what we have here a natural situation,\" Ms Crane said. \"This is clearly caused by human action, adding nutrients to a system it can't tolerate.\" Nutrients from fertilizers used for agriculture leach into soil and waterways causing an over abundant growth of sea lettuce, phytoplankton and algae. Other sources of excess nutrients and growth can be seafood processing plants and sewer systems. She said anoxic events seen in PEI's estuaries are different from, for example, algae blooming to an extent a system can handle, an occurrence often seen in maturing lake systems. \"It's a huge deal,\" Michael Van Den Heuval said.  Mr Van Den Heuvel is an associate biology professor with UPEI and the Canada Research Chair in Watershed Ecological Integrity. He said anoxia causes a litany of effects. \"We see regular anoxia in something like 26 or 28 estuaries on PEI. It's actually severe enough to kill everything in 10 to 25 per cent of the estuary.\" Anoxic waters affect PEI's oyster, mussel and other shellfish industries, the eel fishing industry, the Island's tourism industry and generally cause environmental systems to become less healthy. Bob MacLeod, president of the PEI Shellfish Association lives in Poplar Grove in West Prince. He has seen anoxic waters affect shellfish harvesters at various points over the years. \"It doesn't just affect the 25 people harvesting in one area that has turned anoxic. Anoxic waters affect the industry because those 25 people where a lot of the shellfish have died are looking to fish where others have been fishing before.\" \"There is no Band-Aid solution, you really have to stop nitrate pollution or nitrogen pollution in particular,\" Mr Van Den Heuvel said adding, 80 per cent of excess nitrates, which lead to anoxic waters, are attributed to agriculture. \"The unpopular thing for me to say is much of the nitrate comes from potatoes because of the fertilizer they require. So you either don't grow as many potatoes or you find ways to give potatoes less nutrients.\" Solutions include diversifying crops, adding an extra crop into a farm's rotation schedule, planting strategic potato varieties which require less nutrients and changing fertilization methods. Mr Van Den Heuvel recognizes the challenges associated with each solution. \"There are certainly some potato varieties that have considerably less nutrient requirements but just planting another variety isn't as easy as it sounds, big producers want certain varieties for their French fries.\" Spreading granular fertilizer through potato furrows is a common fertilization method. \"The option we're interested in researching is actually fertigation where you can give your plants little bits of fertilizer when and where they need it through an irrigation system. This is rather than spreading a lot of nutrients in the furrows and hoping some get to the plant eventually,\" Mr Van Den Heuvel said. An obstacle to this solution has been a moratorium on high capacity wells for irrigation on the Island for nearly eight years now, he said. The moratorium has been in effect pending legislation of a Water Act on PEI.  \"This has been a controversial issue,\" he said adding, there has been talk of need for research about benefits of fertigation and to determine Island water systems' sustainable capacities before allowing use of high capacity wells for crop irrigation. \"What's going to happen for farmers is in limbo right now, but the ability to irrigate is part of the equation that could allow precision farming. At least for the larger operations that can afford the costs associated with this style of growing.\"  Mr Van Den Heuvel acknowledges, to Island farmers who have been able to rely on profits from potato crops for years, diversifying is sometimes seen as a risk requiring trial and error and presenting new challenges. Adding additional crops to rotation schedules presents similar challenges. He said these solutions could be big changes for Island farmers but not undoable or impossible."}, {"title": "A stressful year, even for vineyards; Despite challenges, there is cautious optimism heading into the harvest", "article": "\"the painting of the vineyard.\" The French use the term \"veraison\" to describe the phenomenon when the berries in a bunch of grapes begin to change colour en route to the final phase of ripening in the vineyard. Not to put too fine a point on it, but veraison marks the transition period from berry growth to berry ripening and several alterations in the maturation of the berries in the run-up to harvest. In the northern hemisphere, veraison can begin as early as late June or as late as the end of August. Every year is different, and every vineyard site is different. It is true that in 2020, we know a lot more about ripening grapes and encouraging all of a vineyard to ripen within a much tighter time frame, but in the end, we are never really in charge. Bio-dynamic vineyards have shown that when they are in perfect rhythm with the seasons and the equinox, they tend to ripen earlier and in a shorter time frame across the entire vineyard. Precision agriculture, which exposes each bunch to the perfect amount of sunlight and has an almost mathematical leaf count to generate maximum photosynthesis, is helping to compact and fine-tune the ripening process too. You can add to that - every vintage is fickle, and nothing is ever the same. What we do know is that all things being equal, you can expect to be harvesting grapes about six to seven weeks after veraison is complete. In British Columbia, it means the main 2020 harvest is likely to get underway some time in late September or early October. Sparkling wine grapes will be picked earlier, and so too will some of the warmest vineyards in the South Okanagan, but all that will be balanced by late October, and early to mid-November picks, in the far north. Before the colour change, the grapes are essentially bulletproof hard green peas. Over the next six weeks, the grape will double in size as the water content increases, the acids drop, and the sugars rise. It's also a key time for the berries to take on the main traits of their specific grape varietal - Cabernet Sauvignon thickens its skin to colour the wine, Pinot Noir develops that mouth-filling sweet fruit. At the same time, most varieties are beginning to translate their origin into their taste. Behind the scenes, or literally inside the grapes, tannins are ripening; astringent malic acid gives way to softer tartaric acid, while outside leaves are removed from the cooler north side of vines to let the sunshine in and irrigation is limited, if not shut down. While all that intervention is underway, Mother Nature remains firmly in control of all possible catastrophic events like rain, mildew diseases, frost and wildfire smoke. These are issues that will be in play right up until the final grape is harvested. Wildfires have become increasingly troublesome for vineyards. While the vineyards have proven to be effective firebreaks for citizens living in the region, the smoke is an issue once veraison is underway, and the grapes soften. That's when smoke from lingering fires can be absorbed into the grapes only to resurface in the wine (especially red wines) after the fermentation process. If it sounds stressful, it is, and when you add a pandemic into the mix, a reduced workforce, and widespread reports of unbecoming behaviour by visitors failing to comply with basic COVID-19 protocols designed to protect everyone, you can understand why 2020 will be a vintage no one forgets for a long time. Despite the challenges, there is cautious optimism heading into the harvest that looks to be only a handful of days behind at this point. Another six weeks of dry, warm weather will be welcomed and should finish off the year in style. We will know a lot more by Labour Day. Stay safe and be polite if you are heading for wine country. shrimp and cheesy GriTs This Shrimp and grits recipe is an easy take on a restaurant standard of the American South. Randy Shore borrows the complexity of an etouffe and combines it with the peppery profile of Cajun crawfish. If you don't have Cajun seasoning, mix a little cayenne pepper with some Old Bay. Bob's Red Mill Corn Grits are the most authentic grind of corn on Canadian supermarket shelves. The GriTs ? 1/2 cup cream ? 2 cups low sodium chicken stock ? 1/2 cup coarse grits ? 1/2 tsp Cajun seasoning ? Salt and pepper ? 1 cup grated cheddar cheese The shrimp ? 12 very large prawns ? 1 tsp Cajun seasoning ? Salt and pepper ? 1 tbsp canola ? 4 oz Andouille or farmer sausage, diced ? 1 garlic clove, minced ? 1/2 red or green bell pepper, diced ? 3 green onio ns, chopped ? 1 tbsp flour ? 1 cup chicken stock ? 1 tsp red pepper sauce 1. In a saucepan over medium heat, bring cream and stock to a simmer. Whisk in the grits, lower heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Season with Cajun spice and a pinch of salt and pepper. If the grits get too thick, whisk in a little water. Cook until tender, about 25 to 30 minutes or according to package directions. Whisk in cheddar cheese and do a final adjustment to the thickness of the grits with water. They should be loose and creamy. Taste and season with salt, if desired. 2. Meanwhile, season prawns with Cajun spice, salt, and pepper. In a wide pan on medium heat, warm oil. Sear the shrimp for about 1 minute on each side, remove and set aside. Add the sausage and stir until lightly browned and their oil begins to come out. Add garlic, peppers and all but 1 tbsp of the green onions. Lower heat and cook until softened. Stir in flour and cook for about 1 minute. Add the stock and stir quickly so no lumps form. Whisk in chicken stock and cook until thickened, about 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in prawns and let them heat through, 1 to 2 minutes. Drizzle on red pepper sauce. Serve over grits and garnish with green onion.

Not to put too fine a point on it, but veraison marks the transition period from berry growth to berry ripening and several alterations in the maturation of the berries in the run-up to harvest. In the northern hemisphere, veraison can begin as early as late June or as late as the end of August. Every year is different, and every vineyard site is different. It is true that in 2020, we know a lot more about ripening grapes and encouraging all of a vineyard to ripen within a much tighter time frame, but in the end, we are never really in charge. Bio-dynamic vineyards have shown that when they are in perfect rhythm with the seasons and the equinox, they tend to ripen earlier and in a shorter timeframe across the entire vineyard. Precision agriculture, which exposes each bunch to the perfect amount of sunlight and has an almost mathematical leaf count to generate maximum photosynthesis, is helping to compact and fine-tune the ripening process too. You can add to that - every vintage is fickle, and nothing is ever the same. What we do know is that all things being equal, you can expect to be harvesting grapes about six to seven weeks after veraison is complete. In British Columbia, it means the main 2020 harvest is likely to get underway sometime in late September or early October. Sparkling wine grapes will be picked earlier, and so too will some of the warmest vineyards in the South Okanagan, but all that will be balanced by late October, and early to mid-November picks, in the far north. Before the colour change, the grapes are essentially bulletproof hard green peas. Over the next six weeks, the grape will double in size as the water content increases, the acids drop, and the sugars rise. It's also a key time for the berries to take on the main traits of their specific grape varietal - Cabernet Sauvignon thickens its skin to colour the wine, pinot noir develops that mouth-filling sweet fruit. At the same time, most varieties are beginning to translate their origin into their taste. Behind the scenes, or literally inside the grapes, tannins are ripening; astringent malic acid gives way to softer tartaric acid, while outside leaves are removed from the cooler north side of vines to let the sunshine in and irrigation is limited if not shut down. While all that intervention is underway, Mother Nature remains firmly in control of all possible catastrophic events like rain, mildew diseases, frost and wildfire smoke. These are issues that will be in play right up until the final grape is harvested. Wildfires have become increasingly troublesome for vineyards. While the vineyards have proven to be effective firebreaks for citizens living in the region, the smoke is an issue once veraison is underway, and the grapes soften. That's when smoke from lingering fires can be absorbed into the grapes only to resurface in the wine (especially red wines) after the fermentation process. If it sounds stressful, it is, and when you add a pandemic into the mix, a reduced workforce, and widespread reports of unbecoming behaviour by visitors failing to comply with basic COVID-19 protocols designed to protect everyone, you can understand why 2020 will be a vintage no one forgets for a long time. Despite the challenges, there is cautious optimism heading into the harvest that looks to be only a handful of days behind at this point. Another six weeks of dry, warm weather will be welcomed and should finish off the year in style. We will know a lot more by Labour Day. Stay safe and be polite if you are heading for wine country. Weekend wine picks Jose Maria da Fonseca Albis 2019, Setubal Peninsula, Portugal $13.49 I 87/100 UPC: 00600470120002 Albis is produced on the Setubal Peninsula, the source of the Moscatel de Setubal and Srinto grape varieties used in the blend. Moscatel accounts for its barely off-dry floral notes, the ripe pear, and peach fruit while the Arinto adds a juicy, savoury minerality to the light, bright finish. Serve well chilled with fresh raw seafood or summer salads of tomatoes and corn. Super value. Real wine. Kono Sauvignon Blanc 2019, Marlborough, New Zealand $17.99 I 88/100 UPC: 9421003134010 Kono is a reliable, native producer of Kiwi Sauvignon from Marlborough. The attack is bright and fresh, laced with guava, passionfruit, and citrus. The style is fruit-driven, but the trick is halting the fermentation with a touch of residual sugar left to balance the palate and finish. Expect a bit of candied grapefruit in an otherwise mostly dry finish. Serve with a charcuterie plate or freshly steamed mussels - fine value in an introductory NZ Sauvignon Blanc. Cousino Macul Antiguas Reservas Cabernet Sauvignon 2016, Valle del Maipo, Region del Valle Central, Chile $17.99 88/100 UPC: 089046666630 The wine has a long, storied history as Reserva Antiguas, although I would argue its best wines have come in the last decade. 2016 is another good effort that subdues the classic Chilean boldo notes in favour of more balanced bay leaf, cassis, black cherry, spice, and a touch of light chocolate. Cleaner and fresher, it's in a better position to tell the story of Maipo. Good value. Domaine de L'Olivette Red Merlot - Syrah - Grenache 2019, Corbieres, Languedoc, South of France, France $16.99 88/100 UPC: 3356201014009 Wow, this is a lot of wine for $17. Fresh. Ripe black cherries and licorice are dusted in poultry spice, with round soft tannins that run through the savoury (garrigue) finish. It's so juicy and drinkable you will see the bottle drained before all others at the barbecue, so you better take two and hide your backup bottle. Ready to drink and will work with a variety of grilled barbecue meats and poultry. The property and wine have been certified organic since 1990 - back up the truck. Rodney Strong Cabernet Sauvignon 2017, Sonoma County, California, United States $26.99 I 89/100 UPC: 087512912359 Rodney Strong planted his first Cabernet Sauvignon in 1971, Alexander's Crown, on a small hill in Jimtown. Today the fruit comes off three vineyards, from Jimtown to Geyserville and all the way north to Cloverdale. The soils are a mix of well-drained alluvial, volcanic, and uplifted shale/sandstone soils that Cabernet seems to love. 2017 is an impressive, straight up Cabernet Sauvignon with fresh plummy, violet fruit, a dash of spice, and a dry finish. A perfect pour for those looking to grasp the style of a balanced California Cabernet. Grilled steak is the call, but vegetarians could serve this with grilled root vegetables. Randy Shore's take on the classic shrimp and grits. Shrimp and cheesy grits This Shrimp and Grits recipe is an easy take on a restaurant standard of the American South. Randy Shore borrows the complexity of an etouffe and combines it with the peppery profile of Cajun crawfish. If you don't have Cajun seasoning, mix a little cayenne pepper with some Old Bay. Bob's Red Mill Corn Grits are the most authentic grind of corn on Canadian supermarket shelves. Shrimp and Grits The Grits 1/2 cup cream 2 cups low sodium chicken stock 1/2 cup coarse grits  1/2  tsp Cajun seasoning Salt and pepper 1 cup grated cheddar cheese The Shrimp 12 very large prawns 1 tsp Cajun seasoning Salt and pepper 1 tbsp canola oil 4 oz Andouille or farmer sausage, diced 1 garlic clove, minced 1/2 red or green bell pepper, diced 3 green onions, chopped 1 tbsp flour 1 cup chicken stock 1 tsp red pepper sauce In a saucepan over medium heat, bring cream and stock to a simmer. Whisk in the grits, lower heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Season with Cajun spice and a pinch of salt and pepper. If the grits get too thick, whisk in a little water. Cook until tender, about 25 to 30 minutes or according to package directions. Whisk in cheddar cheese and do a final adjustment to the thickness of the grits with water. They should be loose and creamy. Taste and season with salt, if desired. Meanwhile, season prawns with Cajun spice, salt, and pepper. In a wide pan on medium heat, warm oil. Sear the shrimp for about 1 minute on each side, remove and set aside. Add the sausage and stir until lightly browned and their oil begins to come out. Add garlic, peppers and all but 1 tbsp of the green onions. Lower heat and cook until softened. Stir in flour and cook for about 1 minute. Add the stock and stir quickly so no lumps form. Whisk in chicken stock and cook until thickened, about 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in prawns and let them heat through, 1 to 2 minutes. Drizzle on red pepper sauce. Serve over grits and garnish with green onion. Makes 2 meal-sized servings or 4 first courses. Recipe match Shrimp and Grits with some bite call for a richer white and viognier is the tonic here. Road 13 Viognier 2018, Similkameen Valley, British Columbia $25.99 Apricots and nectarine flavours in a fresh and lively will easily tame this spicy dish. Play Starring Viognier 2019, Okanagan Valley, British Columbia $24 A dry, nectarine skin, apricot, and orange flavoured viognier is for food and should elevate the classic shrimp and grits plate."}, {"title": "Alberta farmers join coalition calling for feds to shore up food supply in wake of COVID-19", "article": "Alberta farmers have joined a national coalition of producers calling for the federal government to help producers improve their climate resiliency after COVID-19 impacted national food supply. The Farmers for Climate Solutions (FCS) is calling on federal policymakers to incentivize farmers to turn their farms into green energy powerhouses and provide incentives for climate-friendly farming. They are also calling for help turning farmers into mentors and increased supports for new and young farmers. They also want to see farmers who reduce their climate risk rewarded. Brenda Barritt, a rancher who operates Earth Work Farms near Alix, said FCS wants policymakers to help producers turn their land into climate solutions instead of carbon producers. \"I really want to see programs in place that really just help us invest in those practices that give us longterm benefits and then even help us out economically,\" said Barritt. Barritt said producers don't want government handouts that dictate what changes they make on their farms. Instead, she said they need incentives that will help farmers implement practices that create a healthy future and improve their bottom line. \"So no-till cropping, I understand you get carbon credits for that. That's excellent because that's a nudge forward, but when we convert tilled land back into grassland pasture, right now, as far as I understand, there's no carbon credit for that,\" said Barritt. \"How do we start to not only think of our carbon credit system around agriculture about doing less bad, but also incentivize be part of the solution?\" The calls come as the government looks towards an economic recovery plan in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. FCS is lobbying the government to keep food producers in mind as they build that plan. The pandemic hit Alberta's food supply line particularly hard as outbreaks at the Cargill slaughterhouse in High River and the JBS food processing plant in Brooks led to thousands of cases. The Cargill plant, that has been linked to 1,500 cases, was forced to close for weeks before reopening with additional safety measures. Barritt said governments need to build up medium and small scale producers so the supply line doesn't remain so heavily centralized. \"What we saw was an increased demand for our product, but the infrastructure was missing around the medium sized and small abattoirs,\" said Barritt. \"I truly believe a resilient economy is built on local medium sized and large scale. So there's room for all of us.\" James Watson, a spokesman for Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, said farmers are stewards of the land and are on the front lines of climate change. He said the federal government is committed to helping producers become more climate resilient. \"The $3 billion federal, provincial and territorial Canadian Agricultural Partnership offers on-farm programs that will help farmers capitalize on opportunities for sustainable growth by adopting precision agriculture technologies, tools, and practices that help reduce GHG emissions and store even more carbon in the soil - all while increasing overall production,\" said Watson. dshort@posmtedia.com twitter.com/dylanshort_ Postmedia Network"}, {"title": "Raven Industries Inc Virtual Investor Day - Final", "article": "Presentation STEVEN E. BRAZONES, VP, CFO & TREASURER, RAVEN INDUSTRIES, INC.: Good morning, and welcome to today's virtual Investor Relations event. I am Steven Brazones, Raven's Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and I'm pleased to be with you today. Today, we have a great event in store for you. We are going to be highlighting our 3 strategic platforms for growth. First, you're going to hear about Raven Thunderhead Balloon systems. Next, you're going to hear about Raven Composites. And we're going to end the event with a long presentation on Raven Autonomy. Joining me today will be Raven's President and CEO, Dan Rykhus; Raven Aerostar's Division Vice President, Scott Wickersham; Raven's Executive Director of Corporate Development, Lon Stroschein; and Raven's Executive Director of Autonomy, Wade Robey. The format for today will be about a 60-minute presentation with videos and presenters, followed by a 30-minute Q&A session. Q&A on this event will be held through our platform. If you have a question, please go to the top of the screen and type that in. At the end of the session, we will have a quick changeover, and then we will answer your questions. From a housekeeping standpoint, today's presentation will include forward-looking statements. And as a result, actual results may differ. With that, I'm going to turn the platform over to Dan. DANIEL A. RYKHUS, PRESIDENT, CEO & DIRECTOR, RAVEN INDUSTRIES, INC.: Steven, thank you. And welcome. Thanks, everybody, for joining us today. And we're thrilled to be able to explain our growth strategy to you in more detail. And as you'll see, we're very excited about the opportunities before us. So I've been with Raven for 30 years now. And I can tell you the work that we've done over the last 10 years to prepare the company for today and these growth platforms sets us in a place that I've never seen before. The markets that we're serving are entering transformational stages and the technology that we bring to the marketplace in each of these markets that you will hear about is setting us up for great success. These are unprecedented times at Raven. First, I want to talk about Raven Autonomy. Over the last year, we've spent and invested $100 million in this initiative, and we intend to invest another $250 million in Raven Autonomy going forward. And that's an indication of how strongly we feel about the position we have in this marketplace and the opportunity to really build the ag technology and equipment company for the future. And that's what we'll be doing over the next several years. We expect that, that initiative will deliver at least $300 million in annual revenue within 5 years, leading to $1 billion in annual revenue over the following 5 years. Raven Composites is an initiative which leverages our thin film with high-value properties with rigid composites. And that's what's unique about this initiative. It's our opportunity to move beyond our strong position in thin films and move into the combination of those films with rigid composites to serve transportation, recreation, construction and other markets along the way with very unique value propositions. And finally, Raven Aerostar has been added for several years now, building the Thunderhead Balloon platform system, integrating different sensor technologies to deliver communication and surveillance capabilities at the stratosphere. We're the clear market leader in this emerging market and growing market today. We've earned that position, and we hold it. And this is a market that we believe will continue to grow substantially. And I look forward to Scott telling you a lot more detail about that. So as you can see, I could go on and on this morning about a lot of detail on each of these growth initiatives. But as Steven said, we're going to share the podium today with some of the people from our team, some of the executive leaders who are making all this happen and give you that opportunity to hear from them directly. So with that, I'm going to hand it over to Scott Wickersham and invite him up here. SCOTT W. WICKERSHAM, DIVISION VP OF RAVEN AEROSTAR, RAVEN INDUSTRIES, INC.: Thanks, Dan. Good morning, everybody. As Dan said, I'm Scott Wickersham, Division Vice President for Raven Aerostar. So Raven started nearly 60 years ago or over 60 years ago as a stratospheric balloon company. And during the last 60 years, as we have been the leader in that market and developing new technologies and capabilities to continue to support that market. For about the last 30 years, it's been a pretty small market. It's been mostly focused on science and research. But about 10 years ago, we started doing some investments and created technology that is putting us in position to deliver new capabilities in a new and emerging market. I'm going to turn it to a video here of Jim Nelson, who is Raven Aerostar's Director of Engineering, and he's going to explain some of the -- a little bit about Thunderhead in this emerging market. JIM NELSON, DIRECTOR OF ENGINEERING, RAVEN INDUSTRIES, INC.: My name is Jim Nelson. I'm the Director of Engineering for Raven Aerostar, and I'm responsible for all the engineering and flight operations activities for our stratospheric balloons and radar systems. Thunderhead is our stratospheric balloon platform. The stratosphere is a unique opportunity to provide a capability where you can have the tactical capability to get over an area like an aircraft, but the persistence to stay over that area for a long period of time at a high altitude just like a spacecraft. So it's a little of the best of both forms. The stratosphere provides a unique platform where you can take a balloon up to 65,000 to 70,000 to 100,000 feet and maintain coverage over an area. You can provide intelligence, surveillance for connaissance. A stratospheric balloon for a fraction of the cost of the spacecraft can get capabilities that are near what you can do with a satellite with a much lower cost. And that's why the Department of Defense and others are really excited to use our capability. We're in the hundreds of millions of dollars of potential market for the Department of Defense alone. Balloon technology has been around for 100 years or more. However, the capability to use it in the military environment is new. There isn't the manual to go look at. This is blazing new ground, using a mixture of old capabilities and new technologies to provide a new market and new systems, new capabilities. Over the last 4 years, we've done over 350 flight campaigns, testing out capabilities that gauges the interest of a number of different users of our technology. We've been able to demonstrate this capability can be used in an operational environment, and we've gotten a lot of excitement from a number of different customers who want to use this as a primary capability in their force. This starts with working with the customer of what is their situation? What is their mission? It's working with them to decide what payloads will be flying. And we will work with them to define a plan, deliver all of the systems, bring our flight operations team to identify the right launch location and back at our command and control center, and we can pilot them individually with a combination of some artificial intelligence and machine learning for automated navigation of the balloons. They communicate with one another. When we need to bring them down, we can command a termination. And we will go out and recover those balloons. Back in the 2010 time frame, we're launching balloons that are lasting days. Now we can have a balloon that will last over 300 days. So we provide a capability that no one else can touch, and we're not done yet. Thunderhead Balloon system directly aligns with our purpose to connect, protect and save lives. SCOTT W. WICKERSHAM: All right. Jim did a great job of explaining the information around Thunderhead and also giving you a little bit of a unique view of the world that we operate in. So I'm going to take a little bit here and talk about how Thunderhead works and what makes it unique. So again, balloons have been around for a long, long time. And traditionally, what happens, you fill a balloon, you launch it, it goes to an altitude. And then obviously, it goes in the directions that the winds are taking it. So the ability to change altitudes and find winds that are going in different directions, that's what Thunderhead offers. And with that, we have the ability to navigate balloons. If you look at the graphic on the lower left, you'll see this is the life cycle of a balloon. It goes up. We navigate it to an area of interest. Then while we're in the area of interest, we navigate it to stay there for as long as we'd like it to, navigate out of that and then recover it in an area that we designate. Up on the right, you'll see an animation of how our Thunderhead Balloon systems work. And you can see how they can work in combination with other Thunderhead Balloon systems to make sure that we are providing persistent coverage in areas of interest or covering an area that may be underserved by existing technology. So why does this matter? And I'm just going to pick one example here that I think we can all relate with pretty easily, if we pay attention to the news. So our -- over the last 50 years plus, we have invested so much within our Department of Defense around space and the infrastructure around space. And in the last 10 years, there's been some real emerging threats around our -- with our adversaries around our satellite technology in space. So we've been the dominant player in space for decades. And our infrastructure that's built around that is under threat. So Thunderhead provides an opportunity to augment that or provide some resiliency around the capabilities that are provided with that. So imagine waking up in a world to where there is no GPS. The ability for our Thunderhead Balloon systems to augment that is extremely interesting to the Department of Defense. You can imagine the amount of investments they'll put to put some resiliency in the satellite capabilities that we have today. So now if you think in a bigger picture, within just the Department of Defense, there are all sorts of other capabilities from intelligence gathering, surveillance, communications, P&T, the list is far and wide. We have flown dozens of different payloads that provide different capabilities, and the Department of Defense is really excited about that. So if you look at where we are at with this. On the right, you'll see a graph. And you can see an exponential climb in the number of flights that we have been doing on an annual basis. This graph goes back to 2017. We really started doing flights for the government back in 2015, and it really started out as a situation where it was met with a lot of skepticism. And over the last 5 years, we have continued to demonstrate capability that this has gone from an area of skepticism to an area of belief that this provides a capability that our Department of Defense needs. They are investing in tests and demonstrations currently at a really significant level, and we can see a path to this becoming an operational capability within our Department of Defense. We're really excited about that. If you think about all of the investments that exist in satellites and aircraft today, it's billions. And the ability to augment or replace that capability with a lower cost solution is very, very attractive. The government right now is funding us at a test and demonstration level, and they have mapped out with us a path for this to become a Department of Defense operational capability. We're really excited about that. And I think the market opportunity that as it expands beyond the Department of Defense is much, much bigger as well. So that's our Thunderhead Balloon systems. I'm going to turn it now to Lon Stroschein, and he's going to talk about Raven Composites. Thank you. LON E. STROSCHEIN, DIRECTOR OF CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT, RAVEN INDUSTRIES, INC.: Thank you, Scott. My name is Lon Stroschein. I serve as the Executive Director of Corporate Development at Raven. And I'm going to talk to you today about Raven Composites. There's a sign we see every day when we walk into work at EFD, and the sign just says thinner, lighter, stronger. Because it defines who we are, how we compete, how we win business, how we win customers, how we take care of our customers and how we drive the margins that we're able to drive in our division. And it's something that we are very, very proud of. We focus on high-performance, high-value, multilayer wide goods. And to some, that sounds sort of generic. But for us, it's how we make our living every day. And it's how we grow our revenues and drive profitability for ourselves and take care of our customers in their needs. Over the last -- since COVID, actually, I've been spending a lot more time in EFD, really trying to immerse myself in the strategy, in the composite strategy and learning a lot more about what it is that makes us who we are. And the thing that I've come up with as kind of an outsider is that Raven shows up when the product can't fail. And it almost doesn't matter what it is. It can be a grain cover, covering millions of dollars of assets for farmers from coast to coast. It can be pond liners and tank liners, protecting natural resources. It can be a whole myriad of things, but we get the call when the product can't fail. And we show up and we arrive and we do the job very, very well. And it's something that we take very seriously. And over the decades that we've been in this marketplace, we built expertise in wide width, reinforce multilayer materials. And I felt it was necessary to remind you of what our strategy is and has been and how we've been successful. I'm going to play a little video now by Joe Beck. Joe Beck is the Composites Business Director for Raven EFD. And he's going to walk you through just a little bit about composites and what they are and how we envision using them in our products. JOE BECK, BUSINESS DIRECTOR OF COMPOSITES - RAVEN ENGINEERED FILMS, RAVEN INDUSTRIES, INC.: My name is Joe Beck, and I'm a Raven Business Director for Engineered Films Division, running our Composite strategy. There is a gap in the market today on what surface films are being used. There's really not a lot of highly engineered, high-value surface films being applied to composites today. We see this as a big opportunity. We've been making flexible composites for a long time. So we've been laminating our sheets of film to other sheets of film that we produce and selling them to customers. Raven Composites is our surface films laminated onto rigid structure that we will be selling into the market. Our composite product offering will be consisted of a few basic materials. On the outside, it will be our surface film. Directly adjacent to that outer layer will be the rigid component. That will be a fiber-reinforced thermoplastic material that we will produce. And then the interlayer is the core material, and that can be customized based on the very specific applications that our customers have. They don't have to apply these things after the fact. They'll be integrated into one single product that our customers can take and use. Weight is so critical. And so our products are going to enable them to do more with less. LON E. STROSCHEIN: So Joe does a nice job kind of walking through what composites is. And on the slide that you see now, you can see the composites in the center. And you can see all the other layers are the films that we already provide for composites today. So I thought we'd start out really quickly, just reminding you, in November, we talked about this bold strategy to move into composites. And we thought it would be nice to just give you a little bit of update of what's happened since that time. And we started -- at that time, we had a nice pipeline of acquisitions that we were working with. We also had a number of infrastructure and facility upgrades that we were working on at the time and then COVID came along. And we said very strategically and very thoughtfully. Look, for the time being, let's just put a pause on a couple of these things. But more recently, in the last 30 days, we've decided that now is the time to actually not take a pause and to lean forward and move out and get active on all of these fronts all over again. So maybe the headline here is nothing's changed from a strategy that we announced in November. So I want to talk about composites and wide composites. I mentioned earlier that we compete in high-value laminated multilayer reinforced goods. And we've got a history of investing in these areas. And we invest through our facilities. We invest through our lines. We invest through the expertise that we bring in the house. And we believe that it's this element and this formulation that helps us compete on thinner, lighter, stronger materials that help our customers achieve what they need to achieve at the end of the day. I also want to talk about our expansion, which feels like an expansion into Raven Composites, but I felt like I need to take this opportunity to tell you that this isn't an expansion from where we sit. Composites isn't something new to us. In fact, 40% of our revenue in Engineered Films is from a composite product. It's a soft composite with a string material inside of it, but a composite, nonetheless, a strength member inside of it. And we are very comfortable with selling, promoting, manufacturing, fabricating and providing these products into the marketplace. And the second is surface films. We provide surface films, the outer layers that you see when you see a composite to the market today. So from our standpoint, when we look at this strategy, it's bold from an investment standpoint, not as bold from a big risk, big jump into a market that we don't understand what we're doing. So when you think of composites, we think of composites and how we want to compete as an opportunity for us to use our product anywhere you see plywood with an outer surface or Lauan with an outer surface. And those are the places we want to move into. And we think -- we envision near-term opportunities in industrial markets with trucks and RVs and the long-term opportunity is in ag, construction, geo and potentially automotive in the out years. And our market opportunities are continuously expanding, and we're excited about what we're doing. The global market for composites is substantial. We think just the markets we serve today and the customers that we have and have been engaged with are going to increase our addressable market by 5x our films market. And that is exciting to us. There's a utility for composites in each of the markets we serve, and we're starting to have those conversations with existing customers on how our composites or composite strategy can help them do their job better. So I'm going to talk a little bit about why we're excited. And without a doubt, this strategy to invest in composites, leverages our endowment. The investments we've made over the last 10, 20 and 30 years in Engineered Films are ready for this moment and are ready to take our technology into composites. And we know we can solve this challenge. We've got a history of success in surface films, and we've got a history of success in soft composites. And it builds upon our mantra of thinner, lighter and stronger. Our endowment has made us ready, and we are really excited to just get going. So last thing I want to say is that when COVID happened, it was our -- every company's strategy is ultimate stress test. And that the true can be said for composites. But when we came out the other side, in the middle of COVID, we realized that our strategy for composites had never been more in demand than it was in -- during COVID. So we are excited to get back in, get investing. And we're in the process now of bringing an equipment, creating facilities. We are hiring individuals, and we're strengthening our strategic relationships and partnerships with companies. And we're in advanced R&D stages with many of them to start providing composite solutions later this year. So with that, I'm going to conclude Raven Composites, and I'm going to introduce Wade Robey who's the Executive Director of Raven Autonomy to walk you through that strategy. Thank you. WADE ROBEY, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF RAVEN AUTONOMY, RAVEN INDUSTRIES, INC.: Thank you, Lon. Good morning, everyone. As Lon said, my name is Wade Robey and I'm -- I have the unique opportunity to serve Raven as Executive Director of Raven Autonomy. As I thought about my remarks this morning, it's hard not to think about -- think back over your career and what you've been involved in over the course of that time. And I've had the very great opportunity to be part of animal nutrition and biotech and even renewable fuels. And as I thought about my remarks this morning, what struck me was that I would -- there's no place I'd rather be than where I am today. Although all those technologies brought great innovation to ag, we believe Raven Autonomy will take it to even a new level of opportunity of productivity and a value to the farming community. So very exciting to be part of Raven Autonomy and what I'll share with you today, hopefully, will lay out that vision for you for the future. So as I start my remarks this morning, what I'd like you to do is imagine a world where all the core elements of ag are connected, they're coordinated and they're optimized. And optimized is an important word in that sentence. Today, a lot of the activities on farm are discrete. But with autonomy will come the opportunity to bring all those together and really drive efficiency in a way that really hasn't been possible before. As a result of that, we'll reduce labor requirements. Safety will be increased. And farmers and ag retailers will realize even greater efficiency and productivity than what they've been able to do before, all of that will lead to more value per acre and a better resolution for the farming operation. So the future is here today with autonomy. Raven Autonomy is a bold new strategic platform for growth that we're bringing forward. And what I'm going to share with you this morning is how Raven Autonomy will tie all those elements together and really lay out the pathway for that future. I'd like to start with the vision for Raven Autonomy since we are a new strategic platform for growth. I think it's important to start with what our key vision is and where we want to take this opportunity in ag. And that is to be the global leader for the development and commercialization of the enabling technologies and vehicles necessary to accelerate the adoption and use of autonomous operations in precision agriculture, to improve productivity and efficiency and mitigate labor constraints. I know that's a lot of words, but there's a couple of key elements of that vision that I'd like to highlight here first for you this morning. First, playing on the legacy of what we have been doing for the last 4 decades in precision agriculture. Raven will be both in the development and the commercialization of these solutions and technologies. Today, we go to the market through our OEM partnerships and to the aftermarket. We're going to continue that in the future. And we'll be bringing both discrete technologies, technology stacks and prime movers forward to the market. So in the second slide here -- or second bullet, that includes both the enabling technologies and the vehicles, as I said. With the acquisition of DOT, Raven is a machine platform OEM. So not only selling our technologies to go on prime movers, we'll bring prime movers to the market for use. That includes the DOT platform today, but also new prime movers in the future. All of that ties together to bring and deliver sustained value to our customers. We'll increase productivity, as I mentioned. We'll increase efficiency. We'll reduce labor. But the focus will be on sustainability and overall value on farm. All of those will be delivered by Raven Autonomy. So why are we doing this? We have, again, a long legacy and history in precision agriculture. Why are we making this new investment for this strategic platform? Well, the reason is the challenge for the future persists. How do we feed a hungry world? That has been the challenge for many, many years. And Raven Autonomy will help deliver against that challenge. What I'm going to show you here in the 2 sections of this slide are 2 very well-known concepts. First, the population is dramatically increasing. This has been going on for many, many years now. And the demographics are shifting as well, as you can see on the left side of this chart. People continue to move off farm. They move to the urban areas. And on the left side, you see, it's even more significant in the underdeveloped portions of the world. As those areas come up in affluence, this becomes a critical challenge to deliver protein and calories to that population. They simply want to eat better as their life improves. And today, agriculture is not in a good position to deliver on that challenge. On the right side of this chart, you see that the number of farms continue to decrease as we see consolidation. As a result, average farm size increases, which heightens the need for productivity on farm. And a very important part of this chart is that the overall land available for agriculture is not increasing. This means productivity absolutely has to increase. It's the only way we'll meet the challenge of the future. And what I'll tell you this morning is that autonomy is going to allow us to deliver on that need. So as we look back at precision ag over the last few decades, we've been very fortunate. Precision ag through a variety of technologies has had dramatic improvements on productivity. We've seen significant reductions in fertilizer use, herbicide use and pesticides, that's resulted in improved efficiency on farm and reductions in fossil fuels, making the overall farm more sustainable. In addition, we've seen reductions in water use. All of these are very excellent, but we're reaching a bit of a plateau. Biotech has almost been fully realized in terms of the benefits that it's showing. And there needs to be additional productivity gains that we can bring to our farmers, to our ag retailers. Autonomy is going to allow us to do that. We'll see significant gains in productivity that will leverage what we've seen to date with Precision Ag technologies. We'll also see reductions in all these key inputs that will not only improve the sustainability of farming, it will improve the economic value of what's delivered per acre. Productivity will increase. Costs will go down. Overall, efficiency will increase. Now how can we make that happen? Well, one of the ways autonomy will bring this will be through the coordination, the ability to optimize the overall ag solution in a way we've never been able to do it before. So as you look at this chart and you think about how an ag operation needs to be executed, whether it's planning the mission, connecting all the equipment that needs to be part of the equation, coordinating the applications and then recovering the data and analyzing how we do, all those aspects will be better coordinated and optimized with autonomy. It will extend digital ag and all the technologies we're starting to see enter the industry today. As a result of this, every aspect of the application, whether it be tilling or seeding, spreading, spraying, harvesting, again, they'll all be connected. They'll be coordinated. We'll be able to optimize them in ways we haven't been able to do previously. That means real value will be delivered. There'll be fewer trips across the farm field because the operations will be more choreographed and coordinated. We'll see reduced fuel consumption. That will also cause more limited soil compaction from those fewer trips. And really importantly, on this slide, because autonomy will allow us to become more efficient and more precise in what we do, all the different elements of seeding and fertilizer application, chemical use will become more optimized. We'll see less crop damage. We'll see improved yield, all of those things will add value to the proposition for the farmer. We'll also have better regulatory compliance. Being able to control all of these elements in a more prescribed way, running those in a way that are optimized, we'll see applications on farm fitting more closely within what's required by regulatory and by rule. In addition, that will create a chain of custody around these applications and our ability to validate what was actually applied on farm. And then finally, not least, but finally, I'll mention here that labor will be reduced. We see autonomy as really dramatically reducing labor requirements and improving the applications that occur with the labor that we have. But I wanted to stress here that it's only one element of the full value proposition. All these other elements on this slide will really help drive the value that farmers will see. So why Raven? Why is Raven best positioned to bring this platform forward into invest in autonomy? Well, as I've mentioned, we have decades of experience in precision ag, over 42 years now. We know the market. We work closely with our OEM partners. And we also go-to-market in the aftermarket, working with dealers and direct customers, large enterprise farms. So we have that connection to the market and awareness of what our customer needs. We also have a very long history of class-leading innovations. All of our platforms are world-class leading, whether it's communication, guidance and steering, field computers, all the different technologies we bring forward that are part of our portfolio are recognized in the market as bringing true differentiating value. This really puts Raven in the position. It provides us the endowment to bring autonomy forward. So that's what I'll move to next. As you see this pyramid, this is how we think about going to market. We bring world-class hardware together. We bring software, operating systems, embedded softwares, software to make that hardware work in a real differentiating and value proposition way. We layer on top of that services and support, which give our customers the assurance that our products will work in the field every time and provide the value that they really need. So in summary, as we look at autonomy and as we think about why we came forward with this initiative, with this new platform, we're really building on all these different elements you see here on this chart. The information and management, logistics that Raven has invested in, our field computers in control technology, guidance and steering. The control and value we bring out on to the implement, whether it's application control, rate control, boom control. All of these elements coalescent are necessary for autonomy to work, whether it's semiautonomy or full autonomy. Without this endowment, without these platforms, Raven could not be as competitive as will be. And this will provide the real differentiating value that Raven will have in the marketplace. So now I -- hopefully, what I've shared with you so far in this presentation is that there is a tremendous challenge out there. We have to improve productivity to meet the challenge of agriculture. Raven has the technology, the history to bring this platform forward, and we're well positioned to do so. Now what I'd like to do is shift and have 2 of our leaders in the Applied Technology division tell you a little bit more about some of the key component technologies that will be part of what we bring forward with autonomy. The first will be Sarah Waltner, who's our General Manager. She's going to talk about Slingshot, which is our communication, data transfer technology that has now been married with AgSync, a recent acquisition that brings logistics an overall enterprise coordination of on-field operations. She'll walk you through that and explain to you how this fits not only within our current portfolio, but how it will tie in with autonomy. Next, you'll hear from Luke Pucket. Luke is one of our leading engineers in Applied Technology. Luke has been part of the development of a technology we call VSN, or visual-based guidance system. VSN allows an ag retailer or a farmer to drive autonomous -- or drive equipment down a field without GPS guidance and not have to steer. It allows the machine to follow the row using both camera and radar-based technology to really improve the application and the ease at which we make chemical and fertilizer applications. This allows ag retailers, farmers to do more acres per day and do it with less crop damage and they're resulted with better yield. So now I'm going to turn it over to Sarah and Luke, and let them talk to you about these technologies. SARAH WALTNER, GENERAL MANAGER FOR RAVEN APPLIED TECHNOLOGY, RAVEN INDUSTRIES, INC.: I'm Sarah Waltner, I'm the General Manager for Applied Technology Division. I've been with Raven about 18 years, and I'm responsible for our international business units, our Slingshot data and logistics and connectivity platform as well as overall division guidance and strategy. Slingshot started over 10 years ago when Raven acquired a company, and then we have built on it solidly since then. It started as providing GPS and RTK-based signals. Two years ago, we invested in a big way with an acquisition of AgSync. And since then, we've been using that acquisition, along with everything else we've invested in to really shore up our logistics platform. We were already dominant in the cab, and now what enables us to be dominant in the office. It enables a logistic efficiency every step of the way, eliminating human error as part of that efficiency. And there were so many cases where our customers would spend hours and lose lots of money either in downtime or in improper reporting that would prevent them from being able to build their customer thousands and thousands of dollars. And so that whole value chain from beginning to end really enables us now to look at providing a broader solution set for our customers. So Slingshot has been enabling some core things for our customers for years now, remote software update. You can do that on the fly, over the air, in the middle of the field. Let's say you need technical help. Our technical team can remote into your interface and really see what's actually going on. That is huge. We also have a lot of instances where more than one sprayer or other type of platform is in the field. And Slingshot enables those devices and those machinery to be talking together as well as being seen in real-time by the office. You know where all your fleet is at all times. You know the jobs that they're in at all times. You know that they're applying the right things in the right way. And really, that's incredibly important because you are dealing with crops that don't just get an easy redo. When you think about how farming is done and will be done in the future, connectivity, knowing where your machines are, being able to track the work that is done, the work that is needing to be done, scheduling that out, being able to report it, all of those things are important today that become incredibly more important as we move toward autonomy. All those pieces are pieces we have today. We have fleet tracking that tells a manager where every single piece of their equipment is. We have machine-to-machine communication that is best-in-class that is used to date with multiple machines in the field. We have a core backbone that we've had for over 10 years in remote support, in software updates, in field communication. And we've got all the reporting that is needed right now to make sure that you're closing that loop from planning, execution and reporting. So as we look at the future and the reason we're investing in autonomy, the reason why Slingshot is so important is we are really trying to solve a few basic things. And we are trying to help solve feeding the world and keeping agricultural profitable through the way. We have a best-in-class solution. We have the complete pieces to the puzzle. And we are paving the way, and we'll continue to be a market leader in autonomy, solving those fundamental issues that happen throughout the world in ag that are really important. LUKE PUCKET, ENGINEERING TEAM LEAD, RAVEN INDUSTRIES, INC.: My name is Luke Pucket. I'm Mechanical Design Engineer here at Raven Industries. I've worked in our guidance and steering products for about the past 7 years. VSN is our visual guidance system. So it's a camera-based system that looks at crop rows, distinguishes what is crop in those crop rows and guides the machine. So it provides hands-free guidance for agricultural machines. A few years ago, we released RS1, which is a steering controller for agricultural machines. That enables you to steer on fields that do not have any crop rows. So I can use that in the beginning, in the spring, I can then use that in the fall. Once you have crop rows, you are no longer able to use GPS steering because it's not accurate enough in order to keep your machines in crop row and prevent you from running over crop. That's where VSN comes into the equation. VSN, since it is not based off of GPS, it's completely based off your camera. It looks at the crop rows and feeds guidance and steering messages into the RS1, which steers your machine. To put it in perspective, you have an operator that has to go and drive a 27,000 pound machine with booms that stick out 120 feet through crop that's planted anywhere from 20 inches all the way up to 60 inches. So you're driving this machine for 12 to 16 hours a day. That is extremely stressful. VSN completely takes that stress away from the operator. They're able to focus on the machine, and they're able to focus on applying that product. They're no longer focusing on steering that machine down the crop rows. And VSN is a game-changer that way. Why is VSN important to a customer? What are the returns to the customer? You can look at it from a couple of different aspects. So there's the operator who's actually using VSN. It reduces the stress that, that operator is under. Imagine trying to drive 15 miles an hour all day, keeping your machines centered in crop rows. Some farmers like to ride along with the operator. So I now have my boss's boss sitting right next to me in the cab. Talk about even more stress. And I have to do this for 12 to 16 hours a day, day in and day out. What you hear from the operators is, I get to the end of the day, and I'm just shocked. What's exciting is you talk to guys who have used VSN, they go, I get down at the end of the day, and I feel great. You do the flip side of that, guys who want to take on more acres. They're custom guys. They say, now I can make more money. My machine is running through more acres every single day because of VSN. You also have the co-op. The co-op now has an operator who's happy to do their job. You have employees that are engaged and are focusing on the machine, keeping the machine safe. You're covering more acres. You're making more money as a co-op. Our final customer, the farmer who's field your spring. The more accurate I am, the less crop damage I have. So not only are you improving the lives of the people that are running it, you're also improving the profit margins of the fields that you go through. That is really exciting. We've been out. We've talked to different operators. We say, where's the value of VSN? What value does it provide to you? And they give you stories. Last year, we had a new operator who wasn't as experienced. And they caused $20,000 worth of crop damages. These are real numbers we've heard from guys. You take me, you put me in the seat. I'm comfortable going about 5 miles an hour, and I'm still running over crop. VSN, you put a VSN camera on there. You're going 15, 20 miles an hour, and the crop damage is nothing. It's guiding your machine where you want it to be. The VSN road map over the next 5 years. Right now, the camera-based solution works when you can see crop and you can see some field. Once the drop gets to a full canopy stage, VSN does not work any longer. So we needed to come out with another solution. We now have that solution. We have radar technology that mounts inside the RIMS. And you have radar beams that are shot out, distinguishes those crop rows, and you can steer off that radar technology. So now you have a system with VSN that can steer from 4-inch tall crop, all the way up to full canopy. And as you're sitting in the cab, I don't know if I'm steering off a GPS, if I'm steering off a vision, if I'm steering off a radar, the steering is so smooth and the performance is virtually identical between the different solutions. What gets me really excited about the road map for Raven is autonomy is the goal. That's the ultimate goal. Raven combines all the pieces together are very good at each separate piece. They combine all together, and you have an autonomous project. That's awesome. LON E. STROSCHEIN: As I was watching those videos over the last few minutes, you couldn't see me, I was off camera, but I was just smiling. And it's hard to watch Luke and Sarah describe those technologies and what they mean to our customers without feeling a real sense of excitement. I've had the opportunity to work with both of these individuals for the last 4 years during my time with Raven. And I've got to see these technologies be developed us through our engineering team. And it's been really outstanding. I mean these guys have done such a great job and have identified the needs of our customers and brought these technologies forward. Hopefully, what that gave you in those 2 presentations was a sense of what the underlying technologies are that Raven brings to the table as we launch this platform for autonomy. It's -- without Slingshot and the data connecting ability that we have through that platform and through AgSync, without technologies like VSN, which really are a step on semiautonomy towards full autonomy, we wouldn't be as successful with this platform as we know we will be. We're going to be able to bring all these platforms together in a way that no other company can and really create the kind of differentiating value that will make autonomy a reality for the future. So now I'm going to shift a little bit, and I'm going to talk about the -- why we made these investments. And I'll show you a few slides, which kind of walk us through where Raven was prior to our investments and where we'll be in the future. So as we looked at all the different steps or portions of an ag operation that need to be brought together to make it successful, we think about things on the left-hand side here, like field operations. What actually needs to get done? Moving to machine selection. What type of machine do I need to bring to the field? Is it a sprayer? Is it a tractor? What sort of mission do I need to run? Am I seeding? Am I spraying? Am I adding nutrients? Then the overall operations. How do I execute those? How do I get the kind of application control necessary to really see the value proposition that precision ag allows? And then once it's complete, how do I gather that data, that information? How do I transfer that? How do I create the reports so that I can ultimately optimize this overall operation? Because if we look at all these individually or discretely, we can be excellent, an individual elements of the operation and really not get the true value that precision ag and ultimately, autonomy is going to bring, which allows all of these to be brought together and optimize in a way that has never been possible before. So as Raven looked at its core technology, and we've talked a little bit about that this morning, and I've shown you some of those elements, we were excellent in the equipment, the technology side that allows the mission to be executed. So whether it's application control, machine control, boom-leveling technologies, Raven was really strong in all of these technologies and brought class-leading solutions to the marketplace. With our Slingshot capability, we also were really good at report generation, being able to move data around and get the maximum value from what we were able to collect on field in terms of as-applied math and other references to what the application had been. But we knew there were some areas that we were frankly missing. So as we look forward, and we made the acquisition a little over a year ago with AgSync, it allowed us to improve dramatically our field operations. It complemented the equipment selection and allowed us to monitor those -- that equipment and track it in a much better way. And it certainly greatly enhanced our report-generation capability. So AgSync was that next step, which allowed us to really strengthen Slingshot, and that overall logistics platform that we've been building for over a decade now. With Smart Ag, we realized that there were certain elements that as we move to semiautonomy and full autonomy, we simply didn't have in our portfolio yet. Smart Ag was just a brilliant set of engineers in Ames, Iowa that had developed an AutoCart technology that would allow us to not only have a perception and obstacle avoidance system, but also allow an AutoCart to be automated with a harvesting operation. So we saw improvements in our mission-planning capability, certainly in mission execution. But really, they brought tremendous opportunity to us in our portfolio for optimization. There's a lot of activities in the ag operation that will have to happen in the cloud, but there's also a lot that will happen at the edge, onboard in the piece of agricultural equipment. AI and the opportunity to react to the environment and make decisions on the fly are going to be critically important, not only in full autonomy, but also semiautonomy in the next couple of years. Smart Ag brought that additional capability in AI and has been a great move forward for our platform. Next, we made first investment in DOT, and then an acquisition of DOT here just a month or 2 ago. And there were really great reasons for that. We have long-standing relationships with our OEM partners, as I've mentioned. But we didn't have a way to bring all of this together in a turnkey solution to the marketplace. So that gives us that prime mover. It allows us to accelerate autonomy into the marketplace and really allow the industry to reach a tipping point at a much faster pace. We also strengthened our mission planning and mission execution with DOT. In a moment, I'll talk to you about DOT in the various elements that it brings to the table for these missions that are run in the field. But when we look at this in total, now with our core technology, coupled with AgSync, with Smart Ag, with DOT, we really have the full solution that we can bring forward. This enables not only semiautonomy, but will enable autonomy in the future. This is why we made these investments over the last few years. There will be more technology that we're going to bring forward. There'll be more partnerships and acquisitions we'll make as autonomy evolves, but we're really now, we're very well positioned to bring autonomy into the market for the first time. Now I'm going to talk to you a little bit about Smart Ag and DOT specifically. I'll update you on those technologies. I'll show you some videos about how they perform in the field, and that will give you a better idea of what we're bringing forward now to the marketplace. So here you see an example of AutoCart in the field today. We happen to be harvesting oats in South Dakota. This film was actually shot a few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to be there. And it shows, as you see, a driverless tractor being called by a harvester and coming up to receive the load so that the harvester can continue operations. Now why is this important? And what did we bring into the portfolio when we acquired Smart Ag? Well, as I mentioned, we had just a tremendous set of engineers and data scientists in Ames that we are now part of our Raven ATD teams. So that was a tremendous move forward for our program. But they also had developed a world-class perception system, a system that detects obstacles and can allow the tractor to react. This is a critical need or a component for making the harvesting operation autonomous. So when the harvester is ready to unload its load, it calls the tractor. It comes up and approaches alongside. It's actually syncs with the harvester. So that's going to avoid the opportunity for accidents, for mistakes, for the opportunity for product to be lost during the transfer. And it really improves the efficiency of this overall operation. Once the load has been transferred to the grain cart, the carton then can peel away and go to a designated location for unloading. This means that the farmer can continue to operate the harvester, the combine and not have to stop and do this operation himself or herself or have other labor do this activity. This improves the efficiency of this operation and allows the harvester to really focus on the activity at hand. That will improve the harvesting process, allow it to be executed in a more timely in a rapid manner and just improve the overall efficiency of that operation. So how do we do that? Well, there's a range of technologies that we place on the tractor and the combine that enable AutoCart to work. Here you see a picture of the radar that's mounted on the front of the tractor. We also have camera systems. And you see our RS1 system on the roof of the tractor as well. That provides the processor and some of the guidance capability that AutoCart requires. So all of these technologies come together to provide an AutoCart solution that is truly autonomous for the farmer and really is our first offering into the marketplaces as Raven Autonomy. We'll be launching this product in the fall, in December of this year, and we're excited to bring it to the market. So now I'm going to shift and just to wrap up AutoCart. I'll go through a list of the key elements or attributes that AutoCart brings and kind of walk you through the value proposition that you just saw. So first, as I described, automating this part of the harvesting process allows for near continuous harvesting. This means that the farmer doesn't have to stop. If he doesn't have labor, get out, go get the tractor, bring it over, do the unloading process and have downtime. It also means that he doesn't have to have additional labor there to drive that tractor. So that allows for continuous harvesting. That translates into more uptime, as I mentioned, less downtime. And we find that there is an optimum time to plant, to till, to harvest and allows the farmer to execute the harvesting operation within that window. And that can become very critical when the maximum opportunity for yield is present. As I mentioned during the video, it eliminates the product loss that can occur during transfer. It prevents the risk of accidents because the tractor actually syncs with the harvester, and we can maintain the appropriate distance and then guide it away to the unloading spot. So this allows the operation to be performed in a much more safe manner. In time, we'll bring the opportunity or the additional technology to allow multiple carts to be coordinated with a single harvester or multiple grain carts to be connected to multiple harvesters. This means as the acreage increases, the leverage just gets larger and larger. That will create an overall efficiency to the operation that, again, has not been possible before. The bottom line of all that is that there'll be more efficiency on-farm during harvesting and more money in the farmer's pocket. So next, I'm going to talk a little bit about DOTs. So we'll show a video there, and then I'll walk you through the DOT value proposition as well. So here you see a video of the DOT. It's kind of a walk around of the platform. It's a U-shaped platform. Here, the technician is removing the side panels, showing you how it easy it is to access both the technology, but also the primary components of the DOT system, whether it be for working on the engine or doing just routine servicing. It's just a very convenient platform for the operator to work with. DOT has been a technology under development for a number of years now. Raven actually began its cooperation with DOT first under a joint development agreement before we made the investment. And then here, last November, we made the majority investment in DOT, and then finally, this past June, we made the final acquisition of this platform. Here you see it operate in the field as a single and as multiple seeders. We have multiple implements that work with that. You saw the seeder just a moment ago. This is an example of the grain cart that is manufactured by New Leader. New Leader is a partner of ours that develops this implement for DOT. It's a DOT-ready implement and allows nutrient amendment to the field in an automated way now. So this improves the efficiency and the timeliness of when nutrients can be provided, and it allows us to be run in an autonomous way on the DOT platform. The third implement we have is a sprayer that was developed by Patterson, you see it in the video here. What's interesting about the sprayer is that it already includes the whole raft of Raven technologies. Whether it's in our Hawkeye application control system, our AutoFold, our AutoBoom XRT boom leveling system, this sprayer is layered with Raven Technology that makes it the best automated sprayer in the world, really the only that can work with a platform like DOT today. All of these implements are necessary for the farming operation. It allows DOT to be useful across the whole course of the year. We're excited to have brought the DOT team on board. We're maintaining our engineering team up in Regina, and we're looking to expand our presence in not only Saskatchewan, but across Western Canada, where these important crops are grown. So we're excited about this acquisition, and it's a great part of the overall Raven Autonomy platform. The DOT is operated, as you see here by a path planning system, which allows the farmer to preplan the route through the field to make it optimum, to identify obstacles so that the DOT can execute the mission flawlessly. In the future, we're going to be bringing the perception system from Smart Ag on to DOT. This will allow DOT to operate in a truly fully autonomous mode and will allow it to detect obstacles and make decisions into the field as to how to proceed. So as we look now at the value proposition, let me run through that quickly and just highlight a couple of things you saw in the video. So DOT allows the improved operational consistency for seeding, spraying and spreading. It does that through a unique set of implements that I'll marry with the DOT and become one contiguous autonomous unit that operates in the field. Because of the autonomy that's provided and the opportunity to optimize the execution of the application, just like with AutoCart, we're going to see reduced input cost. In the case of DOT, we'll see improved crop quality and yield because, again, those executions will be done in an optimum way. We'll see reductions in fuel requirements and obviously, reductions in labor. All of these add to the proposition and add to the value of DOT. Just like with AutoCart, because we'll be automated and we'll have a perception system on DOT that allows it to avoid obstacles, we'll have the reduced potential for accidents. One of the important elements of autonomy is that autonomous operations will allow for 24/7 operation. We'll be able to operate around the clock doing whatever is necessary on-farm to execute the farming operation. This will absolutely improve efficiency. And as I said, there are specific windows when seeding needs to be done, when spraying needs to be done, and sometimes those are very time constrained. The ability to run around the clock with autonomy will allow the farmer, the ag retailer, to hit those windows in an optimum way. Again, that will improve overall efficiency and yield. The overall operation will become more efficient. And just like with AutoCart, there'll be more value in the pocket of the farmer. So one of the things that has been really gratifying since Raven made the announcements about autonomy and as we've begun to bring our solutions to the field is we've had tremendous support from the market. So that's been both in terms of social media, and I show a couple of examples of this here. In the print media, we've had just -- we've just been inundated with offers to be interviewed to talk about our program and talk about our bold investments in autonomy. But we've also been contacted from all around the world by technology providers, by Tier 2 OEMs, who want to build implements for DOT, who want to bring new technologies to our platform, to our portfolio. Now that's not only gratifying, but it also is going to put Raven in the position of being the leader in autonomy around the world. I've mentioned we are in the pole position today, but this is one of the attributes that will allow us to maintain that leadership position. Technology is all around the world. We want to be part of this program and part of Raven's solution for autonomy. So this has been a great boon to our program. So as we look forward, there's a number of key milestones that we're going to execute on over the next couple of years. This will allow autonomy to progress forward and for Raven to be successful with this new platform. First, we're going to be commercializing AutoCart in December of this year. I mentioned that a little earlier in the presentation. We're presently validating DOT with customers up in Western Canada. We have about 8 DOTs out in the field with various implements running directly on customers' farms, in collaboration with farmers as we do spraying, spreading and seeding operations. This is allowing us to demonstrate DOT, gather more data around DOT and the DOT value proposition and really prove outlet technology in the marketplace. Over the course of the next year, we'll be establishing our autonomy manufacturing capability. That will only be for DOT, but will be for other technologies that we want to bring to market. So that will be a key and important milestone for our program. Next year, we'll launch DOT in Western Canada. We're targeting small grains in this market because there's a tremendous value proposition for DOT here. Looking beyond that, there's a lot of technologies that are being developed as part of this portfolio. Not only the existing Raven technologies, but others that will either sell discretely or will combine into Raven tech stacks. We'll begin commercializing those in 2022, and those will be a large part of the value that will drive the revenue and margin opportunity that we have before us. In addition and absolutely critical, we'll launch additional prime mover platforms. Raven is now an OEM with the DOT platform, and we expect to continue as an OEM in the future. That means as we look beyond small grains and what DOT can provide, there'll be other prime movers, whether they be pulling platforms or spraying platforms that will become part of our portfolio and that we'll bring to market with our solutions. And then, lastly, looking out in 2023 and beyond, the market for autonomy is global. So we'll be expanding beyond North America. There's markets all around the world that are clamoring for this technology today. We're partnering with those markets, and we'll be bringing our autonomy forward around the world. This allows us to expand our OEM partnerships. It's going to allow us to develop those new channels and leverage them. And we're building an enormously strong IP portfolio. Whether it be on technology or platforms, Raven is putting together an IP portfolio that will allow us to create a differentiating position in the marketplace. So as we look at the revenue opportunity, I know Dan and Steven have mentioned this earlier, but there's tremendous growth opportunity for Raven Autonomy. If you look out over the next few years to 2025 and beyond, we believe we'll achieve $300 million or greater top line growth just with Raven Autonomy sales. Now that will be comprised of a number of different things. There's not only the prime mover platforms that will be a large contributor, but I also mentioned the technologies and tech stacks. Lastly, this will allow us to evolve our offerings in a way that we've been seeking to over the last couple of years. We'll bring more technology through subscription, that will allow customers to have a smaller upfront cost and amortize that cost of that technology over time. This will also allow Raven to create really sustained partnerships with these customers and create customers that stay with us for the long term. So we're excited about this top line growth opportunity, but also the additional margin opportunity that it will bring the division and for Raven Industries. So just to summarize, a couple of key points that I want to make sure that I remind you of in this presentation. The first is that autonomy and ag is here today. We're building on a tremendous legacy in Raven ATD in precision agriculture. And we're now moving it forward through semi-autonomy to autonomy. So it's here today. Our investments have allowed us to achieve this, have mitigated the risk of this move and will really allow us to create that differentiating position. The value proposition is strong, not only for the farmer but for Raven, and it's going to drive the investments that we'll need for this future. We're going to develop machine platforms and technologies. We're not just going to be a technology provider. We're now an OEM for our prime mover platforms, and we'll add more in the future. That will really change the way Raven can do business and the way we can bring technology to market. We're going to target all major crop types, all use cases in all world areas that are relevant. This will allow the tremendous upside growth that we expect. And finally, we're in the pole position. We've gotten there with our endowment with all the technologies that we've been developing. But with these 2 acquisitions, we've really cemented that role. We're committed to autonomy and ag. We're urgent about the future, and we're ready to deliver on autonomy and ag. Thank you very much. STEVEN E. BRAZONES: Thank you, Wade. So we're going to take a short break, a couple of minutes, to assemble our speakers up here and to compile your questions. Just a couple of reminders before we do that. (Operator Instructions) Secondly, we're going to ask participants today to focus their questions on today's event and the strategic platforms for growth. I realize that we reported some very strong results this morning. But we prefer to handle those questions off-line as we typically do in a one-on-one fashion. So give us a couple of minutes and we'll be right back. (Break) DANIEL A. RYKHUS: All right. Thanks for joining back with us, everybody. We're looking forward to the Q&A segment here. And I've asked Steven Brazones to really lead and moderate this section of our event this morning. I do want to thank Lon, and Scott, and Wade for your presentations. I think they're just fantastic and gave a lot more color and depth to what we're doing here. So with that, let's go ahead and get started with our Q&A section. And Steven, take it away. STEVEN E. BRAZONES: All right. So this morning, we have Jared Stearns, our Manager of Investor Relations, off camera. He's been busy compiling your questions, and he's going to lead us through the Q&A session, and we look forward to your questions. Jared? Questions and Answers JARED STEARNS, IR MANAGER, RAVEN INDUSTRIES, INC.: All right. Thank you, Steven. This first question is from Joe Mondillo with Sidoti. He asks, in regard to Thunderhead, can you talk about the size of the addressable market? Also, what are the additional verticals, the most growth opportunity behind the Department of Defense? STEVEN E. BRAZONES: Scott? SCOTT W. WICKERSHAM: Yes. So the short answer is, as I said, it's really big. And it -- I made mention that there are billions of dollars that are put into existing capabilities. But the reality is with our stratospheric platforms is that we are creating a new market. It is the domains that the military is used to operating in with land, sea, air, space and cyberspace. The stratosphere is largely untapped. And the first one to really get a position in that market is going to have a unique advantage on a really large and growing new capability within the Department of Defense. So I think to say that it's a potential of billions is not inappropriate. JARED STEARNS: This next question is also from Joe with Sidoti. At Engineered Films, relative to your CapEx plans and new composite product introductions, how do you see your total addressable size growing over the next several years? And how does that growth look in year 1 versus 2, 3 and 4. STEVEN E. BRAZONES: Lon? LON E. STROSCHEIN: So look, this is something we spend a lot of time on, understanding our markets. And we started from the standpoint of the customers we've got and the opportunities that we have that are right before us. And we quickly moved to the markets that we don't have, but the markets that we believe are going to present themselves. There's no secret that as cars become more autonomous, just like ag equipment, we believe that the ability for a tractor trailer to be -- to weigh less and to be -- provide more efficiency, to enable electric power, those types of things is going to place us squarely where we need to be with the technology we're going for. So to answer your question, we see the market -- the market share or the market size over the next 3 years, we think that we're going to fill it with the markets that we already serve. But we think in years 4, 5 and 6, to get to the 5x our current market, we're going to move into a lot of different areas, where the 5x market that we have now that we talk about is probably a low estimate. JARED STEARNS: All right. This next question is from Chris Moore with CJS Securities. What was the driver behind the decision to delay AutoCart? Does that push back into -- push back intro of other implements? STEVEN E. BRAZONES: Wade? WADE ROBEY: Yes. We -- as we acquired Smart Ag last year, we started with a technology that, as I mentioned, was really in a good shape. It was world-class in terms of the type of technologies that team had brought together. But they didn't have the market experience that Raven does, frankly. And so as we looked at that technology and we looked at the individual components, we felt it was necessary to make some improvements to ruggedize it, to make it more predictable and deliver the kind of user experience in the field that our customers demanded. And what is consistent with our Raven current portfolio of products. And so we made the decision here this summer that we were going to delay our launch by a couple of months. We just simply wanted more field time with AutoCart to ensure that we had the data. We understood how it performed in a lot of different use cases, and we were confident in its release. So we did that. That set the new release date now at December 1. No, it's not going to impact other -- the launches we do with Raven Autonomy. This was really a specific and discrete decision we made around AutoCart and purely to make sure that the type of product we release meets our customer expectations, both in terms of quality and value. JARED STEARNS: All right. These next set of questions are from Will Harrell with Capco. How do these advances -- how will these advances actually go to the market in regards to Raven Autonomy, get adopted and become standards? WADE ROBEY: Yes. It will depend upon the technology, frankly. If you look at AutoCart, we use that maybe as a first example, we have an initial dealer network that we've established with AutoCart around North America, mostly in the United States, frankly, initially. Because we'll be bringing AutoCart forward really for row crop harvesting and some small grain in the upper Midwest. We also have a few dealers out in the West Coast because we've already seen AutoCart being utilized for vegetable harvesting. So AutoCart, principally, will go through that dealer network initially, having a couple of key direct salespeople involved in managing that network and supporting our customers. When we look at DOT, it's a little bit different story. We've got a direct sales team up in Canada that will initially sell DOT. We know that a lot of equipment is sold through a dealer network, so we're evaluating that, and it's quite possible we'll have dealers as part of our go-to-market strategy. But we also anticipate some centers of excellence or regional centers that we'll establish that will not only be outlets for the sale of that technology and other Raven Autonomy solutions, but also to provide a location for training for customers to come in and see the units, see them operate and make a buying decision. So it will be a mixed model as it relates to DOT. JARED STEARNS: Also related to DOT, how will this become widely used? And how will you get OEMs to build implements to be compatible with that? WADE ROBEY: Yes. In terms of DOT and its use case currently, the crops that we're targeting, it really is a focused commercial development and release for DOT. First in Western Canada on small grains, but as I'm sure you know, small grains are grown all around the world. So we'll see an expansion beyond Western Canada to those other regions of the world in time. In terms of implements and how OEMs will interact with, say that, DOT platform specifically, we're in conversations with a whole range of OEM partners, Tier 1, Tier 2, that want to develop implements for DOT. That's not something we've had to go beat the bushes for. They've come to us and said, \"Hey, we see this as the future. Autonomy is going to take hold, how do we participate? How could we develop and implement that will mate with DOT and be able to execute as the current implements do?\" So we're, frankly, in discussions with them about that. There'll be design exchanges that will allow that, so they know how to link to the platform. And then communication or software interfaces, protocols that will also have to be developed. But we'll do that in collaboration with those partners. JARED STEARNS: Also in regards to Raven Autonomy, how will we be able to fund this level of investment? STEVEN E. BRAZONES: Yes. So from a capital allocation standpoint, we've taken a look at the investments across all 3 of our operating divisions and across all 3 strategic platforms for growth. And we're going to be putting our balance sheet to work. So at this particular point in time, we have 0 debt on our balance sheet and about $20 million in cash, and we expect to put that balance sheet to work. It's not inconceivable that we'd have 2 to 2.5x debt-to-EBITDA leverage on our balance sheet, 2 to 3 years from today. And we are geared up for that. JARED STEARNS: This next question is from Joe with Sidoti, again. So for Raven Autonomy, can you talk about competition? Specifically, how challenging is it to compete against the OEMs in-house R&D budgets? WADE ROBEY: Yes. I -- what I'd like to convey is that we certainly will see OEM competition, but we'll also see, and we're seeing it today, OEM partnership on autonomy. So Raven has -- one of the 2 ways we go-to-market is through in-factory installation with our OEM partners. And we've been very gratified to see how much they've come forward and said, \"Hey, we want these technologies on our platforms also.\" So we see that as a partnership that will continue. There certainly are large OEMs out there that won't want to participate, and they'll compete with us. And we know that it will come. We see it in our current precision ag go-to-market strategy. But we feel, again, uniquely positioned to be able to handle that. Not only do we feel like we have a lead time, and we know that we're building a strong intellectual property position. But we also, as Raven can be much more nimble, we can be quicker. A lot of these large OEMs have tremendous installed capacity and a legacy of building manned platforms. It will be a little challenging for them to convert those. Raven won't be burdened with that. And so we'll move quicker. We'll bring prime movers to market, and we will be successful in that endeavor. DANIEL A. RYKHUS: Yes. I'd just add to that, that our vision is really not to compete head-to-head with large incumbents in the ag, especially tractor space. We are building an ag technology and equipment company for the future. And we have visions to continue to bring different platforms to the future ag market that will compete differently. And we get to use the technology that we've been developing for years. The acquisitions that we've made recently supplement that technology extremely well. And as you see, the DOT platform looks nothing like a traditional tractor, and we'll continue to develop other platforms that, that probably move further away from the traditional platform and ag equipment that you see today and more towards what we see for the future. JARED STEARNS: This next question is from Jennifer Oppold at Alpine Peaks. Have prices come down for the composites acquisitions you are looking at? STEVEN E. BRAZONES: Lon? LON E. STROSCHEIN: Yes. So no, to be quite honest. Composite -- one of the things that we discovered, we've been working on doing an acquisition in composites actually for quite some time. And for doing an acquisition in films for quite some time, that isn't a secret. One of the things that we found in the process specific to composites, however, is that finding exactly what we're looking for is not -- isn't readily available. And it's one of the reasons why we get really excited about greenfielding certain elements of our composite strategy. So to answer your question succinctly, the valuations have not come down. Their appetite to sell has not gone up, but we are not backing down from our strategy to find a good acquisition that we can layer into this strategy and be successful. JARED STEARNS: These next set of questions are from Ben Klieve with National Securities. Across the Thunderhead platform, do you hope to be a prime or subcontractor. If prime, do you have the breadth of capabilities to be named on major ISR IDIQs? DANIEL A. RYKHUS: Yes. So unabashedly, we are moving towards a position of being a prime integrated service provider with what -- with the technology that we've created and the positions we have currently is we have established ourselves as a leader in beyond just building a platform. But integration, the services and being able to manage the contract to a medium-sized aerospace and defense provider is squarely in the center of our strategy. So the short answer to the question is yes, we are on our path to being a prime, and we are in a position to manage that. JARED STEARNS: Yes. Also from Ben, what is the composite product coming to market this fiscal year? STEVEN E. BRAZONES: Lon? LON E. STROSCHEIN: So look, we're going to start with what we know and what we're really good at and where we've been successful in the past, and that's going to be with surface films that marry up with composites, where the interlayer isn't a proprietary Raven product. And -- but that's where we're going to find early success and build from there. But it's absolutely our intention to move closer and closer into that market by investing in tapes and tape lines and perfecting that expertise and the lamination processes around those so that we can be a real major player in that market in the near and long term. STEVEN E. BRAZONES: Okay. And just to add on to that, we announced today that we're going to be spending about $10 million in the greenfield operation in the third quarter, and that's to bring in production lines into a facility on the East Coast. And we would expect revenues from that to start generating in the $10 million to $15 million range next year. So there's a little bit of a delay in the delivery of the equipment, given the pandemic, but we are on track for a ramp in composite revenues next year. DANIEL A. RYKHUS: Jared, before you jump to the next question, let's pause a little bit after each one. And I want to step back to the question on the stratospheric balloons. And just remind everybody that yes, we are pursuing prime contractor status, and we are becoming an integrator, and we're going to provide additional technical services all around that. But our strategy has always been, and it continues to be in Aerostar to build the most innovative technology in those spaces. And that's what we lead with. That's how we separate ourselves from our competitors is innovation that's embedded in our ability to navigate these stratospheric platforms and to build platforms that last several hundred days now in the stratosphere. And that's what sets us apart, but it's also what allows us to drive strong margins. JARED STEARNS: Next couple of questions still from Ben. How critical is rural broadband access to the performance of autonomy products? WADE ROBEY: Yes. As we look at the core Raven technologies, communication, connectivity is really critical. And so whether it be cellular capability or connectivity, radio even as we get machines in the field and close proximity, WiFi Bluetooth capability to be connected, it is critical. Now a lot of the operations once the mission has been received, can -- they can be executed without having that continuous connectivity. And we can then when we return back into a zone of connectivity, upload information, receive additional commands, et cetera. When we start talking about multiple machine coordination in the field, again, if we lose cellular, we can be connected machine-to-machine through other types of communication, like radio, and that will augment it to some degree. But we certainly need in time this technology to continue to not only improve but also to proliferate in rural areas or in remote areas where connectivity is less solid today. The next piece I'd add, if I could, is that as AI develops and as these machines have a greater and greater ability to perform autonomously, if I can use that word at the edge, without being connected to the cloud, some of that will go away. And the machines will get smarter through the software and the intelligence we'll bring on these platforms. And they'll be able to react better in situations where connectivity might be lost. But it certainly is a key and important element to us in the future. DANIEL A. RYKHUS: And I'd just say one of the benefits of being in precision ag for as long as we have been, is that we've been through cycles like this before. I remember when we first got into auto guidance, convergence times were long. STEVEN E. BRAZONES: Tremendous. DANIEL A. RYKHUS: And we realized that will get resolved over time, not necessarily through us. But the market will demand it, and it did. And broad rates weren't sufficient to transmit data at a rate initially when we were moving files off a field into an office. But we knew that will get resolved, and it did. And I'm sure that connectivity throughout our rural markets will continue to improve over the horizon that we intend to bring our autonomy solutions to market. JARED STEARNS: These next set of questions are from Kristen Owen with Oppenheimer. In regards to composite strategy, can you expand on the current M&A pipeline and provide an update on how you view the cadence of acquisitions? STEVEN E. BRAZONES: Yes. So we've done quite a bit of work over the last 12 months in identifying a number of candidates for acquisition in the composite space, and we continue to build that pipeline. And so there's lots of conversations that are going on right now with prospective acquisition targets, and we'd expect that to continue to grow throughout the rest of this year and into next year. From an acquisition standpoint, cadence standpoint, we're on track, and we believe that we're going to be able to do at least one transaction a year over the next 5 years. So nothing has changed with respect to the cadence that we expect. JARED STEARNS: Also from Kristen at Oppenheimer. Can you expand on OEM capabilities? And what types of investments need to be made over the near-term from a manufacturing capacity standpoint? STEVEN E. BRAZONES: Wade? WADE ROBEY: So I'm assuming that's related to autonomy. So let me answer it this way. Raven is going to establish its own capability to manufacture. We're in the process of acquiring those location facilities and staining that up. Currently, today, we do that in a relationship with SeedMaster, which was the original owner of DOT, and that can bridge us to -- we get to that point. Long term, as we grow DOT and we bring in other prime mover platforms, in large part, it will depend upon how we do that and whether that in part is through partnership or Raven develops its own prime mover platform. Obviously, if we develop our own, we'll intend to probably manufacture those our own. But there may be times when we also bring technology onto a partner platform, and we simply bring that tech stack or componentry to their existing system that they manufacture. So I think it will be a mixed model. JARED STEARNS: Also from Kristen. Given the current low interest environment, how should we think about funding these investments? STEVEN E. BRAZONES: Yes. Just to reiterate, I think, from a capital allocation standpoint, we're going to be putting our balance sheet to work. And so the cost of financing today, the cost of debt is very advantageous to us. We've got a great revolving credit facility in place that's got $100 million of capacity. That's expandable to $200 million. On top of that, I'd like to address the dividend as well. A lot of companies have to cut their dividend. And we wanted to cut our dividend. And the reason we wanted to cut the dividend is because of all the growth opportunities that we have in front of us. So from a capital allocation standpoint, it's much more important for us to reinvest those funds into these 3 opportunities than it is to give it back. So a combination of that with the leverage on the balance sheet is how we intend to fund this growth. DANIEL A. RYKHUS: And strong cash flows, like we demonstrated the last 6 months. STEVEN E. BRAZONES: Yes. That's right. JARED STEARNS: Okay. This next question is from Chris Strom with Mairs and Power. How will the AutoCart be priced from an annual selling price perspective? And what kind of penetration do you need to meet your goals? WADE ROBEY: So AutoCart will have an MSRP going to the marketplace in December at $55,000 for the complete system. So that includes all the various technologies for perception, for hazard detection, et cetera, cabling, everything that need -- that is needed both on the tractor and the harvester for the system to work. In addition, there will be an annual subscription that we'll roll out with that, which will allow the customer to receive not only updates to the system, but also as we add more features, the availability to connect with those and add those to the suite of technology that they'll deploy. In terms of how we look at rolling it out commercially, we're obviously targeting, initially, the upper Midwest. We've been very open about that for corn and soybean harvesting. But there's also opportunity in those regions for small grains as well. So we'll see it utilize there. And then expanding to the West Coast of the United States up into Canada for small grain, AutoCart, we believe, will be very rapidly adopted. We're receiving inquiries all around the world, people wanting to see systems today. So we'll move it internationally quickly from there. And as we ramp up AutoCart sales over the next 3 or 4 years, by 2025, we'll be selling over 2,000 units a year. That's in our plan. We believe that's very realistic and attainable. DANIEL A. RYKHUS: Wade, I just -- we should talk a little bit about that, really, AutoCart is a first use case. WADE ROBEY: Right. DANIEL A. RYKHUS: So when we purchased Smart AG, we purchased a company that had some deep strength in perception, path planning, using artificial intelligence and machine learning to build out models for collision avoidance and lots of other utility that we bring to autonomy. We're expressing that in AutoCart today, which is one operation bringing -- taking a tractor with a grain cart behind it, lying it up next to combine to offload. But that's just the first. We can go to auto till we can go to auto spray. There's many, many use cases that can follow. And I think that's an important distinction, that while we do envision and we will become the ag equipment company of the future, we also have this beautiful tech stack that we can take to our other partners and allow the enablement of autonomy in that fashion. WADE ROBEY: Yes. You said it much better than I would have. And I think that really is the bright future. This is a very fungible platform. We can, as Dan said, take it to all different applications, which again, opens us up internationally, opens up all crop types and use cases, whether they be traditional or maybe permanent planted viticulture, all these will become as flexible to us with this tech stack capability. JARED STEARNS: Okay. This next question is also from Chris Strom at Mairs and Power. Why is Canada first market for DOT? And how is it different from the U.S. market? And is there any reason why you couldn't launch it in the U.S. market first? WADE ROBEY: Yes. But as we look at DOT and we look at the history of DOT, there are a couple of reasons why we're focusing on Western Canada first. First, that's where DOT was born. And there has been a tremendous amount of exposure to that market through what SeedMaster did as they brought that start-up business forward and began putting systems out into the field. So we have a lot of people extraordinarily interested already, ready customers that want to bring a DOT on to their farm and see it operate. So that's one obvious reason. Secondly, the DOT platform itself is really targeted to small grains. And I won't get into a lot of the reasons why that is. There's issues in terms or reasons based on how it's designed, its length, its width, et cetera. But it's really targeted for small grains. And if you look at where small grains are grown in North America, although we see a fair bit in the United States, certainly down in the Dakotas and other areas, there's just a tremendous market opportunity in Canada that's waiting for DOT. So we're going to start there. It's also where our team is based in Regina and where we'll have our initial capability to produce DOT and service it. But as we look out beyond that, anywhere small grains are grown, we can take DOT and be successful in the marketplace. And so we're going to look beyond Western Canada pretty quickly. DANIEL A. RYKHUS: I'd just add that everything you said, I agree with. And I would say that the current form factor of DOT is really optimized for small grain and broad acre crop conditions. But that's like any successful ag equipment company really starts regionally. Because they're invented by usually people who have experienced growing crops in those areas. And they build a solution, and they invent it, and that's exactly what happened with DOT. WADE ROBEY: Yes. DANIEL A. RYKHUS: So the DOT platform of today is optimized for these small grains. It mates with a seeder, with a sprayer and a spreader for those areas. It's a size that works best in those areas. But we can take -- we'll take that same concept, the utility of a platform that can do multiple operations into other marketplaces eventually, and we look forward to that. JARED STEARNS: Okay. This next question is from Steven Fisher with UBS. What does the machine need to have to be DOT ready? WADE ROBEY: Yes. So let me turn that question around. Today, it's really the implement. So we're bringing forward the U-shape platform, and it's what does the implement need to do to be able to mate with DOT and perform an agricultural operation. So there's a couple of different things. One, as the owner of DOT in that technology and the intellectual property around that, we would need to work with that provider. We would provide them the mechanical design, et cetera, to be able to make those linkages and hook with DOT and do that in the proper way. There's also a software handshake and the ability for that platform to know what it's connected to and to execute that operation. So there's a number of things both on a design and a hardware perspective that an implement provider would need, but also the software protocols to engage with DOT. That's really how that platform is envisioned to grow. We currently have 3 implements. We're looking at a couple more in the next 12, 18 months. And then in time, we believe DOT will be able to mate with 8, 9, 10 implements to really broadly expand its ability to perform lots of different operations on farm. As Dan mentioned, that will, in time, also allow us to move into other crops beyond small grains where we're targeting. JARED STEARNS: All right. This will be our last question of the day. It comes from [Bill Baldwin]. Can you offer insight into the other platforms Raven Autonomy may introduce in the future? WADE ROBEY: So obviously, we're starting with DOT and with AutoCart. And there's a lot of nuances there. And Dan mentioned that very eloquently. When you look at AutoCart and what we actually acquired, it's not just a use case. Certainly, that is the first product we're bringing to market in the system. But it is that perception capability. And within that is not only the sensors and those technologies, but how you bring those together into a perception module. And then, how do you control that through command and control to an executive controller? And then next, how do you transition that to the next platform? So as we look forward, whether it's new prime movers that we might pursue for pulling platforms or spraying platforms, there's also the ability to take this tech stack on to existing platforms or other machines. For instance, a sprayer that's running manned operations could really benefit from perception capability -- perception technology. Because running that very expensive equipment or booms into a tree or a fence post can be a traumatic event and be very expensive for the farmer and the ag retailers.

According to news reporting originating in Guelph, Canada, by VerticalNews journalists, research stated, \"Mechanistic models (MMs) have served as causal pathway analysis and 'decision-support' tools within animal production systems for decades. Such models quantitatively define how a biological system works based on causal relationships and use that cumulative biological knowledge to generate predictions and recommendations (in practice) and generate/evaluate hypotheses (in research).\" Financial support for this research came from Canada First Research Excellence Fund. The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from the University of Guelph, \"Their limitations revolve around obtaining sufficiently accurate inputs, user training and accuracy/precision of predictions on-farm. The new wave in digitalization technologies may negate some of these challenges. New data-driven (DD) modelling methods such as machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) examine patterns in data to produce accurate predictions (forecasting, classification of animals, etc.). The deluge of sensor data and new self-learning modelling techniques may address some of the limitations of traditional MM approaches - access to input data (e.g. sensors) and on-farm calibration. However, most of these new methods lack transparency in the reasoning behind predictions, in contrast to MM that have historically been used to translate knowledge into wisdom. The objective of this paper is to propose means to hybridize these two seemingly divergent methodologies to advance the models we use in animal production systems and support movement towards truly knowledge-based precision agriculture. In order to identify potential niches for models in animal production of the future, a cross-species (dairy, swine and poultry) examination of the current state of the art in MM and new DD methodologies (ML, DL analytics) is undertaken. We hypothesize that there are several ways via which synergy may be achieved to advance both our predictive capabilities and system understanding, being: (1) building and utilizing data streams (e.g. intake, rumination behaviour, rumen sensors, activity sensors, environmental sensors, cameras and near IR) to apply MM in real-time and/or with new resolution and capabilities; (2) hybridization of MM and DD approaches where, for example, a ML framework is augmented by MM-generated parameters or predicted outcomes and (3) hybridization of the MM and DD approaches, where biological bounds are placed on parameters within a MM framework, and the DD system parameterizes the MM for individual animals, farms or other such clusters of data.\" According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"As animal systems modellers, we should expand our toolbox to explore new DD approaches and big data to find opportunities to increase understanding of biological systems, find new patterns in data and move the field towards intelligent, knowledge-based precision agriculture systems.\" Our news correspondents report that additional information may be obtained by contacting J.

(CSE: BEE) (CVE:BEE) (OTCQB: BEVVF) (the 'Company' or 'BVT') today announced a new multi-year blueberry research trial with the Institute for Sustainable Horticulture (ISH) at Kwantlen Polytechnic University (KPU) in British Columbia (BC), Canada. The ISH is a leading partnership of academia with BC's horticultural industries and the community. ISH supports BC in meeting demands for a higher level of sustainability and environmental responsibility from horticulture, and urban landscapes. Canada is the world's second largest producer and exporter of blueberries, after the United States. Canada exports over 50 million pounds of fresh cultivated blueberries valued at CAD$125 million, and over 65 million pounds of frozen blueberries valued at CAD$94 million. (1) And as one of Canada's main blueberry growing regions, BC is a key test region for BVT technology. This multi-year trial builds on the momentum that BVT has achieved in the US blueberry market with successful grower deals over the last growing season since EPA approval in 2019. 'British Columbia's climate, high disease pressures and agricultural practices align well with our technology,' says Ashish Malik, CEO of Bee Vectoring Technologies. 'The Institute for Sustainable Horticulture at KPU has an established relationship with the BC Blueberry Council. They are keen to investigate new, sustainable disease management tools, and are well suited to manage these trials as the lead research group.' Local growers will be tapped for trial locations which will help build awareness and early demand for the BVT system in BC. The trial will evaluate and quantify the efficacy of CR-7, BVT's biological fungicide, in combating fungal diseases in blueberry crops. The results of the trial will be submitted as part of the Company's application for Canadian registration, and will be used as scientific data to market the system to highbush blueberry growers. 'Blueberries are susceptible to a number of common fungal diseases that can wreak havoc on plant health, berry yield and shelf life from farm to plate, including Colletotrichum (anthracnose), Botrytis (gray mold) and Monilinia (mummy berry),' continued Mr. Malik. 'The BVT system has been specifically engineered to target these fungal diseases, and we look forward to quantifying both disease control and crop yield improvements through multi-year season trials with the research group and participating growers. About Bee Vectoring Technologies International Inc. BVT, an agriculture technology company, is a market disruptor with a significant global market opportunity in the $240 billion crop protection and fertilizer market. BVT has pioneered a natural precision agriculture system that replaces chemical pesticides and wasteful plant protection product spray applications by delivering biological pesticide alternatives to crops using commercially grown bees. BVT's award-winning technology, precision vectoring, is completely harmless to bees and allows minute amounts of naturally-derived pesticides (called biologicals) to be delivered directly to blooms, providing improved crop protection and yield results than traditional chemical pesticides - and improving the health of the soil, the microbiome and the environment.

US fall applications should be strong, and management has said that its order book up to October is full. Strong plantings in South America will also support sales volumes. Moreover, share price valuations are considerably cheap on a short-term basis. However, margins for the legacy units are weakening, and fertiliser prices will remain weak most likely for the rest of 2020. Declining EBITDA in the three fertiliser units will most likely cancel out increases from the Retail unit in H220. The long-term outlook is also challenging, as the company faces regulatory and competitive challenges in both its Retail and fertiliser units. Consequently, we still expect market performance against the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) over the short term, with a bias towards outperformance. Company Overview Nutrien is a fertiliser producer based in Saskatoon, Canada. The company was formed through the merger of PotashCorp and Agrium, which concluded on January 2 2018. Nutrien operates four business segments - agriculture retail distribution (the company's largest unit), potash, nitrogen and phosphate - representing USD18.8bn in consolidated 2018 sales and USD3.9bn in consolidated 2018 EBITDA. Nutrien has approximately 20,300 employees. The company's potash division is the largest in the world, representing 22% of global potash capacity, and its nitrogen unit is the second largest in the world.  Mild Rebound After Recent Disruptions Selected Companies - One-Year Share Price Performance, %  Note: Performances as of August 20 2020 in US dollar terms. Source: Bloomberg, Fitch Solutions Company Results Nutrien saw a moderate decrease in sales and operating earnings year-on-year in Q220. In terms of sales, Nutrien saw a decrease of 3% to USD8.4bn. In particular, the company's retail division (which now accounts for around 80% of total sales) saw sales growth of 4%. By contrast, the three main fertiliser divisions saw falling sales. The potash division, the largest of the legacy PotashCorp units, saw sales decrease by 29%, driven by falling prices (based on lower benchmark prices) and despite higher selling volumes. The phosphate unit, the smallest of the company's divisions, saw a strong decline of almost 33% owing to weak phosphate prices and lower sales volumes. The company's nitrogen unit saw sales fall by 12% y-o-y, mostly because of falling sales prices. Like the sales figures, Nutrien's adjusted EBITDA fell by 7% y-o-y in Q220. The decrease was owing to the potash (39% decline) and nitrogen division (17% decline). In the case of the Phosphate division, although EBITDA rose, this was mainly due to a one-time change to a retirement estimate, meaning that all three legacy fertiliser units saw EBITDA fall, while the retail division saw EBITDA increase by 15% to USD964mn due to margin improvement across most product lines. Relative to Bloomberg consensus, Nutrien missed sales estimates but beat GAAP and adjusted earnings estimates.   Sources: Bloomberg, Fitch Solutions We remain more pessimistic regarding the sales growth prospects for the three smaller fertiliser divisions. On the upside, we anticipate moderately higher grain prices from spot levels as global grain market fundamentals tighten, while high prices in South America will encourage plantings for the 2020/21 season. Higher average palm oil prices will also benefit the company's potash unit. The company also has a fully committed order book until October, which will help maintain strong sales volumes. However, there are a number of factors that will constrain fertiliser prices and ultimately Nutrien's earnings. First, fertiliser production capacity remains large, especially in the context of weak oil prices, and weak industrial demand is holding back ammonia prices. Second, China's commitments as part of the phase-one trade deal have yet to meaningfully boost US prices, especially for corn.   <TD>Note: 'Potash' = Green Market Fertilizer Potash Cornbelt Granular Spot Price; 'DAP' = Green Market Fertilizer DAP US Gulf NOLA Spot Price; 'Urea' = Green Market Fertilizer UREA US Gulf NOLA Granular Spot Price. Source: Green Markets, Bloomberg, Fitch Solutions Third, farm profitability, particularly in the US, continues to suffer despite multiple bailout packages. Fourth, the recent potash purchase agreement from the Chinese import consortium signed in late April with Belarusian Potash Company will see the potash price floor fall by almost 25% compared with the previous contract settlement in 2018. Consequently, despite record sales volumes for Nutrien in H120, revenues have fallen precipitously. Aside from the fertiliser production units, sales and profit growth for the company's retail unit will remain positive (in line with our previous view) but will face challenges in the context of strong competition, and digital and supply chain investment and integration. As of Q220, management says that it is too early to forecast the Retail outlook. Company Strategy Nutrien's strategy is defined by management as 'build the channel, enhance the content'. In particular, the company aims to consolidate the retail industry and drive organic growth and margin improvement. This will come from expanding its retail footprint in Brazil, optimising supply chains and focusing on greenfield builds from high-value regions. The company is also rolling out a new sustainability strategy later in 2020. Strong Historical Correlation S&P GSCI Grains Index & Green Markets Fertiliser Index, USD/tonne  Note: Weekly data starting in January 2002. Source: Bloomberg, Green Markets, Fitch Solutions The global fertiliser market can be broadly described as a sector where trends take place over a long period of time (many competitors are decades old) and, aside from changing fertiliser combinations, sees limited ability for participants to change those trends, particularly since fertiliser is produced in places with either large phosphate and potash deposits or easy access to cheap natural gas (for nitrogen fertiliser production). Many of the world's largest fertiliser-producing countries decades ago are still as large today, especially in the case of potash. Moreover, as fertiliser is among the most important variable expense for many perennial crops, fertiliser prices are traditionally sensitive to changes in crops prices as farmers are able cut back or increase variable consumption depending on the price environment. For example, during the food price spike of 2007, fertiliser prices tripled, while in 2008 and 2009 prices fell by a combined 70%. Nitrogen is the most important fertiliser for crop development and has thus traditionally seen the most stable and largest overall consumption.  On a long-term basis, the fertiliser sector will undergo considerable disruption from the increase in agtech funding and emphasis on sustainability in the wake of global climate change. In our view, the underlying assumption of global agriculture's long-term focus on precision planting and sustainability is decreased concentration of agricultural input use, especially fertiliser and crop protection, along with a reduction in additional land being dedicated to crops. For example, in Europe the European Commission published a proposal for the first European Climate Law on March 4, a critical regulation for the European Green Deal that aims to set legally binding climate targets from 2030 onwards to ensure the EU reaches net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. As part of this, the Green Deal reflects a desire to reduce significantly the use of chemical pesticides, fertilisers and antibiotics through the development of precision farming techniques. Multi-Faceted Impacts Of The European Green Deal EU - European Green Deal  Source: European Commission In this context, Nutrien's desire to focus on improving performance of retail makes sense and will be a key differentiator for the company within the fertiliser sector. Although the company has considerable incremental available capacity in the event fertiliser prices improve (especially for the potash division), earnings from the three fertiliser divisions will probably be stagnant or lower year-on-year in FY20 and face pressure beyond. For example, the company was already guiding negative EBITDA growth for the potash unit in 2020 (USD1.4bn in 2020 vs USD1.6bn in 2019) when it revised its guidance down further in Q120 (and maintained it in Q220), now anticipating USD1.1bn. The other two fertiliser divisions will see limited to no growth, according to company guidance, as management admits that fertiliser prices will remain under pressure for the rest of 2020. Finally, with management revising downwards its top-end EBITDA projections for Nitrogen, full-year earnings guidance was lowered slightly to USD1.50-1.90 per share on an adjusted basis. Retail is both the company's largest (accounting for two-thirds of total sales) and historically the least profitable of the company's main divisions, suggesting that the segment shows considerable room for improvement. This means that given the size of the unit, improved efficiency could have a considerable impact on the company's earnings per share. The competition in retail is relatively diffuse and includes agricultural cooperatives, independent retailers and other large agricultural companies. Nutrien represented only 19% of the market in 2018 (according to company management), which suggests room for market share expansion through acquisition, and the company benefits from both considerable financial resources and the initial success of its digital platform launched in January 2019. Management stated in its Q220 earnings call that in North America (the only market where digital is available for now) 60% of all retail sales were digital.   <TD>Note: Q318 adjusted for CAD1. 8bn impairment to potash division; Sources: Bloomberg, Fitch Solutions Retail will face two key challenges. First, the company is looking at improving growth for this unit through acquisitions (including the recent acquisition of Agrosema, an agriculture retailer in Brazil, and RuralCo, a diversified agriculture services company in Australia). T12M retail segment operating margins have remained stagnant in recent years, and the entail integration costs - management has said that it will take a couple of years for the RuralCo deal to achieve its synergy targets - could constrain margins further. Second, commercial offerings for retail could face increased competition (services), reduced pricing power owing to consolidation (seeds) and new legislation regarding health concerns (glyphosate-based crop protection) over the coming quarters. Over the long term, however, as Nutrien's digital platform eventually goes global (which will start in mid-2021 in South America and Australia), and acquisitions are integrated, the combination of Nutrien's existing networks and the online services and enable the company to see increasing margins out of the Retail division. Moreover, the company will be well placed to benefit from eventual consolidation in the agtech services sector. Still Relatively Cheap Valuations Despite Share Price Improvement Nutrien - Share Price, CAD (LHS) With Moving Averages & Relative Forward P/E  Note: Forward P/E relative to TSX Index. Source: Bloomberg, Fitch Solutions Share Price Analysis Nutrien's share price has recovered in recent months, along with the rest of the market, but is still trading a significant discount relative to the TSX. More specifically, on a forward P/E basis, Nutrien continues to trade at levels well below its historical average versus the TSX. Meanwhile, on a P/B basis Nutrien is trading a considerable discount to the TSX, while its dividend yield of 4.7% is significantly higher than US treasury yields. On a technical basis, the share price is testing the 200-day moving average, currently at CAN52. A break above this level, which also corresponds to key horizontal resistance, could see the share price head towards next resistance around CAN60. However, with momentum indicators close to overbought territory and turning lower, we believe that the CAD53 level will hold over the short term.

The team, co-led by P2IRC researchers Andrew Sharpe and Isobel Parkin, used a new genome sequencing technology (Nanopore) that results in very long \"reads\" of DNA and RNA sequences, providing information for crop breeding that was previously not available. The results are published in Nature Plants. \"This work provides a new model for building other genome assemblies for crops such as wheat, canola and lentils. Essentially, it's a recipe for generating a genome sequence that works for any crop,\" said Sharpe, director of P2IRC. \"We now know that we can get the same quality of genomic data and level of information about genetic variation for these important national and international crops. This means we can make breeding more efficient because we can more easily select genes for specific desired traits.\" Sharpe said his team is already using this software platform in the Omics and Precision Agriculture Lab (OPAL) at the USask Global Institute for Food Security (GIFS) to sequence larger and more complex crop genomes. Black mustard (Brassica nigra), commonly used in seed form as a cooking spice, is grown on the Indian sub-continent and is closely related to mustard and canola crops grown in Canada. The research provides a clearer, \"higher resolution\" view of the plant's genes and gives researchers and breeders a more defined view of which genes are responsible for which traits. The resulting gene assembly for black mustard also helps explain how the black mustard genome differs from those of its close crop relatives--such as cabbage, turnip and canola. The team also uncovered the first direct evidence of functional centromeres, structures on chromosomes essential for plant fertility, and detected other previously hard to identify regions of the genome. This knowledge provides a foundation for improving crop production. Parkin, a USask adjunct professor and P2IRC member, said the use of long-read sequence data has enabled unprecedented access to previously hidden features of plant genomes. \"This provides not only insights into how crops evolve but enables the identification of novel structural variation--now known to play an important role in the control of many key agronomic traits,\" said Parkin, also the lead research scientist with AAFC Saskatoon Research Centre. They also found in the sequence multiple copies of certain genes that express specific traits. This could mean that certain traits, such as fungal resistance, could be expressed more strongly through several genes. Other USask members of the team include GIFS researcher Zahra-Katy Navabi and bioinformatics specialist Chu Shin Koh. Other team members include Sampath Perumal, a post-doctoral fellow with Parkin, as well as others from the University of Ottawa, Thompson River University, the National Research Council, and researchers from the United Kingdom and China. \"The genome assembly for black mustard that we have developed is a great example of how new Nanopore sequencing technology quickly reveals important genome biology,\" Sharpe said, noting that this advanced sequencing technology and capability is available to public and private plant breeding organizations through the OPAL at GIFS.

Mr. Linton was appointed as a director and non-executive chairman of the board. Mr. Linton is an experienced director and private investor and currently serves on the boards of TMX Group, Empire Company and CSL Group. He has invested in several successful private companies and retired in 2012 as the chief financial officer of Rogers Communications. - On April 17, Deveron closed the second tranche of a private placement for $700,000, which combined with the first tranche, Deveron issued 13.55 million units for aggregate gross proceeds of $1,355,000. - On May 11, Deveron acquired Better Harvest, a Texas-based agronomy solutions firm, further expanding its U.S. footprint by over 100,000 customer acres. Better Harvest had unaudited reported revenue of $471,769 (U.S.) in 2019. - On June 18, Deveron announced the national launch of a plant tissue testing service in collaboration with A & L Canada Laboratories to continue to build on the company's turnkey data collection offering. Tissue sampling complements other progressive precision agriculture programs and is a value-add to traditional soil sampling. Subsequent to Q2 - On July 7, Deveron announced that it is providing a turnkey data service program to Terramera, a global agricultural technology leader fusing science, nature and artificial intelligence to transform how food is grown. The collaboration allows Terramerra access to Deveron's drone data network to provide high-fidelity insight on numerous sites across Canada and the United States. Business outlook \"The second quarter affirmed our beliefs about the value that our products and services provide our customers,\" commented Mr. MacMillan. \"As engagement within our sales pipeline continues to grow and our team continues to push efficient turnaround from the field to the creation of tangible data that helps leaders in agriculture make better decisions, we only see our success accelerating. With a quarter under our belt of our integration of Better Harvest and increased activity in the United States, we see a lot of opportunities to consolidate a fragmented service market and align great businesses toward a common goal of providing better, unbiased information to improve efficiencies on farms. We are looking forward to a busy fall and have already seen increased demand as the soil sampling season gets under way following wheat harvest across a number of our operating nodes.

(CSE: BEE) (TSXV: BEE) (OTCQB: BEVVF) (the \"Company\" or \"BVT\") today announced a new multi-year blueberry research trial with the Institute for Sustainable Horticulture (ISH) at Kwantlen Polytechnic University (KPU) in British Columbia (BC), Canada. The ISH is a leading partnership of academia with BC's horticultural industries and the community. ISH supports BC in meeting demands for a higher level of sustainability and environmental responsibility from horticulture, and urban landscapes. Canada is the world's second largest producer and exporter of blueberries, after the United States. Canada exports over 50 million pounds of fresh cultivated blueberries valued at CAD$125 million, and over 65 million pounds of frozen blueberries valued at CAD$94 million.[(1)] And as one of Canada's main blueberry growing regions, BC is a key test region for BVT technology. This multi-year trial builds on the momentum that BVT has achieved in the US blueberry market with successful grower deals over the last growing season since EPA approval in 2019. \"British Columbia's climate, high disease pressures and agricultural practices align well with our technology,\" says Ashish Malik, CEO of Bee Vectoring Technologies. \"The Institute for Sustainable Horticulture at KPU has an established relationship with the BC Blueberry Council. They are keen to investigate new, sustainable disease management tools, and are well suited to manage these trials as the lead research group.\" Local growers will be tapped for trial locations which will help build awareness and early demand for the BVT system in BC. The trial will evaluate and quantify the efficacy of CR-7, BVT's biological fungicide, in combating fungal diseases in blueberry crops. The results of the trial will be submitted as part of the Company's application for Canadian registration, and will be used as scientific data to market the system to highbush blueberry growers. \"Blueberries are susceptible to a number of common fungal diseases that can wreak havoc on plant health, berry yield and shelf life from farm to plate, including Colletotrichum (anthracnose), Botrytis (gray mold) and Monilinia (mummy berry),\" continued Mr. Malik. \"The BVT system has been specifically engineered to target these fungal diseases, and we look forward to quantifying both disease control and crop yield improvements through multi-year season trials with the research group and participating growers.\" [(1)] Source: 2016, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC), \"What's New in British Columbia - Spotlight in Blueberries About Bee Vectoring Technologies International Inc.

The Edmonton Metropolitan Region Board accepted the broadband situation analysis report at a meeting Aug. 13. The report looks at the state of internet access in the capital region and the potential economic impacts of improvements to it. Broadband connectivity is absolutely and fundamentally essential to the Regions long-term social and economic prosperity, the report found, especially as e-commerce and new technologies such as autonomous vehicles take hold. While Edmonton and its urban neighbours generally have decent download speeds, the report found rural areas lag significantly behind. Sturgeon County has the lowest maimum advertised speeds on average in the region at 25 megabits per second roughly half the CRTCs target of 50 Mbps. Downloading big bucks An economic analysis in the report found the Edmonton region could add up to $412 million to its GDP per year if it achieves 50 Mbps download speeds region-wide, or about $1 billion if it reaches 100 Mbps. Sturgeon County would see a 1.17-per-cent increase to GDP (about $18.81 million a year) with 100 Mbps speeds, the report found. The report estimated broadband services such as telecommuting could reduce vehicle trips in the Edmonton region by about 10 per cent, preventing some 300,000 tonnes (about 70,000 cars) worth of greenhouse gas emissions per year. Broadband could also reduce the need for hospital admissions through virtual doctors' visits and improve farm productivity through precision agriculture. Sturgeon Countys internet access is spotty in many regions as it is based on line-of-sight towers, eplained Mayor Alanna Hnatiw. It has too few people to justify investment by internet providers, and is too close to the high-speed region that is Edmonton to qualify for federal broadband grants. The report found St. Albert has done much to improve broadband access through its Smart City Master Plan and efforts to run fibre optics to traffic signals and along major roads, but still has poor speeds in its industrial parks. Morinville businesses theoretically have high-speed access, but also face costs of up to $100,000 to get it. The report called on area governments to create a common regional strategy for broadband development, one that would aim to achieve download speeds of up to and beyond 10 gigabits per second in the Edmonton region by 2025. This could involve creating Crown corporations or municipally owned data networks. Hnatiw said Sturgeon County is now doing regional speed tests as part of its own broadband improvement plans. Regional governments could improve download speeds by pooling their cash to invest in new infrastructure and creating common policies (such as requiring fibre optic lines to be run to new neighbourhoods at the same time you lay the pipes for them)."}, {"title": "University of Saskatchewan; Agtech to the rescue in a pandemic: adapting plant labs for human testing", "article": "2020 AUG 27 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Agriculture Week -- Just as redeploying a fleet of small British fishing boats helped during the Battle of Dunkirk, marshalling the research equipment and expertise of the many agtech labs around the world could help combat pandemics, say the authors of a just-published article in Nature Biotechnology. Sophisticated agtech labs and equipment used for crop and animal breeding, seed testing, and monitoring of plant and animal diseases could easily be adapted for diagnostic testing and tracing in a human pandemic or epidemic, the article states. \"If there is anything this current pandemic has shown us, it is that we need to mobilize efforts on a large scale to ramp up diagnostics,\" said lead author Steven Webb, chief executive officer of the Global Institute for Food Security (GIFS) at the University of Saskatchewan (USask). \"We must mobilize 'large ships' to fight pandemics by exploiting and adapting the screening capacity of high-throughput plant breeding laboratories which can rapidly analyze hundreds of thousands of samples.\" The authors urge a national or international effort to co-ordinate rapid redeployment of digital agriculture infrastructure for pandemic preparedness. This approach would relieve the pressure on limited testing tools in the health sector and speed up the ability to respond with treatment and measures to contain the spread and occurrence of disease. \"Agtech has the infrastructure and capacity to support this need through its versatile equipment that can be used for very large-scale and automated applications including genetic testing and sequencing, virus detection, protein analysis, and gene expression,\" Webb said. For instance, automated analysis of new plant varieties could be quickly switched to the automated detection of viral RNA or proteins, as well as detection of neutralizing antibodies, in humans. Selection of the fittest plant cultivars for breeding could be replaced by confirmation of patient diagnose of infectious diseases. \"As an example, the Omics and Precision Agriculture Laboratory (OPAL) at GIFS combines the digital data analysis of plant genes and traits with the latest precision agriculture technologies, and can provide a complete profile and data analysis of 3,000 plant samples per day,\" said Webb. \"Appropriate quality control measures would guide OPAL's switch from plant sample testing and analysis to human sample diagnostics during a pandemic, complying with regulation and using processes personnel are trained to employ.\" GIFS has already lent equipment to enable expanded testing of COVID-19 blood samples and has donated materials and supplies to the Saskatchewan Health Authority. The article notes that pandemics also affect animals and plants, with severe consequences for human food security, the economy, the environment, and society. For instance, the Great Famine in Ireland caused by the potato blight in the 1800s led to one million deaths and the spread of the blight in Europe claimed another 100,000 lives. The article stresses the need to be able to adapt available agtech infrastructure from 'peacetime' applications to emergency use for diagnostic testing. This requires development of contingency protocols at national and international levels. \"There needs to be comprehensive quality control, standardizing the process and outcomes of this high-capacity testing of pandemic diagnostic samples,\" Webb said. As well, there's a need to invest in agricultural technologies that can easily be adapted for medical use during pandemics. \"We need to be proactive to fight the next one. A proactive approach on all fronts will ensure the world is more prepared with the infrastructure and resources needed to respond to a pandemic,\" said Webb.

The technology uses artificial intelligence to detect weeds and other crop pests while passing over a field. This is estimated to reduce pesticide use by up to 95 per cent while maintaining crop yield, saving farmers approximately $52 per acre per growing season. Additionally, the technology can be retrofitted to upgrade new or existing sprayers, making it suitable for all Canadian farmers. The $26.2 million project is being led by Precision.ai Inc., Sure Growth Solutions Inc., Exceed Grain Marketing and the Global Institute for Food Security (GIFS) at the University of Saskatchewan. The partners are together investing $13.4 million into the project, with Protein Industries Canada investing the remaining $12.8 million. Approximately 120 new Canadian jobs are expected to be created through the project within the next five years. \"This new project supported by the Protein Supercluster is a great example of how the superclusters are bringing innovation to farming practices, using advanced technology like artificial intelligence (AI) and creating new well-paying jobs. Through a collaborative effort between three SMEs and a university research centre, this project has the potential to dramatically reduce chemical pesticide use without sacrificing crop yield or quality,\" said the Honourable Navdeep Bains, Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry. Designed by Canadians for Canadian farmers, the technology is intended to address the needs of the Canadian agriculture landscape first and foremost. It can, however, be used anywhere in the world, diversifying and strengthening Canada's economy and providing benefits for farmers around the world. \"The effect this new technology will have on Canada's plant-protein sector is tremendous,\" Protein Industries Canada CEO Bill Greuel said. \"Consumers want plant-protein products that were grown sustainably, without sacrificing on quality or economic value. This is particularly true in international trade where, despite Canada's reputation as a supplier of high-quality agrifoods, our products are facing increasing testing. Thanks to the work being done by Precision.ai, Sure Growth Solutions, Exceed Grain Marketing and GIFS, Canada's plant proteins are one step closer to being the highlight of plates of consumers around the world.\" Once the technology is fully developed, Precision.ai Inc., Sure Growth Solutions Inc., Exceed Grain Marketing and GIFS will expand on the project. Commodities grown using the technology will be tested for international maximum residue level (MRL) compliance and protein content. Both streams of testing will strengthen international market opportunities. \"This project embodies our mission of lowering pesticide use by combining artificial intelligence and robotic automation to achieve precision application,\" said Daniel McCann, CEO & Founder of Precision.ai. \"Our partnership with PIC, Sure Growth Solutions, Exceed Grain Marketing and GIFS is the perfect balance of innovation and industry expertise to deliver a paradigm-defining solution that protects money, time and the environment to make healthier, more sustainable food for everyone.\" \"We have known for some time there were better ways to allocate the time and resources for our clients around pesticide use, particularly with weed control,\" said Terry Aberhart, CEO of Sure Growth Solutions Inc. \"This combination of technologies will allow us to do this in a way that makes sense without sacrificing yield or quality, and having it built and tested locally will ensure its fit for our Canadian farmers. We are very excited to help change the way the world sprays and continue to support farmers help make the world a better place for future generations.\" \"As global demand continues to grow for high-quality products, we are looking to help Canadian producers be influential on an international level,\" Exceed Grain Marketing President Derek Squair said. \"Food safety, maximum residue limits and sustainable practices are some of the top concerns for Canada's markets. With cost savings to our farmers, the technology we're developing is addressing those concerns, benefiting the world for future generations.\" \"At GIFS, we recognize the value of collaboration, so we work with partners to discover, develop and deliver innovative solutions for the production of globally sustainable food,\" GIFS CEO Steve Webb said. \"By joining forces with PIC, Precision.ai, Sure Growth Solutions and Exceed Grain Marketing on this exciting project, we are developing innovative technologies to precisely target crop inputs when and where needed, making production agriculture more efficient and more economically, environmentally and socially sustainable.\" This is Protein Industries Canada's ninth project announcement.

The research project commenced earlier this year and involves a collaboration with Vancouver-based agtech company Terramera's Actigate(tm) technology platform, which aims to reduce global synthetic pesticide use by 80 per cent by 2030. \"The growing world population needs more food and we need to grow food that is environmentally sustainable,\" says SFU computing science professor Martin Ester, who is the principal investigator for the project. \"One approach is to develop organic pesticides that are as effective as chemical pesticides, but less harmful to the environment.\" Distinguished for his research in the fields of data mining and machine learning, Ester was named a Royal Society of Canada (RSC) Fellow last year. The newly funded project will develop data mining methods that learn from data about the effectiveness of a small number of chemical formulations that have been tested in the lab to predict the effectiveness of a much larger number of potential formulations. Robots will be used to efficiently carry out the lab experiments, and image analysis technology will be employed to analyze the images of the treated plants to assess the treatment effect. Ester adds the latest funding will sustain the new research project for two years and involves Terramera testing some of the organic pesticides being developed at its test fields located on Prince Edward Island, with the hope to eventually commercialize the technology for mass production. WHY IT MATTERS A ballooning global population is expected to outpace food production, and could threaten food security the world over. But this is also driving greater innovation in agricultural practices to make them more sustainable and environment-friendly. Ester's team of students and researchers--including Ghassan Hamarneh and Mo Chen--also from computing science, hope to use machine learning, image analysis and robotics to advance the use of precision agriculture to improve the effectiveness of organic pesticides vis-a-vis chemical pesticides. The latter are still used far more widely, given their greater effectiveness in protecting crops, but their extensive use has resulted in increased soil and groundwater toxicity and environmental pollution.

Excluding $9.8 million of revenue generated from the BPO in the prior year period, revenue in the second quarter of 2020 increased 31% compared to the second quarter of 2019 as a result of increased demand in the U.S. and APAC regions. Gross profit in the second quarter of 2020 was $1.9 million compared to $4.6 million in the second quarter of 2019. Gross margin increased significantly to 40.3% compared to 34.8% in the second quarter of 2019. The margin improvement was primarily driven by lower margins on the BPO during 2019. Total operating expenses in the second quarter of 2020 declined to $3.4 million compared to $5.4 million in the second quarter of 2019. The improvement was primarily driven by cost-savings from the reduction in staffing and closure of certain facilities as a result of the Company's previously implemented consolidation strategy. Net loss in the second quarter of 2020 was $1.5 million or $(0.01) per share, compared to a net loss of $0.7 million or $(0.01) per share in the second quarter of 2019.

According to news reporting out of Toronto, Canada, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"Spatial information on crop nutrient status is central for monitoring vegetation health, plant productivity and managing nutrient optimization programs in agricultural systems. This study maps the spatial variability of leaf chlorophyll content within fields with differing quantities of nitrogen fertilizer application, using multispectral Landsat-8 OLI data (30 m).\" Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the University of Toronto, \"Leaf chlorophyll content and leaf area index measurements were collected at 15 wheat (Triticum aestivum) sites and 13 corn (Zea mays) sites approximately every 10 days during the growing season between May and September 2013 near Stratford, Ontario. Of the 28 sites, 9 sites were within controlled areas of zero nitrogen fertilizer application. Hyperspectral leaf reflectance measurements were also sampled using an Analytical Spectral Devices FieldSpecPro spectroradiometer (400-2500 nm). A two-step inversion process was developed to estimate leaf chlorophyll content from Landsat-8 satellite data at the sub-field scale, using linked canopy and leaf radiative transfer models. Firstly, at the leaf-level, leaf chlorophyll content was modelled using the PROSPECT model, using both hyperspectral and simulated mulitspectral Landsat-8 bands from the same leaf sample. Hyperspectral and multispectral validation results were both strong (R-2 = 0.79, RMSE = 13.62 mu g/cm(2)and R-2 = 0.81, RMSE = 9.45 mu g/cm(2), respectively). Secondly, leaf chlorophyll content was estimated from Landsat-8 satellite imagery for 7 dates within the growing season, using PROSPECT linked to the 4-Scale canopy model. The Landsat-8 derived estimates of leaf chlorophyll content demonstrated a strong relationship with measured leaf chlorophyll values (R-2 = 0.64, RMSE = 16.18 mu g/cm(2)), and compared favourably to correlations between leaf chlorophyll and the best performing tested spectral vegetation index (Green Normalised Difference Vegetation Index, GNDVI; R-2 = 0.59).\" According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"This research provides an operational basis for modelling within-field variations in leaf chlorophyll content as an indicator of plant nitrogen stress, using a physically-based modelling approach, and opens up the possibility of exploiting a wealth of multispectral satellite data and UAV-mounted multispectral imaging systems.\" Our news journalists report that additional information may be obtained by contacting Holly Croft, University of Toronto, Dept. of Geography, 100 St George St, Toronto, On M5S 3G3, Canada.

According to news reporting originating from Charlottetown, Canada, by VerticalNews correspondents, research stated, \"Proximal sensing techniques can potentially survey soil and crop variables responsible for variations in crop yield. The full potential of these precision agriculture technologies may be exploited in combination with innovative methods of data processing such as machine learning (ML) algorithms for the extraction of useful information responsible for controlling crop yield.\" Financial supporters for this research include Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada. The news editors obtained a quote from the research from University of Prince Edward Island: \"Four ML algorithms, namely linear regression (LR), elastic net (EN), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), and support vector regression (SVR), were used to predict potato (* * Solanum tuberosum* * ) tuber yield from data of soil and crop properties collected through proximal sensing. Six fields in Atlantic Canada including three fields in Prince Edward Island (PE) and three fields in New Brunswick (NB) were sampled, over two (2017 and 2018) growing seasons, for soil electrical conductivity, soil moisture content, soil slope, normalized-difference vegetative index (NDVI), and soil chemistry. Data were collected from 39-40 30 x 30 m2 locations in each field, four times throughout the growing season, and yield samples were collected manually at the end of the growing season. Four datasets, namely PE-2017, PE-2018, NB-2017, and NB-2018, were then formed by combing data points from three fields to represent the province data for the respective years. Modeling techniques were employed to generate yield predictions assessed with different statistical parameters. The SVR models outperformed all other models for NB-2017, NB-2018, PE-2017, and PE-2018 dataset with RMSE of 5.97, 4.62, 6.60, and 6.17 t/ha, respectively. The performance of k-NN remained poor in three out of four datasets, namely NB-2017, NB-2018, and PE-2017 with RMSE of 6.93, 5.23, and 6.91 t/ha, respectively.\" According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The study also showed that large datasets are required to generate useful results using either model.

But here's the problem - if just one person within a rural hexagon has paid thousands of dollars to get high-speed service on their property, everyone else within that area will not qualify for support from the federal government for broadband access.

The trial will evaluate optimal hive distribution for application of BVT's biological fungicide, CR-7, in sunflower crops in North Dakota. The project is funded by the North Dakota Department of Agriculture, is approved by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), and will be run by NDSU in cooperation with BVT. In addition to the trials with NDSU, the Company will be doing demonstration trials in Minnesota and Idaho with key sunflower growers. Setup of the trials is complete, with blooming season expected to start in early August. \"This is an exciting trial because it will allow us to determine which segments of the sunflower industry, which is valued at nearly US$470 million through 1.3 million harvested acres annually in America alone, we can participate in, and help determine the optimal bee hive distribution to apply CR-7 in the fight against Sclerotinia head rot. The disease is a major challenge for sunflower producers and identified as a high priority by the National Sunflower Association. The heightened need for a cure has led to the state electing to fund the trial,\" said Ashish Malik, chief executive officer of Bee Vectoring Technologies. \"BVT is focused on improving agriculture sustainability, and this trial aligns 100% with that focus. As a large field crop, pinpointing optimal hive distribution impacts sunflower growers greatly. Too little hive distribution impacts efficacy and too much is an economic hardship for them.\" Sclerotinia head rot is a very serious constraint to sunflower production that has led some growers to abandon production. Crop rotation and fungicides are ineffective against this disease, and partially-resistant hybrids are not available. The study will validate the technology, quantify distribution of hives needed to achieve satisfactory head rot control, and address a significant need in the sunflower industry. In the BVT system, commercially-reared bees come into contact with the biological control agent as they exit their hives. As they pollinate the sunflower florets, they deposit the agent directly into each bloom. In trials conducted in 2016, 2017 and 2018, bees were used to inoculate sunflower heads with CR-7, BVT's fungal biological control agent, resulting in 33-60% reductions in Sclerotinia head rot under moderate to severe disease pressure. The goal of these trials is to develop a disease management strategy for strong, consistent control of head rot, even under severe disease pressure. Results will be disseminated to producers and industry stakeholders at outreach meetings, in trade publications, and with reports published online. \"The disease management practices we help develop doesn't just impact North Dakota producers,\" said Mr. Malik. \"They are directly applicable to producers in neighboring states (Minnesota, Montana, and South Dakota) and provinces (Manitoba and Saskatchewan).

The app supports teachers in preparing their curriculum, while offline features assist during electricity blackouts in rural areas, as well as interactive learning using AR and 4D learning support. The Myanmar Government plans to provide cash support to 300,000 students who are in need of financial assistance in the new academic year. The cash support is aimed to ensure that students from the poor financial backgrounds stay in school. Since 2014, with the help of the World Bank and partner organisations, the government has supported students with financial needs in 57 townships in Kachin, Kayah, Kayin, Chin, Sagaing, Tanintharyi, Bago, Magwe and Mandalay regions and states. The Education Ministry has set the start of the academic year for high schools to 21 July, with primary and middle schools reopening two weeks later. Malaysia As of 1 July, the Ministry of Education announced a staggered reopening for remaining school years starting from 15 July for the rest of secondary and upper primary, and 22 July for lower primary students. Sports and co-curricular activities however will continue to be restricted. These changes are applicable to all government schools, government-aided schools, private schools and any learning institutions registered with the Ministry of Education. The Ministry of Education has also indicated that universities will be able to reopen campuses for face-to-face teaching to all students in the coming month. The UK Government has recently promoted the new streamlined immigration route for graduates. The Graduate Route will be available from 2021, allowing students starting in 2020 to stay and work, or look for work in the UK, at any skill level for two years. This comes along with the push for Malaysian students to continue to consider UK universities and programs regardless of travel restrictions. The Philippines The General Community Quarantine (GCQ) in Metro Manila has been extended until 15 July due to a rise in confirmed cases and virus hotspots. Metro Manila along with 11 other areas in Luzon and Visayas region are in GCQ, while Cebu City remains under stricter lockdown (Enhanced Community Quarantine). The rest of the Philippines has been placed under Modified General Community Quarantine -- the most relaxed phase, wherein public transportation may resume, very limited gatherings are allowed and businesses may resume operations at half capacity. Most major organisations are still opting to work from home to reduce exposure. The Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA), and the Philippines' VET regulatory body has been developing free online courses for management in response to COVID-19. The aim is to increase the knowledge and deployment of safety practices and prevention against the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace, while commuting or in public places for essential activities. These courses were developed compiling relevant programs from third party experts and made available via the TESDA Online Program. Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade launched from 1 July 2020 \"A Future That Works\" program in partnership with the Philippine Business for Education (PBEd) and the International Labour Association (ILO).

Thailand Thailand's Ministry of Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation has launched a new online learning platform 'Future Skill x New Career Thailand' to build the capabilities of tomorrow's workforce. More than 100 higher education institutions, private organisations and government agencies have been invited to develop non-degree programs for reskilling and upskilling the workforce of the future. Learners will be able to access over 800 courses, both online and offline modules via this platform for free, (noting some exceptions will be charged at 1,000 Thai Baht /A$44 per course). Focused skills include Smart Farming, Care Givers, Smart Tourism, Digital Data, Food for the Future, Industrial Robotics, Smart Innovative Entrepreneur and Creative Content. The Pearson PTE Academic (UKVI) test is now available in Thailand. The UK Government recently approved Pearson PTE as a Secure English Language Test (SELT) for UK Visa and Immigration (UKVI) purposes. There are two types of SELT tests: PTE Academic and PTE Home. The PTE Academic can be used to apply for UK universities. Students can sit for the PTE Academic UKVI or PTE Home exams at their test centre in Bangkok. The test is equivalent to IELTS UKVI which will help overseas students move faster towards studying in the UK. Several UK universities have confirmed they will welcome new international students to their campuses this September as a regular intake despite the high number of ongoing COVID-19 cases. Thai students that are uncertain about the COVID-19 situation in the UK, are seeking to defer their studies to the January 2021 intake (if available). Alternatively, some have decided to study online this year and return back to campus later next year if and when the pandemic has eased. Vietnam The number of COVID-19 cases in Vietnam stands at 355 with no new infections as reported on 2 July, which is also 77 days straight without community transmission in the country. Vietnam has suspended the entry of all foreigners from March 22 until further notice to limit the spread of COVID-19. The measure will not apply to diplomats, officials, foreign investors, experts, and skilled workers. The Ministry of Education and Training has confirmed high school examinations will be held on 9 and 10 August. Local universities and vocational colleagues can use the exam results for recruitment. The Ministry of Education and Training is planning to implement the Vietnam National Qualifications Framework (VQF). The objective of the VQF is to have equivalent recognition of Vietnamese qualifications to those of regional and international qualifications. This will present opportunities for Australian education providers to expand partnership with Vietnam. The US Agency for International Development (USAID) gave a grant of US$4.65 million to Fulbright University Vietnam (FUV) to help further its goal of achieving international accreditation. USAID will also help FUV develop executive education and other programs, through which FUV will build partnerships with Vietnam's technology, manufacturing and service sectors. On 22 June, UK Visa Application Centres reopened in Vietnam after a temporary suspension during the pandemic. The resumed UK visa operations in Vietnam marked an important step in restoring travel and business activities of the Vietnamese community to the UK. Europe The European Commission is negotiating arrangements for a EUR750 billion recovery fund to support the relaunch of the European economy, following the devastating economic and social impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Entitled Next Generation EU, the fund includes more support for the EU's renowned Horizon research program, which would increase to EUR94.4 billion to fund research in the areas of health, resilience, and green and digital transitions. The proposal also includes more funding for the EU's highly successful Erasmus+ mobility program, one of the largest student mobility programs in the world, however the suggested increase is less than the previous doubling of the program budget that had been proposed prior to the pandemic. The final details for the fund are yet to be confirmed, pending the outcome of negotiations with individual member nations. Russia The Russian Air Transport Agency 'Rosaviation', has advised airports and airlines on the extension of the ban on entry into Russia by foreigners until 1 August.

The Ministry of Science and Higher Education has announced that the 'traditional delivery' of courses will begin again in October. The final decision will depend on the pandemic situation and will be made by individual universities. Some universities have already declared that online learning will continue during the next semester (October 2020 - February 2021). United Kingdom The PM has announced that international PhD students who complete their degrees in the UK will have the opportunity to apply for a post-study work visa of up to three years. The new visa is designed to attract and retain 'world-class' researchers to develop 'moon shots' and drive innovation as the UK economy recovers from the coronavirus crisis. The Minister of State for Universities, Michelle Donelan, has announced that as of 2021, students from EU countries will no longer be eligible for the home fees at English universities, nor will they be able to get a loan to pay them from Student Finance England. Local tuition fees are PS9,250, whereas international fees range from PS10,000 - PS38,000 depending on the degree. Italy The Milan Politecnico, one of the leading universities in Italy, announced plans to employ 50 researchers in 2020 and 150 in 2021. The Politecnico has also launched a EUR60 million venture capital fund to support innovation and start-ups. The announcement was made as part of a program to highlight how Italian industries are working towards a relaunch of the economy, to face the challenges and seize opportunities that have arisen during the coronavirus crisis. The Minister for Universities and Research has announced that all Italian universities intend to be open for attendance on campus by 14 September. This will be managed by offering a blended learning approach at least during the first semester, with lessons alternated between on campus and online. In some universities, it will be possible to make a booking to attend campus via an online system. In order to manage exams and laboratory sessions, some universities will divide students into smaller groups. Middle East and Africa United Arab Emirates The UAE Cabinet has announced a number of changes, and new appointments at the leadership level. In the next two years, the focus will be to transform 50 per cent of Government services into digital portals. As part of the initiative to merge 50 per cent of federal and other entities, the National Qualifications Authority will be merged with the Ministry of Education. This revamp of the cabinet structure is considered a strategic announcement to prepare the country for a post COVID-19 future. Pakistan The Ministry of Education sought proposals to reopen higher education institutes on a trial basis. All provinces were instructed by the ministry to put forward their suggestions. An Intra-Provincial meeting with all educational stakeholders will take place by 8 July, with a decision to be made regarding upcoming exams.

We seek Safe Harbor."}, {"title": "It'S An Opportune Time To Grow Agriculture; Canadian food exporters can benefit from emerging markets, Baljit Singh writes", "article": "In the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, Canadian grocery stores were the scene of shoppers stripping the shelves bare in a frenzy to stockpile pasta, beans, flour and meat, along with a year's supply of toilet paper. Why? Because Canadians momentarily lost confidence in the sustainability of our food supply chains and turned to panic buying. Our reliance on the agri-food sector is often overlooked. We need food and we head to the grocery store, trusting we will find the carton of eggs, head of lettuce and all the other items on our list. Perhaps it takes a crisis such as the current pandemic for us to appreciate the critical nature of our agriculture industry as both a provider of our daily bread and an essential economic driver. In May, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced an aid package of $252 million for Canada's agriculture and agri-food sectors. But temporary measures such as this are meant to help the agrifood industry survive the current COVID-19 crisis. What the sector needs is targeted investment to ensure it thrives and grows in the long term. In looking at ways to diversify and strengthen our struggling economy, one sector stands out with enormous potential: the agri-food industry. The way forward requires taking action to both protect and expand a sector that's critical to both our economic recovery and to ensuring food security. As a net exporter of plant and animal food products, Canada is among a select group of countries. Exports of Canadian food supplies add to food security, not only at home but in many parts of the world. In the coming years, 2.4 billion more people will enter the middle class, mainly in the Asia-Pacific region and Africa, creating a massive opportunity for Canadian food exporters. Tapping into this emerging market would create thousands more high-quality jobs and substantially increase the $134 billion the sector already contributes to the Canadian economy - roughly seven per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), nearly equal to the oil and gas sector. Transforming our agrifood industry requires bold and visionary policies, supported by strategic investments. How do we rise to the challenge? First, we need clearer policy frameworks to foster greater trust in Canada's agriculture industry, both at home and internationally. Too many of us have little understanding of where the food on our dinner plates comes from. More programs like the new Simpson Centre for Agricultural and Food Innovation and Public Education at the University of Calgary need to be created. This centre, supported by public policy, veterinary and human health, economics, and other disciplines, aims to drive discussion and innovation of agri-food public policy. Second, our agriculture and veterinary faculties need a healthy infusion of investment dollars. Why? Canada's agriculture sector has benefited for years from the outstanding research in plant and soil science, livestock health and disease outbreaks coming from these institutions. New investment in aging infrastructure is essential. This will pay dividends, allowing knowledge leaders a more significant role in driving research for better management of infectious diseases and food safety and advancing digital agriculture technology. Third, we need a way to drive the commercialization of new technologies created in academic settings. Canadian universities lag behind many developed countries in converting innovations into actual products. Although efforts are being made to speed up this process, a more precise mechanism is needed to connect private and academic sectors, with focused support from governments. Good examples include a new stream, announced by the University of Calgary's Haskayne School of Business and the Creative Destruction Lab - Rockies, designed to help seed-stage science and technology-based startups in the agriculture and agri-food sectors. The program leverages this region's strong food and agriculture ecosystem, and new infrastructure such as W.A. Ranches at the University of Calgary. It will give companies the opportunity to connect with world-class scientists, economists, experienced entrepreneurs and business students, with the goal of commercializing and scaling their enterprises. Another example is Ottawa's superclusters initiative, which invested nearly $200 million to help create the Protein Industries Supercluster. This initiative alone is expected to add nearly $4.5 billion to GDP along with 4,500 new jobs. Lastly, we need to improve immigration policies to better support our rural communities and address the critical shortage of farm labour. We need a solution that works in the long term, by moving us away from temporary farm workers programs and looking instead to attract newcomers to make their permanent homes in rural Canada. This will require targeted recruitment of immigrants who are committed to working in the agriculture sector, as well as investment to help in the creation of small businesses in rural areas. At this uncertain moment in time, we have an exceptional opportunity to harness Canada's natural resources to further develop a sustainable and strong agri-food sector. In so doing, we can create jobs, support our rural communities, assure Canadians of their food supply and feed a growing world.

(TSXV: BEE) (OTCQB: BEVVF) (CVE: BEE) (the \"Company\" or \"BVT\") today announced that the European Patent Office (EPO) has granted a patent for BVT's Clonostachys rosea CR-7 microbial strain (CR-7), and there has been no opposition filed in the nine month post-grant window which has now closed. This patent claims the usefulness of CR-7 as a plant treatment, thus protecting a critical component of BVT's proprietary natural precision agriculture system, and has been further validated in 14 European countries (Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, UK, Greece, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Turkey). The patent has previously been granted in six countries, and is under review by another nine patent authorities around the world. \"This represents a significant expansion of the scope of our Intellectual Property in Europe, building on the EPO's earlier patent grant for our beehive dispensing apparatus,\" says Ashish Malik, CEO of Bee Vectoring Technologies. \"We now have strong patent protection in the world's largest market for fungicides, with Europe accounting for 36%[1] of the overall global fungicides market. Europe is a major opportunity for BVT, as growers there are rapidly adopting sustainable practices to reduce chemical use and environmental impacts. BVT's system is a powerful tool to help them accomplish that.\" The European patent grant (Patent Number EP3044307B1) recognizes the unique properties of BVT's proven CR-7 strain as a plant-beneficial microbe that offers natural control of various plant diseases. It also protects CR-7 independently of its use as a biologic control agent vectored by bees, enabling the Company to also develop revenue streams in foliar sprays and seed treatments in the well-established traditional global fungicide market. The current global fungicides market is valued at US$18.7 billion and projected to grow to US$24.5 billion by 2025[2]. This growth is due to increased demand for food security by a growing population, advances in farming practices and techniques, and changing climate conditions that lead to disease. Fungicides are used to destroy harmful fungi that affect crop yields. \"This patent is an important part of our larger European strategy - and our aggressive global strategy to ensure the Company is strongly positioned to capture market share around the world,\" says Mr. Malik. \"We recently established our European office in Switzerland, are working to close on Swiss regulatory approval, and are currently building out our strategy for regulatory submission to the European Union.\" This EPO patent grant is part of BVT's fungal strain family of patents in the Company's expanding patent portfolio.

This patent claims the usefulness of CR-7 as a plant treatment, thus protecting a critical component of Bee Vectoring's proprietary natural precision agriculture system, and has been further validated in 14 European countries (Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, United Kingdom, Greece, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Turkey). The patent has previously been granted in six countries, and is under review by another nine patent authorities around the world. \"This represents a significant expansion of the scope of our intellectual property in Europe, building on the EPO's earlier patent grant for our beehive dispensing apparatus,\" said Ashish Malik, chief executive officer of Bee Vectoring Technologies. \"We now have strong patent protection in the world's largest market for fungicides, with Europe accounting for 36 per cent (1) of the overall global fungicides market. Europe is a major opportunity for BVT as growers are rapidly adopting sustainable practices to reduce chemical use and environmental impacts. BVT's system is a powerful tool to help them accomplish that.\" The European patent grant (patent No. EP3044307B1) recognizes the unique properties of Bee Vectoring's proven CR-7 strain as a plant-beneficial microbe that offers natural control of various plant diseases. It also protects CR-7 independently of its use as a biologic control agent vectored by bees, enabling the company to also develop revenue streams in foliar sprays and seed treatments in the well-established traditional global fungicide market. The current global fungicides market is valued at $18.7-billion (U.S.) and projected to grow to $24.5-billion (U.S.) by 2025 (2). This growth is due to increased demand for food security by a growing population, advances in farming practices and techniques, and changing climate conditions that lead to disease. Fungicides are used to destroy harmful fungi that affect crop yields. \"This patent is an important part of our larger European strategy and our aggressive global strategy to ensure the company is strongly positioned to capture market share around the world,\" said Mr. Malik. \"We recently established our European office in Switzerland, are working to close on Swiss regulatory approval and are currently building out our strategy for regulatory submission to the European Union.\" This EPO patent grant is part of Bee Vectoring's fungal strain family of patents in the company's expanding patent portfolio. Bee Vectoring has also been granted patents in two families covering different aspects of a bumblebee hive dispensing apparatus, a family of patents covering carrier formulations that allow microbial strains to be carried by bees, and is pursuing a family of patents covering the new honeybee dispenser system that enables honeybees to be used as delivery mechanisms for CR-7 and other biological controls. Bee Vectoring has had over 65 patents granted and currently has more than 35 pending in all major agricultural regions worldwide, including North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Australia. Bee Vectoring is also pleased to announce it has closed a non-brokered private placement of 1,111,111 units at a price of 31.5 cents per unit for gross aggregate proceeds of $349,999.96. Each unit will consist of one common share and one transferable common share purchase warrant.

According to news reporting from Sherbrooke, Canada, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Clinical symptoms of B vitamin deficiency are rarely observed in ruminants because these vitamins are synthesized by the rumen microbiota. However, over the last decades, numerous reports of beneficial effects on production and metabolic efficiency of dairy cows have been published supporting that, under some conditions, B vitamin subclinical deficiency is present in these animals.\" The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Center for Research, \"Due to their roles as coenzymes or cofactors in major metabolic pathways, an adequate supply in B vitamins is critical to optimize metabolic efficiency. Nowadays, taking into account the growing interest for the Smart Farming concept, fulfilling ruminant requirements for B vitamins according to their physiological stage under different feeding management cannot be neglected. In dairy cows, B vitamin supply is greatly dependent of the activity of the ruminal microbiota. Indeed, the amount of vitamins reaching the small intestine is dependent of the utilization of the vitamins provided by the diet and their synthesis by the microorganisms present in the rumen. The two major challenges faced to determine B vitamin status of ruminants are the difficulty to estimate B vitamin supply due to the lack of knowledge on factors driving the fate of B vitamins in the digestive tract, especially in the rumen, and the choice and thresholds of biomarkers reflecting adequately the animal status.\" According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The present paper aims to present the actual state of knowledge on the methodological approaches used to estimate B vitamin supply and status of ruminant and to point out future research orientations.\" Our news journalists report that additional information may be obtained by contacting C.L.

By adding Michigan's 20,000(3) acres, Bee Vectoring has now penetrated 83 per cent of the U.S. blueberry market. \"With these new deals, BVT has successfully penetrated key blueberry growing markets throughout the U.S. in a single growing season,\" said Ashish Malik, chief executive officer of Bee Vectoring Technologies. \"Since [Environmental Protection Agency] approval in September, 2019, we have entered the Georgia, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Michigan, Oregon and Washington blueberry markets, as well as the Florida strawberry market.\" The newly signed blueberry growers are first-time users of the Bee Vectoring system. They will pilot Bee Vectoring on a percentage of their conventional crops, with the expectation that they will expand it to their entire operations over two to three seasons, based on positive results. Strong word of mouth from growers working with Bee Vectoring will also attract new customers in subsequent seasons. \"We are delighted with the response from American blueberry growers,\" continued Mr. Malik. \"We've had success with growers in this crop, including during these difficult times with limited travel and face-to-face interaction with the growers due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This speaks volumes for BVT's value proposition of helping farmers control crop disease and increase yields through sustainable agriculture practices. We've expanded sales according to our business plan, and this puts us well on our way to revenue acceleration over the course of the next two to three seasons.\" Bee Vectoring's natural precision agriculture system uses commercially managed bees to carry an all-natural plant protection product, Vectorite with CR-7, directly to blooms. The system increases crop yield and protects against disease while using only a fraction of the product required with traditional spray applications. Growers using the Bee Vectoring system also see significant reductions in water consumption and fossil fuel usage. (1) (3) Source: USDA, 2018 agricultural statistics annual.

According to news reporting originating in Sherbrooke, Canada, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Clinical symptoms of B vitamin deficiency are rarely observed in ruminants because these vitamins are synthesized by the rumen microbiota. However, over the last decades, numerous reports of beneficial effects on production and metabolic efficiency of dairy cows have been published supporting that, under some conditions, B vitamin subclinical deficiency is present in these animals.\" The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Center for Research, \"Due to their roles as coenzymes or cofactors in major metabolic pathways, an adequate supply in B vitamins is critical to optimize metabolic efficiency. Nowadays, taking into account the growing interest for the Smart Farming concept, fulfilling ruminant requirements for B vitamins according to their physiological stage under different feeding management cannot be neglected. In dairy cows, B vitamin supply is greatly dependent of the activity of the ruminal microbiota. Indeed, the amount of vitamins reaching the small intestine is dependent of the utilization of the vitamins provided by the diet and their synthesis by the microorganisms present in the rumen. The two major challenges faced to determine B vitamin status of ruminants are the difficulty to estimate B vitamin supply due to the lack of knowledge on factors driving the fate of B vitamins in the digestive tract, especially in the rumen, and the choice and thresholds of biomarkers reflecting adequately the animal status.\" According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The present paper aims to present the actual state of knowledge on the methodological approaches used to estimate B vitamin supply and status of ruminant and to point out future research orientations.\" Our news correspondents report that additional information may be obtained by contacting C.L.

It's a social, cultural, and economic lifeline,\" said Jamie McGarvey, president of the Association of Municipalities of Ontario. \"We look forward to seeing it implemented as quickly as possible to connect homes and businesses that lack adequate service. McGarvey added, \"Municipal governments will continue to work with other governments and stakeholders to find solutions that will deliver affordable, reliable access to broadband across Ontario.\" This investment will allow for the creation of more economic and educational opportunities in rural, remote, and underserved areas of the province. \"By doing their part and staying home to help stop the spread of COVID-19, the people of Ontario have demonstrated the need to be connected to learn, work, and run their businesses,\" said Ontario's minister of infrastructure, Laurie Scott. \"It appears that functioning remotely will continue to be a regular way of life for many in this new environment, and fast reliable Internet will be critical.\" On the government's website, they lay out their plan. They call this their \"Digital First\" strategy. Expanding broadband and cellular access will become an important component of the Digital First strategy.  Fast, reliable connections to the Internet are required to access digital services.  This is particularly important in rural, remote, and northern communities, where people often have to travel long distances to access services. The province says broadband and cellular networks are the foundations of the digital economy, essential for communications, employment, education, health care, doing business, and ensuring critical safety networks are always available. Consumers and employers want faster speeds, more access and affordable services. There are many reasons for this increase in demand, including the expansion of online service delivery, the rise of movie and television streaming, the increased use of connected devices, and the growth of new technologies, such as artificial intelligence, robotics, autonomous vehicles and precision agriculture. The plan, posted on the Ontario government's website outlines action on four key fronts: * delivering regional and shovel-ready projects: \"Ontario will work with partners to deliver projects that will expand broadband and cellular access in Southwestern, Eastern, and Northern Ontario.\" * launching a new program to expand access to unserved and underserved communities: \"Ontario will launch a $150 million provincial broadband and cellular infrastructure program beginning in 2020-21.\" * maximizing existing programs and government assets: \"Ontario will provide additional resources to communities to invest in broadband and cellular infrastructure by expanding existing programs and making better use of government assets, including towers, land, and buildings.\" * reducing red tape and removing barriers to infrastructure expansion: \"Ontario will cut red tape to make it easier for the government and the private sector to deliver broadband projects. This will remove hurdles that slow down development and delay broadband expansion.\" The province is partnering with school boards to implement the Broadband Modernization Program.  Minister of education Stephen Lecce said in the press release,  \"Access to high-speed Internet is foundational to our young people's success in learning, working, and innovating, today and into the future.\"  He added, \"Our government is taking action by connecting all schools to broadband, starting with high schools this September 2020 and elementary schools by September 2021.\" The government says they have completed modernization in 22 school boards, and work is underway to connect all remaining school boards. To help meet this goal, the province says it is investing $315 million over five years to focus on expanded access for unserved and underserved communities.  These investments will leverage funding from the private sector and other levels of government to directly generate up to $1 billion in total investment over five years.  This will result in access for up to 220,000 households and businesses."}, {"title": "Farmers Edge Continues Wave of Digital Disruption in Crop Insurance with Landslide of New Agency Partnerships", "article": "LINCOLN, Nebraska & WINNIPEG, Manitoba, June 9 -- Farmers Edge issued the following news release: - Agtech leader digitally transforms insurance businesses by pairing field-centric data with intelligent automation and predictive analytics, cultivating new service-driven revenue streams Farmers Edge, a global leader in digital agriculture, today announced a wave of new insurance agency partnerships with 25 companies in the United States, spanning the Mid-Atlantic to the Pacific Northwest.

A story in the Seattle Times stated MSN will lay off roughly 50 journalists at the end of June and replace them with robots -- AI algorithms that will identify the best stories, rewrite the titles and find the best photos, effectively automating most of the tasks that had been so far performed by humans. \"It's demoralizing to think machines can replace us but there you go,\" one of those being let go told the paper. Another journalist told The Guardian newspaper: \"I spend all my time reading about how automation and AI is going to take all our jobs -- now it's taken mine.\" Those unlucky journalists may just be the tip of an artificially intelligent iceberg, as we see from today's fully automated list of Five Cool Jobs That May Soon be Stolen From Puny Humans by Recently Developed Robotic Usurpers: 5) The endangered job: Sheep dog The robot usurper: It's a remarkable sight -- there's \"Spot\" trundling around a New Zealand mountainside and herding a bunch of fluffy white sheep. What makes it even more amazing -- and disturbing for some -- is that \"Spot\" is not a living, breathing canine farm worker. No, \"Spot\" is Boston Dynamics' famed four-legged robot dog that has been seen in previous videos opening doors, dancing to music, and has been used by authorities in Singapore to roam public parks and remind people to maintain a safe social distance from each other. In a new video posted by robotics software company Rocos, Spot is seen roaming the New Zealand grasslands, displaying its shepherding skills with a group of confused sheep. The video highlights various advancements in precision agriculture that the world's most advanced robodog -- guided by infrared cameras, real-time mapping technologies and advanced sensors -- could make possible, such as corralling sheep without the supervision of humans. \"Robots, like Spot from Boston Dynamics, increase accuracy in yield estimates, relieve the strain of worker shortages, and create precision in farming,\" Rocos wrote in its YouTube video description. Rocos chief executive David Inggs chirped: \"Our customers are augmenting their human workforces to automate physical processes that are often dull, dirty, or dangerous.\" Spot can check on crops and clamber over rough terrain, but not everyone is keen on robotic sheepdogs. \"The robot might be an amazing tool for lots of things but it is worthless and unwanted as a sheepdog,\" James Rebanks, who wrote a book about his life as a shepherd in England, told theverge.com. \"No one who works with sheep needs or wants this -- it is a fantasy.\" 4) The endangered job: Massage therapist The robot usurper: If you are uncomfortable around robots, this item will no doubt rub you the wrong way. In October 2017, Emma started work at the NovaHealth Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) clinic in Singapore. Specializing in back and knee massages, Emma was quickly doing the work of two human masseuses. As you have no doubt already deduced, Emma is a robot; her name is short for Expert Manipulative Massage Automation, an intelligent device that mimics the human palm and thumb to replicate therapeutic massages such as shiatsu and physiotherapy. \"Emma 3.0 -- the first to go into public service -- is a third more compact than the first prototype unveiled last year, offers a wider range of massage programmes and provides a massage that is described by patients as almost indistinguishable from a professional masseuse,\" according to the website phys.org. Emma doesn't look especially human. Instead, we're talking about a fully articulated robotic limb with six degrees of freedom and a touchscreen. Mounted at the end of the arm are two soft massage tips made from silicon, which can be warmed for comfort. Emma is also equipped with advanced sensors and diagnostic functions -- the data is sent to a cloud server -- which can measure the precise stiffness of a muscle or tendon. The device was developed by AiTreat, a technology startup company launched at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. \"By using Emma to do the labour-intensive massages, we can now offer a longer therapy session for patients while reducing the cost of treatment,\" AiTreat founder Albert Zhang said in a news release. \"The human therapist is then free to focus on other areas, such as the neck and limb joints, which Emma can't massage at the moment.\" The future is looking a lot brighter -- for people with bad backs. 3) The endangered job: Delivery person The robot usurper: You've ordered something special online and you can't wait for it to arrive at your doorstep. Suddenly, there's a loud knock, you fling open the door and there, thrusting a package at you, is the delivery guy. But, assuming you have been paying attention, you know this is not an ordinary human delivery guy. No, this is Digit, a two-legged humanoid robot designed to move in a more dynamic fashion than old-school robots do. We're talking nimble limbs and a torso packed with sensors that allow it to navigate complex environments and carry out tasks, like delivering your long-awaited package. Digit was created by Agility Robotics, which is committed to building legged machines that can go anywhere a person can go. In 2019, they unveiled Digit, which has advanced feet that allow it to balance on one foot and overcome various obstacles, new sensors to perceive and map the world for navigation, and customer-ready, powerful onboard computer hardware. Speaking of customers, the very first out of the gate was Ford, which snapped up the first two Digit robots in January. Ford formed a partnership with the robotics firm to develop a solution for so-called \"last mile\" deliveries. \"Even if Ford had a perfect self-driving car today, when it comes to deliveries, the human recipient still needs to meet the vehicle to grab their goods,\" according to cenet.com. \"That's where Digit is meant to come in. The friendly robot can complete a delivery process, though Ford and Agility think it'll be a splendid addition to warehouses as well.\" Ford has been testing how Digit and its autonomous vehicles can work together to transport a package the last few metres to a customer, going from the sidewalk to the door. \"Digit's unique design allows it to tightly fold itself up for easy storage in the back of a vehicle until it's called into action. Once a vehicle arrives at its destination, this two-legged robot grabs the package inside the vehicle and carries out the final step in the delivery process,\" according to inceptivemind.com. \"And in case, if it encounters an unexpected obstacle, it can send an image back to the vehicle to leverage additional computing power.\" 2) The endangered job: Standup comedian The robot usurper: So this robot walks into a bar to star in a live comedy show. If you think we're kidding, the joke's on you. There Jon was, onstage, telling his audience he has a hard time getting bookings. \"They always think I'm too robotic,\" Jon deadpans, according to sciencedaily.com. If big laughs follow, he chirps: \"Please tell the booking agents how funny that joke was.\" If there's the sound of crickets, he follows up with: \"Sorry about that. I think I got caught in a loop. Please tell the booking agents that you like me ... that you like me ... that you like me ... that you like me.\" Which is killer material, especially (and we hope you figured this out) if you happen to be a cute little robot. According to sciencedaily.com and the CBC, Jon the Robot, with assistance from Oregon State University researcher Naomi Fitter, recently wrapped up a 32-show tour of comedy clubs in greater Los Angeles and in Oregon, generating guffaws and more importantly data that scientists and engineers can use to help robots and people relate more effectively with one another via humour. Fitter, whose hobby is standup, programs Jon, but also writes the jokes, books his stand-up gigs and holds the microphone for him as he performs. \"Social robots and autonomous social agents are becoming more and more ingrained in our everyday lives,\" said Fitter, assistant professor of robotics in the OSU College of Engineering. \"Lots of them tell jokes to engage users -- most people understand that humour, especially nuanced humour, is essential to relationship building. But it's challenging to develop entertaining jokes for robots that are funny beyond the novelty level.\" Jon needed to boost its level of comedic intelligence -- to learn based on how an audience responded when and how to deliver the next line or what joke to tell. So Fitter programmed Jon with what she calls, \"adaptive timing,\" enabling Jon to hear the laughter and wait for it to die down before delivering a follow up joke. \"Hello, I'm Jon,\" the robot says on video, pausing. \"Of course, that is not my real name, but humans have trouble pronouncing (he emits dialup sounds).\" It's all in the name of science, but it sounds funny to us. 1) The endangered job: NHL hockey player The robot usurper: If you grew up watching the TV series Lost in Space and the sci-fi classic Forbidden Planet, you probably assume it's only a matter of time before robots take over the world and make humans their slaves. But even in your wildest dreams, you likely never expected to see the day a robot would be able to strap on the blades and duke it out with Connor McDavid and Alexander Ovechkin in the NHL. Well, that day isn't here yet, but it feels like it's getting closer because academics in Switzerland last year revealed a robot than can teach itself to walk, roller skate -- and even skate on ice. It's called \"Skaterbot\" and it was created from 3D-printed modular parts. \"I envision a moment in the not-too-distant future where it will be as easy to create robots as it is to currently make structures out of LEGO blocks,\" Stelian Coros, a professor at the Computational Robotics Lab at ETH Zurich and Skaterbot's co-creator, told the BBC. \"The only thing we tell it is how one ice skate behaves on ice,\" Coros said, explaining that after this stage the robot figures out how to move across the ice by itself. The modular robot can then work out where its four connected legs need to be balanced in order to steer itself around on its tiny skates. In last year's ETH Zurich's RETHINKING DESIGN exhibition in Davos, part of the World Economic Forum 2019, Coros and his team displayed two versions of the Skaterbot -- one with wheeled legs and another with ice-skating blades. A video showed Skaterbot on the ice competing with players from the local hockey club in Davos. \"Considering these were our first baby steps on ice, I think that our robot did quite well. But it surely shows us that we have much more to go in in terms of being able to match the skill and ability that we see in humans,\" Coros said on the video, in which Skaterbot displays all the hockey sense of a traffic cone. Considering it doesn't have arms, high-sticking shouldn't be a problem. doug.speirs@freepress.mb.ca"}, {"title": "Science - Geoscience; Researchers from University of Prince Edward Island Report on Findings in Geoscience (How Can Potatoes Be Smartly Cultivated With Biochar As a Soil Nutrient Amendment Technique In Atlantic Canada?)", "article": "2020 JUN 12 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Science Letter -- Investigators discuss new findings in Science - Geoscience.

The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from the University of Prince Edward Island, \"Three replicates of twelve lysimeters, each 8000 cm(2), were packed with an Atlantic Canada representative soil to cultivate potatoes with four treatments of soil amendments (T-1 = control [no added nutrients], T-2 = B [biochar], T-3 = F [synthetic fertilizer @ recommended NPK], and T-4 = B + F [biochar + recommended NPK]) under a completely randomized block design with factorial arrangements. Chemical analyses of soils were conducted for physical, hydrological, and chemical (including concentration of macro- and micro-nutrients) prior to and after the completion experiments to evaluate soil fertility and its resulting effects on crop yield. The biochar amendment improved soil micro- and macro-nutrients. Soil organic matter, pH, and cation exchange capacity (ECE) significantly increased by application of biochar. The maximum potato yield of 30,467.4 kg h(-1) was achieved by the combined application of biochar and synthetic fertilizer as this combination resulted in the maximum net benefit ($4433.98 ha(-1)) in comparison with control treatment that had net loss of $- 2621.49 ha(-1).\" According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"It is therefore concluded that biochar amendment of soils resembling to that of the Atlantic Canada representative soil used in this study, with a mix of recommended NPK for, can formulate a smart precision farming nutrient management technique for this region subject to the field trials and replicate experimental treatments for more than three times.\" Our news journalists report that additional information may be obtained by contacting A.A.

According to news reporting out of Charlottetown, Canada, by VerticalNews editors, research stated, \"Electromagnetic induction (EMI) is a non-destructive technique to measure the apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) of agricultural soils. It has become popular in precision agriculture applications to estimate crop yield from ECa.\" Financial support for this research came from Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada. Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the University of Prince Edward Island, \"This study was conducted to relate ECa with soil moisture content (theta v) and potato tuber yield under Prince Edward Island (PEI), Canada growing conditions and to establish a two-layered soil model for ECa. During year one, horizontal co-planar (HCP), perpendicular co-planar (PRP), and theta v were measured with DUALEM-2 sensor and time domain reflectometry (TDR) probe and correlated with yield measured from 12 m(2) grids at 40 locations in each of the two potato fields on PEI. During 2018, vertical electrical sounding was undertaken by raising the DUALEM-2 from ground-level at 0.2 m intervals to a height of 1.6 m to investigate variations in ECa with soil depth. A two-layered soil model was developed using generalized reduction gradients to determine the surficial conductivity and thickness, and subsurface conductivity. ECa variables (HCP and PRP), theta v, and yield were significantly correlated and remained consistent throughout the study period, indicating their potential in predicting potato tuber yield. ECa in the fields varied both spatially and laterally with depth. GIS interpolated maps of a representative set of data for HCP and tuber yield (2017 data) showed structured spatial patterns and thus feasibility for delineating management zones. Further studies should examine the potato root zone (0.15-0.3 m) ECa specifically for developing higher layered models, which may be useful for accurate prediction of tuber yield.\" According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Non-destructive and accurate yield mapping using DUALEM-2 sensor combined with mathematical modelling of soil ECa layering has potential for use in developing management zones in potato fields.\" Our news journalists report that additional information may be obtained by contacting A.A.

Available through FarmCommand(r), a comprehensive digital platform, the tool delivers in-depth reports with critical information required by insurance professionals to make assessments and take action, expediting what is usually a time-consuming process. This first-of-its-kind technology merges field-centric weather data, machine learning, Daily Satellite Imagery, and crop health change detection into one easy-to-use management tool, a welcome breakthrough for the crop insurance industry. Insurance professionals can view active hailstorms, follow storm paths, and monitor when storms touch down on fields where their growers have existing policies. Following the hail event, instead of piecing together details from various sources, automatic notifications are generated to alert growers, agents, and adjusters to critical information, including fields affected, location, crop stage, and extent of the damage. A Crop Health Change Map provides an additional layer of field-level analytics to support assessment and claims management activities. \"The concept of automating claims processing is not new, but the automation of prediction, detection, and reporting powered by field-specific data for insurance is game-changing,\" said Wade Barnes, CEO and co-founder of Farmers Edge. \"One of the challenges to developing accurate models and reports is not just the amount of data required, but the quality as well; this is where we saw an opportunity to help and tackle this gap in the industry. By layering what we've built--the highest quality data sets available--with powerful digital tools, insurance professionals can refine their claim reporting process and deliver premium services to their customers. At the end of the day, it's about providing growers with the best possible experience through deeper digital connections. This new tool does just that, transforming an outdated process to one that's more efficient and profitable for growers and insurance professionals alike.\" How the Hail Detection and Reporting Tool works: Detection: Powered by a sophisticated severe weather monitoring system and Farmers Edge Advanced Weather Network of on-farm stations, insurance professionals and growers can access real-time, historical, and 10-day weather forecasts to identify and track risks. Notification: The morning after a hail event occurs, growers and insurance professionals are alerted to the weather event with an email notification. Additionally, high-resolution imagery of the field is automatically analyzed from before and after the event to detect and pinpoint any potential damage or changes in crop health. Reporting: The notification links to advanced reporting features in FarmCommand which detail the hail event rated by severity, time, location, size of affected areas, and the stage of the crop impacted. Crop adjusters can assess the damage by viewing imagery from before and after the event to make an assessment and determine action. Availability The new Hail Detection and Reporting Tool is just one of the many innovative features Farmers Edge has launched this year.

A Portage College survey found 92 per cent of students would recommend the college to others - a sign that Alberta's colleges are meeting the needs of students. \"We really appreciate our students'understanding and remarkable resilience during this challenging time,\" said Nancy Broadbent, Portage College President and CEO. \"We will take their feedback and learn where we can improve, while also noting what we did well. We congratulate all of our faculty, staff and students on a remarkable year.\""}, {"title": "ERTH Earthrenew begins making new pellets for spring trials", "article": "Earthrenew Inc (CSE:ERTH) Shares Issued 86,363,837 Last Close 5/25/2020 $0.09 Monday May 25 2020 - News Release Mr. Keith Driver reports EARTHRENEW ANNOUNCES PRODUCTION OF NEW PELLET FORMULATIONS FOR FIELD TRIALS THIS SPRING Earthrenew Inc. has developed and produced five new formulations of fertilizer pellets, incorporating insect frass and biochar. The company intends to test these new formulations in the field trial programs scheduled to take place this spring in collaboration with Olds College and Lethbridge College (see the company's press release dated April 29, 2020, which is available under Earthrenew's SEDAR profile). Highlights - Earthrenew has developed and produced five new fertilizer formulations for field trials and market development activities this spring. - The fertilizer formulations incorporate biochar, provided by BiocharNow, as well as insect frass. Earthrenew worked with BiocharNow LLC to develop the new pellet formulations. Both companies produce fertilizer inputs that the company believes benefit Earthrenew's binding properties and pelleted format. Earthrenew produces a heat-treated manure input that has a high organic matter content called GrowER. BiocharNow produces biochar that improves water and nutrient retention in soil. The company believes that the combination of these ingredients, in addition to insect frass, creates higher value organic fertilizer products in a simple-to-apply format for precision agriculture. The new pelleted fertilizer formulations can be applied to soil through an air seeder or other traditional farming equipment. The company anticipates that the results from the field trial tests of these new pelleted products, which contain varying amounts of GrowER, insect frass and biochar, will add to the results from its historical studies that indicated yields increased with the use of GrowER as compared with conventional fertilizers. The objective of these field trials is to validate historical results on yield and soil health and provide data on these new blends and formulations to support market development activities. Earthrenew's chief executive officer, Keith Driver, commented: \"We are very pleased with our first run of the new blended fertilizer pellets and we look forward to seeing how they perform in the field. This is a significant step forward as we look to retool the facility in Strathmore and develop a suite of innovative product offerings that we anticipate will contribute to soil and plant health for different types of plants. We believe that collaborating with innovative partners like BiocharNow helps Earthrenew develop unique blends of sustainable organic fertilizer that we anticipate will add value for our customers and benefit the environment.\" BiocharNow's chief executive officer, James Gaspard, said: \"Biochar is a highly adsorbent, specially produced charcoal produced using the ancient practice of heating wood or other plant material (biomass) with little to no oxygen. We produce it under specific conditions with the intent being to apply the biochar to soil as a means of increasing soil fertility and agricultural yields and sequestering carbon to reverse global warming. Compared to other organic soil amendments, biochar is much more effective at retaining nutrients and keeping them available to plants, so we are excited about this opportunity to incorporate biochar into a new Earthrenew product formulation and we look forward to field trial results. It is a unique chance to offer our product in a new format.\" About Earthrenew Inc.

Now, the general manager of Haggerty Creek Ltd. is preparing to deal with an entirely new kind of bug as he, his brother and their father embark on the next generation of farming as the first in Ontario to use the autonomous farm machine called DOT. \"There are a few glitches,\" said Baresich, 45, about being such an early adopter of the machine developed by DOT Technology Corp. in Saskatchewan. \"It's working, nothing is stopping it from running, but there's little things that when an engineer and a computer programmer and a farmer all get together, they aren't going to agree.\" DOT is a multi-use platform that can shift from fertilizer spreader to corn planter to weed sprayer, and that flexibility is what made it so appealing to Baresich. It's about the size of a small dump truck, and they move it from field to field on the back of a trailer. The family farms about 3,000 acres of corn and soybeans near the town of Bothwell, two hours southwest of Kitchener. They use a computer and GPS receiver to create a boundary around each field known as a geofence, and they can program DOT to avoid obstacles such as utility poles, wet areas, and ditches to within less than an inch of accuracy. It can also be moved via remote control. Baresich admits there's been a bit of a learning curve. \"When you're driving you make those decisions about what areas to avoid while you're in the cab, but now you have to plan ahead.\" Powered by a 164-horsepower diesel engine and four hydrostatic pumps - one per wheel - DOT moves through the field at anywhere from a creep to about 20 km/h. Baresich said he's had it fertilizing between 300 to 400 acres per day this spring - about the same speed as a human-operated machine. If DOT leaves the designated area or encounters unknown obstacles or areas where it might slip or sink, it stops automatically and sends a message to the farmer. It also has a remote emergency stop button. DOT arrived at the farm on May 13 and has given Baresich the opportunity to be in two places at once. \"It gives me time to fix some things that we would maybe normally just drive around. Maybe there's a washed out section in the field, or a big rock, or a tree branch that's fallen down. Before I'd have to get off the machine to move it.\" Not only does DOT improve efficiency, it helps lower production costs by allowing farmers to be pinpoint accurate with their inputs. No more accidentally spreading fertilizer into a ditch or onto the adjacent roadway, Baresich said. DOT Technology Corp. was purchased in March by U.S.-based autonomous agriculture company, Raven Industries Inc. Haggerty Creek also owns a smaller autonomous unit, about the size of a riding lawn mower, that is used to conduct soil sampling by driving up and down the field. Known as RoamIO, it was developed by another Canadian firm, Korechi Innovations. Baresich said DOT cost about $500,000, while RoamIO cost less than $100,000 - prices comparable to traditional farm machinery already on the market. Autonomous machinery isn't new to the farm, however. Farmers have been using automated feeders and milking machines for years inside the barn, but Baresich said DOT is among the first widely available autonomous farming machines available for work out in the field. DOT was first showcased at the 2018 Precision Agriculture Conference in London, Ont., and that's where Baresich first saw it. The self-proclaimed Star Wars fan loves robots, and when he saw DOT again a year later at the Outdoor Farm Show he decided to visit the research facility in Regina. A new agricultural revolution Autonomy is poised to become a critical part of what is being called the fourth revolution in agriculture, which will rely on artificial intelligence, machine learning and big data to help feed more people with fewer labourers and with a smaller impact on the environment. A report by the Royal Bank of Canada released last August found in order to feed a growing population with fewer farmers, the industry will need to take advantage of automation. The report - \"Farmer 4.0\" - states one in four farmers in this country will be 65 or older by 2025, with 110,000 expected to retire in the coming decade. Meanwhile, fewer young people than ever are entering agriculture. The number of farms in Waterloo Region decreased from 1,444 in 2006 to 1,374 in 2016. Those farms cover about 215,000 acres and generated $563.6 million in revenue in 2015. Over that same 10-year period, the number of farms in Canada fell about six per cent, from 229,373 to 193,492. The Royal Bank report also found just 14 per cent of producers automated tasks in 2018, and the sector spent four times as much per worker on machinery as the overall economy did. Baresich said machines such as DOT could help address the looming worker shortage by not only automating certain tasks, but attracting workers from outside the industry. \"There are fewer and fewer people able to drive these big machines anymore, but there are lots of people able to program and drive an autonomous machine,\" he said. \"This is opening up an opportunity for them.\" Robotics could also encourage more small-scale or organic farms since automation can reduce much of the manual labour involved and improve productivity, Baresich said. \"This (technology) is not just for big farmers,\" he said. \"And if that helps consumers, that's great.\" James Jackson is a Waterloo Region-based reporter focusing on business and technology for The Record.
