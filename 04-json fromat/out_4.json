[{"title": "AJX AgJunction receives three more patents", "article": "AgJunction Inc (TSX:AJX) Shares Issued 118,561,641 Last Close 9/5/2019 $0.55 Thursday September 05 2019 - News Release Mr. Jeff Morris reports AGJUNCTION SECURES THREE MORE PRECISION AGRICULTURE PATENTS AgJunction Inc. has received three new patent allowances in the United States and Europe. The first allowed patent describes an invention where position sensors (such as global navigation satellite systems and inertial measurement units) are used to accurately locate a farm implement (such as a spray boom) with reference to the ground, standing crop or other field features. Real-time computer engine processes control algorithms to compare sensor data with spatial data logged from a previous operation or terrain model to make control decisions which maintain desired implement height. Work order management systems and methods can be combined with the machine control functions of the invention to further automate operations, including agricultural operations involving multiple machines operating at multiple locations and sharing data with each other and with centralized data facilities. The second patent, issued on Aug. 20, U.S. patent No. 10,384,709, describes an invention for a steering wheel actuator mechanism that more easily allows for the retrofitting of steering control systems in tractors and other farm machinery. Some steering control systems may not fit in vehicles with certain console arrangements. Other steering control systems may obstruct the vehicle operator from normal hand placement on the steering wheel. This invention solves these issues for farmers wanting to add aftermarket autosteering to their farm machines. Finally, the European Patent Office has issued a notice of allowance for a new AgJunction patent that describes using in-device thermal stabilization to solve low-frequency measurement instability in commercially-available IMUs. This invention offers an affordable solution to measurement errors for IMUs at the lower end of the price spectrum. \"We're excited to bring innovative solutions to precision agriculture that expand the market and use,\" said Jeff Morris, chief marketing officer of AgJunction, \"and, through these innovations, providing farmers greater autonomy to be more productive.\" Bob Barjesteh, vice president, merger and acquisition, intellectual property, and general counsel for AgJunction, commented: \"We continue to invest heavily in R&D churning out strong patents in the precision farming space.

The donations come ahead of an official pledging conference planned for the end of October, with officials aiming to fix the exact dates and location at a meeting in Ottawa this week. At last weekend's summit of powerful G7 nations, Britain, France and Canada announced fresh support for the Green Climate Fund (GCF), which backs projects to help developing states shift to clean energy and cope with wilder weather and rising seas. In the GCF's first fundraising push in 2014 it received pledges of more than $10 billion. But U.S. President Donald Trump, a climate change sceptic, later refused to deliver two-thirds of a $3-billion promise made by his predecessor, and currency fluctuations have also shrunk the GCF's pot. Germany and Norway already announced in late 2018 they would double their initial contributions, and the new pledges from Britain and France are also twice what they first gave, when measured in their national currency. In a statement after the G7 summit, Yannick Glemarec, the fund's executive director, said the doubling of contributions was \"vital to support developing countries to raise and realise climate ambitions\". Many plans by developing nations to curb their planet-warming emissions - to help meet global goals to prevent runaway climate change - depend on such international assistance. France's efforts to put the GCF replenishment high on the G7 agenda signal \"the importance of the fund to drive transformative outcomes for countries and communities in the frontline of climate change\", Glemarec noted. The GCF has now allocated more than $5.2 billion to 111 climate projects in 99 countries. They range from providing credit to Ghanaian women working on climate-smart farming to promoting forest restoration in Honduras and protecting drinking water supplies from drought in the Marshall Islands. A GCF spokesman said the hope was that the second round of fundraising would at least equal the $10.3 billion won from donors in 2014. But a specific goal for this autumn's pledging conference was unlikely to be set, he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. A summary of the G7 summit said other member states were finalising their new contributions to the fund and called on other countries to step up too. COMMUNITIES BENEFIT Climate finance analysts said they expected some countries would announce new donations at a U.N. climate summit in New York on September 23. Other European states are likely to give more, while all eyes are on Japan - currently the biggest donor to the GCF. Leonardo Martinez-Diaz, director of sustainable finance at the World Resources Institute, said the GCF now had concrete examples to show its money was benefiting poor communities - such as boosting solar power in Mongolia where widespread coal burning causes choking air pollution. The G7 announcements indicated donors were responding to that evidence, as well as new rules to make the GCF's decision-making procedures run more smoothly, Martinez-Diaz noted. \"It suggests that there is a broader base of political support in those countries for climate finance,\" he added. China also may be considering putting in money for the first time, he noted, while the United States could come back into the donor fold if next year's presidential election results in a change in political leadership."}, {"title": "BGRD Braingrid investor converts debentures, sells shares", "article": "Braingrid Ltd (CSE:BGRD) Shares Issued 51,917,196 Last Close 8/26/2019 $0.03 Monday August 26 2019 - News Release Mr. Pierre Vannineuse reports EUROPEAN HIGH GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES SECURITIZATION FUND CONVERTS DEBENTURES OF BRAINGRID LIMITED European High Growth Opportunities Securitization Fund, further to the press releases of Braingrid Ltd. on June 18, 2019, and Aug. 8, 2019, has converted $160,000 of its aggregate $850,000 of debentures (as defined herein) on each of July 29, 2019, and Aug. 20, 2019, and sold an aggregate six million shares (as defined herein) between June 25, 2019, and Aug. 23, 2019.

Researchers at the University of Bristol discovered that the circadian rhythms of plants leave them more vulnerable to herbicides at different points in their 24-hour cycle. The team found Arabidopsis plants were more sensitive to glyphosate herbicide around dawn, when a lower concentration was needed to kill them off. A second species called proso millet (Panicum miliaceum) was also more sensitive to glyphosate at sunrise and dusk, but not in the middle of the day. Researchers say the findings, published in the journal Nature Communications, could help farmers by reducing crop loss and improving harvests. Gardeners could benefit from knowing which weeds respond better at certain times of day. Pesticides and herbicides have been implicated in the decline of pollinating insects such as bees. \"This proof of concept research suggests that, in future, we might be able to refine the use of some chemicals that are used in agriculture by taking advantage of the biological clock in plants. Approaches of this type, combining biotechnology with precision agriculture, can provide economic and environmental benefits,\" said Antony Dodd, the study's senior author. \"It could be useful for gardeners ... if we knew about the daily rhythms in the responses of certain weeds. It could reduce the amount of herbicide needed or increase its effectiveness.\" Like humans, plants have evolved to take advantage of cycles of night and day, with certain biological processes turning on at different times of day. Scientists have discovered that many drugs work much better in humans if they are given at specific hours. Aspirin, for example, has double the effect on thinning the blood if taken at night as opposed to the morning. The process is known as \"chronotherapy\" and researchers wanted to find out if the concept could be applied to plants. Many gardeners already know that plants absorb more water in the morning because their stomata, or pores, are open to take advantage of early morning dew and water vapour. At the break of day, plants are also not busy producing food through photosynthesis. The open pores could be the reason chemicals are more effective at dawn."}, {"title": "BGRD Braingrid loaner European High converts debentures", "article": "Braingrid Ltd (CSE:BGRD) Shares Issued 51,917,196 Last Close 8/22/2019 $0.03 Friday August 23 2019 - News Release Mr. Doug Harris reports BRAINGRID ANNOUNCES PARTIAL CONVERSION OF DEBENTURES Braingrid Ltd. loaner European High Growth Opportunities Securitization Fund, advised by Alpha Blue Ocean Inc., has converted $160,000 of its $690,000 remaining principal amount of senior unsecured convertible debentures into two million common shares of the company at an effective price of eight cents per share.

The investment of $315 million in this plan includes $150 million for a new broadband program, which will leverage private sector funding along with support from other levels of government to drive investment and expansion in unserved and underserved communities. We are one step closer to bringing better internet service to Norfolk County, through Request for Proposals for up to $8.3-million in broadband infrastructure. Norfolk is part of SWIFT - a partnership of Southwestern Ontario municipalities, also including Caledon, Six Nations, the Niagara Region, London, Waterloo and Windsor. The aim is to enable the expansion of fibre-optic networks by lessening the financial burden on service providers when it is too expensive to build high-speed infrastructure due to the large distances between customers. Haldimand County did not opt into the SWIFT program. They also have considerable issues with connection and have planned a separate initiative. Agriculture is increasingly high tech with the rise of precision agriculture. As farming becomes increasingly land and labour intensive, technology also needs to be far more controlled and accurate in systems like GPS guidance, sensors, robotics, drones and autonomous vehicles like tractors. Farmers can't remain compliant and competitive when they can't effectively do business online or file documents. Modern agriculture requires connectivity for a variety of jobs, checking the weather, checking the markets.Affordable broadband is essential across rural Ontario to access e-commerce, close deals, process payments, share information and connect with customers and with markets. The CRTC reports that 98 per cent of Ontario households have access to the most basic download speed of at least 5 Mbps. But, at that speed, people have difficulty sharing files by e-mail, let alone streaming videos or making connections via Skype. About 12 per cent of households cannot access the standard of 50 Mbps download and 10 Mbps upload. Low population density, geography and technology limitations can make it too expensive for private-sector providers to expand their networks. Connecting communities often requires running fibre-optic cables long distances, typically buried in the ground or attached in the air to hydro poles. Ontario has the highest hydro pole attachment rates in Canada. These costs are also a financial barrier to expansion in rural, remote and northern areas. Complex permitting and approval processes can also create challenges. This is why our government is stepping in to help find innovative solutions to incentivize private sector investment to ensure businesses and people have access to the high-speed internet they need.

(\"Village Farms\" or the \"Company\") (TSX: VFF) (NASDAQ: VFF) today announced its financial results for the second quarter and six-month period ended June 30, 2019.  All figures are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise indicated. Village Farms' Financial and Corporate Highlights for the Second Quarter Ended June 30, 2019 (All comparable figures are for the second quarter ended June 30, 2018) *Net income before tax improved to positive US$9.9 million and included the contribution of positive net income from Pure Sunfarms Corp. (\"Pure Sunfarms\") of US$14.0 million (CAD$18.6 million) (Village Farms' share based on its 50% ownership). This compares with a net loss of (US$2.3 million); *Produce sales were US$41.3 million compared with US$42.0 million; *Earnings per share improved to US$0.20 from a loss per share of (US$0.05); *EBITDA improved to US$4.6 million, including the contribution from Pure Sunfarms of US$9.4 million (CAD$12.6 million) (Village Farms' 50% share). This compares with an EBITDA loss of (US$1.3 million); and *Completed a bought deal offering of 1,000,000 common shares at a price of CAD$20.00 per share for aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of CAD$20,000,000. Second Quarter Financial Results for Village Farms' Canadian Cannabis Joint Venture, Pure Sunfarms *Sales (before Village Farms' 50% share), which consisted entirely of dried cannabis sold primarily to other licensed producers, increased 125% sequentially to CAD$32.4 million (US$24.2 million); *Cost of goods sold (\"all in cost\") per gram was CAD$0.65 (US$0.49) per gram; *Gross margin was 84%; *Net income (before Village Farms' 50% share) increased 226% sequentially to CAD$37.2 million (US$27.9 million), marking Pure Sunfarms' third consecutive quarter of profitability; and, *EBITDA (before Village Farms' 50% share) increased 194% sequentially to CAD$25.2 million (US$18.9 million), resulting in an EBITDA margin of 78%. Recent Highlights for Village Farms' Canadian Cannabis Joint Venture, Pure Sunfarms *Achieved full run-rate production of 75,000 kilograms of dried cannabis annually at its 1.1 million square foot Delta 3 greenhouse in Delta, B.C., the first and only single site cannabis operation in the world to exceed 1 million square feet; *Received a Standard Processing License from Health Canada for its 1.1 million square foot Delta 3 greenhouse facility which permits Pure Sunfarms to extract and process cannabis at the Delta 3 facility and which will enable the development and manufacture of products derived from the cannabis plant, including cannabis oil, as well as concentrates and edibles, as regulations permit; *Met all Health Canada criteria regarding the amendment to its license that will permit it to sell dried cannabis products directly to provincial/territorial and private retailers in Canada and, in anticipation of receipt of the amendment, continues to prepare for sales and distribution to the Ontario Cannabis Store, with which it has a supply agreement in place, as well as to other provinces, with which it is in discussions for potential supply agreements; *Commenced conversion of its second 1.1 million square foot greenhouse operation, Delta 2, for cannabis production, which is expected to double Pure Sunfarms' annual output at full production to over 150,000 kilograms (expected by the fourth quarter of 2020); *Continued to advance towards completion of the 65,000 square foot state-of-the-art processing center in the Delta 3 facility. The processing center, which will include on-site extraction capabilities and is designed for full GMP compliance and certification, and remains on schedule to be completed by the end of 2019 and operational as soon as possible thereafter subject to Health Canada licensing; *Recently Emerald Health Therapeutics (\"Emerald\") has been electing not to fully exercise its right under the Supply Agreement to purchase 40% of Pure Sunfarms' cannabis production. Pure Sunfarms has sold, and continues to sell, all portions of the production that Emerald did not purchase to other licensed producers in the spot market, where it has been realizing pricing in excess of the predetermined selling price to Emerald under this Supply Agreement. Recent Highlights for Village Farms' U.S. Hemp/CBD Program *Commenced conversion of half of its 1.3 million square foot, ultra-high-tech Permian Basin greenhouse for cultivation of high-CBD hemp and CBD extraction, which will include the implementation of leading-edge technologies that will support Village Farms' leadership position in large-scale precision agriculture. In June 2019, the state of Texas legalized the cultivation of hemp and the processing of hemp and hemp-derived products, including cannabidiol (CBD). The Texas hemp legislation will require licenses for both the cultivation and processing of hemp and Village Farms plans to apply for the requisite licenses as soon as it is permitted to do so; *The Company's joint venture for hemp production and processing in the Eastern U.S., Village Fields Hemp USA, LLC (\"VFH\"), has planted out approximately 600 acres in Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina and expects to begin harvesting in August of this year, with initial sales of hemp biomass to commence in the fourth quarter of 2019. VFH is now well advanced in planning and engineering work to establish its centralized extraction operations in the southeastern U.S., which is expected to be operational in the first quarter of 2020; and, *Expanded U.S. outdoor hemp cultivation and CBD extraction program to Colorado through a new joint venture, Arkansas Valley Green and Gold Hemp, LLC (\"AVGGH\") for the outdoor cultivation of high-cannabidiol (CBD) hemp and CBD extraction. AVGGH has planted 120 acres of Hemp and expects to begin harvesting in October 2019. \"Pure Sunfarms' second quarter financial results firmly rank it among the largest, most efficient and most profitable licensed cannabis producers in Canada, and clearly demonstrates that we have built a best in class cannabis operation setting a new bar for industry performance,\" said Michael DeGiglio, Chief Executive Officer, Village Farms.  \"Moreover, Pure Sunfarms' ability to achieve this level of operational and financial performance in just 24 months from our initial announcement to enter the cannabis industry is clear validation of our unique conversion strategy.  It also underscores the considerable advantage of combining existing, state-of-the-art greenhouse operations with 20 years of site-specific experience, and an exceptional management team, supported by Village Farms' decades-long track record in large-scale, low-cost, precision agriculture.\" \"These results are even more impressive given that Pure Sunfarms' first 1.1 million square foot greenhouse, Delta 3, was not yet at full production during the second quarter and sales were almost entirely to other licensed producers at pricing below what Pure Sunfarms expects to realize when selling directly to provincial/territorial and other retailers.  We expect Pure Sunfarms to deliver consistent quarter-on-quarter growth throughout this year and next, driven by Delta 3 now operating at full production, the anticipated start of sales directly to the Ontario Cannabis Store and other provincial/territorial and private retailers, expansion of product sales into pre-rolls and oils and other derivative products, and the doubling of capacity to 150,000 kilograms annually with its second 1.1 million square foot facility, Delta 2, expected to begin operations mid-2020 and achieve full production later that year.\" \"The success of Pure Sunfarms to date - both operationally and financially - provides us with tremendous confidence as Pure Sunfarms proceeds with the conversion of Delta 2, which will benefit from the same strategy of transferring Village Farms' experienced growers, operational team and skilled crop workers that have been so integral to the success of Delta 3.  And we continue to be optimistic about the potential for Pure Sunfarms to further expand production to as much as 330,000 kilograms or more through the addition of the 2.6 million square foot Delta 1 facility, further supporting low-cost production.\" \"The second quarter also saw Village Farms take major steps in our aggressive pursuit of the significant hemp and CBD opportunity in the United States as we continue to pivot towards these new outsized growth opportunities and transform the earnings potential of our Company.  We established our second joint venture for outdoor hemp cultivation and CBD-extraction, adding Colorado to our production in three eastern states.  And we began conversion and enhancement of half of our 1.3 million square foot, ultra-high-tech Permian Basin greenhouse for hemp cultivation and on-site CBD extraction.  We remain firmly on track to begin sales of hemp biomass this year, transitioning to sales of CBD crude oil early in 2020, and then commence CBD product manufacturing. We are very active with research and development initiatives, including genetics and developing our downstream strategy to establish Village Farms as a leading, vertically integrated, hemp-derived CBD company and capture value throughout the supply chain.\" Summary Statutory Results (in thousands of U.S. Dollars unless otherwise indicated)    Summary Results Including Joint Ventures, on a Proportionate Basis The following results reflect the Company's proportionate share of the Pure Sunfarms joint venture operations, as this is the basis on which management bases its operating decisions and performance.

Cost of sales for the three months ended June 30, 2019 increased by ($3,113), or (8%), to $44,263 from $41,150 for the three months ended June 30, 2018; primarily due to an increase of ($1,447) in contract sales cost (due to the increased volume) and an increase in cost per pound from the Texas facilities.  The decrease in production caused an increase in cost per pound as a majority of the production costs are fixed so as production decreases cost per pound increases. EBITDA for the three months ended June 30, 2019 decreased by ($3,690) from the three months ended June 30, 2018, primarily as a result of a decrease in income from operations, due to a decrease in sales and an increase in cost per pound for product produced as the fixed costs were spread over less pounds.

EBITDA for the six months ended June 30, 2019 decreased by ($7,650), from the six months ended June 30, 2018, primarily as a result of a decrease in income from operations, which resulted in decreased sales and an increase in cost per pound for product produced as the fixed costs were spread over less pounds. Non-IFRS Measures References in this MD&A to \"EBITDA\" are to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, foreign currency exchange gains and losses on translation of long-term debt, unrealized gains on the changes in the value of derivative instruments, unrealized change in biological asset, stock compensation, and gains and losses on asset sales.  EBITDA is a cash flow measure that is not recognized under IFRS and does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS. Therefore, EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Investors are cautioned that EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to net income or loss determined in accordance with IFRS as an indicator of the Company's performance or to cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as measures of liquidity and cash flows.

I would now like to turn the call over to Michael DeGiglio, Chief Executive Officer of Village Farms International. Please go ahead, Mr. DeGiglio. MICHAEL A. DEGIGLIO, FOUNDER, CEO, PRESIDENT & DIRECTOR, VILLAGE FARMS INTERNATIONAL, INC.: Thanks, Jennetta. Thanks everyone, for joining us both by telephone and Internet today. With me -- joining me for today's call is our Chief Financial Officer, Stephen Ruffini. And the agenda for the call. We'll start with a review of the excellent Q2 financial results for Pure Sunfarms, which contributed to one of the best quarters in recent memory for us here at Village Farms and provide an update on steady progress of our U.S. Hemp/CBD initiatives. Steve will review our Q2 financial results in detail, return with some closing thoughts and open it up to Q&A at the end. So starting with Pure Sunfarms' standout Q2 results, let me just say, as always for us, we will go straight to our results without deflection, no matter what they are. We're not going to start out by some of our competitors who seem to talk about opening up a small dispensary in Timbuktu or somewhere and we're proud of our numbers. So also, I want to dedicate this quarter, if there is such a thing to our villagers, our core group of loyal shareholders who've been unwavering since we entered the space and have supported the company and believe in our ability to lead the cannabis industry in Canada long and strong to them. And now the results. And if you'll just humor me for a minute, when I received these results draft numbers about 10 days ago -- for some of you, I was in Navy for about 26 years with my active reserve time. And when we did officer candidate training with the baddest Marine Corps DIs you can ever imagine, everything you did was wrong, but towards the end, if you did something right before graduation, they use the term, looky looky here. And it's kind of funny. I hadn't thought about that for many decades until I saw these numbers, and we were very proud of the performance of our Pure Sunfarms team. So looky looky here to these numbers. That's how we're going to start and bravo, salute to all the team members at Pure Sunfarms and Village Farms on these great results. Okay. So let's start with the results. We're in the contents of Delta 3 still being in production ramp-up during this quarter, has 2 remaining quadrants. We only planted out in April as we announced Delta 3 reach full production on schedule post Q2, and I'll discuss that in a moment. Total sales of Pure Sunfarms in Q2 and all of the numbers I discuss here are before Village Farms' 50% share. They increased 125% sequentially from Q1 to CAD 32.4 million. I want to know here that Pure Sunfarms continues to wait on its license amendment permitting sales directly to provincial, territorial and other retailers. Q2 sales were almost entirely to other licensed producers, so we realized somewhat lower pricing and we expect to achieve selling directly to provinces in the future. For competitive reasons, I won't be providing specifics around the selling price, but I will note that spot market demand remains strong and the spot market pricing continues to be attractive, and Pure Sunfarms continue to sell everything it's producing. With respect to cost of production from day 1, we have stated our belief that Pure Sunfarms can be the low-cost producer in Canada, and the Q2 results are now providing us with continued confidence here going forward. All in all, cost of goods sold were CAD 0.65 per gram. Again, that is all-in production costs. That's down meaningful from approximately about CAD 1.35 in Q1 and works out to CAD 0.82 for the first half of the year. Steve will provide more contents around this number when he discusses the financials. You've heard me say that in the end, the only production cost that really matters is on the last day of the fiscal year. And that's due to variations that are seasonal. But what I believe this is still the case given the intense focus on this metric by our competitors, we're providing it now additional content for the market. As Canadian market continues to develop and mature, it's become increasingly evident, as we have said all along, that being a low-cost producer of high-quality safe cannabis will be a significant advantage. Driving primarily by the lower-cost production, Pure Sunfarms' gross margin for Q2 expanded significantly to 84% from 65% in Q1. Q2 marked the third consecutive quarter profitability for Pure Sunfarms and that's third consecutive quarter of sales and profitability. That's every quarter since our first full quarter of sales with total net income, again, before Village Farms' 50% share increasing 226% sequentially to CAD 37.2 million. And finally, total Pure Sunfarms' EBITDA, which most notably excludes the benefit of the change in biological asset increased 194%, again, sequentially to CAD 25.2 million. That equates to an EBITDA margin of 78%, an increase of 1,900 basis points from the EBITDA margin of 59% in Q1 of this year. I want to be clear that this is true profitability based on cannabis production and sales of only cannabis products. There is nothing in these numbers artificially inflating the cost for this quarter. Pure Sunfarms' Q2 financial results clearly rank among the largest most efficient, most profitable licensed producers in Canada. That was our initial goal before we continued on to other initiatives, including brand strategy and product development. In fact, Pure Sunfarms remains one of the few major licensed producers in Canada to report profitability, let alone, consistent profitability, and I wish to reiterate my comments about this on our last call. Based on my 30-plus years in the business, achieving profitability this quickly while still in production is a great achievement, but it's not luck. It's like the harder we work, the luckier we get, but on the other hand, this is based on experience and know-how and everything we've communicated recently in driving these numbers. For us at Village Farms -- Pure Sunfarms' Q2 operational financial performance and achieving such levels in just 24 months since Village Farms first announced our intention to enter the cannabis space in Canada is all more -- all the more satisfying because we see it as a clear validation of a differentiated strategy. A strategy that was dismissed by many when we first announced our intention to enter the space. Village Farms has built a best-in-class cannabis operation evidenced by these Q2 results. We have achieved this with a foundation of exceptional assets and the understanding of the value of converting existing high-performance greenhouse operations with decades of site-specific operating history, years of chronological data and most importantly, an established and trained labor workforce. Village Farms transferred our own exceptional growing and operational personnel to Pure Sunfarms and we've continued to play an integral role to support Pure Sunfarms' success. And added the exceptional Senior Manager and now CEO, Mandesh Dosanjh and his team that he is building to drive our product and branding strategy, processing, product development in all downstream verticals. It's quite a team and very impressive. And Village Farms is playing, again, an integral role throughout bringing our 3 decades of experience in large-scale, low-cost precision agriculture to bear. We were disruptors. In fact, when looking for a partner in entering the space to help us expedite licensing process, we turned down a number of large producers as partners, names you would well recognize because they didn't share our vision on the way to grow in the cultural side. Today, just 2 years later, Pure Sunfarms has not only caught up to the rest of the industry, but has propelled itself past most of its peers in terms of production capacity, sales and production costs, and consistent meaningful profitability despite most others having a significant head start many, many years, some even as much as 9 years and having spent tens or even hundreds of millions dollars more to start up their operations. Pure Sunfarms has set a new bar for the industry going forward. We very much look forward to Pure Sunfarms building on the success in a number of value-driving milestones throughout the remainder of 2019 and 2020. As we announced at the beginning of July, subsequent to the quarter and year and on schedule, Pure Sunfarms achieved its full run rate production at 75,000 kilograms annually, which should be reflected in higher production sales volume for Q3 and Q4. We're very proud to note that Pure Sunfarms' Delta 3 facility is the first and only single site fully operational cannabis facility in the world in excess of 1 million square feet. According to Health Canada data, as of March 31 of this year, Pure Sunfarms' [1.03] million square feet represented 14% of the current cultivation capacity in Canada, tied for the largest in the country. Earlier I mentioned license amendment, some refer to it as packaging license, that will now allow Pure Sunfarms to sell dry cannabis products directly to provincial and private retailers in Canada. The process has taken longer than expected. We filed in December of 2018, and while frustrating, we respect the tremendous workload of the folks at Health Canada these days. To our understanding, Pure Sunfarms has met all Health Canada criteria regarding the amendment and continues to prepare for sales and distribution to the Ontario Cannabis Store, which it has a supply agreement in place. We expect to realize higher selling prices going forward. Pure Sunfarms is also actively engaged in discussions with other provinces around sales and distribution. We plan to rapidly expand branded sales well beyond Ontario. Yet another opportunity for sales and earnings growth going forward at Pure Sunfarms is evolution of its product offering. Most importantly, the addition of oils and other derivative products. Pure Sunfarms is making steady progress on a 65,000-square-foot state-of-the-art processing center located within the Delta 3 facility. The processing center, which will include on-site extraction capabilities and designed for full GMP compliance and certification and remains on schedule to be completed by the end of 2019 and operational as soon as possible thereafter subject to Health Canada licensing. I mentioned earlier that pricing in the spot market remains quite favorable. Recently Pure Sunfarms has been benefiting to an even greater degree as Emerald Health Therapeutics [with] Pure Sunfarms has a supply agreement under which it committed to 40% of Pure Sunfarms' output. As it's the last part of Q2, they've been electing not to fully exercise its rights to purchase 40%. Under the agreement, Pure Sunfarms are committed to and has been selling all output that Emerald committed to, but has not purchased to other license producers in the spot market. This is clearly beneficial to Pure Sunfarms and it's realizing a price in the spot market in excess of the predetermined selling prices to Emerald's supply agreement. As a reminder, the supply agreement, this particular one concludes at the end of the year and will be transitioned to a new agreement for up to 25% of Pure Sunfarms' production at prevailing market prices. The unmitigated success of Pure Sunfarms today gives us tremendous amount of confidence as Pure Sunfarms moves forward with the conversion of Delta 2, the next 1.1-million-square-foot sister facility to Delta 3, which is expected to, at a minimum, double Pure Sunfarms' production output. Conversion of the external infrastructure at Delta 2 is now underway. All design and planning has been completed. And mobilization of equipment and all the technologies we need to start the process is on-site and we expect to start pulling the first half of the current crop in 2 weeks and start internal conversion. Delta 2 should begin contributing revenues as early as Q2 2020 next year and be operating at full run rate of production of an additional 75,000 kilograms minimum in Q4. Taking Pure Sunfarms totally to at least 150,000 kilograms next year. As we did with Delta 3 facility, personnel from the existing Village Farms growing, maintenance teams and most critical skilled labor force will be transitioned to Pure Sunfarms December 1. Those who are regulars to these calls have often heard me speak often about the necessity of a best-in-class growing operation to build an exceptional agricultural product brand. That was our goal for Pure Sunfarms, and I'm proud to say that we have achieved that goal. Pure Sunfarms is a best-in-class growing operation. It provides a requisite rock solid foundation upon which Pure Sunfarms can build a differentiated market-leading brand and so forth. New hired under Mandesh's leadership brought in deep CPG experience on board. VP of Ops, Mike Lattimer, out of Labatt, Honda, PwC; Maria Guest, VP, Brand Commercial, already had a year or so in cannabis and 12 years of AB Inbev and Labatt; Richard Lenz, VP, Quality, 14 years natural health products in 3 pharma companies; Zach Barr, Director, Production, 12 years at Pepsi and so on; Adam Patterson, Spot Supply Chain Director, previous in cannabis, 10 years retail CBD companies, DAVIDsTEA, so on. And Bill Hayter, Director of Engineering, great mechanical engineer, ran his own firm. These are just a few of the key executives that are on board Pure Sunfarms recently and now will take the company to an even greater level of profitability, I'm sure. Turning to United States and hemp/CBD business. To our U.S. Hemp program where, as a reminder, our goal is to build a vertically integrated consumer packaged goods company, growing, extracting and producing our own CBD products for big-box retail market. On our last call, I talked about our aggressive pursuit of this huge opportunity. We announced it right after legislation was passed in December, purchased $2.5 million worth of seed and went to work with a great, great partner and forming Village Fields Hemp for outdoor cultivation and CBD extraction in the southeast of the United States to start with. During Q2, we took 2 additional major steps forward. First we expanded our outdoor hemp cultivation program to Colorado through a joint venture with Arkansas Valley Green and Gold Hemp. That's the name of the company for the excellent growing area that's located adjacent to the Arkansas river in southern Colorado. We've an outstanding partner there as well who is the founder of one of Colorado's largest licensed outdoor cannabis growing operations. Arkansas Valley has already planted out 120 acres to start this year and we expect to begin harvesting in October. It will have its own extraction, on-site extraction operations expected to be operational and processing crude CBD oil by early 2020 and looking at smokable CBD flower as well. Our other JV, Village Fields Hemp has approximately 600 acres in production in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, which will begin harvesting in the coming weeks, with initial sales of hemp biomass to commence in the fourth quarter of '19. Village Fields Hemp is now well in advance planning and engineering work on its large-scale extraction operation in Georgia, which will be located on Soperton and serve the southeast U.S. operations. These are also scheduled to be operational by the end of Q1 next year. So that's about 720 acres total production outdoors for this year. Second major milestone with legalization of hemp and CBD in Texas. We move forward in our earnest -- in earnest our greenhouse hemp cultivation program and started conversion and advancement of half of our 1.3-million-square-foot, ultra-high-tech Permian Basin greenhouse cultivation extraction facility. We plan to start growing, extracting as soon as possible as Texas sets up regulatory framework and we can obtain the requisite licenses. So we're waiting on Texas and with Texas waiting on the USDA, as all the other states that were not approved under 2014 Farm Bill are. We're off to a great start with our hemp and CBD programs. We're building a rock solid foundation of exceptional growing operations as we did in Canada with Pure Sunfarms that will enable Village Farms to build an exceptional brand in CBD market. Hemp biomass sales will start this year. CBD crude sales will start early next year and then we'll move to production of branded and white label CBD products formulation to our existing model to national big-box pharmaceutical companies, grocery companies as well as other retailers throughout the country. So with Pure Sunfarms, numerous milestones throughout this year and next to drive growth in revenue and profitability in the U.S.A. There is a considerable opportunity and we are doing a lot of work in the background to support our strategy. We're very active in moving forward quickly in R&D in a number of areas, including genetic seed development, advanced growing techniques for plant -- for greater plant health and working with a number of universities in that endeavor. Plant health is key and I would say that's probably at the top echelon of why we're successful. Cannabis is a very nascent industry as we all know and the tools available for our growing operations are not there, it may be years before the regulatory process allows that. So integral is keeping your plant health up. And I firmly believe that with solid plant health, you can avoid all diseases, including mold, which many don't believe. So enough of that for now. To conclude, Pure Sunfarms is indicative of the value of our strategy to pivot towards new outsized growth opportunities and transform the earnings potential of Village Farms. We are only able to capitalize on these significant high growth opportunities in cannabis and hemp and CBD because of the organizational strength and know-how we have amassed as one of the largest and longest operating greenhouse-grown produce businesses in North America. As I've discussed on prior calls, produce business has been challenged in recent years, primarily due to imports from Mexico, which has significant labor cost advantages. We are pivoting with this business too, moving production in Mexico as we transition our North American greenhouse and assets of cannabis and hemp toward significantly better economic returns. There will be some short-term pain, but for the long -- but there will be long-term gain in our produce business, we work through this transition. We've already increased some of our sales 18% this quarter out of Mexico as we start to replace that capacity like Delta 3 and soon to be Delta 2 and the Permian Basin facility. And you can see that in our results, but our produce business will emerge significantly stronger down the road, more competitive and more valuable. And clearly, the financial returns and the shareholder value both short and long-term that are being generated by our transition to cannabis and hemp are worth it. Now I would like to turn the call over to Steve who will walk you through our financial results. Steve? STEPHEN C. RUFFINI, CFO, EXECUTIVE VP, COMPANY SECRETARY & DIRECTOR, VILLAGE FARMS INTERNATIONAL, INC.: Thanks, Mike. I'll just touch on each one of our business lines, produce, hemp and cannabis relatively quickly. First, produce. Obviously we are disappointed with our produce results. A gross loss in the quarter of $3 million is obviously disappointing, it is not the first time. Last time we had a gross loss in the quarter was the second quarter of 2012 as a result of a hailstorm, which ended the Texas crop rather quickly. In this particular instance, we've had -- as we've said, we've transitioned one of our green -- started transitioning one of our greenhouses, so that crop has been pulled. Obviously maintaining our labor force, et cetera, is extremely important, so those costs just hit our cost of sold directly. With respect to the other Texas greenhouses, they have had various pressures throughout this growing season and the crop did not end well. As we've talked about in the past, most of our costs are fixed. We're trying to spread our costs over the full year, full crop year. With respect to the crop, when the crop doesn't end well, essentially you accelerate those costs down to 0 on June 30. So new crop in Texas going forward, we are looking to get back to a gross profit for the rest of the year with respect to our produce. With respect to SG&A, those are corporate SG&A costs. Historically, we've put those into the produce column because we've had those historical costs. Year-on-year our SG&A increased 6%, excluding stock comp. Obviously, a year ago, we weren't on NASDAQ. A year ago, we were a foreign private issuer, we're no longer a foreign private issuer. So we are spending dollars now getting ready to be fully SEC compliant on January 1, which includes (inaudible). Obviously, when we went on NASDAQ, needless to say, our D&O insurance and other costs like that went up on a year-on-year basis. None of those have anything to do with produce, actually our direct produce SG&A has come down on a year-on-year basis. So the incremental increases folks are seeing in our SG&A are directly related to our new business lines and that's all I'll say about that. With respect to hemp, not much has happened in this quarter. It's relatively some SG&A costs, that's it. There won't be much in the third quarter either. The initial harvest is expected later in August and September. Obviously, those crops need to be dried. So the market should not expect any significant revenues, what have you, or any significant changes in the hemp results in Q3. And when the Q3 results come out, we'll talk about the Q4 expectations in November. With respect to Pure Sunfarms, obviously, a very, very strong quarter as the market can see. With respect to the strong cost of sales, I tried to indicate and lead the market to that conclusion on the May conference call. I stated on the May conference call that 30% of the Q1 cost of sales were seasonal for Pure Sunfarms and that is in the form of power, in the form of electricity. Obviously, in the summer months, we don't need that. The greenhouse growing, whether it's us or for anyone else, particularly in Canada will be seasonal. So you will see lower cost per gram of production in Q2 and Q3 than you will in Q4 and Q1. So there will be some variability in the gross margin of Pure Sunfarms due to the seasonality of those costs. Part of the improvement wasn't just the seasonal cost, it's the benefit of the ramp-up. As I stated with produce, a lot of your agricultural costs are fixed. So as you're ramping up and you're getting more revenue and more volume from the greenhouse, obviously, your cost per gram come down. So the market should expect the Q3 cost of goods sold will benefit obviously from the continued summer production. And the market should expect that those strong cost per gram will continue with starting to see an increase in Q4. Q4 will have some winter production in its sales and will -- but we'll still also benefit from some of the summer production due to the lag time between harvest and sales. And with respect to Q1, Q1 will historically probably be Pure Sunfarms' highest cost per gram in a given quarter. With respect to the expectations for Q3, as we discussed on the May call for Q1, the leading indicator is the bio asset. As we've done in the past, the full set of Pure Sunfarms' financials are contained in Note 7 of the Village Farms' financial statements. If one were to refer to those right now, you would see the bio asset for Pure Sunfarms on June 30 was CAD 36.4 million. The bio asset at March 31 was CAD 18.2 million. So that's a leading indicator of the third quarter being significantly stronger than the second quarter results that we've just reported. And with that, I will turn it back over to Mike. MICHAEL A. DEGIGLIO: Thanks, Steve. Okay. Just to review and conclude, our Q2 results are clear evidence of fundamental transformation of the earnings potential of Village Farms. Pure Sunfarms is already making meaningful contribution to our financial results and that business is really just getting started. We expect Pure Sunfarms to deliver consistent quarter-on-quarter growth throughout this year and next driven by Delta 3 at full production capacity, anticipated start of sales to the Ontario Cannabis Store and [other] provincial, territorial and private retailers, expansion of product sales into pre-rolled and oils and other [derivative] products. Delta 2 facility coming online next year doubling the capacity there. We continue to be optimistic about the potential for Pure Sunfarms to exercise the option on the Village Farms' 2.6 million massive square foot Delta 1 facility in return and further expand production to as much as 300 kilograms -- 300,000 kilograms or more. Similarly, our hemp and CBD business well positioned to contribute near-term growth, revenue and earnings going into next year. First sales of hemp biomass later this year, sale of crude, as I said, earlier followed by our own CBD products next year. Expand outdoor cultivation next year, begin cultivation in our Permian Basin greenhouse as a start in Texas as soon as we're licensed to do so. And positioned very well for early move for this massive opportunity in U.S.A. So with that, we'll open up the session to Q&A. Questions and Answers OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Doug Cooper with Beacon Securities. DOUG COOPER, MD AND HEAD OF RESEARCH, BEACON SECURITIES LIMITED, RESEARCH DIVISION: Congratulations on a great quarter. And Mike gave us a great update. I just want to focus in on the cost per gram CAD 0.65 in the quarter. How low do you think that can go as you get more economies of scale through the ramp-up? And I see that a number of Canadian LPs are moving to or bringing on outdoor grow. Can you just talk about maybe how that can compare and what your thoughts are on that? MICHAEL A. DEGIGLIO: Well, it's kind of funny, Doug. I mean every time I see a large LP announcing they're doing an outdoor grow, I shake my head because they just don't get it. It makes me think that they're just having a difficult time executing on the technology side because to me, in Canada it just doesn't make sense. Regarding the cost, I think, one -- I think we can drive our costs down. We're not saying -- we've always stuck to under CAD 1 a gram and we're sticking to that, but clearly I think our cost can be driven down and this is on flower more and more. And of course, that cost will be significantly lower as we move into oil. But we've seen some really unbelievable things based on our years of growing multiple crops. I've seen it and the team has seen it, that it's pretty unbelievable where we think we can go with the right technology. Nothing we talk about now, but I think the possibility is really great in the future to drive cost to phenomenal low going forward. And it's all centered around plant health and processes in growing. So I actually believe we can compete worldwide even if importation has opened up. But that's not tomorrow, but -- I can't give you specific numbers, but I think we can still hammer it though. DOUG COOPER: Right. And I guess, maybe just on the strategy side, presumably the realized prices if you were able to sell directly right now would be a couple of dollars higher per gram at least. But from a strategic perspective, once you get the ability to do so, the cost per gram that other companies have reported thus far are certainly significantly, significantly higher. You mentioned the word disruptor, how much market share would your assets enable you to have and what would be the strategy to do so to that end? You mentioned D1 there briefly. What are the plans to bring that in and how quickly can that be done? And if other companies start to have financial concerns, obviously, we have one out there right now, would there be assets out there that you would -- if you could buy them at pennies on the dollar, would that be of interest to you? MICHAEL A. DEGIGLIO: Well, yes, we always look at an asset if it's distressed. I mean I think there's going to be a lot of assets that get repriced a couple of times over the next couple of years. I mean I said a year ago that at some point we may start the commoditization process because we feel so confident in our cost. Look, at the end of the day in Canada, the Canadian government wants to displace the illicit trade and they're not going to do that by arresting anybody who's breaking the law. They're going to do it by pricing the product to be competitive or more competitive than the black market. So that's going to set the bar on pricing. And, of course, they have to make their profit. And of course, taxes come out. So at the end of the day, the growers are all going to have to compete at this price to take out the illicit trade, that's the bar. But if our cost of production continues down, then we could start to come down and push the commoditization. And the first guy is I think at $3 plus a gram and then on the cost of production and the (inaudible). And take that additional market share. I would do Delta 1 tomorrow if I could because I know what the cost in that facility now, we have the [confidence] to be. But I think it would be hard for anybody to compete with that, especially as we move into more oils going forward because the production cost of flower is much higher than oil. So I'm very confident where we can go [in the future]. DOUG COOPER: And I guess, maybe just my last question being you don't have -- because it's a wholesale business right now, you're not supporting brands at retail or on the SG&A costs and so forth. Once you get into your own brands, and presumably spending has to go up a little bit to do that, what do you think the long-term EBITDA -- assuming where your costs are and pricing is today, but certainly the 78% EBITDA margin is eye-popping, what should the market be thinking about in terms of long-term sustainable EBITDA margins in your view? MICHAEL A. DEGIGLIO: Well, I would say this sets the bar for the EBITDA margin, so plus or minus a couple of percent because SG&A. Marketing in Canada is not going to be like marketing in U.S.A. It's going to be a whole different venue. It's very controlled. I mean the companies are spending all this money -- the Hollywood crowd, so to speak. You just don't get it in Canada. You're very restricted in what you can do. And Pure Sunfarms is going to roll out a great branding strategy that's based on the Pure Sunfarms brand and it's going to be really based on the quality of the product we put in the marketplace. But I don't think that cost is going to be -- is going to really move our SG&A line up because as we double production, the cost -- our overall cost for SG&A is just going to be driven down even with that initial marketing cost. We have a team in place. There's a great team fully in place today. So I think the EBITDA margin is sustainable and even as it commoditizes out, those efficiencies -- cost efficiencies, that I can see are very real going forward. And I think we could sustain these kind of numbers for foreseeable future. DOUG COOPER: Great. And just my last one, on the packaging license, you mentioned it in your speech at the beginning, I know it's Health Canada and you have no, I guess, ability to push them, but what is your thoughts now on when this might be delivered? MICHAEL A. DEGIGLIO: I'm not going to say because I had talked to when we thought we would receive it and that was predicated on knowing that we're compliant and we are. As best as my knowledge, we've met all the criteria. And it was also based on the time it was taking for other competitors. I can't say what the reason is. It's out of our control. I don't know if it has to do with some of the bad actors out there. I mean CannTrust, I mean these guys should be in jail as far as I'm concerned. And when that kind of stuff happens, I would think if I was working for Health Canada, I'd be -- it would affect my trust in other companies and I'm going to kick up my processes across the board. So that could be part of what's driving it recently. There's a lot of companies out there that have odor issues because they're located in the middle of a residential area. That's not the case with us, but that's getting traction. So I think there's a lot of different forces at work, but it's going to come. And we have everything set up to go. So, whether it's a month or 3 months, I don't think it's going to affect our ability to execute very well this year. So I'm not that worried about it. So -- but I can't say when. I'll leave that up to the government to decide. OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Partheniou with JMP Securities. ANDREW PARTHENIOU, ANALYST, STIFEL NICOLAUS CANADA INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Congrats on the outstanding quarter. I wanted to ask for the Pure Sunfarms' utilization capacity in Q2, can you give us a little bit of color on where that was? And given that in Q3, it's going to be at full production, it could be interesting to see what kind of increase in results that could mean? MICHAEL A. DEGIGLIO: Well, I mean let's just say it was about half utilization, I can't -- I mean I know what the number is and have to look it up, but based on the licensing, we picked up a lot of our licenses in a very short amount of time between sort of December and February and then, of course, you have to propagate the plants before you get into the growing room. So I think we're about 50%. So I'd probably say that's a decent number to look at between the first half of the year and the second half of this year. ANDREW PARTHENIOU: Okay. That's great. And you mentioned that Emerald is not taking advantage of its 40% on its contract. Do you know -- or rather can you give a little bit of color on what kind of quantity they are buying if that's above or below what it's going to turn into at the beginning of next year? STEPHEN C. RUFFINI: This is Steve. It's roughly in line with their 25% for next year. It does vary. You've got to remember Pure Sunfarms is producing fresh batches every single week. That's what it's designed to do. So depending on the batch, depending on the Emerald's product line, some instances, they're taking the full amount. And some instances, they're taking a lesser amount. But net-net, it's roughly in line with what their supply -- new supply agreement will be starting January 1. Again, it's all being -- it's all being sold, anything they pass on is all being sold at a higher price to other licensed producers. ANDREW PARTHENIOU: Right, right. And you guys are still planning on unveiling the brand at the same time as receiving the packaging license? MICHAEL A. DEGIGLIO: Yes. STEPHEN C. RUFFINI: Yes, that's the plan. ANDREW PARTHENIOU: Okay. Great. Transitioning a little bit to the U.S. market, you spoke previously about market segmentation. Maybe you can discuss a little bit on the smokable hemp flower trend that we're seeing now and given that the Texas greenhouse is probably better positioned for that and potentially outdoor cultivation like many people are doing, maybe you can give a little bit of color on how that fits into your strategy? MICHAEL A. DEGIGLIO: Well, we're certainly looking at that. I mean it's a trend that's coming up so -- and as we said early -- in early stages of talking about differentiating the market, just say it's a 90%-10%, 90% CBD growing from hemp in the field versus 10% or 15% from a controlled environment. That -- those -- that validation for those percentages will come and this is an example of a product line that's getting traction that would work very well in a controlled environment just because we're producing 4 to 5 crops per year per section for control to keep the quality flower as far as a controlled environment versus outdoors. So yes, we had touched on that before, and I think that's an area that we're definitely going to look at going forward. ANDREW PARTHENIOU: I find it very interesting given I'm not sure how accurate the prices that we are seeing are, but it seems like it's 10x or above smokable flower versus biomass. So it seems like an interesting opportunity. Given that and also the progress that you guys are making in the U.S. overall, can you give a little bit of color on maybe interest of potential buyers or the prices or volumes that you might be seeing on a preliminary basis for U.S. CBD products? MICHAEL A. DEGIGLIO: I don't think we're prepared to say that at this point in time. So I think that's a big part of our strategic focus starting here in September through the rest of the year on exactly where we want to initiate and play in what part of that space, so I think it's just too early on, Andrew, to comment. ANDREW PARTHENIOU: Okay. No worries. And just the last one from me, if I can put it in there, is the USDA should be coming out with regulations sometime soon. Do you have any little bit of color that you can provide on that as well in terms of timeline? MICHAEL A. DEGIGLIO: Yes. Well, I'm really happy about the FDA and their possibility. I mean if they take longer, it's fine with me because that's allowed Village Farms -- again, we want brand rules at the end of the day, there's no doubt about it. As we look at CPG pivot here, at least in the U.S. with our assets and what we're doing in the field, that branding side is very, very important, but our concept is you've got to get the foundation right on the cultural side. And it's great to be a CPG company that has no tie to manufacturing or growing in this instance, but we don't see it that way, mainly because the genetics have not been developed yet and that will come. And at some point, it's okay to be purely a CPG company. So that said, even when it comes to regulatory processes, that gives us -- if the FDA takes another 6 to 8 months, a year, to get it right, that's helping us build this foundation over existing players in the space that are sort of coming out of the grave -- existing players in the space that have been producing before it was decriminalized in December. So we're happy about that. And I think the FDA plays an integral role in regulating the industry. So we're glad to see that happening. And if they take their time, it just gives us more time to get our ducks in order. STEPHEN C. RUFFINI: Thank you, Andrew. We've got to move on to the next question. OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Fortune with Roth Capital Partners. SCOTT THOMAS FORTUNE, DIRECTOR & RESEARCH ANALYST, ROTH CAPITAL PARTNERS, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Congrats guys on a good quarter. Real quick follow-up on Pure Sunfarms. I know you're expecting the licensing. Can you step us through on the timing as far as the rollout of the brand? And then kind of how far along are you in discussions with the different provinces outside of Ontario to begin selling at those provinces? How should we look at that? MICHAEL A. DEGIGLIO: Yes. We're way along with the other provinces just that most of them are waiting until we have the license to commit to a contract, but that dialogue is taking place. And I think it'll happen very quickly after the license. We talk about Ontario because we do in fact have a contract with Ontario, while they are waiting to see us get our license. So that's well underway. As far as the brand strategy is in place and ready to go, Pure Sunfarms has been working all out on that for about 9 months. It's -- they're ready to go, but I think that will coincide more or less with the license coming on board. And as I said earlier, I just don't know when that's going to happen. So like everyone else, it's out of our control and every Friday, we wonder if it's this Friday, so... SCOTT THOMAS FORTUNE: Okay. And expanding upon that and the contraction strategy side of things, is there a percentage that you're targeting towards the cannabis 2.0? Can you step us through near-term extraction until that facility gets built out? What's the strategy from that standpoint? MICHAEL A. DEGIGLIO: Well, we're going to stay internal because we like to control the vertical all the way through. And I think we can do it at a fairly good cost, where we're going to shoot for GMP certification on our extraction side so that, that market opens up. Even for exports, Europe at some point, we'll be ready to go there. We have everything in place to be able to start extracting by year-end, this December, depending on licensing. So I think next year we'll be rolling forward. And as the market moves and we bring on Delta 2, I wouldn't be surprised that next year we could be looking at -- it's more -- this is somewhere in the 30 -- 30% range. I think, in the future, it could be 50%, but I think 30% is probably a number I'm throwing out there. I mean the Pure Sunfarms team would probably know better, but in some of the conversations we had, that seems to be a number going forward, so... SCOTT THOMAS FORTUNE: Okay. And shift real quick on the U.S. hemp side, obviously, kind of the biomech is seeds and genetics are for planting next year, have you guys gone out and forward purchased seeds? And in a sense, what type of size from a harvest are you guys kind of potentially planning for the following year? MICHAEL A. DEGIGLIO: Yes. We're not putting too many of those numbers out. I mean I could tell you we purchased when there was no seed available back -- at the end of the last year, we purchased well over $2 million. So clearly it's always on our radar screen to be ahead of the curve and we do have a number of initiatives that we haven't talked about tied to seed and genetics. Probably don't want to go there here because of competitive reasons. And I mean a lot of folks are clearly working on the genetics, but till such time that the large multibillion dollar seed companies get in the space and I don't think that's going to be too long. I think a lot of the companies have to take that burden on, we are too. We're working with some great folks, with some great universities pushing that forward. And the genetics even on the field side have to be tied to critical day length. And if you look at Texas alone as a state, I mean it's like a country, there are so many different latitudes and climates. So you have to gear those genetics to that and the same in the greenhouse and looking at percentages of CBD, and so on. So it's an exciting place to be, and of course, it creates IP if you're fortunate enough to hit on something that's the Holy Grail and that's a big focus for us. But we are looking at next year, and I think we'll be in pretty good shape. OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Des Lauriers with Craig-Hallum Capital. ERIC DES LAURIERS, SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, CRAIG-HALLUM CAPITAL GROUP LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Congratulations on a really impressive Q2. I was wondering if I could just start with margins, obviously a great strong point for Pure Sunfarms, a little bit weaker as it relates to produce. So if I could dig in there a little bit. So on the produce side, margins impacted by decrease in production, which with a fixed cost, obviously increases the cost per pound there. So the conversion of the half of greenhouse in Texas obviously having an impact, Delta 2 as well. Could you give us a sense of how much this sort of interim period, especially as it relates to Texas -- we've no produce sales and no hemp sales, can you kind of give us a sense of how much that impacted your produce gross margins this quarter? STEPHEN C. RUFFINI: This is Steve. It's not insignificant, but it's not that significant. When we're talking in hundreds of thousands of dollars, it's not that significant. The bigger issue is the end of the Texas crop. This year, we had higher expectations and essentially, you have to accelerate your -- we undercharged ourself on a per pound basis. So we have to end the crop in June 30, the crops all gone, so you have to bring all those crops off your -- off out of inventory and run them through your income statement. So it's really kind of a catch-up for costs incurred in prior periods because the crop is gone. So on a go-forward basis, as Mike side, the Delta 2 grow team will transition December 1, they're continuing to grow tomatoes, as we talked about in the MD&A. Part of it -- half of that facility will begin conversion at the end of September. So there will be some incremental, call it, overhead cost of goods incurred in the fourth quarter relating to Delta 2 that hit our books that have no revenue to generate against them, as again, we're planning on transitioning the growing team on December 1 as Mike said earlier. MICHAEL A. DEGIGLIO: But we can't underestimate the cost, I mean the whole company is pivoting. So a huge part of our cost is going into a different direction. And the cost of doing that over the last 2 years has all been -- it's being picked up because we report (inaudible) as a produce company. But these costs are well within a normal SG&A percentage, but at the same time, we would not incur these costs if we weren't investing in a whole new area. We haven't taken a penny of profit or cash flow that's paying for the whole Village Farms team. And a lot of us are supporting that effort within the Village Farms team, across every discipline from accounting and finance to R&D to asset development and the whole IT team, and so on, and that's supporting our joint venture partners. So it's really -- that's a significant part of that cost. And to answer your question with Monahans, as soon as we get the license, we're ready to roll, but if that happens -- we can't control the USDA. The USDA has communicated they're going to get the regulatory process right. And if it takes 3, 4 months longer, it is, and Texas can't move to that. So -- but in the long term, it's a great move for us. So I think in Monahans, that is one of the most high-tech facilities anywhere in the world and we're going to take it to another bar. This is the time to make some technological advancements that we think will hugely pay off on the cannabis side and I'm not at liberty to talk about them, but we'll take that time to do it. So unlike other our competitors that have 110% SG&A costs and have burn rates and are losing CAD 300 million a quarter, in a way, that sort of partly outburn costs, but we're doing it with an underlying business that's supporting it. So we feel good about that, even though we're showing some negative loss to the business. ERIC DES LAURIERS: Got it. That makes sense. And then just one on the retail side of things. I guess so as we look at 2020, kind of assuming you have the packaging license and amended sales agreement by then, so as we look at 2020 and maybe into '21, how should we think about your target breakdown between wholesale and retail in terms of sales? MICHAEL A. DEGIGLIO: Well, I think we kind of touched on that on the previous call, but I mean I think probably prudently, it would be around 20% differential on the pricing because I think we want to remain -- we're climbing on sort of a sweet spot where we want to be on the pricing, where we would like to see our products sold. And I think even when you hear about some -- you hear some stories that there is an oversupply, well, I don't believe that. I mean if you're trying to sell your product at CAD 14, CAD 15 a gram, there's probably an oversupply, but if it's priced right, it's that sort of every day. And as the team -- the Pure Sunfarms team will launch their concept of the brand and I'm totally on board with it, but I think that positioning is where it's at. So I don't think it'd be prudent to say we're going to see a huge 30%, 40% differential. I think it's probably more in than 20% range. OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Grey with Alliance Global Partners. AARON THOMAS GREY, MD & HEAD OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, ALLIANCE GLOBAL PARTNERS, RESEARCH DIVISION: Congrats on the quarter. The first question is just going to be on, you mentioned the spot market remains strong. Just wanted to get some color on where you see that going forward? And then what are you seeing in terms of the overall market supply and demand and when that might reach equilibrium? MICHAEL A. DEGIGLIO: Well, I think it'll happen. I mean I think, looking at the competitive landscape, as we've always said, this -- at the end of the day, is farming, be it high-tech farming. And farming is not for sissies or the weary, so to speak. It's hard business and you need to be on your game 24 hours a day 365, on the edge pushing it and you need to keep that plan in balance. And I look the competitors, and I think sometimes they've taken it, it's not like any other business. I mean every business is tough, but farming is real tough. So I think that's where experience makes the difference in the know-how and being able to steer that crop and keep it healthy and performing well. It's like a finely tuned athlete, you need to be in your game healthy every single day. And when you lose that, it affects you. So I can't answer when these -- the other folks will start ramping up. I mean they've been doing it a while so I would expect soon they're going to get the numbers going. And so I really can't say, but our concept is based on everything commoditized in farming and this will too. So we're focused on our costs and being able to get a chair at the table when the music stops here. AARON THOMAS GREY: All right. Great. And then just touching, again, on gross margin kind of more on a long-term basis. As we kind of look at the puts and takes there in terms of long-term pricing pressure, which seems to be inevitable as you mentioned, commoditization earlier, but also upside and novel form factors, and also direct to province sales mix for you guys, how best to look at the long-term gross margin opportunity for the company, at least for Pure Sunfarms? STEPHEN C. RUFFINI: Yes, again, we're excited about getting the packaging license. We expect to be able to maintain the -- improve our gross margin dollars. Our gross margin percentage because of the CAD 1 tax will decrease a little bit, but the gross margin dollars will improve. And as we get into oils and extraction, again, will be -- that facility will be up and ready operational by the end of this year. Obviously, we've got to get it licensed from Health Canada. So we should see improved margin from extraction and oils beginning hopefully early 2020. And we'll see how the other various cannabis 2.0 develops in the marketplace. Ultimately, as we're vertically integrated, we're in control and actually extraction -- extracting grade is actually cheaper to harvest because we're not dealing with all the post-harvest cost of the bud. So I think we'll certainly be able to maintain a [significant] market-leading gross margin in all aspects of all products in Canada. OPERATOR: And your final question comes from the line of Hugh Cooper with RBC Financial. HUGH COOPE, VP & DIRECTOR, RBC DOMINION SECURITIES INC.: Congratulations on a great quarter. I think most of my -- I had a few questions, which have been answered. Just wanted to say that you guys have been the one firm in the industry to underpromise and overdeliver. So it's been very, very impressive. On Delta 3, you've got -- I managed a tour there and I noticed that you have a fair amount of office space and vault and so on. Delta 2 is only going to have that small extraction processing center. So you're saying 75,000 kilograms out of each greenhouse. Some of the other LPs have said they're going to get a lot more out of their greenhouses. Is that a number that is flexible or is that a base number or are you guys just -- I don't want to cramp your style, but is that just a base number or can you increase that? MICHAEL A. DEGIGLIO: That's the number and we're sticking to it, Hugh. Look, I think you just got to look at the bio asset, which by the way we won't be reporting when we switch to U.S. here in another quarter, but it's a great indication. And the possibilities are there. We've seen what can happen and it's pretty mind-blowing where we think we'd take it. But prudently based on our experience at some point, things happen, they always happen. It's not a question of if, it's a question of when. And we wanted to take a prudent approach with the new conversion to this crop and get 4 seasons under our belt, and it's gone very well. So Delta 2 is going to have a larger production footprint than Delta 3 as you pointed out. So right there, there's a pickup gain. So I think, yes, the answer is sure, we can get there. And I mean when others say they can get it, they haven't gotten it. So everybody is saying what they can produce, but who's doing it so far. We're meeting our criteria because we had realistic goals to set. And I think at some point, we'll update that. So I hope that answers your question. HUGH COOPE: It does. And just lastly, you've got -- I know you guys have a lot in your plate, but are you contemplating or looking at or you have been in any talks, discussions like joint venturing anything outside of Canada or the U.S.? MICHAEL A. DEGIGLIO: We can't comment on that. But Pure Sunfarms, we structured the company with the total ability to do whatever it wants anywhere in the world. So I think Pure Sunfarms with Delta 2 well on its way. It's all planned out. Construction is going to start. I think the leadership at Pure Sunfarms is clearly looking at opportunities of expansion in the space in a number of areas. They should be doing it and they are within Canada. And I think it's a very focused group. I mean they're focused on expanding operations in Canada, not only just production operations, but product innovation, many different ways. And I think if they get that going and right and they could probably look at international opportunities. Separate from Village Farms, and we're totally looking at that as well. So I think there's more to come there for sure. And as we've always said, let's get the fundamentals right. We wanted to prove that we can make profit -- consistent profit, build a sustainable durable company, profit first and then go from there. I mean honestly, I see companies every day launching IPOs and all based on the CPG pedigree within the company. And these guys are very impressive, but there are a lot of great talented executives in the CPG industry out there. And any company could bring those into this space because this space is new and growing, but it's not the same to get the fundamentals down on the farming side and the production side. You got to have right products to have a good CPG company. So we see it that way and proving profitability is where we wanted to start. Now I think it opens up a lot of opportunities for us, both for Village Farms and Pure Sunfarms. All right. Thank you, everybody. That concludes, no more questions. And we look forward to reporting in November, and thank you so much for your interest in Village Farms. Talk to you soon. Bye. Thank you, operator. OPERATOR: This concludes today's conference.

('Village Farms' or the 'Company') (TSX: VFF) (NASDAQ: VFF) today announced its financial results for the second quarter and six-month period ended June 30, 2019. 'Pure Sunfarms' second quarter financial results firmly rank it among the largest, most efficient and most profitable licensed cannabis producers in Canada, and clearly demonstrates that we have built a best in class cannabis operation setting a new bar for industry performance,' said Michael DeGiglio, Chief Executive Officer, Village Farms. 'Moreover, Pure Sunfarms' ability to achieve this level of operational and financial performance in just 24 months from our initial announcement to enter the cannabis industry is clear validation of our unique conversion strategy. It also underscores the considerable advantage of combining existing, state-of-the-art greenhouse operations with 20 years of site-specific experience, and an exceptional management team, supported by Village Farms' decades-long track record in large-scale, low-cost, precision agriculture.' 'These results are even more impressive given that Pure Sunfarms' first 1.1 million square foot greenhouse, Delta 3, was not yet at full production during the second quarter and sales were almost entirely to other licensed producers at pricing below what Pure Sunfarms expects to realize when selling directly to provincial/territorial and other retailers. We expect Pure Sunfarms to deliver consistent quarter-on-quarter growth throughout this year and next, driven by Delta 3 now operating at full production, the anticipated start of sales directly to the Ontario Cannabis Store and other provincial/territorial and private retailers, expansion of product sales into pre-rolls and oils and other derivative products, and the doubling of capacity to 150,000 kilograms annually with its second 1.1 million square foot facility, Delta 2, expected to begin operations mid-2020 and achieve full production later that year.' 'The success of Pure Sunfarms to date - both operationally and financially - provides us with tremendous confidence as Pure Sunfarms proceeds with the conversion of Delta 2, which will benefit from the same strategy of transferring Village Farms' experienced growers, operational team and skilled crop workers that have been so integral to the success of Delta 3. And we continue to be optimistic about the potential for Pure Sunfarms to further expand production to as much as 330,000 kilograms or more through the addition of the 2.6 million square foot Delta 1 facility, further supporting low-cost production.' 'The second quarter also saw Village Farms take major steps in our aggressive pursuit of the significant hemp and CBD opportunity in the United States as we continue to pivot towards these new outsized growth opportunities and transform the earnings potential of our Company. We established our second joint venture for outdoor hemp cultivation and CBD-extraction, adding Colorado to our production in three eastern states. And we began conversion and enhancement of half of our 1.3 million square foot, ultra-high-tech Permian Basin greenhouse for hemp cultivation and on-site CBD extraction. We remain firmly on track to begin sales of hemp biomass this year, transitioning to sales of CBD crude oil early in 2020, and then commence CBD product manufacturing. We are very active with research and development initiatives, including genetics and developing our downstream strategy to establish Village Farms as a leading, vertically integrated, hempderived CBD company and capture value throughout the supply chain.' About Village Farms International Inc. Village Farms is one of the largest and longest-operating vertically integrated greenhouse growers in North America and the only publicly traded greenhouse produce company in Canada.

Recent Highlights for Village Farms' Canadian Cannabis Joint Venture, Pure Sunfarms - Achieved full run-rate production of 75,000 kilograms of dried cannabis annually at its 1.1 million square foot Delta 3 greenhouse in Delta, B.C., the first and only single site cannabis operation in the world to exceed 1 million square feet; - Received a Standard Processing License from Health Canada for its 1.1 million square foot Delta 3 greenhouse facility which permits Pure Sunfarms to extract and process cannabis at the Delta 3 facility and which will enable the development and manufacture of products derived from the cannabis plant, including cannabis oil, as well as concentrates and edibles, as regulations permit; - Met all Health Canada criteria regarding the amendment to its license that will permit it to sell dried cannabis products directly to provincial/territorial and private retailers in Canada and, in anticipation of receipt of the amendment, continues to prepare for sales and distribution to the Ontario Cannabis Store, with which it has a supply agreement in place, as well as to other provinces, with which it is in discussions for potential supply agreements; - Commenced conversion of its second 1.1 million square foot greenhouse operation, Delta 2, for cannabis production, which is expected to double Pure Sunfarms' annual output at full production to over 150,000 kilograms (expected by the fourth quarter of 2020); - Continued to advance towards completion of the 65,000 square foot state-of-the-art processing center in the Delta 3 facility. The processing center, which will include on-site extraction capabilities and is designed for full GMP compliance and certification, and remains on schedule to be completed by the end of 2019 and operational as soon as possible thereafter subject to Health Canada licensing; - Recently Emerald Health Therapeutics (\"Emerald\") has been electing not to fully exercise its right under the Supply Agreement to purchase 40% of Pure Sunfarms' cannabis production. Pure Sunfarms has sold, and continues to sell, all portions of the production that Emerald did not purchase to other licensed producers in the spot market, where it has been realizing pricing in excess of the predetermined selling price to Emerald under this Supply Agreement. Recent Highlights for Village Farms' U.S. Hemp/CBD Program - Commenced conversion of half of its 1.3 million square foot, ultra-high-tech Permian Basin greenhouse for cultivation of high-CBD hemp and CBD extraction, which will include the implementation of leading-edge technologies that will support Village Farms' leadership position in large-scale precision agriculture. In June 2019, the state of Texas legalized the cultivation of hemp and the processing of hemp and hemp-derived products, including cannabidiol (CBD). The Texas hemp legislation will require licenses for both the cultivation and processing of hemp and Village Farms plans to apply for the requisite licenses as soon as it is permitted to do so; - The Company's joint venture for hemp production and processing in the Eastern U.S., Village Fields Hemp USA, LLC (\"VFH\"), has planted out approximately 600 acres in Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina and expects to begin harvesting in August of this year, with initial sales of hemp biomass to commence in the fourth quarter of 2019. VFH is now well advanced in planning and engineering work to establish its centralized extraction operations in the southeastern U.S., which is expected to be operational in the first quarter of 2020; and, - Expanded U.S. outdoor hemp cultivation and CBD extraction program to Colorado through a new joint venture, Arkansas Valley Green and Gold Hemp, LLC (\"AVGGH\") for the outdoor cultivation of high-cannabidiol (CBD) hemp and CBD extraction. AVGGH has planted 120 acres of Hemp and expects to begin harvesting in October 2019. \"Pure Sunfarms' second quarter financial results firmly rank it among the largest, most efficient and most profitable licensed cannabis producers in Canada, and clearly demonstrates that we have built a best in class cannabis operation setting a new bar for industry performance,\" said Michael DeGiglio, Chief Executive Officer, Village Farms. \"Moreover, Pure Sunfarms' ability to achieve this level of operational and financial performance in just 24 months from our initial announcement to enter the cannabis industry is clear validation of our unique conversion strategy. It also underscores the considerable advantage of combining existing, state-of-the-art greenhouse operations with 20 years of site-specific experience, and an exceptional management team, supported by Village Farms' decades-long track record in large-scale, low-cost, precision agriculture.\" \"These results are even more impressive given that Pure Sunfarms' first 1.1 million square foot greenhouse, Delta 3, was not yet at full production during the second quarter and sales were almost entirely to other licensed producers at pricing below what Pure Sunfarms expects to realize when selling directly to provincial/territorial and other retailers. We expect Pure Sunfarms to deliver consistent quarter-on-quarter growth throughout this year and next, driven by Delta 3 now operating at full production, the anticipated start of sales directly to the Ontario Cannabis Store and other provincial/territorial and private retailers, expansion of product sales into pre-rolls and oils and other derivative products, and the doubling of capacity to 150,000 kilograms annually with its second 1.1 million square foot facility, Delta 2, expected to begin operations mid-2020 and achieve full production later that year.\" \"The success of Pure Sunfarms to date -- both operationally and financially -- provides us with tremendous confidence as Pure Sunfarms proceeds with the conversion of Delta 2, which will benefit from the same strategy of transferring Village Farms' experienced growers, operational team and skilled crop workers that have been so integral to the success of Delta 3. And we continue to be optimistic about the potential for Pure Sunfarms to further expand production to as much as 330,000 kilograms or more through the addition of the 2.6 million square foot Delta 1 facility, further supporting low-cost production.\" \"The second quarter also saw Village Farms take major steps in our aggressive pursuit of the significant hemp and CBD opportunity in the United States as we continue to pivot towards these new outsized growth opportunities and transform the earnings potential of our Company. We established our second joint venture for outdoor hemp cultivation and CBD-extraction, adding Colorado to our production in three eastern states. And we began conversion and enhancement of half of our 1.3 million square foot, ultra-high-tech Permian Basin greenhouse for hemp cultivation and on-site CBD extraction. We remain firmly on track to begin sales of hemp biomass this year, transitioning to sales of CBD crude oil early in 2020, and then commence CBD product manufacturing. We are very active with research and development initiatives, including genetics and developing our downstream strategy to establish Village Farms as a leading, vertically integrated, hemp-derived CBD company and capture value throughout the supply chain.\" Summary Statutory Results (in thousands of U.S. Dollars unless otherwise indicated)  Summary Results Including Joint Ventures, on a Proportionate Basis The following results reflect the Company's proportionate share of the Pure Sunfarms joint venture operations, as this is the basis on which management bases its operating decisions and performance.

Details of the changes are described in note 5 of the Company's interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the six months ended June 30, 2019. (2)EBITDA is not a recognized earnings measure and does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS. Therefore, EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. See \"Non-IFRS Measures\". Management believes that EBITDA is a useful supplemental measure in evaluating the performance of the Company. Consolidated EBITDA includes the Company's 50% interest in Pure Sunfarms, 65% interest in VFH and 60% (effective 63.25% with VFH interest) interest in AVGGH. (3)The consolidated financial results above reflect the proportionate share of the Company's share of revenues and expenses from its joint venture operations, as this is the basis which management bases its operating decisions and performance evaluation. IFRS does not allow for the inclusion of the joint venture on a proportionate basis. These results include additional non-IFRS measures such as EBITDA. The results are not generally accepted measures of financial performance under IFRS. The Company's method of calculating these financial performance measures may differ from other companies and accordingly, they may not be comparable to measures used by other companies.

Canadians know that we need a healthy environment for a strong economy. The Government of Canada is taking action with initiatives like cutting edge research on climate change and biodiversity at the Experimental Farm. The Government is also supporting the innovations of small businesses and entrepreneurs who have bold ideas that can protect our environment and create new sustainable solutions for the agriculture and agri-food sectors. Today, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Canada, Catherine McKenna, on behalf of Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Marie-Claude Bibeau, announced an investment of up to $600,000 under the Innovative Solutions Canada program for four new projects. Minister McKenna made the announcement following a tour of the Experimental Farm where she met with researchers and discussed their work on environmental sustainability. 20 federal departments, across government, have committed a total of $100 million to support the Canada's small business innovators and entrepreneurs, through Innovative Solutions Canada. This program uses the Government of Canada's purchasing power to help companies scale up and grow their businesses.  Today's announcement provides up to $150,000 each to four businesses with exciting new ideas for solving challenges in the agriculture sector: *EcoEnviro Labs Inc. will test a new organic bioplastic mulch made from poultry feathers. This is a lower-waste, fully biodegradable and compostable way to produce mulch needed in Canada's agriculture. *Titan Clean Energy Projects Corp. will be testing a food-grade quality bioplastic, ideal for fruit or prepared vegetable containers,that biodegrades more quickly, meaning less landfill and more sustainable options for grocery stores and shoppers. *Troo Corporation will test the viability of their idea for an agricultural 'Internet of Things'. The smart data hub will collect data from existing farm management tools and bring them together in one place, reducing the research and operational costs for small producers and increasing the adoption of precision agricultural practices; and *Expert Systems Inc. will be testing a drone-based technology that uses artificial intelligence to provide a more affordable and fully autonomous crop protection and spraying solution that will help reduce herbicide and pesticide use as well as operational costs for producers. Quotes \"The Government of Canada recognizes the important role innovators and entrepreneurs play in our economy. The four projects announced today have the potential to make Canada's agriculture sector more profitable and sustainable, and we look forward to seeing the results.\"  - Marie-Claude Bibeau, Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food \"These innovative solutions are great example of the transformation that is underway in Canada's agriculture and environment sectors. Our government is proud to see Canadian small businesses at the forefront of finding solutions to environmental challenges that affect Canada and our planet as a whole.\" - Catherine McKenna, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Quick facts *The Innovative Solutions Canada (ISC) program is investing up to $100 million to support the scale up and growth of Canada's small business innovators and entrepreneurs by having the federal government act as a first customer. *Up to $600,000 has been committed for four projects that were submitted to address two ISC challenges issued by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada: Improved Composability of Bioplastics and Scaling Down Precision Agriculture. *If successful at the proof of concept stage, projects are each eligible for up to $1 million under Phase 2 of the ISC for prototype development. The government may then act as a first customer, helping these small businesses commercialize their innovations.

First was a report July 22 from the Canadian Agriculture Human Resources Council (CAHRC) that said \"nearly all farm employers share similar challenges when it comes to finding the workers they need to succeed. Without a clear understanding of the underlying issues and potential solutions, workforce shortages may have consequences for this vital part of the Canadian economy.\" Greater use of new technology \"has increased the need for management skills among operators who must transition from being farmers to employers, and strong productivity gains have reduced the need for some types of workers while changing the required skills for many of the jobs that remain,\" the CAHRC said. The next day, in what is being described as coincidence, Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi announced spending of up to $49.5 million in the Canadian Agri-Food Automation and Intelligence Network (CAAIN), a network dedicated to bringing together the private sector, academia and research institutions together to accelerate automation and digitization in Canada's agricultural sector. CAAIN is putting together a $108.5-million project to boost artificial intelligence (AI), robotics and precision agriculture systems to help Canadian farmers be more internationally competitive, Sohi said. The research could also produce exportable farming solutions Canadian companies could market. CAAIN will be spearheaded by Alberta Innovates and the Vineland Research and Innovation Centre with support from Alberta's Olds College and Lakeland College and expects to begin operations with eight partners from British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario and Quebec. The Olds College Smart Farm will be the hub for developing and testing new technologies. CEO Laura Kilcrease of Alberta Innovates said, \"Demand is growing for Canada to help feed a hungry planet, and our new technologies, approaches and processes, in conjunction with meaningful partnerships, will strengthen our agricultural sector and help meet that demand. CAAIN will build on innovation within the agricultural sector by bringing technology to market, applying data and new problem-solving technologies like artificial intelligence, and identifying opportunities for collaboration across the value chain between sectors.\" While the number of farm job vacancies has dropped to the 15,000 range, \"farm businesses lost 2.9 billion in 2018 because they could not find the people that they needed to work on-farm,\" CAHRC said. In 2014, the worker shortage costs farmers about $1.5 billion worth of lost sales. The number of unfilled vacancies decreased during that period which \"speaks to the type of jobs that are going unfilled, likely higher-skilled jobs that have a greater impact on a business if left unfilled.\" In its Labour Market Forecast to 2029, CAHRC said technology has the potential to dramatically reduce labour requirements in farming like other industries. \"Along with being able to manage with a decreased number of workers, technology and innovation have enabled farmers to streamline their operations and rapidly improve efficiencies.\" Already the sector's adoption of technology has \"contributed to agriculture experiencing the strongest labour productivity gains of any major sector over the past 20 years. Productivity is forecasted to grow by up to 1.6 per cent a year, compared to the Canadian average of 0.7 per cent, partly as a result of the influence of technology. Continuing to improve farm productivity and shifting away from labour-intensive practices will help address workforce issues.\" However increased use of technology will change the kind of workers farmers will be seeking to men and women \"with the technical knowledge and digital expertise needed to program, operate and service highly technical machinery and equipment, as well as provide specialized animal care,\" the forecast said. \"There is a need to develop new skill sets within the sector. \"There are many opportunities for the way forward in addressing workforce shortages,\" says CAHRC executive-d-rector Portia Mac-Donald-Dewhirst. \"Our ability to be resilient as a sector and adapt to changing technology will depend on our ability to respond in a timely way to new skills requirements.\""}, {"title": "AJX AgJunction loses $682,000 (U.S.) in Q2 2019", "article": "AgJunction Inc (TSX:AJX) Shares Issued 118,561,641 Last Close 8/7/2019 $0.48 Wednesday August 07 2019 - News Release Mr. Jeff Morris reports AGJUNCTION REPORTS SECOND QUARTER 2019 EARNINGS RESULTS AgJunction Inc. has released its financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2019.

The decline was primarily driven by the sale of the Outback and Satloc businesses in September, 2018, and November, 2018, respectively, partially offset by the fulfilment of shipments related to the bulk purchase order (BPO). Gross profit in the second quarter of 2019 was $4.6-million compared with $5.4-million in the second quarter of 2018. Gross margin was 34.8 per cent compared with 39.3 per cent in the second quarter of 2018. The margin decline was primarily related to an increase in cost of the product mix sold. Total operating expenses in the second quarter of 2019 declined to $5.4-million compared with $7.7-million in the second quarter of 2018, primarily driven by a decrease in employee compensation costs related to the aforementioned sale of the Outback and Satloc businesses. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses declined to 40.4 per cent compared with 56.3 per cent in the second quarter of 2018. Net loss in the second quarter of 2019 improved to $700,000 or (one cent) per share, compared with a net loss of $2.3-million or (two cents) per share in the second quarter of 2018. The improvement was primarily driven by the aforementioned decrease in total operating expenses.

When asked why the U of W was interested in agricultural research despite lacking a strong connection to the industry, Bidinosti pointed out that the problem of data collection, digitalization, and automation is a global issue and can be applied to the agriculture industry among other sectors. The point is, this isnt really an agricultural problem, he said. Its a data problem, a machine learning problem, a computational problem, and its a sensors problem. We have skills in all of those areas as individual researchers, so it was actually very easy and efficient for use to focus on this looming problem. Bringing those expertise into the sector will give the U of W researchers and their students new problems to grapple with using their skills. We were in a position with all of our expertise in sensors, computing and data where it made a lot of sense, and we decided to jump on it, he said. Bidinosti says he hopes to show more students the potential of working in or with the agriculture industry, and in turn, show agricultural employers what type of skills they might look for and expect from new graduates. So what will they be researching? A few weeks ago the Manitoba Co-operator saw a prototype of a plant identification project. The goal of this project is to be able to look at examples of weed species and correctly identify the plant. The prototype uses cameras and identification software with thousands of previously collected images to identify the plant and weed species that wed see here in Manitoba. The problem? A lot of plants look alike, even to the most experienced agronomists. Making sure the software will correctly identify a plant requires the researchers to take thousands of pictures of each different plant species at all of the growing stages. The pictures of the plants at different stages go into a database for the software to reference when identifying a new plant. Their research team is currently in its most important phase, collecting and cataloguing the plant images. The team hopes to have the collection done as soon as it can, noting that it will be an extensive process nonetheless. As more varieties and different crops appear in rotations, and new weeds crop up, having an accurate set of images for the ID software to work with is a crucial first step."}, {"title": "Kubota steps up with bigger tractors", "article": "With plenty of fanfare, and a little obligatory concert fog, two new tractors rolled into view at a national Kubota dealer event this week. The news was launch of the Kubota M8 series, built by Buhler Industries in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Can. The new machines are Kubota-designed and will offer more power for key segments of the market. Todd Stucke remembers starting the conversation in 2013 with Kubota about the need to grow bigger in tractors. Stucke is senior vice president of sales, marketing and product support for Kubota and he noted the challenge for the company was designing and building a totally new and larger tractor without stressing \"internal resources.\" The aim was to bring in bigger machines and maximize engineering and design talent. From that early idea came the approach of having the tractors purpose built by Buhler Industries in Winnipeg. \"This is a custom OEM product that has Kubota DNA,\" Stucke says. \"They've been good to work with and responsive.\" Stuck explains that Kubota brought its manufacturing practices to that Winnipeg plant and that process taught both companies new things along the way. And the process continued. \"From when we saw prototype No. 1 through what we have today is an evolution that used their expertise and ours.\" Stucke emphasizes that the M8 follows on the M7 and that product relationship is clear. Today the M8 series is a next generation model for the company. Some specs While Stucke says the process started in 2013 to start creating this new product, the relationship that created the original equipment manufacturing relationship was formalized in 2016. Essentially it took six years to bring this tractor from idea to the market. In that time, Kubota also built on its brand acquiring Kverneland with its hay and tillage tools and Great Plains with its tillage, planting and application equipment. And in many cases those acquisitions brought along implements that required more horsepower to pull than Kubota had available. As Stucke says: \"The M8 allows us to aggressively fill a higher-horsepower customer need across the large utility and mid-size row crop tractor market - for material handling and hay tool application on dairy and livestock operations as well as a variety of field work. Built with an operating experience focused on easy-to-control comfort, confident workability, and intuitive controls for precision farming, the M8 will maximize return on investment for Kubota customers today and well into the future.\" There are two models in the M8 series and both are powered by a Cummins 6-cylinger B-Series 6.7-liter diesel engine. The engine meets tough emission standards in the Unites States, and future tighter regulations proposed for Europe called Stage 5. Kubota does not make a six cylinder engine, so management turned to this outside supplier for power. The M8 191 clocks in at 190 engine hp. The M8-211 hits 210 engine hp. The Cummins choice was popular among dealers who got to see the new machine. \"Cummins is well known in the ag market,\" Stucke notes. \"And when these machines come out all service will be handled by Kubota dealers.\" In some markets where Cummins power is used, service is provided by a separate Cummins-certified network, but Kubota and its leaders want to have customers going to their dealers for support. The engine is mated to either a semi-powershift transmission or the KVT continuously variable transmission that farmers are familiar with on the M7 series. Both M8 models will feature four-wheel drive as standard. The tractors feature a spacious cab that one dealer likened to the size of a combine cab. In fact the cab has 148 cubic feet of space and is a roomy operating platform for the machine. Production of market-ready models will begin in January with a gradual introduction to the dealer network. Based on comments from dealers at the premier event, many are ready to go to market now. Pre-production models were on hand for the launch, and over the next few weeks Kubota and its dealers will review these near-final models for any needed tweaks, Stucke says. During the event, Haruyuki (Harry) Yoshida, president and CEO of Kubota Tractor Corporation and Kubota North America said that in \"five years we will look back...and celebrate the pioneers of this tractor launch. And we will not only meet the needs but exceed expectations.\""}, {"title": "Federal funds help Lakeland and partners", "article": "On July 22, the Government of Canada's ministry of Innovation, Science and Economic Development announced an investment of $49.5 million through the Strategic Innovation Fund (stream four) for CAAIN, a network comprised of academic, private sector and research institutions to accelerate the automation and digitization of Canada's agricultural sector.

In addition to improved performance and a tighter turning ratio that supports more effective configurations, K-Turns offers farmers the benefit of further reducing the area required to perform a turn with their equipment. The classic keyhole turn requires a large headland to make a turn for the next row, while K-Turns can reduce the size of that headland by half and better utilize the grower's fields. This increases the amount of the field available for planting and provides a safer turning option for farmers with land that borders canals, creeks and other challenging terrain. \"AgJunction really considers how autosteering effects the work of the farmer and the mechanics of agriculture itself,\" said M. Brett McMickell, chief operating offcier of AgJunction. \"The K-Turns capability is about improving efficiency without overlapping to maximize utilization of the entire field. Using minimal headland space means a greater yield is possible, along with the ability to make more efficient turns and adjustments, while providing greater autonomy to be more productive.\" Bob Barjesteh, vice-president, merger and acquisition, intellectual property and general counsel for AgJunction, commented: \"Owning this important technology further solidifies our patent coverage in machine steering, specifically in the area of auto headland turns. We also were just granted the European patent for this technology, where the K-Turns capability is even more critical to farmers because of the slightly smaller field sizes.\" Since 2016, AgJunction has added 72 new patent matters with 13 new patents issued.

Both executives will focus primarily on the Heliae (R) Agriculture arm of the business in these new roles for the company. Norm Davy brings more than 30 years of sales, marketing and business development expertise in the agricultural industry, including vast knowledge and experience in biotech seed, crop protection chemistry and precision agriculture software technology. He most recently developed new markets for cutting-edge enhanced-efficiency fertilizers that embody global regenerative agriculture principles that use technology to improve soil health and the environment. Davy has worked for multinational corporations and startups in North America, Central America, South America and Australia. Davy comes to Heliae from Anuvia Plant Nutrients, where he was vice president, ag sales. He has held C-level roles with industry-leading organizations including Cargill, Univar, Uniroyal Chemicals (Bayer) and Monsanto (Bayer). \"In concert with the leadership team at Heliae, we purposely selected my title of chief revenue officer as it is a pivotal role directly influencing the future of the company and covers new business sales, installed client-based sales, marketing and partner strategy,\" said Davy. \"It's all about fast, sustainable and customer-centered growth. One of the things I'm most excited about is helping Heliae (R) Agriculture grow from where it is today to being a significant contributor to regenerative agriculture. That's a pretty noble cause I can play a small role in.\" \"Norm possesses specialized knowledge and proven experience that will differentiate Heliae and lead us on our path of addressing some of the world's major challenges with our microalgae technology,\" said Heliae President and CEO Eric Lichtenheld. \"And his passion for sustainable agriculture truly complements the work we do at Heliae.\" Agriculture has always played a big role in Davy's life. He was born and raised on a farm in Western Canada. Realizing he had no chance, as the youngest of four boys, to get a shot at the family farm, he started taking vocational agriculture classes at the local university. He earned his M.B.A. in food and agribusiness from the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada. When not traveling for work, Davy is busy following his wife of 31 years. She plays goalie as a senior women's ice hockey hall of famer. He is also passionate about golfing and fishing with family or customers on the Gulf of Mexico. The couple is busy preparing to move from Florida to Arizona. Their soon-to-be five grandchildren live in Minnesota and Canada. Lon Kreger brings more than a decade of sales and marketing in the agriculture industry to Heliae. He joins Heliae from Loveland Products where he was international business development manager. At Loveland, Kreger was responsible for the company's strategic direction, product development, market and strategic development for everything outside of the U.S. and Canada, acquisitions, integrations and facilitating international regulatory processes. Kreger describes himself as \"relationship centric\" above all else. He says, \"The biggest focus in all business is on building partnerships. The world we live in is a small one and there's not a lot of thought or strategy or effort needed to have a client-supplier relationship. But if you want longer health and viability for your organization, you need to look for partnerships with customers. It's a genuine relationship. Sometimes it's a win-win. Sometimes it's more beneficial for one group than the other. However, if both organizations are mutually invested, we'll end up with an outcome that's best for both of us through the long-term.\" Kreger's expertise also lies in managing and designing channel strategies. To him, it's about finding the unique access point in a channel and avoiding channel conflicts with different products through market segmentation strategies. Kreger is passionate about the strategic nature of both product and channel development in business. He genuinely enjoys creating new relationships, making friends in business and helping historical relationships move past any generic client-style relationships and developing them into true partnerships. \"Lon will play an integral role in international expansion as well as product and commercial development,\" said Lichtenheld. \"And with Lon's natural affinity for business development and partnership building, we're excited about the numerous potential opportunities ahead -- and to see where Lon takes Heliae (R) Agriculture internationally in this new role and on this new journey.\" Despite his work, Kreger is finishing both an M.B.A. and a master's in business analytics from Syracuse University, which has one of the strongest worldwide analytics programs.

They said the involvement of local industry in research and collaboration with academic and research institutions, effective communication, extension and outreach can enhance the adaptation of precision agriculture technologies in Pakistan. Speakers also emphasised the need to develop and initiate collaborative research projects between experts from the University of Prince Edward Island in Canada and Pir Mehr Ali Shah Arid Agriculture University Rawalpindi. Growers, processors and machine manufacturers should be engaged to develop the technologies to meet regional needs The day long international seminar was organised by the Arid university's Faculty of Agriculture Engineering. The university's vice chancellor Dr Qamaruz Zaman was invited as the chief guest, while Pakistan Agricultural Research Council's Agricultural Engineering Division Director General Liaqat Ali Shahid was the guest of honour. Dr Zaman spoke about issues in agricultural development and emphasised the use of modern agricultural technology and machinery to enhance agriculture produce. He said education plays a significant role in the development of any country, and there need to be strong links between academia and the agriculture industry to address the problems and challenges facing the agriculture sector and boost the economy. He said the agricultural production system should be improved along scientific lines to enhance sustainable food production, and urged the university's scientists to help raise awareness among the farming community about the latest techniques in agriculture. Dr Aitzaz Farooque, associate professor at the University of Prince Edward Island's School of Sustainable Design Engineering, said agriculture was a key resource to ensure food security on the planet. The increasing world's population demands more food for survival, as agricultural land is shrinking because of urbanisation and intensification, he said. He added that agriculture production typically involves uniform applications of crop growing inputs, ignoring spatial and temporal variations in soil, crop, yield or weather and topographic attributes that exist within fields. Uniform application not only increases the production cost but also adversely affects our environment. Dr Farooque was of the view that sustainable agriculture production requires discoveries, innovations and technical skills, which need to be integrated into traditional farming to achieve targeted applications of crop growing inputs on an as-needed basis. He said that precision agriculture technologies are meant to increase production efficiency, profitability and environmental efficiency. Dr Mohammad Azam, a post-doctoral research associate at Chungbuk National University in South Korea, spoke about hardware and software based smart technologies for early flood warning systems directly connected to people's mobile phones. Arid university Institute of Geo Information and Earth Observation in-charge Dr Mohammad Ali Hasan Baig discussed challenges to the adoption of precision agriculture practices in the country and suggested a way forward in the context of remote sensing, with special attention on hyper spectral remote sensing. Dr Naveed Tahir delivered a lecture on the use of unmanned aerial vehicle based spraying technology in Pakistan, and said that arid university was going to establish a centre for precision drone spraying technology."}, {"title": "Minister Sohi announces investment in the future of farming", "article": "New innovation competition will bring together eight partners to accelerate Canadian leadership in digitization and automation in agriculture EDMONTON, July 22, 2019 /CNW/ - The Government of Canada continues to invest in the agriculture and agri-food industry to create good middle-class jobs and ensure the sector punches above its weight in a competitive global market.

After today's 50th anniversary of Neil Armstrong's first footsteps on the surface of the moon, Canadians are no doubt taking stock of Canada's role in space. It's a role most Canadians (80%) are proud of. This, according to a DART and Maru Blue poll provided exclusively to the Sun. Three in four Canadians (73%) feel we have benefited from what we've learned in space and the innovations that resulted from our participation in space exploration. About two-thirds (63%) have been personally inspired by Canada's astronauts. As for future space research, seven in 10 (68%) say the federal government should keep funding the Canadian Space Agency at its present level (47%) or increase it (21%), with just one in 10 (11%) believing it should be reduced or eliminated (6%.) If Canadians could personally rank ten possible priorities for the Canadian Space Agency, the top three would be to ensure technology is available to aid in disaster response (80%), provide imagery and telecommunications for the safety and security of Canadians (74%) and to provide accurate measurement for weather and climate monitoring (70%.) The DART and Maru Voice Canada Poll was undertaken for the Sun as part of a regular sounding of Canadians on various issues that affect their lives as citizens, consumers, and voters.

Kreger describes himself as \"relationship centric\" above all else. He says, \"The biggest focus in all business is on building partnerships. The world we live in is a small one and there's not a lot of thought or strategy or effort needed to have a client-supplier relationship. But if you want longer health and viability for your organization, you need to look for partnerships with customers. It's a genuine relationship. Sometimes it's a win-win. Sometimes it's more beneficial for one group than the other. However, if both organizations are mutually invested, we'll end up with an outcome that's best for both of us through the long-term.\" Kreger's expertise also lies in managing and designing channel strategies. To him, it's about finding the unique access point in a channel and avoiding channel conflicts with different products through market segmentation strategies.

According to news reporting out of Kingston, Canada, by VerticalNews editors, research stated, \"A 'digital revolution' in agriculture is underway. Advanced technologies like sensors, artificial intelligence, and robotics are increasingly being promoted as a means to increase food production efficiency while minimizing resource use.\" Funders for this research include Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC), University of Guelph's Canada First Research Excellence Fund project. Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Queen's University, \"In the process, agricultural digitalization raises critical social questions about the implications for diverse agricultural labourers and rural spaces as digitalization evolves. In this paper, we use literature and field data to outline some key trends being observed at the nexus of agricultural production, technology, and labour in North America, with a particular focus on the Canadian context. Using the data, we highlight three key tensions observed: rising land costs and automation; the development of a high-skill/low-skilled bifurcated labour market; and issues around the control of digital data. With these tensions in mind, we use a social justice lens to consider the potential implications of digital agricultural technologies for farm labour and rural communities, which directs our attention to racial exploitation in agricultural labour specifically. In exploring these tensions, we argue that policy and research must further examine how to shift the trajectory of digitalization in ways that support food production as well as marginalized agricultural labourers, while pointing to key areas for future research-which is lacking to date.\" According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"We emphasize that the current enthusiasm for digital agriculture should not blind us to the specific ways that new technologies intensify exploitation and deepen both labour and spatial marginalization.\" Our news journalists report that additional information may be obtained by contacting S.

Despite the recent addition of tariff-related pressures, however, some remain optimistic that relief could be on the horizon. According to the 2017 U.S. Census of Agriculture, which is conducted every five years by the United States Department of Agriculture, net cash farm income in Spokane County dropped by 67% from 2012 to 2017, and the total market value of products sold decreased by 22% during that period. Chris Mertz, northwest regional director for the USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service, says part of decrease in income is due to the fact that 2012 was an especially profitable year for wheat. \"I remember when the 2012 numbers came out, I said, 'This is going to be kind of an odd year,\"' Mertz says. \"That year, we had lower inventories and higher prices. Our average market year price in 2012 ... for all wheat in the state of Washington, was $8.70 per bushel.\" By comparison, the 2017 average market year price was $4.85 per bushel. The market value of all wheat grown in Spokane County in 2012 was just over $75,000; by 2017, that value dropped to about $30,000. While wheat production increased statewide by about 4.7 million bushels, Spokane County's wheat production dropped by about 2.7 million bushels. Glen Squires, CEO of the Spokane-based state industry agency Washington Grain Commission, says wheat farmers also have been grappling with high operations expenses and stagnant income. \"The cost of everything - fuel, inputs, taxes - goes up, but the price per bushel isn't much different than it was 20 years ago,\" Squires says. Marci Green, a wheat farmer and owner of Green View Farms Inc., located near Fairfield, says the farm economy in general has tightened, but wheat farmers in particular have been struggling to keep up with operations expenses. 'When the price of wheat was up, the cost of our inputs went up also,\" says Green, who also is a past president of the Washington Association of Wheat Growers. \"When the price comes down, the price of our inputs doesn't usually come down, so therefore our margins get a lot tighter. The price was up a little more two or three years ago, but the input costs have also gone up significantly.\" Green View Farms' largest expense is equipment, Green says. She says the farm has been finding ways to decrease equipment costs in order to balance out the lower market prices of wheat. \"There are some pieces of equipment we have bought jointly with neighboring farmers. We share it, so we only have to pay part of the cost,\" Green says. \"We've also looked at leasing some equipment, rather than buying.\" Green says the farm has also been investing in more high-tech solutions to reduce costs. \"We use precision agriculture. A lot of that is GPS systems, which reduce the amount of overlap that we have,\" Green says. \"So, if we're spraying chemicals, we're not spraying part of the field twice.\" Green says some farmers who have been unable to cope with rising costs and declining income have chosen to retire, while others have left the farming industry altogether. Other farmers, Squires says, increase their acreage in an attempt to produce more wheat. Green says some of these farms increase acreage by buying the land retiring farmers sell. Farmers have also been affected by ongoing trade disputes, Green says. As previously reported in the Journal, total wheat exports from Washington slipped by about 8% last year; Green says nearly 90% of wheat grown in Washington is destined for export. \"We were selling some wheat to China before the tariffs, and as soon as the tariffs went on, it went to zero,\" Green says. The impact of trade disputes on wheat farmers can't be quantified, Green says. \"It's one of those things where we don't know where our markets would be without the uncertainty, so you can't really put a price on it,\" she says. Green says that when tariffs are brought up in the global political conversation, customers become uncertain about the future of their trade relationship with U.S. farmers, and begin to view those farmers as unreliable sources of commodifies. \"In Japan, for example, the wheat industry has spent 60 years developing a relationship with the Japanese millers and bakers,\" Green says. \"Now that's in jeopardy because we're not part of the CPTPP. The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership is a trade agreement between several countries, including Canada, Japan, Mexico, Australia, and Chile. It was formalized in early 2018 and went into effect Dec. 30. Green says that she and other farmers are hopeful that a new trade agreement with Japan can be forged in the near future. \"Once you lose those markets or you lose market share, it's very difficult to get that back,\" she says. Farmers also have been feeling the squeeze of tariffs on materials needed for production, Green says. In 2018, the U.S. implemented tariffs on steel and aluminum coming to the U.S. from all other countries, with the exceptions of Canada and Mexico. \"We kind of get it from both sides,\" Green says. \"It's harder to sell our product in the global marketplace, and the cost of our inputs goes up because we're paying the tariffs to bring things into our country.\" Green says most farming equipment is made from steel, as well as storage facilities such as grain silos. \"I know people who were planning to put up new grain storage facilities, and then the steel tariffs went on and the price went up so significantly that they postponed building their new facilities,\" Green says. While trade disputes continue, Mertz says the outlook for wheat production this year is somewhat more positive than recent years - he compares outlooks for harvest volume and market prices to the 2012 crop. Wheat crops are behind schedule in the Midwest, while parts of Australia have struggled with droughts. \"It's a global market, so if some countries are doing poorly, sometimes we get higher prices for what we have, and vice versa. Some areas of our country are doing poorly, so some commodities in other parts of the country benefit from that,\" Mertz says. 'We've been noticing that the commodity market's prices are going up. With inventories potentially decreasing, this year could end up being a higher market average price year.\" Green says wheat farmers throughout the state expect crops of average or above-average production. \"We are optimistic. It's not a huge crop, but it should be at least average,\" Green says. \"In the southern central parts of the state, they're actually getting close to harvesting. In our area just south of Spokane, we probably won't be harvesting until August.\" Whether market prices rise to match production volumes, Green says most farmers will find ways to remain flexible. 'We have good years and we have bad years, and it's been that way since the beginning of time,\" Green says. \"Farmers are pretty resilient. We work hard to adapt to the challenges and work toward efficiency. We'll continue to do that, and hopefully we don't lose too many (farms) along the way.\" \"It's harder to sell our product in the global marketplace, and the cost of our Inputs goes up because we're paying the tariffs.'\" Marci Green Green View Farms Inc. 67 Percentage of decrease in Spokane County net cash farm income from 2O12-2017."}, {"title": "Remote Sensing; New Findings on Remote Sensing Described by Investigators at McGill University (Clustering Tools for Integration of Satellite Remote Sensing Imagery and Proximal Soil Sensing Data)", "article": "2019 JUL 1 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Journal of Engineering -- Investigators discuss new findings in Remote Sensing.

A new clustering technique was introduced and compared with existing clustering tools to determine the relatively homogeneous parts of agricultural fields. A DUALEM-21S sensor, along with high-accuracy topography data, was used to characterize soil variability in three agricultural fields situated in Ontario, Canada. Sentinel-2 data assisted in quantifying bare soil and vegetation indices (VIs). The custom Neighborhood Search Analyst (NSA) data clustering tool was implemented using Python scripts. In this algorithm, part of the variance of each data layer is accounted for by subdividing the field into smaller, relatively homogeneous, areas. The algorithm's attributes were illustrated using field elevation, shallow and deep apparent electrical conductivity (ECa), and several VIs.\" According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The unique feature of this proposed protocol was the successful development of user-friendly and open source options for defining the spatial continuity of each group and for use in the zone delineation process.\" For more information on this research see: Clustering Tools for Integration of Satellite Remote Sensing Imagery and Proximal Soil Sensing Data.

Tractors will drive with no farmer in the cab, and specialised equipment will be able to spray, plant, plough and weed cropland. And it's all happening well before many analysts had predicted thanks to small start-ups in Canada and Australia. While industry leaders Deere and CNH Industrial haven't said when they'll release similar offerings, Saskatchewan's Dot Technology has already sold some so-called power platforms for fully mechanised spring planting. In Australia, SwarmFarm Robotics is leasing weedkilling robots that can also do tasks like mow and spread. The companies say their machines are smaller and smarter than the gigantic machinery they aim to replace. Sam Bradford, a farm manager at Arcturus Downs in Australia's Queensland state, was an early adopter as part of a pilot programme for SwarmFarm last year. He used four robots, each about the size of a lorry, to kill weeds. In previous years, Mr Bradford had used a 36m wide, 14.5-tonne spraying machine that \"looks like a massive praying mantis.\" It would blanket the field in chemicals, he said. But the robots were more precise. They distinguished the dull brown colour of the farm's paddock from green foliage, and targeted chemicals directly at the weeds. It's a task the farm does two to three times a year over 20,000 acres. With the robots, Mr Bradford said he can save 80pc of his chemical costs. \"The savings on chemicals is huge, but there's also savings for the environment from using less chemicals and you're also getting a better result in the end,\" said Mr Bradford, who has run the farm for 10 years. Surrounding rivers run out to the Great Barrier Reef off Australia's eastern cost, making the farm particularly sensitive over its use of chemicals, he said. Costs savings have become especially crucial as a multi-year retreat of prices depresses farm incomes and tightens margins. The Bloomberg Grains Spot Index is down more than 50pc since its peak in 2012. Meanwhile, advances in seed technology, fertilisers and other crop inputs has led to soaring yields and oversupply. Producers are eager to find any edge possible at a time when the US-China trade war is disrupting the usual flow of agriculture exports. Farmers need to get to the next level of profitability and efficiency in farming, and \"we've lost sight of that with engineering that doesn't match the agronomy,\" said SwarmFarm's chief executive Andrew Bate. \"Robots flip that on its head. What's driving adoption in agriculture is better farming systems and better ways to grow crops.\" In Saskatchewan in Canada, the first commercially sold autonomous tractors made by Dot were arriving in fields this year. The Dot units won't be completely on their own this year farmers who bought equipment as part of a limited release are required to watch them at all times. But after this trial run, the producers may be able to let the equipment run on its own starting next year. That will open up a lot of time for the growers who will no longer need to sit behind the steering wheel. Farmers are always managing multiple tasks, said Leah Olson-Friesen, CEO of Dot. \"When you look at the amount of intelligence that's sitting in the cab, they could be on the phone doing different things or outside of the cab there's some real opportunities there.\" But farmers do more than steer when they're in the cabs of their tractors, said Alex Purdy, head of John Deere Labs and director of precision agriculture technology. Deere hasn't yet released fully autonomous equipment because the technology that's out there still isn't good enough to replace people, he said. Machinery that uses automation for tasks right now is more beneficial to farmers than autonomous equipment, Mr Purdy said. Artificial intelligence, deep learning and advances in computer vision are going to transform agricultural machinery even further, he said. \"Automation is a neverending journey there's always something that will get better over time, and there's so much opportunity that we're prioritising automation over autonomy,\" added Mr Purdy. A modern tractor does thousands of tasks, and to provide a fully autonomous solution, a deep understanding of each of those tasks is needed to automate them, said Brett McClelland, product manager of autonomous vehicles at CNH Industrial. One of the areas that are still evolving is the ability of machines to see. \"Sensing and perception is one of the most challenging overarching themes,\" said Mr McClelland. While CNH Industrial in 2016 revealed a sleek, aggressive-looking prototype to much fanfare, the product is still in test pilots and not yet commercially available. For some tasks, current equipment is oversized, and smaller machines might be able to successfully scout a field, for instance. But they won't be able to prepare the ground for planting carrots, where machines rip up soil 40 inches deep, Mr McClelland said. \"Farmers have a demand for productivity, and they'll take it in whatever way we can give it, and technology is the new way,\" he said.

By saving the green space around us, we can help them survive Until this year, Kaitlin Kennedy had little cause to think about the South Cameron woodlot. Located in Windsor, Ont., the woodlot consists of 0.6 square kilometres of mature trees and undergrowth where water pools in springtime and where threatened species such as Butler's garter snake and willowleaf aster can sometimes be spotted. Surrounded on all sides by suburban homes and city streets, it is a tiny remnant of the lush hardwood forests that blanketed the region centuries ago. In March, Windsor's mayor, Drew Dilkens, announced that the Ontario government had lifted a \"significant wetland\" designation from part of the woodlot, effectively freeing it up for development into high-end residential properties. In a Facebook post, Mr. Dilkens thanked Ontario Premier Doug Ford, whom he had personally lobbied for the change. Ms. Kennedy, who works for a local pharmaceutical company and has a graduate degree in biology, couldn't believe what she was reading. Why would a municipality with only 8-per-cent tree cover and an environmental plan that prioritizes the need for more green space give up one of its last remaining pockets of wild habitat - not to mention destroy a natural buffer for storm water in a region where heavy rains and flooded basements are endemic? \"A decision based on land use is not looking at the big picture,\" she said. \"It's important to protect the natural landscape.\" Many residents agreed. Ms. Kennedy launched an online petition to preserve the woodlot that quickly amassed nearly 10,000 names. James Morrison, the city councillor whose ward includes the site, has also taken up the fight. As many as 200 property owners hold a piece of the woodlot, he said. To save it all, the city will need to buy them out - a scenario that the mayor said would cost millions. At this point, the fate of the woodlot is unclear as the city proceeds to map the area and sort out who owns what. But the case illustrates a larger issue at the heart of efforts to conserve nature in Canada. On one hand, the country is huge - nearly 10 million square kilometres - including the vast boreal forest and the sweeping Arctic tundra beyond. And while studies suggest that much of this northern wilderness is inadequately protected, it remains, for now, relatively intact. The problem is that Canada's biodiversity is concentrated elsewhere. Like the human population, it is pressed against the border with the United States, where warmer temperatures and a longer growing season permit a more varied suite of plants and animals. In these areas, Canada is indistinguishable from other developed parts of the world: Most of the native habitat has been plowed under to make room for intensive agriculture or paved over by urban growth. The data back up this assessment. Of the more than 700 species of plants and animals that are listed or recommended for listing under the federal Species at Risk Act, the largest numbers are found in the most populated provinces. British Columbia, which has the most diverse range of ecosystems owing to rainfall and elevation, tops the list at 295, more than 100 of which are found within Vancouver alone. In terms of geographic distribution, threatened species map almost exactly onto the most densely settled or farmed areas of the country. \"This is where we will either win or lose the fight to conserve the majority of Canadian species - and where we as citizens have to take responsibility,\" said Jeremy Kerr, a biologist at the University of Ottawa who specializes in biodiversity loss. Vanishing habitat is the reason most species end up listed. In southern Canada, much of the habitat that once existed is now private land where the federal species law does not apply, except where it pertains to aquatic species and migratory birds. All of this puts little-known places such as the South Cameron woodlot at the fulcrum of Canada's conservation efforts. At a national level, it turns out that saving species is not something that can be accomplished only by setting aside wilderness areas in remote parts of the country that few people will ever see. For conservation to succeed, Canadians need to find ways to better integrate human spaces with the wilderness that is on the doorstep. \"If we really want to protect nature, we need to protect it all around us and in between us,\" said Lenore Fahrig, a landscape ecologist at Carleton University in Ottawa. \"And people need to understand there's potential for that everywhere.\" Canada is a signatory to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity, which includes the provision, adopted in 2010, that member countries designate at least 17 per cent of their land area for habitat and species protection by the end of 2020. In response to the looming deadline, the federal budget last year included a $1.3-billion allocation to accelerate conservation. Not surprisingly, much of the new funding has been aimed at the least developed parts of the country, including Northern and Indigenous lands where the federal government is looking to set aside enough natural space to meet the target. Places that are under consideration for protection tend to feature size and connectivity, and give species room to move and to support large populations of wildlife. The difference in the south is that the federal government cannot act directly in most areas unless it applies emergency measures to enforce habitat protection on provincial or private land - something that Ottawa has been reluctant to do. Instead, the strategy has been to encourage conservation efforts led by others. In April, Environment and Climate Change Minister Catherine McKenna announced the $100-million Natural Heritage Conservation Program, which is aimed at landowners who are seeking to donate or manage their property for its ecological benefit. The program offers one dollar for every two that is raised or donated for conservation through third-party organizations, including the Nature Conservancy of Canada and other land trusts that seek to buy up and preserve parcels of native habitat. Although the federal government has offered similar assistance in the past, in this case, the program is aimed specifically at places where species at risk are found. Collectively, the program's objective is to protect an additional 2,000 square kilometres toward Canada's 17-per-cent target. In terms of overall area, this does not amount to much. What matters more is where the money is applied, simply because there is so little habitat left where it is needed most. Dan Kraus, senior conservation biologist with the Nature Conservancy, is working on an assessment for all of southern Canada that will help identify areas of critical habitat where species conservation can be most effective. Priority places include those that can connect parcels of native habitat and reduce the chance that a species will be extirpated (eliminated from Canada) when it becomes hemmed in to just a few vulnerable locations. \"I think we're recognizing now that isolated parks and protected areas are not enough to capture the biodiversity of an entire region,\" he said. But while emphasizing connectivity may help threatened species be more resilient, Dr. Fahrig says that it should not be taken as a reason to disregard small pockets of nature that are not connected to anything. On the contrary, such places could be more important than their size and isolation suggest because they offer a final redoubt for some populations of plants and animals in a particular region. To some extent, this runs contrary to the emphasis on protecting large, undivided natural spaces. The debate is known by its acronym, SLOSS, for \"single large or several small.\" Dr. Fahrig maintains that while it's always better to conserve more habitat than less, it needn't be all in one place and there may be no lower threshold for what size of area matters. Dr. Fahrig's ideal scenario, which she admits is aspirational, would be for every property owner in Canada, from corporations to city dwellers with postagestamp-sized lots, to set aside a fraction of their land for conservation, just as Canada has committed to doing at a national scale. Because of the sheer amount of natural habitat such a scheme would bring to human-dominated landscapes, \"I think that would go a lot farther than searching for specific places that we think are bigger or most connected,\" she added. The idea is not far-fetched, said Faisal Moola, an environmental policy expert at the University of Guelph who was involved with the development of Canada's first urban national park in Toronto's Rouge River Valley. He added that cities should be leveraging their local geography to create networks of green space at the scale of individual lots and neighbourhoods that connect to larger corridors and spaces for nature on a regional scale. \"We need to create incentives for private landowners to commit more of their personal property to biodiversity-friendly forms of urban development,\" Dr. Moola said. While awareness is growing about the need to conserve habitat beyond the boundaries of national parks, it is also the case that in populated regions of Canada, small pockets of habitat are continuing to vanish without notice. Jenny McCune, a plant ecologist at the University of Lethbridge in Alberta, recalled a study conducted in 2017 in rural eastern Ontario that involved visiting woodlots that had been surveyed some 20 years earlier for rare and endangered plants. \"In a bunch of the ones that we went to, there was no forest there anymore,\" she said. The reason, she added, is simple economics. In many areas, the cost of buying prime farmland is greater than the cost of clearing a stand of trees and removing the stumps. What is missing are incentives to keep natural habitat intact. The same applies to more urban areas. The relatively high price of land in populated areas means the Nature Conservancy has to prioritize purchases it makes on a limited budget. But even in those places, the approach still requires landowners to get on board with conservation. Often, the prerequisite is an emotional attachment to a property that goes beyond its commercial value. For example, over the past six months, the Conservancy has announced donations of land in Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick and Manitoba, all of which meet the criteria of the Natural Heritage Conservation Program. All were given in memory of family members connected to those sites. In other cases, the donors have continued to participate by looking after the natural spaces they have elected to preserve. John Caraberis, a Nova Scotia businessman who has donated land in the Pugwash River estuary and persuaded others to do the same, said that for him, the calculation was a simple one. \"I think if the land is not protected today, particularly in settled areas, it's going to be developed. ... It's not going to be left alone,\" he said. But setting aside donated or purchased land for conservation still leaves another problem: what to do in places where land can't be left alone because it's involved in agricultural production? For Bryan Gilvesy, chief executive officer of ALUS Canada, the answer is to make farmers part of the solution. His not-forprofit organization (its acronym stands for Alternate Land Use Services) pays farmers to repurpose the marginal land they might otherwise cultivate and, instead, put it to work providing ecosystem services. \"The farmers are taking that acreage and managing it for an environmental purpose,\" Mr. Gilvesy said. The effort now involves some 23,000 acres across Canada, the equivalent of a small national park. In Southwestern Ontario, for example, the program has contracted farmers to allow meadows to grow on lands that are near rivers and streams. These areas absorb runoff from nearby fields and take up excess nitrogen and phosphorus from fertilizer that would otherwise end up promoting algae blooms in Lake Erie. At the same time, the meadows create natural habitat for pollinators and other species. \"The beneficial insects show up in large numbers and high diversity within the first year,\" said Andrew MacDougall, a conservation biologist at the University of Guelph who has measured the impact of the program on the landscape. In subsequent years, he said, the tall grasses develop a root network that acts as a nutrient sponge and then begins locking carbon into the soil. Alhough the total amount of working farmland that can be allocated this way is small, it can have an outsized effect by restoring habitat for a relatively low cost. It also points to a future era of \"precision farming,\" in which areas that have ideal soil composition for cost-effective food production are identified and cultivated, while neighbouring areas that are not worth the economic and environmental cost of additional fertilizer and pesticides are left in a natural state. Dr. Fahrig said her research suggests that wilderness areas need not be large to promote biodiversity as long as nature is present in many places - not unlike the smaller family farms of a previous generation, where hedgerows and other natural spaces occupied gaps between fields of crops. In a study she conducted of agricultural land in Canada and Europe, she and her collaborators found that species do better where natural spaces are interspersed with worked farmland, rather than grouped into a single clump to make room for large areas of single-crop cultivation. Whether in urban or rural Canada, strategies for preserving habitat all have something in common: a recognition that nature has a value that counterbalances the monetary value of that land when it is used for other things. It is a message that resonates with the public, but, in many cases, has not permeated the legal and political framework that determines land use in local and regional governments across the country. In some instances, the tax system works perversely against conservation, said Peter Arcese, a conservation scientist at the University of British Columbia. He said that along B.C.'s coastal lower mainland, property owners can receive a tax reduction for keeping land agricultural - for example, by grazing cattle - but the incentive would not apply if the landowner instead allowed native forest to regrow on the property. Dr. Arcese, who has studied tax-shifting schemes that benefit nature, said the system is a relic from the colonial era when land in its natural state was viewed as unproductive. What is needed, he said, is a change to the tax laws in B.C. that extends the notion of productivity to storing carbon and the other ecosystem services a landscape can provide. Provincial governments, because of their jurisdiction over natural resources, typically have more direct control than Ottawa over the fate of species and habitat in much of the country, and their record is mixed. Earlier this month, the government under Ontario Premier Ford passed an omnibus housing bill that loosens rules on species protection, and reduces the power of local conservation authorities to protect and enhance habitat if municipal governments don't co-operate. While it is too early to say how the changes will play out, Deborah Martin-Downs, a biologist who heads up the Credit Valley Conservation Authority west of Toronto, is concerned that the bill's emphasis on land use risks \"taking us back to where we were 30 or 40 years ago.\" Dr. Moola said governments at all levels need to be thinking about a three-step process that begins with saving whatever habitat is left, restoring habit that exists but has been degraded by invasive species and human impact, and then looking to increase habitat wherever possible. For too long, he said, the developed parts of Canada have been viewed as a landscape of regret that people travel away from in order to experience nature. \"It can also be a landscape of opportunity,\" he said, adding that the Convention on Biological Diversity not only calls for protecting a target amount of land but also for employing measures to conserve biodiversity in the places where it is most at risk. Back in Windsor, Kaitlin Kennedy said she feels motivated to keep the South Cameron woodlot intact both for the services it provides the city and for its value to future generations, including her own one-year-old daughter. Mayor Dilkens told The Globe and Mail he is focusing on conservation in other parts of the city. Any private owner who wishes to pursue development in the woodlot will still need to meet all provincial and [Essex Region] Conservation Authority requirements, he said. \"This won't be easy to satisfy in this area, but it's not impossible.\" Richard Wyma, who heads up the Essex Region authority, which includes Windsor, said the personal connection that residents feel toward the woodlot will ultimately determine what happens to it. He added that natural spaces that are close to home serve a purpose beyond their ecological value. By keeping nature present in peoples' lives, they make broader discussion about the environment and its benefits seem less remote and abstract. \"The No. 1 thing is to get out and explore these areas,\" Mr. Wyma said. \"It's really important that people form an attachment to these places, because if they're not using them, then that's when the problems come.\""}, {"title": "Cereals 2019: What UK growers can learn from global pioneers", "article": "The Farmers Weekly theatre at this year's Cereals event in Lincolnshire showcased three farmers and an agronomist from around the world who are pushing the boundaries of crop production. Advice on no-till from Canadian early-adopter Fact file: Blake Vince Location Merlin, Ontario, Canada Farm size/cropping 485ha with maize, soya bean, wheat and mixed-species cover crops Specialism Healthy soils through no-till and cover crops, environmental stewardship and water management Find a mentor Where farmers are looking to move from a tillage-based system to direct drilling and cover crops, finding a mentor that has successfully transitioned in similar conditions will help build confidence, according to Canadian no-till expert Blake Vince. His Nuffield Scholarship, titled \"Conserving Farm Land with Cover Crops and the Importance of Biodiversity\", helped build a peer network that includes, among others, Chilean no-till pioneer Carlos Crovetto and Paraguay-based conservation ag guru Rolf Derpsch. Choose suitable cover crop mixtures Mr Vince doesn't buy premixed cover crop seeds, instead blending his own on farm. Growers should find species that are not part of the typical crop rotation, avoiding brassicas if growing crops lsuch as oilseed rape, for example. See also: What potato growers need to consider ahead of diquat ban He also likes to include flowering species such as sunflower, phacelia, and flax in the mix to support pollinators. Also, establish what the main goals of growing a cover crop are. Eliminating compaction Fixing nitrogen Grazing for animals These are all factors that will dictate the makeup of the cover crop species mix. Pick the right drill There are four objectives for Mr Blake when buying a no-till drill: Selecting a system with the least amount of soil disturbance Avoiding drills with a high number of soil-engaging parts Dealer reliability is key - all drills wear out and break, so availability of parts and service in season are essential Ensure that you have the desired row width configuration for intended crops grown Aim for profit, not yield While the agricultural industry tends to focus on increasing yield, Mr Blake urges growers to focus on profit to ensure their own business is sustainable. His no-till establishment system and cover crops can help do so, as it has eliminated the need for expensive tillage, reduced nitrogen inputs, cut soil erosion, improved soil biology and soil carbon and increased water infiltration and water-holding capacity. Mr Vince has also bucked the trend in North America, as he grows non-GMO varieties of maize and soya bean to fetch a higher premium for his grains, increasing margins. He also notes the importance of sound, independent advice. How Aussie robotics might help UK ag Fact file: Andrew Bate Location Emerald, Queensland, Australia Farm size/cropping 4,050ha growing wheat, barley, chickpeas, sorghum, cotton and mung beans and 5,350ha pasture to support 2,000 beef cattle Specialism Practical application of robotics and automation in agriculture and horticulture Robots can help redesign crop production systems Queensland farmer and robotics entrepreneur Andrew Bate believes his machines signal the end of bigger and heavier machines and offer the chance to redesign agricultural systems to benefit crop growth. The smaller and lighter machines Mr Bate is delivering to farms help to improve timeliness, reduce soil compaction and minimise herbicide inputs in an arable setting. Attaching a mower to the robots is improving margins for turf producers, with a move from three-day mowing cycles to 24-hour mowing improving grass quality and getting the turf ready for market faster. This is reducing production costs and increasing premiums for growers. In horticulture, combining Swarmfarm robots with visual processing technology will see machines able to count and prune apple tree flowers to ensure the right number for optimum yield and quality. This will provide massive labour saving and is said to increase apple yields by more than 40% compared with manual pruning. More targeted spraying can help combat resistant weeds Australia has one of the biggest herbicide-resistant weed problems in the world and Swarmfarm Robotics is playing a role in combating the problem. With WEEDit spot spraying technology on board his sprayers, glyphosate use in fallow spraying is cut by up to 99%, reducing selection pressure. It allows the delivery of more lethal doses to minimise or even eliminate survivors. Also, by using smaller quantities, the technology increases the viability of more expensive herbicides to improve weed control. Recent developments include a retractable tine, which can drop down when a weed is detected and hoe it out. This could have potential in organic systems or in crops to weed between rows. The company is also looking at microwave technology that can zap resistant weeds. This approach has not been accepted due to slow speed of operation and potential risk to operators, but robot technology now makes it viable. Robotics could help save key pesticides Drift of phenoxy herbicide 2,4-D is a serious environmental concern in Australia and has led to restrictions on how, when and in what conditions the active ingredient can be applied. Mr Bate is working alongside agrochemical manufacturer Adama on a project that sees a weather station integrated into a Swarmfarm Robotics sprayer. This allows the machine to record conditions and exact GPS location of each weed when spot sprayed with 2,4-D, enabling the farmer to guarantee 100% compliance with the rules. It is hoped that going back to regulators with such data will demonstrate that certain products can be applied in a targeted and safe way, potentially leading to \"robot application only\" labels and products saved from further regulation or withdrawal. Could this be a way of stemming the flow of lost active ingredients in Europe Precision-farming tips from Dutch master Fact file: Jacob Van den Borne Location Ruesel, The Netherlands Farm size/cropping About 800ha arable, including potatoes, sugar beet, maize, durum wheat and barley Specialism Precision agriculture and processing potato production Understand what the definition of precision farming is Buying a steering system or section control on the sprayer is not \"going precision farming\" as Dutch potato producer Jacob Van den Borne defines it - they are solely tools to reduce overlap. Instead, it is all about doing the right thing, in the right place, at the right time. Collecting data on variables such as weather, soil, crop growth and yield has enabled his vision of precision farming to come to fruition and he uses weather stations and a range of sensors to do so. All data collected by tractor sensors or sensors mounted on farm machinery is also contextualised by operators through a cloud-based software system when leaving the field to help make sense of results. Establish yield potential of soils A vital step in making Mr Van den Borne's potato production system more efficient is gaining an understanding of how to manage variability. He has used a multi-depth electroconductivity (EC) scanner to map his soils and divide them into zones. These zones are then investigated and combined with other data, such as historic yield maps, to create yield potential maps. These can range between 50t-100t/ha of potatoes in the most productive spots. Likening the soil to a battery, knowing how much \"charge\" it has through these maps allows him to optimise inputs and maximise yield. Charge the soil's battery with targeted inputs Once the potential of the zones is known, technology can then be used to vary inputs based on that potential. Mr Van den Borne says there are two ways of approaching variable rate nitrogen applications in potatoes. The first is the \"Robin Hood\" approach of taking N from the \"rich\", high-potential spots and placing more in the \"poor\", low-potential spots. The other is what he calls the \"Olympic strategy\", where the \"best athletes\", or high-performing soils, get more investment to win the competition. For his potatoes, he has found that the Robin Hood strategy only works well for seed-bed applications at planting for boosting early growth, with the Olympic strategy more effective when top-dressing N later in the season to maximise yield. Six things UK growers can take from Kenyan ag Fact file: David Jones Location Timau, Kenya Farm size/cropping Managing 12,000ha across 10 farms growing cereals, pulses, oilseed rape and potatoes Specialism Soils and no-till systems, crop nutrition, extensive field trials and precision farming techniques After swapping Sussex and Kent for Africa, Cropnuts independent agronomist David Jones now manages more than 12,000ha around Timau - a four-hour drive north of the Kenyan capital Nairobi. At 1,800-3,000m above sea level, temperatures are moderate and yearly rainfall and the length of the season are surprisingly similar to southern England. Mr Jones outlines the learnings he would apply in the UK, if he returned home. 1. Seed on wide rows and use inter-row harrows Ryegrass is a problem weed and the best control Mr Jones has achieved since being in Kenya has been in barley crops drilled on 15in rows with starter fertiliser. This has got the crop up and above the ryegrass quickly, then allowed an RTK-guided sweep tine to be used inter-row to take out weeds. Could this help in problem grassweed situations in the UK 2. Relay crop pulses or cover crop in the inter-row It is possible to establish a pulse crop and establish a cereal crop before harvest. This is repeated but the inter-row shifted each year, allowing the following cereal to take advantage of residual nitrogen fixed by the pulse crop. It also reduces the build-up and impact of soil-borne diseases, such as take all and rhizoctonia in cereals, too. 3. Aggressive use of variable rate technology In oilseed rape and wheat, the best yields Mr Jones has achieved are where variable seed and fertiliser rates have been used to manage the crop canopy. Mr Jones says the technology is not about making seed and fertiliser savings, but pushing the crop based on yield potential of the soil. 4. Leaf tissue test more The lack of tissue testing crop plants for nutrients in his six years as a UK agronomist is an embarrassment for Mr Jones. He has been using it routinely in Kenya - up to four times per cropping cycle - and it has enabled him to target macro- and micro-nutrients exactly when and where they are needed, saving unnecessary cost in the process. Where growers are unsure of micronutrient deficiency parameters - which may be set by advisers with a commercial interest - run strip trials to work out optimum application rates. 5. Precision establishment key to high OSR yields Mr Jones has had negative experiences using high seed rates of conventional varieties to counter plant losses from pest pressure and drought. In Kenyan Canola - or spring oilseed rape - he has found that the lower the seed rate, the higher the yield. Planting as little seed as 1.2kg/ha requires a precision establishment approach, using accurate drills on wide 15in rows to reduce seedling competition between, and in, the rows. Kenyan growers are also using a moisture-seeking tine developed in Australia, which sweeps dry soil aside and places seed in a moist trench for rapid germination. The trench collects rain and is the last place to dry out, helping to combat drought. The whole approach has achieved yields in excess of 5t/ha. 6. Pay more attention to the subsoil Often, soil pits are dug far too shallow to solely focus on the top soils. However, in a dry season - much like the UK had experienced up until June - looking to the subsoil to see what might be impeding crop root access to subsoil moisture. This will help decide what remedial action might be required, such as a deep rooting cover crop.

(TSX: AJX), the Autosteering Company(TM) (\"AgJunction\"), has announced that A+ heading, along with five additional features are now available to support the Wheelman(TM) Pro and Wheelman Flex products with the latest free update to the Whirl app. A+ heading is an easy way for farmers to set a path based on a compass heading and farmers can now use Wheelman to reliably follow the same direction they previously planted for spraying. For tilling, farmers can also specify an angle to cross the field, which helps reduce ridges. \"Providing all farmers with the most up-to-date technology is a priority for us,\" said Jeff Morris, chief marketing officer of AgJunction. \"With the addition of A+ heading support, along with five other new features, farmers can further fine-tune their autosteering for peak performance.\" AgJunction is pleased to bring its unique expertise in solving complex control challenges to help Wheelman customers autosteer with greater precision and performance.

With more than 500 employees worldwide -- Farmers Edge has now deployed its solutions on about 24 million acres of farm production land across four continents -- the company is currently looking to build up a technology hub in its Winnipeg head office. Like most rapidly growing enterprises, it has been hiring virtually non-stop since it was formed in 2005. But rather than just keep filling positions, the company wants to get the word out about its corporate culture among experienced and talented high-tech professionals. \"We are developing very unique solutions; we are an innovative, rapid-growth, digital company,\" said Marina Barnes, Farmers Edge's chief marketing officer. \"We want people to know that we are a tech company... and we have agronomists at the heart of it.\" Tonight, the company is hosting a curated high-tech career summit at its head office; attendees are required to apply in advance. Some observers say other companies may follow in their footsteps by taking a similar approach. Barnes said Farmers Edge wants to spread the word that not only is it a cool tech company that provides competitive compensation and a work environment that young tech professionals have grown to expect, but it is also addressing important global challenges engaged in work that could make the planet a better place. In other words, it's offering an opportunity to work somewhere that is part of something really big. \"It's not easy to find talent,\" Barnes said. \"We need people to know there are opportunities here and the career summit is a way to let people know that even if a position is not open today, it might be there tomorrow. I strongly believe that as much as the company is looking for the right employee, employees should be looking for the right company to work for.\" Farmers Edge has built a digital platform that integrates all sorts of data about the field that generates predictive modelling, allowing farmers to produce higher yields using less inputs. It has about 130 people in its Winnipeg head office and soils lab; close to 100 in Lethbridge, Alta., where it does a lot of its development work; and another 300-plus around the world. Its U.S. headquarters is in the heart of farm country in Ames, Iowa, and the company is also growing its presence in Brazil, Australia, Russia and Ukraine. Kathy Knight, the CEO of ICTAM (Information and Communication Technology Association of Manitoba), said Farmers Edge is being savvy in the way it's approaching recruitment for its new Winnipeg tech hub. \"They want to raise their profile so that they are more attractive,\" Knight said. \"By creating that awareness, they can be more attractive to the highly qualified personnel that they are after. The way they are doing the recruitment event is really smart. They are being selective. You have to apply and be invited to attend.\" Knight believes the ongoing tight labour market and the shortage in mid-level and senior developers mean companies that are serious are going to have to show their commitment. In addition to the competitive pay packages and workplace perks, Barnes believes Farmers Edge can get its own edge in talent recruitment by promoting the positive aspects of working at the Winnipeg precision farming business. \"We want people to know that in addition to being a cool company to work for, Farmers Edge is a place for people who want to make a difference in agriculture, that our practice is sustainable, that we are working on reducing emissions and helping to feed a growing world,\" she said. martin.cash@freepress.mb.ca"}, {"title": "BGRD Braingrid arranges $5.1-million loan with European High", "article": "Braingrid Ltd (CSE:BGRD) Shares Issued 45,812,752 Last Close 6/11/2019 $0.095 Tuesday June 11 2019 - News Release Mr. Michael Kadonoff reports BRAINGRID SECURES UP TO $5.1 MILLION FINANCING Braingrid Ltd. has entered into an agreement dated June 11, 2019, to obtain funds to support its capital projects and general working capital.

The first fully autonomous farm equipment is becoming commercially available, which means machines will be able to completely take over a multitude of tasks. Tractors will drive with no farmer in the cab, and specialized equipment will be able to spray, plant, plow and weed cropland. And it's happening well before many analysts had predicted thanks to small startups in Canada and Australia. While industry leaders Deere and CNH Industrial haven't said when they'll release similar offerings, Saskatchewan's Dot Technology has already sold some power platforms for fully mechanized spring planting. In Australia, SwarmFarm Robotics is leasing weed-killing robots that can also do tasks like mow and spread. The companies say their machines are smaller and smarter than the gigantic machinery they aim to replace. Sam Bradford, a farm manager at Arcturus Downs in Australia's Queensland state, was an early adopter as part of a pilot program for SwarmFarm last year. He used four robots, each about the size of a truck, to kill weeds. In years past, Bradford had used a 120-foot wide, 16-ton spraying machine that \"looks like a massive praying mantis.\" It would blanket the field in chemicals, he said. But the robots were more precise. They distinguished the dull brown colour of the farm's paddock from green foliage, and targeted chemicals directly at the weeds. It's a task the farm does two to three times a year over 20,000 acres. With the robots, Bradford said he can save 80% of his chemical costs. \"The savings on chemicals is huge, but there's also savings for the environment from using less chemicals and you're also getting a better result in the end,\" said Bradford. Costs savings have become crucial as a multi-year rout for prices depresses farm incomes and tightens margins. The Bloomberg Grains Spot Index is down more than 50% since its peak in 2012. Meanwhile, advances in seed technology, fertilizers and other crop inputs has led to oversupply. Producers are eager to find an edge at a time when the U.S.-China trade war is disrupting the usual flow of agriculture exports. Farmers need to get to the next level of profitability and efficiency in farming, and \"we've lost sight of that with engineering that doesn't match the agronomy,\" said SwarmFarm's CEO Andrew Bate. \"Robots flip that on its head. What's driving adoption in agriculture is better farming systems and better ways to grow crops.\" In Saskatchewan, the first commercially sold autonomous tractors made by Dot are hitting fields this spring. The Dot units won't be completely on their own this year -farmers who bought equipment as part of a limited release are required to watch them at all times. But after this trial run, the producers will be able to let the equipment run on its own starting next year. That will open up a lot of time for the growers who will no longer need to sit behind the steering wheel. But farmers do more than steer when they're in the cabs of their tractors, said Alex Purdy, head of John Deere Labs and director of precision agriculture technology. Deere hasn't released fully autonomous equipment because the technology still isn't good enough to replace people, he said. \"Automation is a never-ending journey -there's always something that will get better over time, and there's so much opportunity that we're prioritizing automation over autonomy,\" Purdy said."}, {"title": "Braingrid Limited Announces Three New Sales Contracts Under Data Intelligence Program; Gaining Traction: Cultivation Analytics That Provide Valuable Yield and Predictive Pathogen Information to Growers Seeking Consistency", "article": "Toronto, Ontario--(Newsfile Corp. - May 28, 2019) - Braingrid Limited (CSE: BGRD) (\"Braingrid\" or the \"Company\"), a global provider of cultivation analytics that provides real-time environmental information for early detection giving growers the time to take action, announced sales contracts with three new clients, including Canna Farms and Up Cannabis. \"These new contracts illustrate the growing traction that our Data Intelligence Program is generating.

The first fully autonomous farm equipment is becoming commercially available, which means machines will be able to completely take over a multitude of tasks. Tractors will drive with no farmer in the cab, and specialized equipment will be able to spray, plant, plow and weed cropland. And it's happening well before many analysts had predicted thanks to small startups in Canada and Australia. While industry leaders Deere and CNH Industrial haven't said when they'll release similar offerings, Saskatchewan's Dot Technology has already sold some power platforms for fully mechanized spring planting. In Australia, SwarmFarm Robotics is leasing weedkilling robots that can also do tasks like mow and spread. The companies say their machines are smaller and smarter than the gigantic machinery they aim to replace. Sam Bradford, a farm manager at Arcturus Downs in Australia's Queensland state, was an early adopter as part of a pilot program for SwarmFarm last year. He used four robots, each about the size of a truck, to kill weeds. In years past, Bradford had used a 120-foot wide, 16-ton spraying machine that \"looks like a massive praying mantis.\" It would blanket the field in chemicals, he said. But the robots were more precise. They distinguished the dull brown colour of the farm's paddock from green foliage, and targeted chemicals directly at the weeds. It's a task the farm does two to three times a year over 20,000 acres. With the robots, Bradford said he can save 80% of his chemical costs. \"The savings on chemicals is huge, but there's also savings for the environment from using less chemicals and you're also getting a better result in the end,\" said Bradford. Costs savings have become crucial as a multi-year rout for prices depresses farm incomes and tightens margins. The Bloomberg Grains Spot Index is down more than 50% since its peak in 2012. Meanwhile, advances in seed technology, fertilizers and other crop inputs has led to oversupply. Producers are eager to find an edge at a time when the U.S.-China trade war is disrupting the usual flow of agriculture exports. Farmers need to get to the next level of profitability and efficiency in farming, and \"we've lost sight of that with engineering that doesn't match the agronomy,\" said SwarmFarm's CEO Andrew Bate. \"Robots flip that on its head. What's driving adoption in agriculture is better farming systems and better ways to grow crops.\" In Saskatchewan, the first commercially sold autonomous tractors made by Dot are hitting fields this spring. The Dot units won't be completely on their own this year - farmers who bought equipment as part of a limited release are required to watch them at all times. But after this trial run, the producers will be able to let the equipment run on its own starting next year. That will open up a lot of time for the growers who will no longer need to sit behind the steering wheel. But farmers do more than steer when they're in the cabs of their tractors, said Alex Purdy, head of John Deere Labs and director of precision agriculture technology. Deere hasn't released fully autonomous equipment because the technology still isn't good enough to replace people, he said. \"Automation is a neverending journey - there's always something that will get better over time, and there's so much opportunity that we're prioritizing automation over autonomy,\" Purdy said."}, {"title": "Braingrid Completes Shares for Debt Issuance and Convertible Debenture Financing", "article": "Toronto, Ontario--(Newsfile Corp. - May 17, 2019) - Braingrid Limited (CSE: BGRD) (\"Braingrid\" or the \"Company\"), a global provider of cultivation analytics using its affordable, scalable and easy-to-deploy sensor platforms for precision agriculture, wishes to announce the completion of two transactions.

A helicopter-mounted sensor used for mineral prospecting has been scaled down to a high-definition soil scanning system which is being launched as TerraMap to refine precision farming systems. The system is made by Canadian group SoilOptix, and has been used for up to 30 years in mineral prospecting and eight years in farming in North and South America and China. The sensor measures gamma radiation, which comes naturally from the soil and it gives measurements of a range of criteria from phosphate and potash content to minor nutrients through to organic matter. See also: High-tech soil scanner delivers margin-boosting data The agronomy group Hutchinsons has exclusive use of this technology in the UK, which could mean cheaper and more accurate soil mapping over the long term compared with current scanning methods that use electro-conductivity measurement to give nutrient data. Improved yield and lower costs From the company's trials last year, the new technique can lead to improved yields and help lower the overall cost of production, and is in use this season by a handful of farmers from Kent to the Scottish Border. \"This system offers greater accuracy than ever before and will offer benefits at least as good if not better than before,\" says Oliver Wood, the group's precision technology manager. This new method is not affected by soil moisture, compaction, or crop cover, so can be used over a wider window than before, with the only limitation being not to use the scanner in heavy rain. It could well replace current zonal scanning systems - where the accuracy can be affected by changes in soil moisture and soil compaction - and also grid sampling, which only samples chosen points. The new system is set to be offered at two prices. The premium offering takes 21 measurements and costs PS32/ha while the standard offering measures nine criteria at PS24/ha, compared with current zonal scanning at PS20-22/ha. Collecting the data involves first scanning the soil by driving a lightweight all-terrain vehicle fitted with the sensor over the field at 10-12m widths, and then taking a soil sample every 3-4ha to calibrate the readings. Data integration The data can be fed into precision farming system, such as Hutchinsons' Omnia, often leading to growers using variable drilling rate and variable phosphate and potash applications. This system has been used over the autumn and spring across 60-70ha of the 5,000ha-plus arable cropping at Thurlow Estates on the borders of Suffolk, Cambridgeshire and Essex. Here, manager Andrew Crossley has seen some questionable results in the past from chalky soils and soils that have seen big changes in structure. Using current scanning systems, chalky soils can hold on to moisture that can affect readings and soil compaction can also cause some mixed results. Jim Woodward, agronomist on the estate, says precision farming has been used on the farm over the past five to six years and a particular problem has come with scanning on chalky soils, so this new method could offer a solution. \"We now have the breath and depth of information in one place to allow us to target inputs to give a better return on investment,\" says Mr Woodward, who works for Farmacy, which is a member of the Hutchinsons group of companies. TerraMap premium service measures the following 21 criteria (The standard service includes only the first nine measurements) Phosphate Potash Magnesium pH Clay % Sand % Silt % Soil texture Elevation Calcium Manganese Sodium Boron Copper Molybdenum Iron Zinc Sulphur Organic matter Cation exchange capacity (the ability of soils to hold nutrients) Plant available water index"}, {"title": "Asterion Invited to Participate in the Cowen Toronto Cannabis Summit", "article": "Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - May 16, 2019) - Asterion Cannabis Inc.

(TSX:UR) (\"UrtheCast\" or the \"Company\"), a leading provider of information-rich products and services in the geospatial and geo-analytics markets, reported its financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2019. All financial figures are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise indicated. As a result of the planned sale of Deimos Imaging or its assets, the operations of Deimos Imaging have been classified as discontinued operations for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and the associated comparative prior period. The financial information in this press release is based on the Company's continuing operations unless otherwise noted. Q1 2019 Financial Results     \"Our near-term focus continues to be on strengthening and streamlining our current business lines while advancing towards the build and launch of the UrtheDaily Constellation, a global change detection system that will transform the way we observe our planet. Indications of market demand for our unrivalled UrtheDaily service offering remain robust and widespread,\" said Donald Osborne, CEO of UrtheCast. \"Additionally, our ongoing restructuring activities are beginning to yield positive results, most notably in the form of a significantly reduced fixed cost base, and we have enhanced UrtheCast's strategic focus, resilience, and ability to translate growth opportunities into positive cashflow. We continue to make progress towards delivering a positive run-rate EBITDA for UrtheCast by the end of 2019 and have already begun to see a positive EBITDA contribution from our recently completed acquisition of Geosys, a provider of world-class geo-analytics solutions for precision agriculture.\" Mr. Osborne continued, \"The Geosys acquisition furthers our vertical integration strategy and moves UrtheCast up the value-chain into geo-analytics, a high-margin and rapidly growing market segment. The combination of daily imagery data from UrtheDaily with the innovative analytics capabilities of Geosys is going to provide insights that will revolutionize the agriculture industry.\" Revenue in the first quarter of 2019 was $4.4 million and was comprised entirely of geo-analytics products and services revenue resulting from the acquisition of Geosys and the commencement of a 13-year services contract with Geosys' former parent company, Land O'Lakes. The Company did not recognize any engineering and value-added services revenue in the first quarter of 2019, compared to $3.3 million in the first quarter of 2018, due to progress delays incurred by its key subcontractors in completing milestones under its engineering and value-added services contract. The decrease was also due to revenue being recognized on contracts for the provision of space hardware in the first quarter of 2018 which were completed during 2018. Operating costs of $7.2 million in the first quarter of 2019 decreased by $0.4 million compared to the first quarter of 2018, due to the impact of cost reduction initiatives and a decrease in engineering subcontractor costs related to the decrease in engineering services revenues. These cost reductions were partially offset by the consolidation of Geosys operating costs from the acquisition date. Operating costs from continuing operations, exclusive of Geosys, have been reduced by more than 60% since the first quarter of 2018. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations of negative $0.8 million in the first quarter of 2019 improved by $2.8 million compared to the same quarter last year due to lower corporate and engineering services related costs and a positive EBITDA contribution from Geosys. The net loss of $6.5 million in the first quarter of 2019 improved by $4.6 million compared to the net loss from the first quarter of 2018, primarily due to higher revenue, lower operating costs, and a smaller net loss from discontinued operations. Outlook & Going Concern We refer you to the Company's consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and the related Management's Discussion & Analysis for further details relating to the Company's liquidity position. The Company has continued to take steps subsequent to March 31, 2019 to ensure that it is able to continue as a going concern and that it has adequate liquidity in the near term.

NON-IFRS EARNINGS MEASURES The following table reconciles our Non-IFRS earnings measures to Net Loss prepared in accordance with IFRS.    About UrtheCast UrtheCast Corp. is a Vancouver-based company that serves the rapidly growing and evolving geospatial and geo-analytics markets with a wide range of information-rich products and services. UrtheCast is a Big Data services company specializing in satellite imaging, data services and geo-analytics. The data the Company collects from its satellites and third parties fuel powerful cloud-based analytics platforms at the leading edge of the AI and machine learning revolution. The insights gained from the Company's imagery, cloud-based processing chain, and algorithms allows its customers to identify potential adverse events quickly, track long-term trends, monitor change, reduce intervention times, uncover opportunities, and take targeted, strategic actions to better serve their customers and fulfill their missions.  Key markets served are agriculture, forestry, environment and defense and intelligence. UrtheCast has designed and proposes to build and launch a satellite constellation designed to capture high-quality, medium-resolution optical imagery of the Earth's entire land mass (excluding Antarctica) everyday, called UrtheDailyTM, and has developed advanced synthetic aperture radar technology for satellites, called OptiSARTM. Subject to UrtheCast financing the build and launch of the UrtheDaily Constellation satellites in a timely manner, the Company currently expects the UrtheDaily Constellation to begin operations in 2021. UrtheCast has entered into multiple agreements for the sale of imagery from the UrtheDaily Constellation once UrtheCast begins delivering data to customers. In January 2019, UrtheCast also acquired Geosys, a digital agriculture company that provides a suite of geo-analytics products and services to agribusinesses around the world (see \"Business Highlights - Geosys Acquisition\"). The acquisition of Geosys positions UrtheCast as a fully vertically-integrated geo-analytics solution provider for the precision agriculture market, able to integrate satellite imagery services with analytics. The Company currently owns and operates two Earth Observation (\"EO\") satellites, Deimos-1 and Deimos-2. Imagery data from these sensors is continuously downlinked to ground stations around the world and distributed directly to partners and customers in multiple markets. UrtheCast also processes and distributes imagery data and value-added products on behalf of the PanGeo Alliance, a network of seven EO satellite operators with a combined 13 medium- and high-resolution EO sensors, led by Deimos Imaging, S.L.U., a wholly-owned subsidiary of UrtheCast. During the first quarter of 2019, the Company committed to a formal plan and commenced a bid process to sell all or substantially all of the assets of Deimos Imaging. Non-IFRS Financial Measures The Company prepares its financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\"), as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. This release includes certain non-IFRS financial measures, such as EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations. The Company uses these non-IFRS financial measures as supplemental indicators of its operating performance and financial position.

As a result of the planned sale of Deimos Imaging or its assets, the operations of Deimos Imaging have been classified as discontinued operations for the three months ended March 31, 2019, and the associated comparative prior period. The financial information in this press release is based on the company's continuing operations unless otherwise noted.  \"Our near-term focus continues to be on strengthening and streamlining our current business lines while advancing towards the build and launch of the UrtheDaily constellation, a global change detection system that will transform the way we observe our planet. Indications of market demand for our unrivalled UrtheDaily service offering remain robust and widespread,\" said Donald Osborne, chief executive officer of Urthecast. \"Additionally, our ongoing restructuring activities are beginning to yield positive results, most notably in the form of a significantly reduced fixed-cost base, and we have enhanced Urthecast's strategic focus, resilience and ability to translate growth opportunities into positive cash flow. We continue to make progress towards delivering a positive run-rate EBITDA [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization] for Urthecast by the end of 2019 and have already begun to see a positive EBITDA contribution from our recently completed acquisition of Geosys, a provider of world-class geo-analytics solutions for precision agriculture.\" Mr. Osborne continued: \"The Geosys acquisition furthers our vertical integration strategy and moves Urthecast up the value chain into geo-analytics, a high-margin and rapidly growing market segment. The combination of daily imagery data from UrtheDaily with the innovative analytics capabilities of Geosys is going to provide insights that will revolutionize the agriculture industry.\" Revenue in the first quarter of 2019 was $4.4-million and was composed entirely of geo-analytics products and services revenue resulting from the acquisition of Geosys and the commencement of a 13-year service contract with Geosys's former parent company, Land O'Lakes. The company did not recognize any engineering and value-added service revenue in the first quarter of 2019, compared with $3.3-million in the first quarter of 2018, due to progress delays incurred by its key subcontractors in completing milestones under its engineering and value-added service contract. The decrease was also due to revenue being recognized on contracts for the provision of space hardware in the first quarter of 2018, which were completed during 2018. Operating costs of $7.2-million in the first quarter of 2019 decreased by $400,000 compared with the first quarter of 2018, due to the impact of cost reduction initiatives and a decrease in engineering subcontractor costs related to the decrease in engineering service revenues. These cost reductions were partially offset by the consolidation of Geosys operating costs from the acquisition date. Operating costs from continuing operations, exclusive of Geosys, have been reduced by more than 60 per cent since the first quarter of 2018. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations of negative $800,000 in the first quarter of 2019 improved by $2.8-million compared with the same quarter last year due to lower corporate and engineering service costs and a positive EBITDA contribution from Geosys. The net loss of $6.5-million in the first quarter of 2019 improved by $4.6-million compared with the net loss from the first quarter of 2018, primarily due to higher revenue, lower operating costs and a smaller net loss from discontinued operations. Outlook and going concern The company refers you to the company's consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2019, and the related management's discussion and analysis for further details relating to the company's liquidity position. The company has continued to take steps subsequent to March 31, 2019, to ensure that it is able to continue as a going concern and that it has adequate liquidity in the near term.

Disclosure information is available on the original site. ___ Author: Derek Lynch, Professor of Agronomy and Agroecology, Dalhousie University Maintaining soil organic matter is critical to tackling climate change because soil organic matter is rich in carbon. Soil carbon is also the keystone element controlling soil health, which enables soils to be resilient as droughts and intense rainfall events increasingly occur. Given this tremendous importance of soil carbon, are economic incentives and programs helping Canadian farmers maintain and enhance soil carbon on their farms? On the Prairies, farm soil carbon levels have stabilized or increased over the past few decades, largely as a result of adoption of no-till cropping, which avoids disturbing the soil while growing a crop. In Eastern Canada, however, most estimates suggest that the intensity of crop production (especially reduced use of forage crops) is causing soil carbon levels to decline. This situation is made more challenging by the fact that in higher moisture regions such as Eastern Canada and British Columbia no-till cropping does not enhance soil carbon. This contrasting soil carbon performance of Eastern and Western Canadian farms could even be a politically sensitive issue. My research examines how different farming systems and cropping practices influence soil carbon and soil health. But it is increasingly evident that economic incentives are as important as technical approaches in developing solutions to this issue. Which policy tools, taxes or credits are needed to assist farmers, including those in Eastern Canada, prevent further soil carbon losses and move to a more positive soil carbon status? Carbon credit markets Some voluntary carbon credit markets such as Nori and Puro are primarily interested in supporting a reduction of current atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. They provide a marketplace for carbon removal certificates, whether the CO2 reduction is achieved by industrial methods or biological methods such as agriculture. The funds raised support carbon farming initiatives globally. Farmers are paid where net gains in soil carbon can be verified. These voluntary (that is, not driven by government regulation) carbon credit markets do not, however, support farms making headway in reducing their soil carbon losses. Such a limited approach to carbon credits, if widely adopted by voluntary markets, would be unfortunate. Avoiding continued loss of soil carbon, which is often eventually accompanied by the irreversible loss of the soil itself, is critical to global efforts to tackle global climate change. Carbon taxes On April 1, 2019, the Canadian government launched a national carbon tax on CO2 pollution from fossil fuel use, commencing at $20 per ton of CO2. This tax will be applied in provinces that don't have some other economic or pricing mechanism to reduce fossil-fuel CO2 emissions. The impact of this carbon tax on consumers is much debated, but the impact on farmers has been much less discussed. Some have argued that the additional costs of farm inputs from a carbon tax will be difficult to recover by farmers. Indeed, one of the few such studies found the carbon tax in B.C., in place since 2008, negatively affected farm economic performance. Reduced farm profitability would limit farmers' options in adopting new soil management practices, or less intensive cropping, to maintain and enhance soil carbon levels. A recent report by the Senate's Standing Committee on Agriculture and Forestry assessed the impact of climate change and a carbon tax on agriculture. The study recommended farm fuel costs be exempt from the carbon tax. The report also highlighted the critical need for new mechanisms (offset protocols) to determine soil carbon credits for Canadian farmers in different agricultural sectors, and the need to characterize in detail current farm soil carbon levels in Canada. Cap and trade markets Cap-and-trade markets to reduce CO2 emissions, such as those in Quebec and California, have generated substantial green funds for climate change programs. In both jurisdictions, green fund dollars support on-farm projects for farmers to test out different farm practices that show promise for improving soil carbon levels. Details on these programs were outlined and discussed at the excellent recent symposium organized by Regeneration Canada. Regeneration Canada's mission is to support farmers adopting climate-smart farming and to bridge the gap in consumer awareness of these issues and farm challenges. Reducing emissions Declining soil carbon levels and associated losses in soil quality and soil productivity are a critical issue globally. Farmers, including those in Eastern Canada, are challenged in understanding the complex relationship between their farm management practices and their soil carbon levels. They also need support to test out and adopt changes in cropping practices to reverse often declining soil carbon levels. A combination of innovative economic programs, incentives and credits, supported by all stakeholders including consumers, are needed to support farmers in this key challenge of a generation. ___ This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.
