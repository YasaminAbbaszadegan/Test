[{"title": "Drone industry welcomes new safety rules; Certification as pilot now requirement", "article": "Canada's burgeoning drone industry welcomed the government's new drone safety regulations, which include stiff penalties for reckless aircraft operation and stricter rules for recreational pilots while maintaining flexibility for commercial uses like precision agriculture or forestry surveying. Transport Canada on Wednesday unveiled the new regulations for remotely piloted aircraft systems, also known as unmanned aerial vehicles and commonly referred to as drones, after a year-and-a-half of consultations. Both government and industry recognized the need for new rules given the increasing popularity of drones. Reckless and negligent drone operators can pose major hazards to commercial airlines, such as the drone sightings that forced the U.K.'s Gatwick Airport to suspend flights for days, resulting in Christmas travel madness. Closer to home, there have been dozens of drone sightings near airports, with one close call in Ottawa in 2016 that resulted in two fighter jets being sent to track down the rogue unmanned aircraft. The new system will require both recreational and commercial drone operators to pass an online exam to get a pilot certificate (for a $10 fee) and register their drones (this will cost $5). It will cost $28.4 million to implement over the next decade, according to amendments published in the Canada Gazette. Maximum penalties for breaking the rules will be $5,000 for individuals and $25,000 for corporations. The regulations, which apply to any drone weighing between 250 grams and 25 kilograms that's operated within a pilot's visual line of sight, end a somewhat lax environment for recreational users. Previously, leisure pilots didn't need permission fly drones less than 35 kg even though all commercial operators, from special event photographers to mining site surveyors, needed to obtain special flight operations certificates on a case-by-case basis. The new rules don't discriminate between business or leisure users, instead classifying operators as basic or advanced depending on how close they fly to people, and airspace rules. They set a minimum age of 14 for basic operations and 16 for advanced operations. (Younger children may fly \"micro drones\" less than 250g or if supervised by a certified drone pilot.) \"This is a positive step forward for everybody,\" said Mark Aruja, chairman of Unmanned Systems Canada, which represents more than 400 players in an industry that he said has doubled in size every two years since 2008. \"There's a good balance between making sure there are clear rules that promote safety, but they're structured in a way that we can innovate.\" Since fewer special flight permits will be required, the rules are expected to reduce bureaucracy and eliminate regulatory uncertainty for companies that are experimenting with new uses for drones, Aruja said. He agrees with the need for certification, since without proper education people can unknowingly infringe on airspace such as hospital emergency helicopter pads. \"Whenever you're putting something into the airspace, you have certain risks,\" he said. \"With the right to fly, you also have the responsibility to be knowledgeable in what you're doing.\" Companies will still need to get permission on a caseby-case basis for drones weighing more than 25 kg that operate beyond a pilot's visual line of sight. This is where the real commercial opportunities lie, Aruja said, adding that 70 per cent of drone companies see it as critical to business development. Transport Canada inspectors will enforce the rules on a complaint-driven basis, a spokesperson said in an email. Previously, Transport Canada has partnered with the RCMP to issue fines, and is looking to partner with other law enforcement agencies across Canada. The new rules come into effect Jun. 1."}, {"title": "Braingrid Launches Innovative Sensor Technology for Precision Cannabis Cultivation", "article": "TORONTO, Jan. 8, 2019 /CNW/ - Braingrid Limited (\" Braingrid \") ( CSE:BGRD ), a global provider of affordable, scalable and easy-to-deploy sensor platforms for precision agriculture is pleased to announce the launch of its new self-powered \"Sentroller S\". Sentroller S brings all the great features of Braingrid's original Sentroller platform to cultivators including a quick installation, online dashboards and reports, as well as email alarm notifications. This allows growers the peace of mind that their cannabis crops are safe and thriving. The Sentroller S is powered by a solar panel that enables an even quicker install and limitless possibilities for sensor placement. This true wireless freedom helps cultivators monitor growing conditions where it matters - in and around the plant canopy where power connections are not often available. Any form of grow lighting including LED is sufficient to power the ultra-low energy Sentroller S. The new self-powered Sentroller S differentiates Braingrid from the competition by monitoring mission critical cultivation parameters (i.e. temperature, relative humidity, CO2, PAR, EC, moisture) in the plant canopy, without power cords or the need to change batteries. Michael Kadonoff, Founder and CEO of Braingrid, stated \"The Sentroller S launch marks yet another important milestone for Braingrid that aligns with our strategic plan and continues our momentum that has been building since the launch of our original Sentroller as we strive to provide the best precision technology solution to the cannabis cultivation industry\".

Deere, Tide maker head to CES gadget show", "article": "LAS VEGAS - The companies founded by blacksmith John Deere and candle-and-soap-making duo Procter & Gamble may not be the hip purveyors of new technology they were in 1837. But they're first-time exhibitors at this year's CES gadget show, along with other unlikely newcomers such as missile-maker Raytheon, outdoorsy retailer The North Face and the 115-year-old motorcycling icon Harley-Davidson. The four-day consumer-electronics show opens Tuesday with some 4,500 companies exhibiting products and services and more than 180,000 people expected to attend. It's the place startups and established tech giants alike go to unveil everything from utilitarian apps to splashy devices. So what are these legacy companies doing here? \"Every company today is a technology company,\" said Gary Shapiro, CEO of the Consumer Technology Association, which organizes CES. Shapiro said many companies already send executives to Las Vegas each January to gauge trends, so it's not surprising that they eventually unveil their own new technology as well. It's also part of a more fundamental economic shift as consumers increasingly expect to buy not just goods and services, but a personal experience, which often skews digital, said Dipanjan Chatterjee, a brand analyst at Forrester Research. \"We're still doing old-fashioned things: Ordering clothes, buying detergent, getting a cup of coffee, but there are new-fangled ways of doing it,\" he said. \"Brands have no choice but to play a role in this new technology space.\" That's one reason Harley-Davidson is using the show to announce the commercial launch of its first electric motorcycle LiveWire. The motorcycle will have a cellular connection, as many cars do these days, so people can keep track of their motorcycle's charge or check where they parked it through an app. Consumer goods giant P&G, best known for Pampers diapers and Tide detergent, is showcasing heated razors, a toothbrush with artificial intelligence and a wand-like device that scans the skin and releases serum to cover up age spots and other discoloration. P&G is also showing off an internet-connected scalp adviser: The Head & Shoulders-branded device uses ultraviolet light and other techniques to uncover scalp issues and recommend products. The device is available only in Europe and Asia for now. Expect these gizmos to cost more than the plain-old \"dumb\" versions. P&G's Oral-B toothbrush, for example, is expected to cost $279, while a regular Oral-B electric toothbrush can be had for less than $30. And every new connected device means more data collection about people's personal habits - a gold mine for advertisers and hackers alike. The North Face is using virtual reality to provide a fine-grained look at its waterproof fabrics. Raytheon is demonstrating the everyday applications of GPS anti-jam technology, which was originally designed to protect military forces. And John Deere has hauled in self-driving tractors and a 20-ton combine harvester aided by artificial intelligence. The combine has cameras with computer-vision technology to track the quality of grain coming into the machine so that its kernel-separating settings can be adjusted automatically. Farmers can monitor it remotely using a smartphone app. It's hard to imagine what 19th century Illinois blacksmith John Deere might think if he were plopped into his company's 2019 booth at the flashy Vegas convention centre, but Deanna Kovar believes he'd be \"amazed and astonished.\" \"His innovation was making a self-powering steel plow that could cut through the heavy, rich soils of the Midwest,\" said Kovar, the company's director of production and precision agriculture marketing. \"We've been a technology company since the start.\" Kovar said American farmers have been using self-driving tractors for decades - and CES is a chance to let everyone else know. Chatterjee said such messages are directed not just at a company's customers, but to investors, potential corporate partners, startup acquisition targets and the technically skilled employees these more traditional firms are hoping to attract. \"These are brands that are aggressively looking to work tech into their DNA,\" Chatterjee said. \"They want to be perceived all around as a tech-forward innovative brand.\" -- AP video journalist James Brooks contributed to this report."}, {"title": "Atlantic Precision Agriculture Services Inc. is now part of Vantage Canada", "article": "STRATHMORE, AB, Jan. 8, 2019 /CNW/ - Vantage Canada is pleased to announce Atlantic Precision Agriculture Services Inc.

But Airdrie's Ryan Straschnitzki was immediately making plans to rebuild it. The 19-year-old has gone over the story countless times - how he was sitting on a bus with his Humboldt Broncos teammates while texting his girlfriend, and the next thing he knew he heard a scream. How he flew out the window and hit the road, unable to move. But hours after he awoke in a Saskatchewan hospital from a seven-hour surgery on his back and was told he would never walk again, Straschnitzki was already making plans to get back on the ice. \"He just looked at me and his mother and he goes, 'Well, I'm gonna get onto the Olympic sledge hockey team,'\" his father, Tom, recalled two days after the crash, which left 16 dead and Ryan paralyzed from the chest down. \"He's an amazing kid.\" True to his word, Straschnitzki took his first strides in a sled just over three months after the April crash and continues to practise weekly. Inspired by the support of the community, he attends rehab sessions multiple times a week and remains determined to overcome the life-altering tragedy. His story has captured the hearts of people across the Calgary area - and Canada and beyond - who have learned what it means to be \"Straz Strong,\" the slogan that appears on hats sold to help raise funds for his recovery. But Straschnitzki said his own heart remains with the teammates, coaches and Broncos staff and volunteers that were lost last year. \"I do it for them because they can't be here doing it for themselves,\" he said. \"I was always told during a game when you're down or you're losing, when things aren't going your way, your true colours start to show. I think this is a good example of it.\" Lesley Brown From her time growing up in Glasgow, Scotland, Lesley Brown knew her future would be steeped in education. \"My father went back to school as a mature student when my brother and I were young, and he was the first person in our family to have a university degree,\" said Brown, the provost and vice-president, academic, at Mount Royal University. \"So my brother and I knew from a very early age that we would both be attending university because of the value my parents placed on it.\" Brown's family moved to Ontario when she was a child. With a PhD in kinesiology among her degrees, she got her first job at the University of Lethbridge, where she worked on both the research and academic fronts. She was hired at MRU in July of 2017. \"My job is to make sure Mount Royal University is the first-choice institution for students looking to come and experience post-secondary education,\" she said. \"I need to make sure the programs we're offering are high-quality and are relevant for student needs and relevant for market demand. \"The best part of my job is watching about 2,000 students walk across the stage every year, knowing they're going to go out and make a difference, not only in Calgary but throughout the country and the world.\" Mount Royal, after more than 100 years as a college, became a university in 2009, and it continues to grow. \"We're beginning to see a maturation of our institution; we see students coming here for our degrees,\" said Brown. \"We're also overcoming that legacy as a transfer institution. Students are actually staying here.\" Her job in 2019 is to expand on that growth. \"I'm incredibly proud to have built a leadership team that is transforming undergraduate education,\" she added. \"Our students today are very much engaged in wanting to make the world a better place and we have a number of experiences that support students in those aspirations.\" Travis and Stephanie Hamonic Travis and Stephanie Hamonic come by their generosity naturally. \"I think the way we both grew up, pretty humble beginnings, our faith was very important,\" said Travis, a Calgary Flames defenceman. \"It's been the biggest part of our marriage, our life together, our faith. A big chunk of that is knowing that you have to help and try to give back. ... Those things will mean more to me when I'm retired than some of the stats I put up on the ice.\" The Hamonics, since joining the Flames in 2017, have made charitable endeavours a focal point of their stay in this city with the Northern Project (providing opportunities for Indigenous children), the D-Partner program (for youngsters who have lost parents) and, most recently, Charlie's Children, named after their sevenmonth-old daughter. \"We'd never been exposed to it, obviously, first time having a kid,\" said Hamonic, who is of Metis heritage. \"The first couple of times we went out shopping, we realized how expensive everything was. \"With our background, our faith, we looked at each other and said, 'We have to help.'Teaming up with the Flames Foundation and the Women in Need Society Calgary, help some families and single moms who are in need of financial aid.\" Providing for others isn't just lip service for the Hamonics. \"I really truthfully believe that it doesn't matter what you do - a teacher, a lawyer, pumping gas - I think it's important to try to spread some goodness,\" said the 28-yearold. \"I'm not naive; I know I'm in a different situation than a lot of people. I'm grateful that I can use that a little bit, especially in Calgary where hockey is so prominent. \"I'm grateful to God that I have that stage to try and invoke some good, and try to use my voice a bit louder because of what I do for a living.\" Vivek Shraya When Vivek Shraya finished teaching her final creative writing class of the year, her University of Calgary students broke into applause. \"I was really nervous moving back to Alberta because of my experience with homophobia growing up in Edmonton,\" says the first-year assistant professor. \"But, truthfully, I feel like I have won the lottery. Teaching in Alberta has been healing for me.\" The transgender author, musician and filmmaker had a stellar 2018. Besides teaching (focusing on science fiction by Indigenous and black writers and writers of colour), she released her memoir, I'm Afraid of Men, to acclaim, including a profile in Vanity Fair magazine lauding the author's transformation of her fears into \"cultural rocket fuel.\" Growing up \"brown and queer,\" Shraya first wrote music as a boy to cope with loneliness. I'm Afraid of Men started as a song on her 2017 album, Part-Time Woman, (long-listed for the Polaris Prize), with Queer Songbook Orchestra. In May, her comic book Death Threat (\"the rules of literary fiction don't apply, so it can be wacky\") will be published, after receiving constant emails from someone telling her: \"I want you to die.\" Shraya will tour that book this summer with Tea Mutonji, whose short story collection, Shut Up You're Pretty, will be the first imprint under VS Books (Shraya and Arsenal Pulp Press) supporting Indigenous/writers of colour. And the healing power of teaching will continue for Shraya. \"You have as many as 70 students listening to what you say. My job is to find ways to bring out each student's power - as a writer, as a thinker.\" In the midst of everything else, Shraya hopes \"me\" time will include catching up on soap opera Young and the Restless. \"In a world that is changing constantly, you go into this other world that's consistent ... they're reliable, they're friends. That's comforting to me.\" Matt Embry Matt Embry does not shy away from uncomfortable topics. In fact, he embraces them. \"It really is wonderful to get feedback,\" the 42-year-old Calgary filmmaker and producer said. \"With a documentary, it can take up to three years sometimes, from the time you start to the time it reaches audience, and that's just a labour of love. We're so lucky we get response literally from all over the planet. Some of them are so inspiring and encouraging and you see that the work that we're doing is changing lives.\" One of those efforts is Living Proof, a 2017 documentary devoted to multiple sclerosis and his own struggles with the disease. He followed that this year with a film dealing with the opioid crisis. \"I think as a filmmaker it's an evolution in regards to the stories,\" said Embry, one of the founders of Spotlight Productions. \"I was really fortunate early in my career to work on documentaries with some stars like Ian Tyson and Jann Arden, Theo Fleury, and, as my career grew, I transitioned into topics that would have a social impact. ... \"Trying to create content that is going to add good to the world is really important to me. Recognize a problem, shine a light on an issue but then offer solutions and how we're going to make this better in a better world to live in.\" Embry earned an undergraduate degree from the University of Calgary and got his master's in film production at Concordia. He's currently working on a project on cyberbullying and another on concussions. \"When the work that you're doing is going to have an effect, that's really motivating on a day-to-day basis,\" he said. \"Some of the issues we tackle, there's an urgency in it. People need help, people need hope, and we want to get it to them as fast as we can.\" Tommy Wheeldon Jr. One word that Tommy Wheeldon Jr. keeps bringing up is \"opportunity.\" Whether it's the one he received to help grow the sport of soccer in this city, or what he hopes to give aspiring pros, it's all about that chance. Wheeldon, originally from Liverpool, England, first came to Calgary in 2002 to play for the Calgary Storm, a club coached by his father. After his playing days, he stayed in the city he fell in love with, aiming to see soccer reach another level. \"When I fly in and see the skyline and the mountains in the backdrop, it feels like home. Home isn't just where you're born; it's where your heart is,\" said Wheeldon, the head coach and general manager of Cavalry FC of the fledgling Canadian Premier League. \"I wanted to help grow a sport that you could see people playing. There was so much untapped potential.\" As the driving force behind the Calgary Foothills program, Wheeldon coached that team to a Professional Development League championship last season. \"When I joined Calgary Foothills in 2007, we developed a pyramid,\" he said. \"We wanted real good grassroots programs, so we started with that, the young kids. Then when they got more serious, 10, 11, we developed another program, more skills-based. After that, you wanted better coaches and opportunities to go over to England or down to the U.S. to play in tournaments. From there, as they started to progress, if they hadn't gone abroad, it was creating avenues to get into universities.\" Wheeldon, 39, was then hired by the Spruce Meadows Sports and Entertainment group to run the Cavalry, who begin play in April. \"There's an opportunity to grow a league, Canada's own domestic professional league, and do it for future Canadians, current Canadians, and create some type of legacy,\" said the father of three. \"It's a great challenge and I couldn't have asked for a better job.\" Julian Black Antelope When it comes to the television and movie industry, Julian Black Antelope has all the bases covered. Acting, producing, writing, stunt work - Black Antelope fits the bill. \"In Alberta you have to be versatile if you want to work in the business, and this is what I've learned since I started in 2004,\" he said. \"I've always managed to carve out making a living and I love all aspects of it.\" Originally from the Fort Macleod area, he now lives in Calgary with his wife and three daughters. His resume includes numerous diverse projects, most recently Netflix's locally shot Hold the Dark. Amazingly, he's self-taught. \"I've only had a handful of weekend acting workshops,\" he said, noting he has been mentored by Shaun Johnston, who plays Grandpa Jack on Heartland. \"I absorbed everything he taught me. I still use it and apply it today. Lots of trial and error, that's for sure.\" Black Antelope has a varied ethnic background - First Nations, Central American, Irish - and is proud to portray them on screen. \"My eyes were opened up wide when I first worked overseas,\" he said. \"Their demographics are open books, they can't put people in as stereotypes; it's just the right person for the job. I think here in North America, we need to break out of that old pigeonhole stereotype thing and open the door to that view.\" Stunt work still appeals to him ... to a point. \"I'm pushing 50 now so I don't really look forward to it as much,\" he said. \"You dial in ... to do it in one take, because you sure as hell don't want to do it over and over again.\" He's currently working on a television series for APTN called Secret History of the Wild West, which focuses on some of Western Canada's biggest icons. \"I have my door open,\" he said, \"to whatever may come.\" Hayley Wickenheiser There don't seem to be enough hours in a day for Hayley Wickenheiser. Yet, in true high-performance fashion, she manages it all. Wickenheiser, one of the greatest women's hockey players ever, has put her playing days behind her but remains entrenched in the sport. In November at Canada Olympic Park, the ninth-annual Wickenheiser World Female Hockey Festival - known as WickFest - gave girls the opportunity to not only play but also take part in quality presentations. \"I'm really proud of it,\" said Wickenheiser, winner of four Olympic gold medals. \"We had 110 teams this year in Calgary and we'll have another 15 in Surrey (B.C.) in January. We're talking about expanding it across North America. \"It's not a money-maker for anyone - we inject about $4 million a year into the Calgary economy - but it's great for young girls. They get access to Olympic athletes, to NHL players, the Stanley Cup was here, the prime minister was here, the best of the best in terms of nutrition and education seminars. I think it's becoming the go-to tournament.\" In August, Wickenheiser was hired by the Toronto Maple Leafs as assistant director of player development. The flexibility of the job is perfect for her schedule. \"I can be working in Calgary with a Hitmen prospect drafted by the Leafs, to on the ice with the Marlies, on the ice with Leafs players rehabbing,\" she said. \"It really spans a lot of areas. ... It was a position I couldn't say no to.\" And she's currently attending medical school, which she will finish in a little over two years. \"I'm used to being really busy,\" said Wickenheiser, mother to Noah, 18. \"I think as an athlete, one thing you understand early is time management. There will always be adventures and new projects and fun things to create and do. \"That's the way I like it.\" Kelly Fedorowich Early on, Kelly Fedorowich had a goal. When she first hopped into a top fuel dragster, she aimed to become the fastest woman in Canada. Man or woman, you can't get much faster. \"I accelerate from zero to 300 miles per hour in under four seconds,\" Fedorowich said. \"I'm the first Canadian woman to ever climb into one of those monsters and pilot them. It's breaking through the glass ceiling every time.\" Fedorowich, husband David and son Nicholas are the force behind Dark Side Racing. They came to Calgary from Winnipeg in 1994. Fedorowich and her husband have been together more than 30 years. \"He was well-enmeshed in his racing career when we met (on her 20th birthday). He introduced me to an entirely new world,\" she said. \"I fell head over heels in love with David and I fell head over heels in love with the sport of drag racing.\" Eventually, well-versed in building and maintaining the vehicles, Fedorowich wanted to get into the driver's seat. \"At the end of the 2017 season, I started training and it is a process,\" she said. \"Wanting to drive the car was something I've always aspired to. We were on the road a lot, so the opportunities never presented themselves,\" she said. \"The goal of becoming the fastest woman in Canada has been something I've longed to do since the '90s, and finally my opportunity is here.\" In addition to racing, Fedorowich - whose husband is a prostate cancer survivor - was named executive director of Prostaid Calgary in 2015. Being in a maledominated sport gives her a captive audience. \"We reached out and simply said, 'we have a top fuel dragster, we have space for a decal if you're interested,'\" she said. \"We've reached thousands and thousands of guys out there. I get to wag my finger and remind them to know their PSA. That race car has such an attraction value.\" Carlos Foggin If you can't get to the music, the music will come to you. That was Carlos Foggin's objective when he created the Rocky Mountain Symphony Orchestra in 2016. \"I grew up in small-town Alberta, there was a post office,\" joked Foggin, 37, who hails from tiny Del Bonita. \"My mom drove me into Lethbridge every Monday, which is an hour and 15 minutes each way, for piano lessons, and I didn't know that Lethbridge had an orchestra. I didn't hear an orchestra play until I was 25.\" In its third season, Foggin's growing group now has a home base in Balzac. A mid-winter gala will be held there Jan. 19. Foggin - a fellow of the Royal Canadian College of Organists, one of just over 100 named since 1909 - got his music degree at the University of Calgary. His desire to share his passion with rural Albertans prompted the formation of the orchestra. \"(The orchestra) was six people the first year, 10 the second ... we put 55 on the Jack Singer stage a few weeks ago,\" he said. \"The whole mandate of the orchestra is go out to the country, the smaller towns, so there won't be another me who won't hear an orchestra until they're 25.\" And he's continuing to work to take his music to the masses. \"What we sought to do was look at it from someone in a small town's perspective,\" he said. \"What would average mom and dad see as objections to taking kids to the orchestra? Cost is a huge one. Then there's the unknown; it's seen as elitist. If we could eliminate most of those and make it a 10-minute drive from your house, then why not? \"We're also looking to establish a permanent core of players, start taking orchestral music into schools so kids get more exposure. We'll do whatever it takes, with the mindset that orchestral music isn't dying. \"If we make it a little less stuffy and a little more accessible, people will enjoy that.\" Stephen Hair Stephen Hair's first professional acting role paid him $100 a week, singing and dancing in a summer variety show - five shows a day, six days a week - at Calgary's Heritage Park. But even as a four-year-old, \"my mother said I would follow behind people in our small English village, copying the way they walked,\" says Hair, who for 25 years has played iconic Ebenezer Scrooge in Theatre Calgary's A Christmas Carol. His family moved to Montreal, and in junior high the \"very shy\" teen did his first audition - winning the school play's lead role. \"Acting was a way of covering up the 'real me.'Actors are really professional liars, pretending to be people we are not.\" In 1973, Hair came to Calgary to audition for Alberta Theatre Projects'company of actors - and the now 68-year-old has never really left. His 40-plus-year career spans hundreds of roles, including film and television, but theatre is his passion. \"I like the rehearsals, the collaboration, performing in front of real people. There's no stopping for another take; you forge ahead and tell your story.\" Some of Hair's favourite roles have been Noel Coward musicals and playing Charlie Brown's Snoopy - twice. \"There's just something fun about being that dog,\" says the self-described cat person. Besides acting, Hair is particularly proud of the $20 million raised for the food bank by Toonies for Turkeys through two decades of A Christmas Carol. He also mentors young artists - \"I tell them what I have learned; that the life is a difficult one, and they have to market themselves.\" His mentorship comes full circle in 2019 - A Christmas Carol (Hair returns as Scrooge) will have a totally new adaptation by 2010 Stephen Hair Emerging Actor Awardwinner Geoffrey Simon Brown. Last season, Hair tackled three huge roles - including King Lear. What's next (besides Scrooge) is still to be decided. \"I don't have to audition any more; people just ask. And you can say 'no.'\" Debra Tomlinson In 2015, the Association of Alberta Sexual Assault Services launched a campaign called I Believe You. Within a year, sexual assault centres experienced a 53-per-cent increase in new counselling intakes. \"That's a 53 per cent increase of people who were picking up the phone and actually saying, 'this happened to me and I recognize that I need some help,'\" said CEO Debra Tomlinson. The shift didn't stop there. In October 2017, another movement began to take shape with the global spread of the hashtag #MeToo. In Alberta, Tomlinson and her colleagues watched the #IBelieveYou hashtag increase to about 40 million mentions online, as people around the world spoke out in support of sexual-assault survivors. After 25 years working in the field, Tomlinson has witnessed the kind of cultural shift take place over the past four years that she never thought she'd see. \"I'm so grateful to have been able to see this change,\" she said. Tomlinson started out as a social worker in the field of services for people with disabilities. In that role, she had an opportunity to do a national training institute for independent living centres on how to respond to abuse of people with disabilities. It's what led her to devote her career to supporting survivors of sexual assault and abuse. She is now in her second stint as head of the association, which oversees 14 sexual-assault centres that provide supports and resources to survivors. After having witnessed that \"enormous shift\" in culture in recent years, Tomlinson is hopeful for the future. \"A lot of people have said, 'how can you do this work, you see such pain and such trauma,'\" she said. \"But, you know, what I also see is resilience. Human beings are amazingly resilient. \"I think the more survivors are given an opportunity to speak their truth, to tell their story, the more it can help to make our world a better place.\" Michelle Thrush Michelle Thrush expects to hit the road this year, taking her one-woman show, Inner Elder (winner of the 2018 Betty Mitchell drama award for best actress) across Canada. But for the Cree actress and activist, who has appeared in more than 40 roles in TV, movies and on stage over three decades, that will be just one of 2019's highlights. The mother of two teenage daughters is working with her eldest, Imajyn Cardinal, (already an actress) writing and producing short films. \"My heart is watching how Indigenous youth is so empowered, rising up and taking over - in filmmaking, in theatre, in fashion design, in all areas of the arts.\" It's empowerment Thrush has fought for all her life, growing up in Calgary with alcoholic parents, being bullied and called \"squaw\" in school. Through Inner Elder, Thrush shares those memories. One Yellow Rabbit Theatre's synopsis describes it as: \"a young brown girl navigating a world of alcoholic adults, aliens, and the spiritual presence of her guiding grandmothers.\" Thrush found her voice in acting, starring in well-known TV series North of 60 and Blackstone (she won a Gemini award). In 2013, she co-produced and acted in Making Treaty 7, where both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal performers chronicled Alberta's history from a First Nations' perspective. She uses art and humour to tackle recovery, particularly the destructive legacy of residential schools. For a decade, as Majica, a therapeutic healing clown, she's performed for kids and teenagers in Aboriginal communities and shelters. Much of her life has been spent on the red carpet, but her own healing includes two years living off the grid in the bush with her children. \"I loved being on the land, I had lots of time to write. My ultimate dream is to go back.\" That won't be for a while. The 51-year-old Thrush hopes Inner Elder will expand internationally to Scotland, Australia and New Zealand. This February, she'll co-host Indspire Awards (celebrating Indigenous achievement) in Calgary. Hyder Hassan As head of wealth management at First Calgary Financial, with its portfolio value of $500 million, Hyder Hassan understands money. It's an understanding begun early, at age 15, when he and his mother got jobs with a burger chain to support the recent immigrants to Canada. \"I was a fry boy and my mom was in front.\" With his dad remaining in Pakistan to fulfil engineering contracts, Hassan worked, went to school, and ensured his younger siblings were fed and schooled. \"It was training me to be good at budgeting,\" says Hassan, Calgary's Immigrant of Distinction (under 35) in 2018. His father eventually joined the family in Ontario and Hassan entered university for a kinesiology degree, ready for some \"me time.\" But, unable to find engineering work, his father left. Hassan quit school to, again, support the family. He worked nights for a photocopying company and days as a bank collections officer. \"I understood people in those tough situations and tried to offer them advice and win-win situations. I got thank-you letters afterward.\" With his father's return, Hassan joined banking full time and completed his arts degree (management studies) two or three courses at a time. In 2017, the University of Waterloo gave him a young alumni award, noting Hassan attained six financial sector designations - while volunteering extensively. Hassan worked for a number of Canadian banks - each time achieving promotion and each time recommended by someone met along the way. In 2013, Hassan and wife Christina (accepted at University of Calgary's law school) moved west. While he organized life here, Christina was in Uganda as part of her master's in public health studies. The suffering of mothers and children there led the Hassans, in 2013, to establish FullSoul (a recipient of humanitarian awards) outfitting African hospitals with more than 65,000 medical kits for safe delivery of babies. In 2019, Hassan intends to \"scale up\" FullSoul's effect, while doubling mentoring efforts to ensure kids learn financial planning. Darren MacLean At the age of 13, Darren MacLean lied about his age to get a job in a Calgary diner to help out his single-parent mom. \"I didn't like cooking but it was a necessity,\" says the 35-year-old chef, whose Japanese gastropub Shokunin has been one of Canada's top 50 restaurants two years in a row. Last year, Maclean was one of 24 international stars - the only Canadian - competing on Netflix's The Final Table, fixing dishes from nine different countries (spoiler alert: he didn't win but many on social media say he should have). As a teenager, MacLean didn't have a career path: \"I just wanted to take care of my mom and buy her a home.\" While studying finance in university, he worked restaurant jobs and at a holding company that bought and relaunched failed businesses. \"Along the way, I realized the only thing I loved was cooking.\" He enrolled at Stratford Chefs School \"figuring I would never come back to Calgary.\" Just before heading to New York as a chef, the holding company called. They had a restaurant. \"Did I want it?\" He opened Downtownfood showcasing local produce (a rooftop garden had beehives, herbs, fruits and vegetables). Downtownfood (a top 100 Canadian restaurant) closed in 2014 when the landlord doubled its rent. MacLean spent months in Japan studying cuisine before opening Shokunin - to mixed reviews. He closed for five days and reinvented his menu. \"I was trying to be too Japanese instead of making it my own.\" The tenacity inherited from his mom has guided him through industry ups and downs and two months of Netflix filming, which included earning a spot in the finale fixing Japanese dishes. Beating Michelin Star chefs, meeting his \"Wayne Gretzky\" - Irish chef and judge Clare Smyth who loved his food - all provided \"validation\" for what he's created in Calgary. But he's not done. This March in East Village, MacLean opens a second restaurant featuring his Final Table dishes. Monica Curtis Growing up on a small Manitoba farm, Monica Curtis learned important lessons she's brought to the role of CEO of Energy Efficiency Alberta. \"In a rural area, you have to take care of the things you have,\" says the 55-year-old who has led the new government agency for 20 months. \"You worked hard and did things that mattered to you and society, making full use of your resources. You couldn't run down the street and buy something.\" The self-reliance and entrepreneurialism that farming instilled took Curtis to a university business degree, her first Alberta job with the department of agriculture, then to Edmonton Power (Epcor) working on some of the utility's first energy-efficiency programs. After similar work at SaskPower, Curtis moved to Wisconsin with her husband and two small children, spending 10 years consulting on resource management with companies and utilities in 17 states. Her decision to return to Canada was both personal and professional. She wanted her now-teenage children to grow up Canadian and was attracted to the challenge of implementing Alberta's first provincewide energy-efficiency programs. One of the biggest successes was the Residential No Charge program that swapped everything from shower heads to thermostats for more efficient models. Twelve per cent of Alberta's single-family homes (150,000 households) signed up - twice what was expected. Savings equate to 20,000 tonnes of greenhouse-gas emissions (equivalent to 8,000 cars off Alberta roads) and three-million litres of water (enough to fill 1,000 Olympic swimming pools). This year, Curtis says public awareness and program delivery will continue, including a green loan program for small and medium-sized businesses, and professional training to grow the energy-efficiency industry (1,200 tradespeople, including electricians and solar installers, are already involved in programs). \"Albertans have always had a thrifty culture,\" said Curtis. \"They don't want to waste things.\" Paul Shumlich Paul Shumlich, the 28-year-old founder of Deepwater Farms, gets excited when he talks about entrepreneurship and the future of this city. The third-generation Calgarian says young entrepreneurs are embracing new technologies as well as concepts such as \"local\" and \"sustainable\" - and in the process are expanding the city's image beyond oil and gas. \"My peers, my friends from university and other inspiring people are doing amazing things,\" Shumlich says. \"Things don't change overnight, but they are changing.\" Shumlich's business, which he started five years ago while still a student in Mount Royal University's entrepreneurship program, represents a new way of thinking about food and farming. Deepwater Farms raises leafy greens and fresh seafood together in what will ultimately be a sustainable, closed loop system. (Right now, the waste from the fish is used as fertilizer for the plants. Once the company gets its technology perfected, Deepwater's goal is to condense the purified water the plants release into the air and return it to the fish). \"We are at the crossroads of nature and technology,\" says Shumlich, who believes the growing global demand for food and concern for the environment will push aquaponics into the mainstream. \"We are just at the forefront of where things are headed in terms of smart farming,\" he says. Already, Deepwater's produce and fish are served at some of the city's finest restaurants. Shumlich - who has raised close to $2 million in seed funding for the business that started in his backyard and is now located in a 10,000-square-foot building in a northeast industrial park - says he believes Deepwater Farms could grow to 10 times its size within three years, and he's not afraid of the hard work it will take to get there. \"I'm young, I don't have a house, I don't have kids,\" he says. \"I've got nothing to lose and I've got everything to gain.\" Trevor Tombe Maple Ridge B.C.'s own Robert Mundell won a Nobel Prize in Economics in 1999. When Mundell's hometown high school launched an economics course in his honour, one of the first students to sign up was Trevor Tombe. \"I didn't know what I wanted to be until late in the game,\" says the associate professor of economics at the University of Calgary, who was thrust into the spotlight last year with his pragmatic economic assessment of Calgary's potential 2026 Winter Olympics bid. That class - plus \"I wasn't afraid of math\" - took Tombe to a doctorate in economics. He joined the U of C six years ago, while also becoming research fellow at its School of Public Policy, focusing on such hot-button topics as minimum wage, carbon tax and equalization payments. \"Economics at the deepest level is that raw idea that there's no free lunch, that for every decision you make there is a trade-off. That applies to everyday life, or to public policy at all government levels.\" When asked by the city to review projected Olympic economic data, Tombe was critical of suggestions that hosting the Olympics would bring economic returns to the city of \"10 to one,\" while solving Calgary's unemployment problem. He says there was no recognition that money used for Games infrastructure would come at the expense of other infrastructure - such as schools and roads. \"Hosting a Games is about supporting sports, about a civic vision and community spirit - and are no less valuable. But it is not a free lunch.\" In 2019, Tombe will continue to make complex ideas accessible to his students - and the public. For his first-year class of 400 students in 2018: \"It was easy to get them excited about economics because there is so much connection to this world - from renegotiation of NAFTA, to Trump tweets about dairy tariffs, to equalization payments.\" Paul Addo Paul Addo is doing his part to ensure clean air for future generations. The University of Calgary researcher, originally from Ghana, was awarded the 2018 Mitacs Award for Outstanding Innovation - Post-doctoral, which he received in November in Ottawa. \"It was a great honour,\" said Addo, 36, whose groundbreaking work is in partnership with ATCO Pipelines. \"What we've been looking at in the past year is trying to take carbon dioxide emitted by large industrial plants and converting it into something very useful. My group has worked on different materials that have very good capabilities of taking carbon dioxide and converting it into chemicals for biodegradable plastic production and other applications. \"(The award) is a good symbol for me to keep working hard and make sure we come up with a commercial technology that will help companies cut down their CO2 emissions.\" Addo received his degree in chemistry in Ghana, then went to the U.S. for his master's. In 2011, he moved to Calgary to begin his PhD in carbon-dioxide conversion at the U of C. The next step is to get businesses on board with the new technology. Addo and his colleague have started a company called CO2 Energy, based at SAIT. \"We're trying to push this research to a commercial demonstration. We'll be working on this for the next couple of years. \"You need the right frame of mindset by industrial companies to use it in their production,\" he said. \"For example, we had this company in the U.S. that is involved in producing biodegradable plastics. They came to us. In that case, they're trying to recycle the CO2 so it's not being emitted into the atmosphere. \"It's a good long-term vision but we have to make sure we have the right personnel, expertise and technology to get there.\" RunLin Wang He has two international silver medals at science Olympiads, is co-founder of a math competition for junior-high students, and he tutors and mentors other youth. He also loves Tom Clancy novels and basketball (\"it's about planning out the course, the strategy of who to pass to, using logic to fruition.\") And he's taking university-level calculus for fun, while doing biochemical lab research at the University of Calgary. Seventeen-year-old RunLin Wang may not be your typical Grade 12 student, but he dreams of continuing to share his passion for science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education by becoming a university professor and researcher. \"I'm very glad to be born in this era because it's an exciting time in science,\" says the international baccalaureate student at Sir Winston Churchill High School. \"I think we should be watching young people because there could be a cure for cancer, for AIDS.\" Wang, who immigrated to Canada from Beijing with his family when he was four, found his affinity for science in junior high, when biology intrigued him with its elegant simplicity of \"form fits function.\" He joined math/science competitions because \"I genuinely love it. It isn't about competition; it's about self-improvement, to test myself.\" Against the world's top high school students, he won silver medals, in biology (2017), then chemistry (2018). While other Calgary students face a lack of lab resources to qualify for international competitions, Wang considers himself lucky to be mentored by U of C microbiologist Dr. Robert Edwards. In 2017, Wang co-founded Alberta Team Math Attack, drawing 70 kids in Calgary to a oneday, free competition sponsored by the university. It repeated last December with even greater success. The competition sees three-person teams collaborating \"instead of kids sitting at desks writing the tests, on their own, in a classroom.\" University lies ahead later this year. And while Wang's parents hoped he'd become a doctor, they are supporting \"discovery of my own dream.\""}, {"title": "CSE New Listing - Braingrid Limited Commences Trading on the Canadian Securities Exchange - Video News Alert on Investmentpitch.com", "article": "Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - January 2, 2019) - Braingrid Limited (CSE: BGRD) is one of the latest new listing on the Canadian Securities Exchange, following a reverse take-over of Match Capital Resources, which previously traded on the TSX Venture Exchange.

CONTACT: InvestmentPitch Media Barry Morgan, CFO"}, {"title": "The good, the bad and the puzzling", "article": "2018 saw some businesses boom, the mining sector suffer and, of course, a whole whack of weed In 2018, the business dynamics in Manitoba sort of mirrored what was going on everywhere else. The new digital era in which we live caused plenty of disruption (and new opportunities) in Manitoba, the overall economy grew slowly and tentatively and while Winnipeg's real estate market has never been close to a bubble, it slowed down in 2018 as regulators tried to put a cap on the gushers in Vancouver and Toronto. Here are a few of our own home business stories of the year: Canadian reality check Folks in Ottawa finally realized that if someone didn't fix the train tracks to Churchill, the whole concept of Canadian Arctic sovereignty really wasn't going to work anymore. After almost two years of uncertainty over the future of the rail line, the federal government helped form a consortium to take over ownership of the line, kicked in more than $100 million to acquire the assets and ensured the new owners would have enough resources to keep the line repaired for the next 10 years. Now, the challenge begins anew to create an economic scenario for the railroad and the only Canadian deep-water port on the Arctic Ocean that will keep it above water. Hopefully, a near-fatal brush with a system-wide transportation shutdown will be enough to underline the need for this country to actually embrace the North instead of just moving to the suburbs. The economic hot potato Trying to come up with an economic development plan is a mug's game that's only as good as the jobs that are created and the next contract that's signed, irrespective of what's in the plan. But out of an abundance of caution (and a desire to disown any policy that might suggest a hint of NDP), the Pallister government commissioned a couple of reports that forestalled taking any definitive stance one way or the other. It paid Deloitte to do a laundry list of what's out there and then took advantage of the good will of Dave Angus and Barb Gamey, who spent countless hours as unpaid volunteers (and who barely received a breath of acknowledgement from the premier). They got input on the best ways for the province to approach economic development from the people who are actually doing economic development. Other than some bureaucratic re-shuffling and a commitment to use some third-party agencies, it's about as clear as mud as to what the economic development strategy is. Welcome to Winnipeg As a sparsely populated sprawling province in the middle of the country, folks have forever been trying to come up with ways to lure businesses and investment here. (There are some who even joke about keeping quiet about how good we have it here to avoid getting sullied by too many moneyed enterprises rolling in.) In 2018, there were a few interesting new businesses setting up shop here. Manitobans became the guinea pigs for the newest wireless company in the country -- Xplore Mobile. And the successful French computer gaming company, Ubisoft, decided to open a studio here to capitalize on the excellent schooling, diligent and loyal workforce and damned smart people who live here. End of an era 2018 saw a spate of departures of people with lengthy tenures running some of the most active organizations in town. Klaus Lahr -- who ran the Winnipeg Convention Centre for about a generation -- retired, as did Sean McKay, the guy who invented the Composites Innovation Centre. Stefano Grande left the Downtown Biz to take over the Children's Hospital Foundation of Manitoba and Mike Mager stepped down from the corner office at CAA Manitoba after 32 years there. There were a few corporate departures as well. Monsanto announced it's moving its Canadian head office to Calgary, the Winnipeg Commodity Exchange closed up shop after 131 years and the fledgling ultra-low-cost air carrier Flair Air no longer calls Winnipeg home. Who needs Amazon? Speaking of that smart, industrious labour market, in 2018, the food-delivery company SkipTheDishes just about completed its official takeover of the East Exchange, where it employs about 2,000 people (when five years ago there was only about a handful). Even though it was acquired by a British company, it's the smart Winnipeg crew running the show. And the little app company from Ile-des-Chenes, Bold Commerce, keeps outgrowing ever-larger facilities. Farmers Edge, the precision agriculture company, may now be the most globally influential company in Winnipeg. More and more farmers from as far away as Australia and South America are using the Winnipeg company's technology to become more productive. Mining for miners It was another troubling year for the mining industry in Manitoba, with the closure of a mine in Bissett that had been extracting gold for generations. The nickel smelter in Thompson, part of Vale's big mining complex there, closed this summer and was preceded by the closure of its Birchtree mine in 2017. Over in Flin Flon, Hudbay Minerals made it official that after 90 years of operating mines in and around that northern Manitoba town, it will effectively be clearing out after 2021. Hudbay still has a good-sized operation in Snow Lake and continues to spend money on exploration in the region, but the sector needs some good news fast. Efforts to reopen a former gold-mining operation in Lynn Lake have been getting bogged down by red tape and industry officials say the province could do a lot more to provide incentives for capital-intensive exploration activities. What a difference a tower makes The 365,000-square-foot True North Square office building opened in 2018, the first new multi-tenant office building in the city in 25 years. While it and an accompanying residential tower (as well as a hotel now under construction across the street) have filled in almost a whole city block that used to be surface parking, the office building has an aspirational quality to it. The hope is that existing businesses have grown enough to warrant additional space or, out of the blue, some big head office will decide to move to Winnipeg for some inexplicable reason. In the meantime, the biggest impact of the development is likely being felt be the managers of the legacy towers in the city, where vacancy rates have all gone up. The next big thing Marijuana is legal and so far, no one has succumbed to Reefer Madness,unless you count stock market investors trying to make a killing. It's only been a couple of months and the operators still have to fine-tune the supply-and-demand dynamics, but there is no denying the capital investment and job-creation activities. It's like a brand-new vertical market that requires a whole new supply chain. In Winnipeg alone, long-vacant industrial buildings are being filled, retail spaces that were previously begging for tenants are now commanding market rates and hundreds of new jobs are being created. GrowForce is building a 120,000-square-foot production facility in an old meat-packing plant in Transcona, Bonify has renovated the old Winnipeg Cold Storage building into a high-tech operation and Delta 9 Cannabis is expanding into a series of long-vacant old buildings in east Transcona. Remember to tip the serving staff Allegations of harassment and bullying at Stella's, the successful Winnipeg restaurant chain, likely shocked a lot of patrons partial to the chain's fresh food and home-grown vibe. In addition to some kind of vindication for the victims of the poor treatment they received in the workplace, it might have caused a lot of poor or absentee managers to take stock and become more engaged. Stella's ownership went so far as to take out a full page in the Free Press to apologize. It's not hard to imagine there are other institutions out there that could use Stella's example to make sure there are systems in place so that similar toxic environments are not allowed to fester. They really love us Manitobans who can't afford the pricey excursion to see the polar bears in Churchill have likely never thought too much about how much of an international pull such a tourist attraction really is. But now that Lonely Planet included Manitoba in a list of the top 10 regions to visit in 2019, we're all feeling a little chuffed about how cool that is.

Zeroing in on the moral side of everything from medical imaging to automated credit card approvals, the Centre for Advancing Responsible and Ethical Artificial Intelligence (CARE-AI) aims to bring together experts to study and teach humanist approaches to AI. Graham Taylor, a machine learning expert named as the centre's academic director, says AI carries the seeds of both harm and progress, depending on how it's nourished. \"There has to be, with any AI, essentially a tradeoff between what you can do with the technology and how much you're willing to violate people's privacy in order to achieve those technological objectives,\" Taylor said in an interview. \"We're still fully in control of these systems, so it's the right time to drive toward human values...potentially before it's too late, because there are things that could go wrong.\" Protecting people's right to privacy and weeding out bias in big data will be one of his key concerns, as ethical issues continue to draw attention everywhere from Silicon Valley to Toronto's waterfront. There, Google-affiliated tech company Sidewalk Labs' proposed use of sensors to measure residents' movements in Quayside, a planned neighbourhood near downtown, has sparked debates over facial recognition, data access and profit. Sometimes technical solutions can resolve the tension between privacy and data collection. In one recent lab experiment, Taylor's team used carbon dioxide detection rather than cameras, which are more invasive, to determine how many people occupy a space and set the room temperature accordingly. Built-in prejudice is another issue, said Jennifer Chayes, managing director of Microsoft Research in Cambridge, Mass. \"If I am trying to hire a software development engineer, and I look at what are the characteristics of the successful software development engineers I have in my pool, what you might conclude is that being male is one of the key characteristics,\" she said. The new centre will take aim at regulations and public policy related to the ethics of AI technologies, the university said. Researchers will also apply AI to human and animal health, environmental sciences and food and agriculture. Mary Wells, dean of the College of Engineering and Physical Sciences, highlighted the use of field data and precision agriculture to apply soil nutrients efficiently with minimal environmental impact. \"There are only so many resources on the planet. AI will allow us to optimize the limited resources we have and equalize opportunities,\" she said. \"Often we think of technology in isolation from social applications. When we use this intellectual property, we have a responsibility to society to do good.\" Working with an advisory panel of academic and industry leaders, the centre will draw on nearly 90 researchers and scholars from units across campus, including the Arrell Food Institute and the Centre for Biodiversity Genomics. It will introduce more AI-related courses and new graduate programs, the university said. The centre will also support a new collaborative specialization in AI approved for funding under an initiative administered by Toronto's Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence, said Taylor, who is a member of the organization."}, {"title": "Forestry; Data from University of Quebec Provide New Insights into Forestry (Effect of Predation, Competition, and Facilitation on Tree Survival and Growth in Abandoned Fields: Towards Precision Restoration)", "article": "2018 DEC 20 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Agriculture Week -- Current study results on Forestry have been published. According to news originating from Montreal, Canada, by VerticalNews correspondents, research stated, \"Tree seedlings planted in abandoned agricultural fields interact with herb communities through competition, tolerance, and facilitation. In addition, they are subject to herbivory by small mammals, deer or invertebrates.\" Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the University of Quebec, \"To increase the success of forest restoration in abandoned fields and reduce management costs, we should determine which species are tolerant to or facilitated by herbaceous vegetation and those which require protection from competition and predation. Eight native tree species were planted in plots covered by herbaceous vegetation, plots where herbaceous vegetation was removed, and plots where seedlings were surrounded by an organic mulch mat. Half of the seedlings were protected against small mammal damage. Results showed that two non-pioneer and moderately shade-tolerant species (yellow birch and red oak) were inhibited by herbaceous vegetation. Birch species were particularly affected by small mammal predation. No effects of predation or herbaceous competition were observed for conifer species. Rather, herbaceous vegetation had a positive effect on the survival and the height growth of tamarack (Larix laricina). None of the tested herb communities had a stronger competitive effect on tree growth than another. Restoration of abandoned fields using multi-tree species should be designed at the seedling scale rather than at the site scale to account for different tree responses to predation and competition as well as variable site conditions.\" According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"An approach resembling precision agriculture is proposed to lower costs and any potential negative impact of more intensive vegetation management interventions.\" For more information on this research see: Effect of Predation, Competition, and Facilitation on Tree Survival and Growth in Abandoned Fields: Towards Precision Restoration.

According to news reporting out of Guelph, Canada, by VerticalNews editors, research stated, \"Meeting future food demands for 9 billion people in the next 30 years will require either agricultural expansion or intensification to increase production. However, agriculture is already a major driver of biodiversity loss, as well as freshwater withdrawals, nutrient inputs, and greenhouse gasses, among other pressing environmental issues.\" Financial support for this research came from Canada First Research Excellent Fund. Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the University of Guelph, \"In this paper, we look for solutions to this production-conservation challenge at the subfield scale. We use precision agriculture yield data from three farms in Southern Ontario and convert them into 'profit maps' that show which regions of a field have management costs that exceed the market value of the commodities produced. We analyse the profit of three farms over time and identify areas that consistently show low or negative profit and thus constitute a compelling case for taking these areas out of production. We find, for example, that up to 14% of farmland can result in money loss and even more than 50% of the land might still not meet minimum revenue expectations. Further, we assess the economic feasibility of conservation strategies on these set-aside lands and find that investing in environmental benefits (even minimally) can often times be inexpensive when compared with economic losses due to failed harvests.\" According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"We argue that profit mapping can serve as a management tool for farmers that will allow them to identify optimal crop areas, optimize nutrient inputs, plan for ecological intensification, and avoid economic loss all while providing ecosystem services at the local scale.\" Our news journalists report that additional information may be obtained by contacting V.

The goal, according to the federal government, is for companies of all sizes, academia and the non-profit sector to collaborate on new technologies, to spur economic growth and create jobs. As part of the Innovation Nation series, the Financial Post is taking an in-depth look at each of the five regional projects, and will provide continuing coverage of their progress. It looks like beef. It tastes like beef. It even bleeds like beef, thanks to the beet juice extract. If not for the distinctive aroma - fast-food chain A&W's Beyond Meat burger gives off a scent more like a casserole than a burger patty - the plant-based protein puck would fool even the most red-blooded carnivores. It's a tasty concoction made from protein isolated from peas, rice and mung beans as well as canola and coconut oils. More important, it's a product that plant-based protein companies across the Prairies believe consumers around the world will buy in increasing quantities. Entrepreneurs and the federal government don't just want Canada's three Prairie provinces to sell more proteins derived from plants to a growing global population, the express goal is world domination. \"That presents enormous potential for us,\" said Innovation, Science and Economic Development Minister Navdeep Bains, whose ministry established the Protein Industries Supercluster in Regina this year and is seeding it with $153 million. To access the funding, companies would need to match the contributions from the federal government on new facilities, Bains said in an interview, adding that funding announcements are coming \"in as little as a matter of weeks.\" James Szarko, the president and CEO of Calgary-based Botaneco Inc., which uses a proprietary method to extract valuable oils, proteins and fibres from canola, safflower, sunflower and hemp, is one of a growing number of companies in the West expanding its facilities. \"We could truly dominate,\" said Szarko, noting the abundance of farm land in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba as well as plentiful water and suitable crops. But the industry has a classic Canadian problem. Canada is once again playing the role of drawers of water and hewers of wood, exporting raw produce to other countries that add value and ship it back to us at higher costs. The missing ingredient is innovative processing methods and facilities to turn the crops and seeds from the Prairies into value-added protein products such as hemp-based protein powder or canola-based supplements. The protein supercluster aims to create 4,500 new jobs and contribute $4.5 billion to the country's GDP in 10 years. The cluster's interim board of directors includes executives from companies across the three provinces, including AGT Food and Ingredients Inc., Emerging Ag Inc., Enns Brothers Ltd., and Ag-West Bio Inc. \"It's bigger than one company and bigger than one province,\" Bains said. The federal government has committed funding to five superclusters focused on a range of sectors, but Bains says the protein hub on the Prairies is kicking off with some existing momentum. In September of last year, Roquette, the France-based global leader in innovative plant-based food ingredients, broke ground on a $400-million manufacturing facility in Portage la Prairie, Man., that will derive proteins from peas, showing that investors see an opening in the domestic protein sector. Even established players in the meat industry, such as Maple Leaf Foods Inc., intend to participate in the supercluster and are building a presence in the space. Over the past two years the Mississauga, Ont.-based Maple Leaf has purchased Washington-based Field Roast Grain Meat Co. for US$120 million as well as Massachusettsbased Lightlife Foods Inc., which makes plant-based tempeh, an Indonesian dish using deep-fried fermented soya beans, hotdogs, breakfast foods and burgers, for US$140 million. \"We feel that we've entered this space at a very good time. We'll see how quickly it goes,\" said Rory McAlpine, Maple Leaf senior vicepresident, government and industry relations. Other companies, such as Innisfail, Alta.-based WA Grains & Pulse Solutions, are building or expanding processing facilities to capture growing opportunities in the market. \"Unlike other superclusters, this one is not aspirational,\" said Carlo Dade, Canada West Foundation director of trade and investment policy. \"Our goal is total world domination,\" he said, noting that Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba could collectively corner the global market for plant-based protein. Still unclear, however, is whether governments in Ottawa, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba are willing to work together to support the nascent industry's growth. \"I'm not as convinced on the political level,\" Dade said. \"It's an indictment of government in general.\" Saskatchewan says it's committed to \"a collaborative effort\" and is communicating regularly with Alberta and Manitoba on research. \"We need to share our intellectual and physical resources to be successful in this highly competitive global area,\" Saskatchewan's agriculture ministry said in a statement, adding the provinces could better co-operate on developing new technologies and market commercialization. Similarly, Alberta said it's willing to share research. \"There's always been collaboration on research and sharing technology,\" Alberta Agriculture Minister Oneil Carlier said. \"Alberta is well positioned to be able to supply some research know-how.\" The Manitoba government did not respond to a request for comment. The cluster effect is already under way as the Prairies'agriculture industry is tapping into at least 19 crops and research and development in the region - a nexus of universities, government incubators and the private sector. Combined, the three provinces are already some of the world's biggest producers of high-protein pulses like peas and lentils, in addition to being major exporters of wheat, canola, barley, beef and other agricultural products. Saskatchewan, the largest agriculture and agri-foods exporting province, reported $13.6 billion in exports in those categories in 2017, slightly below $14.4 billion in exports a year earlier. Alberta broke its own record with $11 billion in agriculture exports last year, and Manitoba recorded $4.3 billion in ag-based exports, which was roughly flat from the year before. Those figures could get a boost as global demand for plant-based proteins, valued at US$8 billion in 2017, is projected to grow at an annual rate of 5.9 per cent to US$14.8 billion by 2023, according to a study by the Canada West Foundation. The report found that plant-based proteins will make up a third of the global protein market by 2054. The surge is largely a function of a growing global middle class driving demand for protein. Data shows 160 million people are expected to join the middle class every year for the next five years. Still, there was some disappointment in the Prairies as the plantbased proteins supercluster beat out another \"precision farming\" supercluster proposal, focused on cattle and livestock ranchers. Dennis Laycraft, executive vicepresident of the Canadian Cattlemen's Association, said his group, which represents beef producers, was disappointed that its proposal - aimed at reducing water and chemical usage in meat products - didn't receive funding. But it was pleased for the plant-based proteins supercluster. \"It was important that agriculture did achieve one of the clusters,\" Laycraft said. As for meatless burgers, he rejects the idea that they are more sustainable than the meat version. \"There are a number of people trying to create the perception that livestock agriculture isn't good for the environment,\" Laycraft said. \"Canada is one of the best environmental stories in the world when it comes to livestock production.\" But the budding plant-based industry faces rising competition from the United States and Europe. CWF's Dade says businesses in the U.S. have already established an advantage in the production of protein derived from soy beans, eliminating one potential strain of proteins for Canadian businesses to compete. Europe, which has less farmland for crops than Canada, has been investing in processing centres for other forms of plant-based protein. Botaneco's Szarko acknowledges the competition, but notes Canada has an advantage over its competitors thanks to recently signed free trade deals with Europe, the United States and the Asia-Pacific countries that provide domestic agriculture producers low-cost access to a global consumer base. \"I do think the Protein Industries (Supercluster) is an incredible catalyst,\" Szarko said. \"The timing couldn't be sooner.\""}, {"title": "Can supply management and innovation co-exist? The dairy industry offers a surprising answer", "article": "Agropur Cooperative, the maker of OKA cheese and Natrel milk, is what what a free-market economist might call an outlier. The Longueuil, Quebec-based co-op is owned by about 3,300 members of Canada's \"dairy cartel,\" which is how many of the dismal scientists on Twitter describe the 13,000 farms responsible for almost all of the lactose in the Canadian diet. Providing the raw ingredient for cheese, ice cream and whey powder is an unusually tough business. However, Canada's dairy farmers endure their daily dawn-to-dark rituals comforted by the knowledge that they will be spared the vagaries of supply and demand. Government-sanctioned production quotas ensure that fluid-milk prices exceed the cost of production and a massive tariff wall keeps all but a small percentage of imports at bay. \"We cannot be reactive to innovation,\" Robert Coallier, Agropur's chief executive, told me in an interview on Oct. 31, by which he meant the co-op intends to be a leader, not a follower. \"We're pretty unique,\" he acknowledged. \"We don't see Saputo investing that kind of money in Canada,\" Simon Somogyi, the Arrell chair in the business of food at the University of Guelph, told me in an interview on Nov. 20. \"In my mind, a system that provides an incentive to produce without giving much thought to markets, that's not good.\" That path probably won't lead to the dismantling of supply management because the U.S.'s heavily subsidized dairy farmers would flood the Canadian market. But we might end up with a system that favours the most efficient and innovative farmers, as the Trudeau government has identified agriculture and agri-food as an industry that should be generating more exports and wealth. Agropur's recent history suggests innovation is possible within a supply managed system so long as its benefactors are a little uncomfortable. The co-op got truly serious about developing and commercializing new ideas a few years ago, according to Dominique Benoit, vice-president of institutional affairs. That would have about the same time it was becoming clear that trade agreements with Europe and Asia would open the door to more dairy imports. Now it's sponsoring startups. There's a reason the economists think competition is a good thing."}, {"title": "Going meatless: Prairies shoot for 'total world domination' in growing field of plant-based proteins", "article": "CALGARY - It looks like beef.

According to news reporting out of Guelph, Canada, by VerticalNews editors, research stated, \"Meeting future food demands for 9 billion people in the next 30 years will require either agricultural expansion or intensification to increase production. However, agriculture is already a major driver of biodiversity loss, as well as freshwater withdrawals, nutrient inputs, and greenhouse gasses, among other pressing environmental issues.\" Financial support for this research came from Canada First Research Excellent Fund. Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the University of Guelph, \"In this paper, we look for solutions to this production-conservation challenge at the subfield scale. We use precision agriculture yield data from three farms in Southern Ontario and convert them into 'profit maps' that show which regions of a field have management costs that exceed the market value of the commodities produced. We analyse the profit of three farms over time and identify areas that consistently show low or negative profit and thus constitute a compelling case for taking these areas out of production. We find, for example, that up to 14% of farmland can result in money loss and even more than 50% of the land might still not meet minimum revenue expectations. Further, we assess the economic feasibility of conservation strategies on these set-aside lands and find that investing in environmental benefits (even minimally) can often times be inexpensive when compared with economic losses due to failed harvests.\" According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"We argue that profit mapping can serve as a management tool for farmers that will allow them to identify optimal crop areas, optimize nutrient inputs, plan for ecological intensification, and avoid economic loss all while providing ecosystem services at the local scale.\" Our news journalists report that additional information may be obtained by contacting V.

In this case, that book is Rebecca Tucker's A Matter of Taste: A Farmers' Market Devotee's Semi-Reluctant Argument for Inviting Scientific Innovation to the Dinner Table. It's a slim volume, but makes a solid case for putting an end to magical thinking when debating the future of food. On the face of it, that might not seem like a terribly radical call to action but, as Tucker, a Toronto journalist active in the city's food community, points out, a lot of the most commonly accepted \"fixes\" for the industrial food system are unrealistic and elitist. That's not to say that Tucker wants to give \"Big Food\" a pass - but, rather, that it's important to try to find some middle ground between the food grown and processed by corporations and the farmers' market cohort. What's wrong with farmers' markets? Not a thing, if you can afford the prices, which Tucker estimates is roughly twice as much as most stores. Big-box stores aren't a choice for many people - they're a necessity. And that's only going to get worse on a planet expecting nine billion inhabitants within 20 or so years, especially with the challenges that come with climate change. To survive that, we're going to have to science the heck out of the food system, argues Tucker, who cheers on \"Smart Farming,\" urban vertical agriculture (no soil) and even GMOs (genetically modified organisms). Sparked by an increased awareness over Big Food's abysmal environmental and human rights records and poor nutritional standards, the last 20 years have seen a massive backlash against industrial agriculture - so massive that many within it reject science altogether, arguing that we need to return to a pre-lapsarian \"Golden Age of Food.\" The practical problem with Golden Age of Food thinking is that family farms selling directly to the consumer aren't sustainable. The fundamental problem with that, though, is that the wholesale rejection of science is a ridiculous approach to any contemporary issue. You can argue for better science, or better applications of science, but to argue for no science, well, you might as well pitch in with the flat-earthers, creationists and anti-vaxxers. And, as Tucker demonstrates, the anti-GMO rhetoric is pretty darn close to the anti-vax lobby, in that it trades in logical fallacies, scare tactics and a lack of general understanding of the fundamentals of science. Food, of course, is not the only pressing current issue stalled by an anti-modern backlash that's led to polarization. The only way out, though, is by continuing to make thorough, well-informed, even-handed arguments for moderation and meeting in the middle - exactly like the ones Tucker has made.

This is the first satellite in a constellation of up to 28 smallsats that will provide global IoT coverage. \"This is undoubtedly an exciting leap forward for us and a foundational component of our future constellation. We expect it will shake up the way people think about IoT connectivity, in terms of application types that can be layered on top of the network, specifically analytics and blockchain,\" explains CEO and co-founder, Scott Larson. \"We're very grateful to our team and partners for helping us reach this milestone and we remain focused on expanding our market opportunities and completing our next group of satellites.\" By 2020, the IoT market is expected to be worth US$581B for information and communications tech-based spend, according to a 2018 McKinsey report. (With a compound Annual Growth Rate ranging between 7 and 15%.) The report anticipates that industries related to manufacturing, transportation and logistics, and utilities will spend $40B each on IoT platforms, systems and services. While IoT sensors become cheaper thanks to design innovations, IoT security, another pain point, can also be improved by combining blockchain capabilities. \"The IoT industry is very much in a growth phase. For Helios, the goal isn't only to connect devices and aggregate data, it's also to improve the applications and services that can be layered atop the network. The ability to allow for not only machine-to-machine communication, but also machine-to-machine transactions using the blockchain, is very intriguing. It is the economy of machines and the service offering will add very real value,\" says Larson. Truly global connectivity has yet to be fully addressed economically by traditional providers, and with a space-based system, connectivity and data become even more secure and accessible. Ledgers and data can be backed up in space, while small data bursts can be leveraged by both small and large organizations operating across land and sea. \"The key is finding the sweet spot in a system that is robust enough to offer the types of data rates that meet the needs of industrial applications, but also at a price point that actually allows for adoption by a wide range of customers.\" Helios intends to scale to 28 microsatellites over the next five years. About Helios Wire Helios Wire is bringing satellite-enabled, machine-to-machine (M2M) and Internet of Things connectivity to the mass market. This two-way global system will provide ultra-low-cost, short-burst data services -- connecting up to 5 billion sensors using priority mobile satellite system (MSS) S-band spectrum. The Helios system is designed for new and existing applications that monitor or control fixed and mobile assets. Those assets can be found across a broad array of applications related to transportation, supply chains, logistics, security/public safety, energy, industrial construction, agriculture, animal management, among other industries.

Greek agriculture going digital The Greek government has plans to collect agriculture information into a database that will be open to everyone, including researchers, farmers and policymakers. The data will include satellite-gathered weather conditions, the information collected by farmers who use precisionfarming technology and much more. Greece is the first government in Europe to make this move, but politicians in the European Union are telling member countries that this is what they ought to copy. The EU executive seems to be satisfied with the Greek government's plan and describes its approach as a \"win-win\" situation for all, reports EUROACTIV. \"The digitisation of agriculture and precision farming present enormous potential to improve the competitiveness and environmental sustainability of European agricultural production, thus adding value and jobs in the agri-food sector,\" Commissioner Phil Hogan said an interview with ERUO-ACTIV."}, {"title": "Among compaction villains, the wagons are the worst; Often outfitted with highinflation highway tires, hay and gravity wagons leave a deep footprint", "article": "Meaford -Which piece of your farm equipment is the biggest offender when it comes to soil compaction? Manure spreaders are bad, loaded pickup trucks can be a problem, but it is hay wagons and gravity wagons that are at the top of the list tests with sensors have found, participants in the AG 4.0.2 digital agriculture conference were told. OMAFRA crop innovation specialist Ian McDonald said hay and gravity wagons often have old retread highway trailer tires at 60 to 89 psi. \"In this game we all recognize e there is a price to be paid for better tires. We have to figure out that t verses less compaction. Everybody y has to make that decision for themselves,\" he said. The damage from soil compaction was highlighted by several speakers at the Meaford conference with predictions that the trend to larger and larger farm equipment will be reversed because of the compaction problems they are creating. \"Equipment has gotten way too large,\" said Scott Shearer, chair of food and agricultural engineering at Ohio State University. Shearer predicted agriculture will move to autonomous equipment that is lighter in order to reduce compaction. Patience is another way to prevent damage, McDonald said. When the weather turns bad during spring seeding some farmers tend to work the land too wet, reducing the porosity of the soil, he said. \"The difference can be as little as six hours. Half a sunlight day can make the difference between ground that is fit to be worked and ground that isn't fit and you are going to live with the compaction at least one season if not more,\" he said. Lowering tire pressure when equipment is moved into the field will reduce compaction, McDonald said. But few farmers in the crowd said they actually take the time and have the equipment required in the field to routinely lower tire pressure. Jake Kraayenbrink, who farms and has worked on compaction research with OMAFRA and the University of Guelph, said soil health is something everyone in society should be concerned about. \"We only have so much topsoil and it is non-renewable,\" Kraayenbrink said. Compacted soils become very vulnerable to the wind and water movement, he said. \"When we see brown water, we see brown snow, we see dust flying, that is our resource that is disappearing. Once it is gone, it is gone.\" In 2010 he was part of a research team that visited Europe to learn about CTIS -centre tire inflation/deflation systems. Working with an engineer and mechanic when he returned, Kraayenbrink developed and patented his own system that allows farmers to automatically inflate or deflate tires without leaving the tractor. The company he formed, AgriBrink, has sold more than 80 of the systems and is currently developing a dealer network."}, {"title": "AJX AgJunction earns $1.65-million (U.S.) in Q3", "article": "AgJunction Inc (TSX:AJX) Shares Issued 117,178,275 Last Close 11/12/2018 $0.85 Monday November 12 2018 - News Release Mr. Dave Vaughn reports AGJUNCTION REPORTS THIRD QUARTER 2018 EARNINGS RESULTS AgJunction Inc. is releasing its financial results for the third quarter ended Sept. 30, 2018.

Management commentary \"Our third quarter revenue and profits benefited from shipments made under the bulk purchase order we announced earlier this year,\" said Dave Vaughn, president and chief executive officer of AgJunction. \"The bulk order offset general industry softness as the worldwide agricultural market continues to face uncertainty with higher tariffs and lower grain prices. The continuing demand for our core products are a testament to their ability to assist our farmer customers to drive down costs and to increase crop yields. \"Our hands-free-farm initiative continued to gain market traction with the introduction of our revolutionary new Wheelman auto-steering product, which we showcased at two major trade shows to rave reviews and significant market interest. We continue to receive excellent feedback on the functionality of the product and the substantially lower price point compared with any other auto-steering products on the market, furthering our mission to bring precision ag to millions of smaller farms. \"In order to allow us to focus on our core strategy of growing the market for auto-steering, we completed the sale of our Outback Guidance business to Hemisphere GNSS during the quarter, along with a new technology licensing agreement. We also settled the patent infringement lawsuit against Raven Industries and entered into a non-exclusive licence with them for a significant portion of AgJunction's extensive patent portfolio. Completing these two initiatives were important steps in bolstering our strategy to expand precision ag and further commercialize our industry-leading intellectual property. \"Looking to the remainder of 2018 and into 2019, we believe our financial results will continue to benefit from the large bulk purchase order. Notwithstanding this, we remain committed to investing in [research and development] to expand upon the success we have experienced with our hands-free-farm initiative and with Wheelman to create revolutionary new products that bring immense value at a reasonable price to millions of small farms across the globe.\" Third quarter 2018 financial results Total revenue in the third quarter of 2018 increased 99 per cent to $17.9-million compared with $9.0-million in the third quarter of 2017. This was primarily driven by an increase in sales in the company's Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region associated with the previously disclosed bulk purchase order. Gross profit in the third quarter of 2018 increased 96 per cent to $6.3-million compared with $3.2-million in the third quarter of 2017. Gross margin was 35.4 per cent compared with 36.0 per cent in the third quarter of 2017. The margin decline was primarily due to a lower-margin mix of products associated with the bulk purchase order, partially offset by the reduction of warranty and obsolescence reserves, and compensation costs being allocated to cost of revenue. Total operating expenses improved to $5.7-million compared with $6.3-million in the third quarter of 2017, primarily driven by the capitalization of development costs and a decrease in employee compensation costs. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses declined significantly to 31.7 per cent compared with 70.0 per cent in the third quarter of 2017 due to the increase in revenue. Net income in the third quarter increased significantly to $1.6-million or one cent per share, compared with a net loss of $3.1-million or two cents per share in the third quarter of 2017. The improvement was driven by the aforementioned increase in revenue, along with the decrease in total operating expenses. EBITDA in the third quarter of 2018 increased 180 per cent to $2.1-million compared with ($2.6-million) in the third quarter of 2017. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the third quarter of 2018 totalled $19.5-million compared with $13.9-million at the end of 2017. Working capital was $22.9-million compared with $20.3-million at the end of 2017. The company continues to carry no debt and has access to its full $3.0-million line of credit. Year-to-date 2018 financial results Total revenue in the first nine months of 2018 increased 29 per cent to $47.4-million compared with $36.9-million in the same period of 2017. This was driven by an increase in sales in the company's EMEA region associated with the bulk purchase order. Gross profit in the first nine months of 2018 increased 19 per cent to $18.5-million compared with $15.6-million in the same period of 2017. Gross margin was 39.1 per cent compared with 42.2 per cent in the same period of 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a lower-margin mix of products sold versus the prior period. Total operating expenses increased to $21.2-million compared with $18.5-million in the prior-year period, primarily due to the rise in R&D costs associated with the company investing in improving and developing new products. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses improved to 44.8 per cent compared with 50.2 per cent in the first nine months of 2017. Net loss in the first nine months of 2018 was $1.7-million or one cent per share, compared with a net loss of nil or nil per share in the same period of 2017.

According to news reporting out of Corner Brook, Canada, by VerticalNews editors, research stated, \"Precision agriculture (PA) involves the management of agricultural fields including spatial information of soil properties derived from apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) measurements. While this approach is gaining much attention in agricultural management, farmed podzolic soils are under-represented in the relevant literature.\" Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the Memorial University of Newfoundland, \"This study: (i) established the relationship between ECa and soil moisture content (SMC) measured using time domain reflectometry (TDR); and (ii) evaluated the estimated SMC with ECa measurements obtained with two electromagnetic induction (EMI) sensors, i.e., multi-coil and multi-frequency, using TDR measured SMC. Measurements were taken on several plots at Pynn's Brook Research Station, Pasadena, Newfoundland, Canada. The means of ECa measurements were calculated for the same sampling location in each plot. The linear regression models generated for SMC using the CMD-MINIEXPLORER were statistically significant with the highest R-2 of 0.79 and the lowest RMSE (root mean square error) of 0.015 m(3) m(-3) but were not significant for GEM-2 with the lowest R-2 of 0.17 and RMSE of 0.045 m(3) m(-3); this was due to the difference in the depth of investigation between the two EMI sensors. The validation of the SMC regression models for the two EMI sensors produced the highest R-2 = 0.54 with the lowest RMSE prediction = 0.031 m(3) m(-3) given by CMD-MINIEXPLORER. The result demonstrated that the CMD-MINIEXPLORER based measurements better predicted shallow SMC, while deeper SMC was better predicted by GEM-2 measurements.\" According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"In addition, the ECa measurements obtained through either multi-coil or multi-frequency sensors have the potential to be successfully employed for SMC mapping at the field scale.\" For more information on this research see: Soil Moisture Mapping Using Multi-Frequency and Multi-Coil Electromagnetic Induction Sensors on Managed Podzols.

Details for the 26th annual conference, to be held at the Ridgetown campus of the University of Guelph Jan. 3 and 4, were announced Thursday. Members of the Enactus Club at Lambton College have been working sine 2012 to lift people in rural Zambia out of poverty. Enactus members have helped farmers improve their yields by using no-till methods, and have helped build peanut butter factories, schools and drip irrigation systems. The club was recently recognized for their achievement when they won the Enactus World Club. Jon Milos, the entrepreneurship director at the college, estimates that in 2018 alone, the work of Enactus members at Lambton College helped lift 270,000 people out of poverty. The story of the Enactus Club's work in Zambia will be among the presentations at the January conference. Entitled The Road Ahead, speakers will be sharing the latest information on subjects from nutrient management to marketing, compaction to pest management, and precision agriculture to maximizing yields, said program co-chair Peter Johnson in a news release.

The companies we are recognizing today know the potential that lies outside our borders and understand the challenges Canadian cleantech companies face getting there,\" said Carl Burlock, Senior Vice President, Global Head Financing and International Growth Capital, EDC. \"By sharing the stories of these outstanding organizations, we hope other potential exporters will be inspired by their success to begin their own export journeys.\" Based on commitments under the Paris Agreement, the World Bank estimates global cleantech opportunities to be $23 trillion through 2030. EDC has a dedicated team focused on understanding the industry's needs and delivering the right solutions to help Canadian cleantech companies grow their business internationally. The crown corporation is Canada's largest provider of financial solutions for cleantech companies. Since 2012, EDC has facilitated more than $5 billion worth of cleantech export business and supported more than 190 Canadian cleantech companies in the first three quarters of 2018 alone. 2018 Cleantech Export Stars Farmers Edge City: Winnipeg, Manitoba CEO: Wade Barnes Farmers Edge is at the leading edge of what some people are calling the second agricultural revolution - the development of data-driven precision agriculture that will allow farmers to continue feeding the world's growing population. Manitoba agronomists Wade Barnes and Curtis McKinnon created Farmers Edge when they realized that agricultural productivity could dramatically increase, with less water and fertilizer, by collecting and analyzing data on soil chemistry, moisture content and more. Today, the company's services still focus on data, but from a much larger range of sources that include daily satellite imagery, on-farm weather stations, soil sampling, nutrient management, precision application technologies for fertilizer and water, and artificial-intelligence-based software that gives producers an all-up understanding and direct control of their land and productivity. Westport Fuel Systems City: Vancouver, British Columbia CEO: Nancy Gougarty Westport Fuel Systems' technology has the potential to make an important contribution to combatting global climate change and the sales potential to drive the creation of new cleantech jobs in British Columbia and beyond. Westport Fuel Systems' roots trace back to early public concern about air quality issues in the 1970s and University of British Columbia professor Philip Hill's desire to build a better diesel engine. Research eventually led to the development of the first high-pressure direct injection technology (HDPI), which injects a small amount of diesel into an internal combustion engine. This allows the engine to mimic the diesel combustion cycle using 90% natural gas, delivering similar power with fewer greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The company was created to commercialize the technology in 1995. Ongoing development led to a 2017 partnership that used improved, lower-cost Westport HDPI 2.0(tm) components to build an advanced heavy-duty truck that could deliver comparable power to diesel-only vehicles with 20% lower CO2 emissions. Hortau City: Levis, Quebec CEO: Jocelyn Boudreau Hortau began working on better agricultural irrigation systems in 2002, at a time when droughts and water management were still seen as \"regional\" issues that most farmers would never need to worry about.  Sixteen years later, water management has been confirmed as a worldwide concern and Hortau's web-based irrigation management technology has become the right product at the right time. Using mobile software, Hortau's patented smart irrigation management system shows growers how their crops are faring in real time, allowing them to irrigate or adjust practices before stresses like drought or lack of aeration can have a negative impact on the crop.  The company's software collects soil data on an ongoing basis, providing farmers with information that can help them anticipate crop stress, optimize the growth of their crops, and save money on key agricultural cost inputs, like water, energy, and soil nutrients. By conserving agricultural water resources, Hortau is improving the sustainability of the North American food supply and bringing jobs and economic opportunities to Canadians. 2018 Cleantech \"One to Watch\" P&P Optica City: Waterloo, Ontario CEO: Olga Pawluczyk P&P Optica's Smart Imaging System accurately sorts meat and product on production lines for nutrition and safety, which puts better quality food on the tables of consumers with much less waste. In other words, it helps us maximize the use of a finite resource - our food. Modern food production still relies on hand sorting that favours the nicest looking foods over the most nutritious foods. This both lowers the quality of our food supply and wastes some of the best products farmers grow.  P&P Optica's patented technology combines hyperspectral imaging and artificial intelligence to instantly read the chemistry of food as it passes through the production line. Processors receive detailed information about each piece of food on the production line and can use that data to stream it for the best possible use.  Pyrowave City: Montreal, Quebec CEO: Jocelyn Doucet In a sector where every innovation is called disruptive, Pyrowave's technology that finally allows plastics to be fully recycled has legitimately earned the right to be called a \"solution.\" Post-consumer plastic waste has limited market interest and only about eight per cent of all plastics are recycled, mostly resulting in a mixed plastic product with limited uses. Pyrowave's patented technology uses small Catalytic Microwave Depolymerization (CMD) units to \"unzip\" plastics back into their constituent chemicals, turning a low value waste stream into a high value commodity that can make new plastics with properties identical to virgin. CMD technology can even unzip post-consumer polystyrene waste, which is notoriously difficult to recycle.

(Nutrien) announced today its 2018 third-quarter results, with net loss from continuing operations of $1.1 billion(1) ($1.74(2) loss per share). Third-quarter adjusted net earnings was $0.47 per share(3) and adjusted EBITDA(4) was $839 million. Adjusted net earnings and adjusted EBITDA exclude a New Brunswick potash non-cash impairment of $1.8 billion ($2.15 per share) and gain on adjustment of pension and other post-retirement benefit plans of $151 million ($0.18 per share). For a description of other adjustments in net earnings and EBITDA, please see pages 33 and 34, respectively. Nutrien also announced that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend of US$0.43 per share payable January 17, 2019 to shareholders of record on December 31, 2018. This represents a 7.5 percent increase in the dividend and is representative of improving market fundamentals and confidence in our operational cash flow moving forward. See \"Quarterly Dividend\" section for additional details regarding the dividend. \"In the third quarter, Nutrien delivered solid operating results. Retail earnings increased by 10 percent year-over-year(3) while our nutrient production operations reported higher volumes, margins and significantly lower costs. We also made significant advances on our strategic priorities including raising the dividend and our synergy target, completing our share repurchase program and closing the sale of our stake in Arab Potash Company (APC). We remain on track to receive $5 billion in net proceeds from the sale of our equity investments.

Telephone Conference: Dial-in numbers:   5 Nov 2018 18:00 ET Press Release: Nutrien Reports Solid 3rd Quarter -6-  Nutrien Ltd. Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements As at and for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2018 (in millions of US dollars except as otherwise noted) (unaudited) 1. Significant Accounting Policies 5 Nov 2018 18:00 ET Press Release: Nutrien Reports Solid 3rd Quarter -7- On January 1, 2018, Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc. (\"PotashCorp\") and Agrium Inc. (\"Agrium\") combined their businesses in a transaction by way of a plan of arrangement (the \"Merger\") by becoming wholly-owned subsidiaries of a new parent company named Nutrien Ltd. (collectively with its subsidiaries, known as \"Nutrien\" or \"the company\" except to the extent the context otherwise requires). Nutrien is the world's largest provider of crop inputs and services. The company's accounting policies are in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (\"IFRS\"). The accounting policies and methods of computation used in preparing these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements are consistent with those used in the preparation of Nutrien's first quarter 2018 unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements (\"first quarter financial statements\"). PotashCorp is the acquirer for accounting purposes, and as a result, figures and related notes for 2017 and prior reflect the historical operations of PotashCorp. The financial statements and related notes of Nutrien in 2018 and beyond reflect the consolidated operations of Nutrien. These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Nutrien and its subsidiaries; however, they do not include all disclosures normally provided in annual consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the company's first quarter financial statements. Further, while the financial figures included in this preliminary interim results news release have been computed in accordance with IFRS applicable to interim periods, this news release does not contain sufficient information to constitute an interim financial report as that term is defined in International Accounting Standard (\"IAS\") 34, \"Interim Financial Reporting\". The company expects to file an interim financial report that complies with IAS 34 in its 2018 third quarter report in November 2018. In management's opinion, the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments necessary to present fairly such information in all material respects. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the fiscal year. 2. Business Combinations Merger of Equals As described in Note 1, PotashCorp and Agrium combined their businesses in a merger of equals. Further information relating to the merger of equals was previously described in Note 2 of the company's first quarter financial statements. The company has engaged independent valuation experts to assist in determining the fair value of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed and related deferred income tax impacts in connection with the Merger. The purchase price allocation is not final as the company is continuing to obtain and verify information required to determine the fair value of certain assets and liabilities and the amount of deferred income taxes arising on their recognition. The company estimated the preliminary purchase price allocation as of the date of the Merger based on information that was available and continues to adjust those estimates as new information becomes available that existed at the date of acquisition. The company expects to finalize the amounts recognized as it obtains the information necessary to complete the analysis, and in any event, not later than December 31, 2018. Final determination of the fair values may result in further adjustments to the values presented in the following table:  Retail Acquisitions During the year, the retail segment acquired 43 farm centers in North America and Australia, in addition to companies operating within the digital agriculture, proprietary products and agricultural services segments. Benefits of the acquisitions include expansion of geographical coverage for the sale of crop input products, increased customer base and workforce, continued growth in the digital agricultural field and synergies between Nutrien and the acquired businesses. The purchase price allocation for these acquisitions is not final as the company is still gathering and analyzing information relating to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including fair values and the resulting income tax impact. The preliminary values allocated to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities based upon fair values were as follows:  3. Segment Information The company has four reportable operating segments: retail, potash, nitrogen and phosphate and sulfate. The retail segment distributes crop nutrients, crop protection products, seed and merchandise and provides services directly to growers through a network of farm centers in North and South America and Australia. The potash, nitrogen and phosphate and sulfate segments are differentiated by the chemical nutrient contained in the products that each produces.  5 Nov 2018 18:00 ET Press Release: Nutrien Reports Solid 3rd Quarter -8-  4. Impairment of Property, Plant and Equipment After a strategic portfolio review was completed by the Board of Directors during the third quarter of 2018, it was determined the New Brunswick operations would no longer be part of the company's medium-term or long-term strategic plans. As a result, the New Brunswick operations will be safely shutdown. The decision was considered a significant change in the expected manner of use and the related assets were moved from the Potash cash-generating unit (\"CGU\") to the New Brunswick CGU. Indicators of impairment were identified and the company conducted an impairment assessment of the New Brunswick CGU where the estimated recoverable amount was determined to be $50, based on fair value less costs of disposal. Since the estimated recoverable amount was lower than the carrying value, an impairment loss of $1,809 ($1,320, net of tax) was recorded in the potash segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018. 5. Other Income (Expenses)  During the third quarter of 2018, as part of the company's continuous assessment of its operations, participation in certain company defined benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit plans was suspended and/or discontinued effective January 1, 2020 based on age and years of service. As a result, the company recognized a merger-related gain on curtailment of defined benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit plans (\"Curtailment Gain\") of $151. 6. Income Tax Recovery (Expense) A separate estimated average annual effective tax rate was determined for each taxing jurisdiction and applied individually to the interim period (loss) earnings before income taxes from continuing operations for each jurisdiction. 5 Nov 2018 18:00 ET Press Release: Nutrien Reports Solid 3rd Quarter -9- Income Tax Related to Continuing Operations  The actual effective tax rate on the loss from continuing operations for the three months ended September 30, 2018 decreased compared to the same period last year. This was primarily due to different income weightings between jurisdictions, partially offset by the impairment of the New Brunswick property, plant and equipment. The actual effective tax rate on the loss from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 increased compared to the same period last year. This was due to different income weightings between jurisdictions, mostly a decline in Canada partially offset by an increase in the United States, as well as the impairment of the New Brunswick property, plant and equipment. In the second quarter of 2017, a discrete deferred tax recovery of $68 was recorded as a result of a Saskatchewan income tax rate decrease. This decreased the actual effective tax rate including discrete items for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 by 28 percentage points. 7. Discontinued Operations The company's investments in Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile S.A. (\"SQM\"), ICL and Arab Potash Company (\"APC\") were classified as held for sale and as discontinued operations in December 2017, due to regulatory requirements to dispose of these investments in connection with the Merger. The company's share of earnings, dividend income and associated income tax recovery (expense) pertaining to these investments were reclassified from (loss) earnings before income taxes and income tax recovery (expense) to net earnings from discontinued operations on the condensed consolidated statements of (loss) earnings.  On May 17, 2018, the company entered into an agreement with a third party for the sale of its remaining equity interest in SQM for $4,066 before taxes and closing costs. The agreement is subject to customary closing conditions (including applicable regulatory approvals) and is expected to close by the end of the fourth quarter of 2018. On October 24, 2018, the company completed the sale of its equity interests in APC for gross proceeds of $502, resulting in a gain on disposal of approximately $140, net of income taxes of $NIL. Net Earnings from Discontinued Operations  Cash flows from Discontinued Operations  8. Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows In connection with the sale of one of the company's investments, the company received $325 of cash that is currently not available for use.  9. Short-term Debt Short-term debt as of September 30, 2018 included $500 of borrowings secured by $1,798 of accounts receivable. The company retained control of the substantial risks and rewards of accounts receivable ownership. During the three months ended September 30, 2018, the company entered into an amending agreement to replace its $75 unsecured line of credit with a new $250 uncommitted revolving credit facility repayable on demand. The covenants under the new credit facility were the same as under the line of credit. Subsequent to September 30, 2018, the company entered into an amending agreement to increase the uncommitted revolving credit facility to $500. 10. Share Capital Share repurchase program On February 20, 2018, the company's Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program of up to five percent of the company's outstanding common shares over a one-year period through a normal course issuer bid. Purchases under the normal course issuer bid were made through open market purchases at market price as well as by other means as permitted by applicable securities regulatory authorities, including private agreements. The company completed the share repurchase program by September 30, 2018. 5 Nov 2018 18:00 ET Press Release: Nutrien Reports Solid 3rd Quarter -10- The company repurchased for cancellation 7,271,800 common shares during the three months ended September 30, 2018, at a cost of $394 and an average price per share of $54.15. During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, the company repurchased for cancellation 32,209,923 common shares at a cost of $1,663 and an average price per share of $51.62. The repurchase resulted in a reduction of share capital, and the excess of net cost over the average book value of the shares was recorded as a reduction of contributed surplus and retained earnings. Anti-dilutive shares The diluted weighted average shares calculation excluded 979,000 stock options and 118,000 equity-settled performance share units for the three months ended September 30, 2018; and 621,000 stock options and 118,000 equity-settled performance share units for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, due to their anti-dilutive effect. Dividends declared Subsequent to September 30, 2018, Nutrien's Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.43 per share payable on January 17, 2019, to shareholders of record on December 31, 2018. This represents a 7.5 percent increase from the previously declared dividends. The total estimated dividend to be paid is $263. 11. Comparative Figures As described in Note 1, the comparative figures are PotashCorp only. To conform with Nutrien's new method of presentation and as a result of discontinued operations described in Note 7, comparative figures were reclassified as follows, with no impact to net earnings. Condensed Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Earnings  Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive (Loss) Income  Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows  Condensed Consolidated Statement of Changes in Shareholders' Equity  Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet  12. Subsequent Events 5 Nov 2018 18:00 ET Press Release: Nutrien Reports Solid 3rd Quarter -11- Subsequent to September 30, 2018, the company signed a new natural gas purchase agreement in Trinidad. This five-year $1,258 contract will commence January 1, 2019 and is set to expire December 31, 2023. The signing of the new contract has increased the company's minimum purchase commitments as disclosed in the company's first quarter financial statements as follows: 2019 -- $244, 2020 -- $248, 2021 -- $252, 2022 -- $255 and 2023 -- $259.  5 Nov 2018 18:00 ET Press Release: Nutrien Reports Solid 3rd Quarter -12-  Nutrien Ltd. Selected Non-IFRS Financial Measures and Reconciliations and Supplemental Information (in millions of US dollars except percentage and per share amounts) (unaudited) Generally, a non-IFRS financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, cash flows or financial position that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS. Adjusted net earnings (in total and per share), EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, free cash flow, gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization per tonne, cash cost of product manufactured and combined Nutrien historical information for 2017, described as Nutrien, are not measures of financial performance (nor do they have standardized meanings) under IFRS. In evaluating these measures, investors should consider that the methodology applied in calculating such measures may differ among companies and analysts. Retail EBITDA to sales, retail working capital to sales and retail cash operating coverage ratio are considered to be non-IFRS financial measures as they are calculated using information representing legacy Agrium in 2017. The company uses both IFRS and certain non-IFRS measures to assess operational performance, to evaluate liquidity and financial strength, as a valuation measurement and as a component of employee remuneration. Management believes these non-IFRS measures provide useful supplemental information and greater transparency to investors in order that they may evaluate Nutrien's financial performance using the same measures as management. These non-IFRS financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, nor superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. A. ADJUSTED NET EARNINGS, EBITDA, ADJUSTED EBITDA, ADJUSTED EBITDA MARGIN and RETAIL EBITDA TO SALES Set forth below is a reconciliation of \"adjusted net earnings\" (in total and per share) to net loss from continuing operations (in total and per share). Adjusted net earnings is calculated as net loss from continuing operations before purchase price allocation, impairment, Merger and related costs, share-based compensation, Curtailment Gain and dividend income from discontinued operations net of tax. Nutrien uses adjusted net earnings to assess operational performance and as a component of employee remuneration. Management believes adjusted net earnings to be an important measure as it excludes the effects of non-operating items supporting a focus on the performance of the company's day-to-day operations. As compared to net loss from continuing operations according to IFRS, this measure is limited in that it does not reflect the periodic costs of charges associated with the purchase price allocation, impairment, Merger and related costs, share-based compensation, Curtailment Gain or dividend income from discontinued operations net of tax. Management evaluates such items through other financial measures such as cash flow (used in) provided by operating activities.  5 Nov 2018 18:00 ET Press Release: Nutrien Reports Solid 3rd Quarter -13- Set forth below is a reconciliation of \"EBITDA\" and \"adjusted EBITDA\" to net (loss) earnings from continuing operations and retail \"EBITDA\" to retail sales for the last four rolling quarters. EBITDA and retail EBITDA are calculated as net (loss) earnings from continuing operations before finance costs, income tax (recovery) expense and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as net (loss) earnings from continuing operations before finance costs, income tax (recovery) expense and depreciation and amortization, impairment, Merger and related costs, share-based compensation and Curtailment Gain. Retail EBITDA to retail sales is calculated as retail EBITDA divided by retail sales for the last four rolling quarters, which does not have any directly comparable IFRS measure. Nutrien uses EBITDA as a supplemental financial measure of its operational performance. Management believes EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, retail EBITDA and retail EBITDA to sales to be important measures as they exclude the effects of items that primarily reflect the impact of long-term investment and financing decisions, rather than the performance of the company's day-to-day operations. As compared to net (loss) earnings from continuing operations according to IFRS, these measures are limited in that they do not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in the company's business, the charges associated with impairment, Merger and related costs and selected corporate expenses. Management evaluates such items through other financial measures such as capital expenditures, cash flow (used in) provided by operating activities and capital management ratios. The company believes that these measurements are useful to measure a company's ability to service debt and to meet other payment obligations and as a valuation measurement. Retail EBITDA is also used as a component of employee remuneration. Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated as adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales (sales less freight, transportation and distribution). Management believes comparing adjusted EBITDA to net sales earned (net of costs to deliver product) is an important indicator of efficiency. In addition to the limitations given above in using adjusted EBITDA as compared to net (loss) earnings from continuing operations, adjusted EBITDA margin as compared to net (loss) earnings from continuing operations as a percentage of sales is also limited in that freight, transportation and distribution costs are incurred and valued independently of sales. Adjusted EBITDA also includes earnings from equity investees from continuing operations whose sales are not included in consolidated sales. Management evaluates these items individually on the consolidated statements of (loss) earnings.  Retail EBITDA to sales is calculated as retail EBITDA divided by retail sales for the last four rolling quarters. Management believes comparing retail EBITDA to sales earned is an important indicator of efficiency and retail's operational performance.  B. FREE CASH FLOW Set forth below is a reconciliation of \"free cash flow\" to cash (used in) provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS. The company uses free cash flow as a supplemental financial measure in its evaluation of liquidity and financial strength and as a component of employee remuneration. Free cash flow is calculated as cash (used in) provided by operating activities less sustaining capital expenditures, cash provided by operating activities from discontinued operations and changes in non-cash operating working capital. Sustaining capital expenditures include the cost of replacements and betterments for the company's facilities. Management believes that adjusting principally for the swings in non-cash operating working capital items due to seasonality or other timing issues and sustaining capital expenditures assists management in the long-term assessment of liquidity and financial strength. Management also believes that this measurement is useful as an indicator of its ability to service its debt, meet other payment obligations and make strategic investments. Readers should be aware that free cash flow does not represent residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.  C. SELECTED RETAIL METRICS Set forth below is a reconciliation of retail's \"average working capital to sales\". The company uses retail average working capital to sales to evaluate operational efficiency. Retail's average working capital to sales is calculated as the average working capital divided by sales for the last four rolling quarters. A lower or higher percentage represents increased or decreased efficiency, respectively.  5 Nov 2018 18:00 ET Press Release: Nutrien Reports Solid 3rd Quarter -14- Set forth below is a reconciliation of \"cash operating coverage ratio\", which assists management and investors in understanding the costs and underlying economics of the company's operations and assessing the company's operating performance and the company's ability to generate free cash flow from our segments and overall as a company. Cash operating coverage ratio represents gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization less EBITDA and merger-related presentation adjustments, divided by gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization expense. Given the significance of the impact of merger-related presentation adjustments for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, cash operating coverage ratio calculations were revised in the third quarter of 2018.  D. GROSS MARGIN EXCLUDING DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION PER TONNE Nutrien uses \"gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization per tonne\" for the company's potash, nitrogen and phosphate and sulfate segments as a measure of operational performance. Management believes gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization to be an important measure as it excludes the effects of items that primarily reflect the impact of long-term investment and financing decisions, rather than the performance of the company's day-to-day operations. The reconciliation of gross margin per tonne to gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization per tonne for the company's nutrients are included in the Selected Financial Data section. E. CASH COST OF PRODUCT MANUFACTURED Nutrien uses \"cash cost of product manufactured (\"cash COPM\")\" per tonne to assess operational performance for the potash and nitrogen segments. Cash COPM is calculated as cost of goods sold for the period excluding depreciation and amortization expense and inventory and other adjustments divided by the production tonnes for the period. Management believes cash COPM per tonne to be an important measure as it excludes the effects of production from other periods and long-term investment decisions, supporting a focus on the performance of the company's day-to-day operations. Cash COPM is limited in that it does not reflect the impact of manufactured product from other periods and the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets. Management evaluates such items through other financial measures such as cash flow from operating activities. The company believes that these measures are useful as an indicator of efficiency. F. NUTRIEN COMBINED 2017 HISTORICAL INFORMATION Nutrien uses non-IFRS combined historical information in the evaluation of its operations and financial position. This information is useful as it provides a measure of what the combined results may have been had PotashCorp and Agrium merged on January 1, 2017. The combined historical results for Nutrien were calculated by adding the historical IFRS financial statements prepared by PotashCorp and Agrium and then eliminating intercompany transactions and reclassifying line items to conform with Nutrien's financial statement presentation. This combined historical information does not include, among other things, estimated cost synergies, adjustments related to restructuring or integration activities, adjustments relating to purchase price allocation (\"PPA\") and the impact of discontinued operations. The combined historical information may differ from the Nutrien pro forma earnings and balance sheet presented in the company's business acquisition report dated February 20, 2018 as the pro forma information therein required certain adjustments under applicable securities laws and accounting standards that the company believes do not provide as useful a measure as the combined historical financial information. The primary differences in the statement of earnings were that pro forma finance costs were reduced by the amortization of the change in carrying amount of Agrium's debt resulting from the PPA and the pro forma other expenses were adjusted to remove any Merger-related costs. There were no comparable adjustments in the combined historical financial information. The primary differences in the balance sheet were the pro forma adjustments for the estimated proceeds from the sale of SQM, APC, ICL and Agrium's Conda Idaho phosphate production facility and adjacent phosphate mineral rights at December 31, 2017 while there was no adjustment in the combined historical financial information and the PPA in the pro forma was largely allocated to goodwill as fewer provisional fair value adjustments were known at the time of its preparation. Refer to the Appendix starting on page 33 of the company's first quarter interim report for the Nutrien combined historical balance sheet as at December 31, 2017 and the Nutrien combined historical statement of earnings and EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2017. Below is the combined historical segment EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, as this information was not previously provided.

From aerial drones, to controlled irrigation and drainage systems, to machinery that manages consumption and output by livestock, to small factories that allow the product to be packaged where it is produced, technology is becoming more and more prevalent in agriculture, those attending an agricultural technology conference in Meaford heard on Thursday. \"It is a changing time in the history of agriculture in North America,\" said Professor Scott Shearer, chair of food, agricultural and biological engineering at Ohio State University and the keynote speaker at Grey County's Ag 4.0.2 at Meaford Hall. He said there will be ample opportunity to use technology to advance agricultural substantially, and it is coming fast and soon. \"I believe that technology truly is the fourth revolution in agriculture,\" said Shearer, who spoke at the conference through an audio link from Columbus, Ohio. \"I think there is going to be some tremendous opportunities in terms of productivity gains, in terms of profitability and in terms of connecting consumers with the origins of agri-cultural products, as well as allowing consumers to know what went into those products and how they were produced.\" Shearer touched on a number of technologies that will affect sustainability in agriculture. He spoke of sensor networks to gather data about the condition of the soil and the crops growing in it, and controlled irrigation and drainage systems such as tiles that can be blocked off. Shearer said the Great Lakes region, which receives an abundance of precipitation, will remain a very productive region in terms of agriculture, but it is important to properly manage water resources and to ensure they are protected. Shearer also talked about the advancement of technology in controlled environment agriculture such as greenhouses, which will drive the way food is produced and allow food to be produced closer to home. In terms of animal agriculture, Shearer said there is a proliferation of technology that allows producers to adjust the diet of an animal, such as a dairy cow, to ensure peak milk production. See TECH A3 He also sees companies connecting the production side to the processing side in the future, with small packaging plants being placed right on farms. \"I could envision a point in time when some of the logistics companies have kind of intervened and move the finished product from the farm directly to the consumer,\" said Shearer. \"The days of brick and mortar stores may be coming to an end.\" Sensing technologies, on crop planters and drones that fly over the crops producing remotesensed imagery, are also advancing rapidly. Data collected is being used to increase yields, productivity and profitability. \"By themselves, machined-based information is very valuable and remote-sensing information is very valuable,\" said Shearer. \"When you merge the two data sets together you have tremendous potential.\" Shearer said that many of the technologies are scale neutral, so they can work on smaller farms, such as many of those that dot Grey County. \"For example, robotic milkers typically support 45 to 50 cows, and are purchased in multiples depending on herd size,\" Shearer said. \"If my projections are correct relative to field machinery, 100-hp. autonomous tractors will scale similarly to robotic milkers -one tractor for every 750 acres.\" Shearer said the move to smaller autonomous equipment will be partly spurred by a need to alleviate soil compaction, which is an issue with the large equipment being used on fields. \"This is the area I think is ripe for robotics,\" said Shearer. \"Watch what is going to happen in the next five to 10 years with the proliferation of robots in agriculture. \"It is much closer than you think.\" It is the third year that Grey County has held the agricultural technology conference, with this year's event having a particular focus on technology's role in soil health and conservation. One panel at the conference was dedicated to soil health and improving productivity through proper soil management and planting practices. The crowd heard from Jake Kraayenbrink of AgriBrink CTIS, which has developed and now sells tire inflation and deflation systems for machinery to reduce soil compaction in fields. Also on the panel was Jordanna Kalis of SoilOptix Inc., which does topsoil mapping for farmers to allow them to make better decisions on nutrient management applications for their land. Taylor Vokes, an agronomist with Sprucedale Agromart talked about the work she does crop scouting, soil sampling and her use of a program to make better use of growers'nutrient and yield data. Listeners also heard first-hand from local producers and how they have used technology in their own operations, as well as some of the realities they have faced, both good and bad, in succession planning. Speakers included Courtney Denard of Valleykirk Farms, Arlen Taylor of Cedar Crest Trout Farms, and Jeff Torrie of Torrie Farms Inc. The conference also included a session on blockchain in agriculture, where Peter Vincent of Grain Discovery spoke of how blockchain will allow consumers to essentially trace their food from the time it was a seed to when it lands on their kitchen table. After the morning sessions, participants took part in tours of area agricultural operations, including the Bay Growers apple packing facilities in the Beaver Valley, Good Family Farms south of Meaford and the Sharedon Farms silo facilities at Mennonite Corners southwest of Owen Sound."}, {"title": "Enactus'efforts in Zambia part of SWAC presentations", "article": "A Sarnia-Lambton organization's efforts to bring sustainable food production and security to rural communities in Zambia will be among the presentations planned for the Southwest Agriculture Conference in Ridgetown in early January.

Grieg Seafood BC showed the Mirror around a new barge at its Noo-la fish farm in Clio Channel during an Oct. 26 tour. The barge - which includes accommodations for workers and various industrial aquaculture facilities - is the second built by the company in as many years. \"We've just built two $2 million feed barges,\" said Rocky Boschman, managing director of Grieg Seafood BC, which is part of the Norwegian multinational Grieg Group. \"We do that because we believe there's a place for us here on a long term.\" The barge includes a remote feeding system with underwater video cameras that allow technicians to observe fish behavior and adjust the flow of food accordingly. \"Fish, when they're not hungry, they tend to school,\" Boschman said, pointing to a screen that showed hundreds of fish moving in a chaotic pattern. \"Those fish are all hunting.\" Environmental monitoring manager Bogdan Vornicu also noted that microscopes on the Noo-la barge are connected to the Internet, so that biologists can examine samples of materials such as plankton remotely. The company is trying to position itself as a leader in \"precision farming,\" with instruments tracking oxygen levels in the water and other data, said Boschman. The goal is to predict ocean dynamics. \"[The sensors] are all feeding into a common database,\" he said. Boschman hailed the barge as an example of aquaculture investing in local business. He produced a list of some 22 vendors from the Campbell River area involved in the project, ranging from building contractors to high-tech firms to office services. \"Everywhere possible, we utilize local companies,\" he said. The residential area of the barge includes 12 bedrooms and a shared living area featuring an open-concept kitchen, fireplace and big-screen television. Workers at the facility - who spend eight days on-site before returning to their homes for six days - seemed impressed with the new accommodations. \"It's like a resort coming out here,\" said one worker, a Campbell River resident in his 20s who declined to provide his name for privacy reasons. The company was showcasing its investments as the provincial government imposes new regulations on a controversial industry. Starting in 2022, fish farm operators must have the consent of First Nations whose territories they're operating in. The Grieg facilities in Clio Channel are the result of a partnership with Tlowitsis Nation, whose traditional territories include waters in the Georgia Strait from Telegraph Cove to just west of Sayward. Boschman said the aquaculture industry is working hard to develop positive relationships with First Nations, although he said that formal agreements aren't in place for all Grieg operations. \"We absolutely recognize that they are the right holders,\" he said. \"We look forward to learning and growing and making these relationships even stronger.\" John Smith, the elected chief of Tlowitsis Nation, said that rental fees and revenue from fish harvests provide a stable source of funds for the community. \"We're very pleased with the agreement,\" he said, saying the partnership with Grieg is positive. \"They do a lot to make our relationship strong and happy.\" Smith said the operation has the support of hereditary chiefs from his community, although he acknowledged that some band members oppose fish farms. Also under the new regulations, the federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) will have to vouch that fish farm operators aren't harming wild salmon. Critics of the industry have said that fish farms discharge harmful materials into the ocean, spread sea lice and disease among wild fish, and allow Atlantic salmon to escape, posing risks to wild stocks. And while Boschman objected to the claims of environmentalists who want fish farms removed from B.C. waters, he said the company is also trying to reduce its ecological impact and avoid harming wild fish. \"Grieg Seafood has a responsibility to do this in a way that does not damage wild salmon,\" he said.

The site of the launch was Terryland Farms Inc., a 1,000-acre dairy farm east of Ottawa in St-Eugene, the last community along Highway 417 at the Quebec border. And for good reason. Eleven years ago, Terryland became the first Ontario farm to sell electricity converted from cow manure to the grid, and has since expanded to generating more power - and additional income - from solar panels. It's been just one of the ways modern farmers, including those in the Ottawa Valley, have gone green. George Heinzle, 56, who runs Terryland with his 52-year-old wife, Linda, and their 31-year-old son, Terry (for whom the farm is named), knew about the potential of animal dung. His native Austria introduced biodigesters to produce energy from excrement back in the 1970s. In 2006, Heinzle built his own biodigester, in which manure from his 300 head of cattle, along with liquid waste he receives from foodprocessing plants in the Montreal area, are placed into a 1,000-cubicmetre, oxygen-free tank fitted with heating coils that keep the temperature inside at 40 C. \"It's sort of like a big cow stomach,\" explains Heinzle, who immigrated to Canada 36 years ago and bought the land for his farm a year later. \"The food that cows eat is not completely digested, so we break the manure down further with bacteria to create methane gas, or biogas, that we collect and run through generators to produce electricity.\" Fat and oil drawn from the sludge and mixed with the manure creates more gas, and, as a result, more energy - enough to provide electricity to as many as 300 homes. (It takes about 30 days to convert that gunk into biogas, which, as Heinzle points out, also eliminates most of the associated odours and doesn't smell nearly as bad as the raw manure farmers spread on their fields.) For Terryland Farms, the power-producing biodigester has resulted in an additional source of revenue beyond dairy products. The Heinzles sell the electricity generated to Hydro One at a rate of 20 cents per kilowatt hour, which adds up to an average of $20,000 per month. Solar panels on three of Terryland's five barns send electricity to the grid and provide further income at a rate of 70 cents/kWh. (That return depends on sunlight and varies from as high as $12,000 to $13,000 a month in June, to as low as $1,200 to $1,500 in December.) Heat generated from the two engines that drive the biodigester is used to heat the family home, provide hot water and to dry corn in the fall. Heinzle, who has passed Terryland's management to Terry so that he can devote his full attention to the biodigester operation, will also buy back from Hydro One electricity generated for use on the farm. However, by producing their own power, the Heinzles end up saving money on utility costs - and on fertilizers, since the biodigester also produces digestate, which provides soil with organic content and moisture retention. Terryland is so sustainable that cows sleep on pasture mats that, in a sense, they made. Undigested fibres processed by the biodigester are used for their bedding. Liberal MP Francis Drouin, whose Glengarry-Prescott-Russell riding includes Terryland and more than 300 other, mainly dairy, farms has seen agricultural producers going green in different ways. He says that some, such as the Heinzles, are using biodigesters and solar panels on their farms. Others are using dairy robots to milk their cows and allow farmers to focus more on making their operations more sustainable. Drouin has also seen more \"precision farming\" in the Ottawa Valley. Rather than fertilizing all fields, farmers are relying on soil testing which, through satellite GPS technology connected to their tractors allows them to pinpoint what rows or areas require top dressing. \"That creates a better yield and allows them to save money, which going green also allows them to do,\" Drouin says. Terryland's approach has combined self-sufficiency with environmentally friendly results. Methane escapes from manure, so by converting cow dung into biogas, Terryland reduces methane emissions, which account for one-third of farm-related greenhouse-gas emissions. Terryland is also using waste to generate electricity rather than it getting diverted to landfills. As the first Ontario farm to sell electricity, Terryland has become a trailblazer. Heinzle estimates that 15 farms throughout eastern Ontario are now converting biogas into electricity and sending it to the grid. Although it cost Terryland more than $2 million to set up the biodigester and solar panels, the farm has recouped that in revenues from electricity, and over all turns a profit through the sale of dairy products and small crops of soybeans, corn and wheat grown on the property, Heinzle says. The farm processes its own soybeans into soymeal pellets for cattle feed, rather than sending them to a mill, and extracts oil from the beans to use as tractor fuel. Terryland has found its niche as a green electricity-generating operation. But other farms of its size will need to come up with a specialty, such as blueberries or garlic, according to Heinzle. \"If you grow conventional crops, it takes up a lot of land, and the land and machinery is so expensive,\" he says. \"So smaller farms are getting squeezed out because they can't compete with larger farms that keep expanding.\" TERRYLAND BY THE NUMBERS $20,000 - Monthly average sales of biodigestergenerated electricity to Hydro One. $13,000 - Maximum June income from solar panel energy. $2M - Terryland's investment in biodigester and solar panels"}, {"title": "Grey County's third annual digital agriculture conference on Nov. 1", "article": "Agriculture innovation and technology will once again be brought to the forefront in Grey County's third annual digital agriculture conference, this time called Ag 4.0.2: The Next Big Thing.

The move impacts 71 staff located at the former Monsanto office at the University of Manitoba's Smartpark. It isn't known yet how many of the staff will be extended job offers in Calgary. German multinational company Bayer bought U.S.-owned Monsanto two years ago, but regulatory approval wasn't finalized until this summer. The two companies were not even allowed to talk to each other for much of that period. Part of the regulatory process saw Bayer divest some crop science assets to another German company, BASF. One of Bayer's first acts following regulatory approval was to decide where to locate the Canadian head office of the combined companies. Bayer's Canadian head office was already in Calgary. \"They didn't want to move ahead offering people roles without knowing where those roles would be located,\" said Trish Jordan, Bayer's public and industry affairs director. Those roles will become more defined in the next month or so, she said. The shuffle includes Jordan, who moved to Winnipeg with her family to work at Monsanto in 1996. The decision to relocate also comes as a blow to Winnipeg's reputation as the centre of the Canadian grain sector. The crop sector does not have as strong a presence in Calgary. Bayer struck a committee, including an internal real estate board, to determine where the Canadian head office should be located. A number of factors were reviewed, including company headcounts at each location, the number of employees needing to relocate, available office space, taxes, cost of living, etc. Economic development offices in Winnipeg and Calgary also duked it out. Monsanto had more employees in Winnipeg than Bayer in Calgary, but that was before Bayer had to divest assets to BASF. \"We knew it was a tough battle for us. But YES! Winnipeg put together a really impressive package to say why Winnipeg was a great choice for Bayer,\" said Dayna Spiring, CEO of Economic Development Winnipeg, which oversees YES! Winnipeg. \"We talked about Smartpark, and promoted the fact we are a leader in food research and innovation, advanced crop research and precision agriculture,\" she said. YES! Winnipeg also enlisted two top Bayer clients in Cargill and Richardson International to help convince Bayer to set up in Winnipeg. Mayor Brian Bowman telephoned the president of Bayer as well. \"We gave it the old college try, but we came up short on this one,\" Spiring said. Spiring said Calgary is hurting from the downturn in the oil sector and has a lot of vacant downtown office space right now. \"Calgary is not doing well right now. You'll see their province and the city really throw great incentives at companies because the reality is their downtown is empty,\" she said. Monsanto's name had become synonymous with genetically modified crops and evolved into a dirty word among environmental activists. But Monsanto was a major force in modern agriculture, particularly with its invention of glyphosate, the most widely used herbicide in the world today. \"It basically revolutionized agriculture,\" Jordan said. Glyphosate also allowed farmers to adopt environmentally friendly practices like no-till farming so soils didn't have to be disturbed and potentially blow away. \"We were an innovator and leader in changing agriculture and bringing science and biotechnology to crops,\" she said. Monsanto's Canadian head office has been located in the University of Manitoba's Smartpark since 2005, and it was located on Scurfield Boulevard before that. Jordan said Monsanto has been in Winnipeg at least 30 years. In about 2000, Monsanto sold off its pharmaceutical division and focused solely on crop science. Employees will have to move to Calgary before September 2019. Bayer will pick up moving costs. The announcement last week was for people largely in finance, human resources, marketing and commercial sales. It doesn't include the former Monsanto canola breeding program that accounts for another 20 employees, many of them plant scientists. That is being reviewed with a decision expected soon. Neither has a decision been made on the Monsanto office on Berry Street in Winnipeg (16 employees), the Carman research farm (nine employees) or the Headingley research farm (11 employees). That means a total of 56 employees are still waiting for a decision regarding location. The Monsanto jobs generally are high-paying jobs, with plenty of employees being professionals and having PhDs, and many who have been with Monsanto a long time, Jordan said. Bayer has more than 100,000 employees worldwide and three divisions: pharmaceutical, consumer health and crop science. Monsanto had about 22,000 employees focused entirely on crop science. bill.redekop@freepress.mb.ca"}, {"title": "Canadian Stocks Are Rising In Cautious Trade - Canadian Commentary", "article": "The Canadian stock market is up slightly in early trade Tuesday, after ending the previous session with a slight loss.

Sensing4Farming provides crucial insights about crop health to farmers, agronomists and agribusinesses via computer, mobile phone or tablet to optimize agriculture productions. Sensing4Farming utilizes data from DigitalGlobe's multispectral, high-resolution satellite imagery, which reveals information that cannot be seen by the human eye about vegetation health, such as plant age and chlorophyll concentration. Ground-based sensors deployed in crop fields by Qampo also provide data for Sensing4Farming, such as soil moisture, temperature, humidity and other agroclimatic parameters to complement the satellite imagery. These sensors are connected through Vodafone's narrow-band IoT (Internet of things) network to quickly send data to the SITI4Farmer agriculture software platform, a cloud-based farming management system built by ABACO, a leading company focused on developing software solutions for remote monitoring of land use. GMV, a multinational technological business, processes and manages these different data sources through its WinEO service. Artificial intelligence algorithms analyze the ground- and space-based data, extracting information that enables farmers to make decisions with confidence, know when and where to water or fertilize crops, when to pro-actively protect crops from pests and blight, and when is the right time to harvest. These actions ultimately lead to higher crop yields and increased efficiency for farms. Emilio Moro Winery in Valladolid, Spain, is the first Sensing4Farming customer. The 127-year-old winery aims to create a more sustainable farming program by using less water, fertilizer and energy while increasing its grape harvests and quality. \"Sensing4Farming will put critical geospatial insights directly in the hands of farmers,\" said Amy Minnick, DigitalGlobe senior vice-president and general manager of commercial. \"DigitalGlobe's industry-leading commercial imagery will provide valuable insights for agribusiness owners looking to integrate the latest IoT technology to increase their efficiency and crop production.

It's an exercise that's meant to help residents get to know the candidates better and to get a firm sense of where they stand on important issues facing our city. Our survey was broken into three parts: City issues, ward-specific questions, and an 'about you' section. Candidates appear in alphabetical order and surveys were completed and returned to this newspaper by Sept. 7. Read, below, about Barrhaven (Ward 3) and what the ward's candidates have to say. Ward 3: Barrhaven Population (2016): 58,269 Households (2016): 21,259 Votes cast/eligible in 2014: 11,638/33,767 (34.47 per cent) Area: 26.1 sq. km. Boundaries: Barrhaven is bounded on the west by Hwy. 416. The boundary is generally along Fallowfield Road on the north, then turns south along Woodroffe Avenue, west on Strandherd Drive, then south to the urban boundary, mostly along Jockvale Road and Longfields Drive. Jan Harder has been the councillor here for 21 years. She swept easily past two opponents in 2014, taking more than 75 per cent of the vote. This time around, she is running against four new challengers. Atiq Qureshi works in income tax consulting, Hadi Wess is the former president of the Student Federation of the University of Ottawa. Franklin Epape teaches at La Cite collegiale and is president of the board of Cooperation Integration Canada. Also running is Ahmad Malgarai. Franklin Epape Franklin Epape, candidate for Ward 3 - Barrhaven CITY ISSUES 1. Taxes. Are they too high? Just about as high as they should be? Not high enough for the city we wish we had? Just about high as they should be for now: I'm not for tax increase, but for tax freeze, we need to pay the same amount we are paying now, not a dollar more. 2. Given the option, should the city allow private pot stores? If so, in what way should the city restrict where stores can operate? The bill on cannabis has already received royal ascent and will come into effect in October 2018. This is a product of negotiations between the federal and the provincial governments. That said, the city ends up dealing with the majority of consequences. The city should definitely play a bigger role in regulating the commercialization as well as the consumption of the products. As a councillor, I will be advocating for an intensive education on the use of cannabis based on scientific evidence. As challenging as that law can be, the city council should also use it as an opportunity to provide to the most vulnerable of our constituencies social marketing training that will help them develop capacities for assertive choices 3. There are more than 10,000 people on the waitlist for affordable housing. The city has a 10-year homelessness plan with a lofty goal of ending chronic homelessness. Is this plan enough? Should the city be doing more? If so, what actions should the city take? Let us be clear, this is a direct result of the city's poor housing policy and also a consequence of the close ties between city councillors and developers. That's why we need councillors that will make delivering affordable housing to those who are the most in need a priority. The city has received an upgrade on housing and homelessness in March which revealed (sic) the city record spike in homeless families at the midpoint of that plan with an average of almost 1200 person staying at shelter each night in Ottawa just last year. (Sic) Clearly something are to be correct in the way this plan is conducted. 4. What should the city do to slow down traffic in neighbourhoods? Put more signs and speed bump and why not camera on the schools areas where drivers are reported to drive above the limit. 5. Where should the city extend LRT first after Stage 2? Kanata or Barrhaven? Barrhaven. 6 What should the city do to get more people using their green bins, beyond allowing plastic bags? Communication. 7. Should council support opening more supervised injection sites in Ottawa? Yes. 8. Should homeowners not connected to the city water and sewer network be forced to pay an additional fee for stormwater services, as council enacted this term? No. 9. Are you happy with the snow clearing operations for roads, sidewalks and paths? If not, what should be done to improve the winter maintenance program? No. There is a paradox with the city. 10. Did council make the right decision to allow the Salvation Army to build a new shelter and social services complex in Vanier, replacing its facility in the ByWard Market? Yes. 11. Do you believe community design plans should be set in stone? No. 12. Should a women's bureau be created for city hall? Why or why not? Definitely. It is unbelievable that in a great city such as Ottawa women are still not having equal salary for equal service. It is important that the city takes a lead on that file by applying a progressive approach by applying the policy of equal service, equal salary to its female workers. Not only do I support the idea but I will also be working hand to hand with numerous stakeholders to advance that agenda. We need more women at the table of decision. The gender representation at the city level needs to change. 13. What's been the greatest success of the current council over the past four years? In partnership with the people and communities of Ottawa, Ottawa Public Health improves and advocates for health and wellbeing through prevention, promotion and protection. The local opioid crisis: OPH's response was multi-pronged and sought to support, which sought to increase communication between agencies and alert the public of increases in suspected drug overdose-related emergency department visits. 14. What's been its greatest failure? The Finance and Economic Development Committee provides direction on strengthening financial and administrative practices, identifying corporate goals, and providing guidance on economic development issues, yet we are still not able to diversity our economics and attract more investors. YOUR WARD 1. What are the two most important issues in your ward? Why? Tax increase: We propose a freeze on property tax, water and wastewater fees, the city has to find an alternative way to finance. Transport and Transportation : Ensure affordable public transportation and more buses in our ward during various times of the day. We need to ensure cyclists and pedestrians have good traffic signs and encourage people to do both at peak times of the day. But for people to commute more often, we need to improve the quality of our transit service. Right now, users are reported to be fed up and route No. 95 is absolutely unreliable. This needs to change. 2. If you are the incumbent, what ward-specific decision made by council in the last term are you most proud? N/A. 3. What ward-specific decision do you wish council had dealt with better? Police say they're concerned about the number of shootings in the area and how disputes are being handled by people between the ages of 18 and 24, who are more often resorting to violence and using guns. The police need more staff for sure, but also need to get close to the community to regain community thrust. All this needs to be included in the police budget. 4. Do you live in the ward in which you're running? If not, what's your interest in the area? I have lived in the ward for almost 10 years. ABOUT YOU 1. If the election were held tomorrow, which mayoral candidate would get your vote? It's really hard to say but it will be Jim Watson for now. 2. Are you, or have you been, a member of any political party? Yes. 3. Have you ever donated to a political campaign? If so, to whom? (The candidate did not answer.) 4. How often do you use OC Transpo services? It depends, once a week or once every two weeks 5. Do you own a bicycle? If so, how often do you use it and for what purpose? Yes IN SUMMER. Jan Harder Coun. Jan Harder CITY ISSUES 1. Taxes. Are they too high? Just about as high as they should be? Not high enough for the city we wish we had? Residents have made it clear that they want their municipal tax dollars spent in a responsible manner that sees core services (i.e. snow removal, roadside maintenance, emergency services, etc.) delivered in a timely manner. As a taxpayer, I have always been supportive of efficiencies that save you money while providing the optimum services. It is no secret that Nepean believed in reserve accounts for \"rainy\" days and \"pay as you go\"! If our bank account of your tax dollars ends up with a surplus at the end of the year, I say we put it in the bank just like we did in Nepean because as you know \"rainy\" days do come along. This next term, the city will build a new Official Plan (this is Ottawa's future guiding document), Transportation Masterplan, Development Charges Bylaw and Infrastructure Masterplan. These very important documents will direct how we grow, how we spend the money we take in and how we alter the priorities of the city. My time on council has given me the experience to be a leader in shaping these policy documents and ensuring Barrhaven is well represented for the future. It takes experience to manage a corporation with a budget of more than $3 billion. I will continue to support predictable, responsible and reasonable taxes. 2. Given the option, should the city allow private pot stores? If so, in what way should the city restrict where stores can operate? With the impending legalization of cannabis, the city has to be ready to respond and allow for private pot stores. However, we don't have the information we need nor the funding to be ready for the legalization of cannabis. That's why Mayor Watson and I asked staff to prepare options that could include an online survey and other public consultation outreach; I hope you will provide your input. Once we gather the information, the city will submit feedback to the Ontario government, including possible retail locations and an analysis of the implications of any proposed \"opt-out\" option for municipalities. Our Cannabis Steering Committee will provide council and the public with the information required and determine if we have any jurisdiction over the federal ruling on cannabis by October 17, 2018. Ottawa Police and Paramedic Services, Public Health, Planning and Economic Development, and Ottawa Bylaw will play key roles in making sure we are ready! I am committed to ensuring that the sale of cannabis is done in a responsible and safe manner. 3. There are more than 10,000 people on the waitlist for affordable housing. The city has a 10-year homelessness plan with a lofty goal of ending chronic homelessness. Is this plan enough? Should the city be doing more? If so, what actions should the city take? Homelessness continues to be on the rise across Canada. In Ontario, municipalities are responsible for the maintenance and construction of affordable housing. Across the municipal sector in Canada, affordable housing and a goal to end homelessness are common themes. Here in Ottawa we know that all people deserve healthy places to live with good transit and city services. It is a very complex issue. Over the years we have developed a solid plan to build new units and to rehabilitate older ones while investing about $16 million annually in these efforts. There are a variety of planning tools that are used to ensure affordable housing is made available. One such approach is inclusionary zoning, which is a new tool; however, as it's new, I don't think it is quite proven at this point as the optimal approach to address the gaps in affordable housing. We look to the federal and provincial governments to commit funding, such as through the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation. Along with Mayor Watson, I met with Ontario's Minister Municipal Affairs & Housing, Steve Clark, on August 19th to discuss affordable housing challenges and opportunities in support of new and retrofitted units. No matter the approach, I know that my colleagues and I, as well as city staff, put a priority on getting more folks off the street and giving more families good places to live. 4. What should the city do to slow down traffic in neighbourhoods? Certainly traffic is one of the main concerns for Barrhaven residents. With 27 schools in the area, and another on the way, traffic will continue to be an issue. I have a budget of about $48k annually to spend on safety measures. Each ward has this annual funding that can be spent on speed boards, flex stakes, pavement markings and more. I am very pleased school radar zones have been approved and there will be more red light cameras installed. Many of you have picked up \"slow down\" signs from my ward office. I count on all of you to let me know when you notice trouble. School crossing guards do a fantastic job and are important part of school zone safety. Road design is also an important safety improvement factor to consider. In the newer communities we see narrower roads, parking on one side of the road and wider sidewalks as the community is being built. As part of my initiative called Building Better Smarter Suburbs program we will return to the grid road network and we can install safer crossings at the time of build out with bump outs, road texture, controlled parking and improved site lines. Density of units per hectare will lower with these measure. The best way to get more police attention is to \"make the call.\" Police activate their traffic team based on complaints/concerns. I encourage people to do so all the time. I am very pleased the new south police station, approved under my watch as a member of the Ottawa Police Service Board, is ready to be built. 5. Where should the city extend LRT first after Stage 2? Kanata or Barrhaven? LRT is coming to Ottawa. This is a major step forward for our city as a whole. With Mayor Watson, I put forward a motion to council for the allocation of funds for the LRT environmental assessment to Barrhaven. I am thrilled and committed to moving this forward and bringing LRT to Barrhaven. The assessment will look at using existing infrastructure to offset some of the costs. Barrhaven is the fastest growing area in the city and we need the right balance of sustainable infrastructure to support the growth. When the LRT reaches Baseline Station with the tunnel for LRT ready for extension to Barrhaven; I say \"do it\"! Even with LRT on the horizon, we need to continue to improve operations of our bus routes. We need more service in Barrhaven, no mistake about it! The network is important to keep people moving toward a more sustainable community. 6. What should the city do to get more people using their green bins, beyond allowing plastic bags? In 2014, I made a promise to make using the green bin more convenient. In this past term of council we made a significant change that will now allow residents to use plastic bags in their green bins starting in 2019. I am confident that this measure will significantly increase the use of this program. I want measurements of tonnage from Barrhaven to know success ... it needs to be trackable. The city needs to continue in building awareness of all diversionary services and continue to offer replacement or additional green bins. Many schools in the ward are doing a great job of educating children on waste disposal. I remember the roll-out of the blue bin close to 20 years ago, and it was the kids going home from school with the \"recycle, reduce, reuse\" theme that worked. 7. Should council support opening more supervised injection sites in Ottawa? Currently the provincial government is reviewing the supervised consumption and overdose prevention sites but it is the federal government that has the ultimate authority to approve permanent sites. In the meantime, the supervised consumption site on Clarence Street, which is managed by Ottawa Public Health, is operational. I would support increased efforts by all levels of government in the creation of more rehabilitation centres for those struggling with addition. 8. Should homeowners not connected to the city water and sewer network be forced to pay an additional fee for stormwater services, as council enacted this term? First of all there is no correlation between water and sewer charges and stormwater. There is no comparator so how is it possible to use tax money to cover costs from a specific account for something that had no relationship to it. This was about an amalgamation era taxation change that created an unfair situation across the city, including in several rural villages. Now, those who receive a service pay for that service relative to the level of service they receive. We made sure the change was phased in. Bottom line: no one is getting a free ride which was the case prior to the change. 9. Are you happy with the snow clearing operations for roads, sidewalks and paths? If not, what should be done to improve the winter maintenance program? The city puts $68 million (recommended as the \"right\" amount by KPMG in a report on snow maintenance to council) into the budget annually and sometimes we are short and sometimes we have extra. That said, we approved a policy that prioritizes snow maintenance. Unfortunately the priorities don't always work in the suburbs. To address this issue, my staff and I have formed a good working relationship with the snow teams and are in regular contact with them throughout the year. A few years back I agreed to try a few new techniques, such as flipping the order of snowplowing after each snow fall. This ensures all streets are covered and prioritized. People have responded well to the changes and think it's fair. As well there are streets where we prohibit parking on one side of the street during the winter. It is a huge benefit to quality of the plow and ability to plow. It also makes the street safer for school buses and allows access for emergency vehicles when snow is particularly heavy. Am I happy with the winter operations - sometimes I am. It really does depend on what the weather gives us. If its terribly cold and snows, if it melts and freezes, if we get a ton of snow ... well that is just another situation. I think the answer is doing exactly what I am doing and that is taking advantage of every tool I have in my snow tool kit. 10. Did council make the right decision to allow the Salvation Army to build a new shelter and social services complex in Vanier, replacing its facility in the ByWard Market? Yes, we did. The Salvation Army is not able to deliver the services needed at its present location. The new facility will have a number of social services on site that integrated will give folks who need and want help a \"leg up\". Shelter is a component of it and we capped the shelter's maximum size. 11. Do you believe community design plans should be set in stone? Community design is an ongoing process between the existing community, city and those putting forth the plans. Public consultation has proven on countless occasions to be an important tool to the development and actioning of plans. The design of a community should be informed by those most affected. I have on many occasions gone to great lengths to ensure community associations, residents, city staff and developers are informed of each other's views and create the space to come to a common understanding and decision. I have found that these efforts have resulted in applications not reaching the Ontario Municipal Board, where the city is often not the victor due to the Ontario Planning Act. I am proud that OMB cases in this city have reduced by some 70%. We work hard to facilitate good solutions between legitimate applicants and engaged communities. I will continue to ensure decisions made by councils are informed by the views and opinions of any interested residents. This has always been my commitment and one I stand by. In Ottawa we are moving away from Community Design Plans. Every time the community comes together to discuss a shared vision is time well spent. 12. Should a women's bureau be created for city hall? Why or why not? During this term on council, we agreed to explore the parameters of establishing a Women's Bureau. This is an important review and discussion as the city will be undertaking a governance review in the fall. In the meantime, I have been working with our local MPP, minister Lisa MacLeod, who oversees women's issues in Ontario, to explore opportunities that support all women and girls across the city. Stay tuned as Lisa and I will have more for you later in October and, of course, for the governance review. 13. What's been the greatest success of the current council over the past four years? LRT will be moving in Ottawa soon. This is a major step forward for our city as a whole. Along with Mayor Watson, I am excited about the allocation of funds for the LRT environmental assessment to Barrhaven. Light Rail is \"Back on Track\" for Barrhaven. I am thrilled and committed to moving this forward and bringing LRT to Barrhaven. No other community suburban or urban is the \"gateway\" to Ottawa ... only Barrhaven. 14. What's been its greatest failure? (The candidate didn't answer.) YOUR WARD 1. What are the two most important issues in your ward? Why? As the widening of Strandherd Drive has begun from Home Depot to Costco with a VIA overpass this year and Barnsdale Interchange has been prioritized by the city, my focus for infrastructure moves to delivering LRT to Barrhaven. My motion supported by Mayor Watson for a $400K environmental assessment is the first step in this process. I am committed to delivering LRT to Barrhaven in an expedited manner. I made sure Barrhaven's Citigate Prestige Business Park (surrounding Costco) would be home to 7,000-10,000 professional jobs. Priority is to FILL IT! We will then truly realize our Live, WORK, Play community that I have been working so hard to fulfill over these years. 2. If you are the incumbent, what ward-specific decision made by council in the last term are you most proud? I am most proud of the fact that Barrhaven is on the minds of all members of council. Funding for environmental assessments at our VIA crossings, including Fallowfield/Woodroffe plus the Transitway and for a pedestrian underpass at the Jockvale crossing, were approved by council. I'm also pleased to know we have $2 million in road improvement and safety measures coming to Greenbank Road between Fallowfield Road and Hunt Club Road. In this last term, I had the support of council to see 1/3 of the Master Transportation Plan budget to go to Barrhaven. People are amazed at how much Barrhaven has matured over the years. Barrhaven is the No. 1 pick of people on the move. We are blessed with our sports facilities, indoor and outdoor, and I do my best to enhance them whenever possible. If you live in Barrhaven, or play in Barrhaven, you will probably have noticed the new stadium seats at Quinn's Pointe fields at Minto Rec or the time clocks at Walter Baker for hockey and ringette users. 3. What ward-specific decision do you wish council had dealt with better? I think we need to invest more in road maintenance such as roads being painted, which is an easy safety measure that is needed across the city. A few years ago, the federal government made the decision to legislate a new environmentally friendly paint for use on all roads. Unfortunately this road paint is not as effective and wears down quicker. We need to look at new options to ensure road markings are visible. I asked staff to make sure all our lines were painted before school started. With 27 schools in Barrhaven, it is a priority for me, too. Road safety has always been a priority for me. 4. Do you live in the ward in which you're running? If not, what's your interest in the area? I have raised my five children and now grandchildren for over 30 years in Barrhaven and have been proud to represent Barrhaven for over 21 years. BarrhavenJAN is who I am. ABOUT YOU 1. If the election were held tomorrow, which mayoral candidate would get your vote? Jim Watson. With Jim, I've been able to realize many of the issues and concerns facing Barrhaven residents. We have worked well with other levels of government in getting things done for Barrhaven, including prioritizing the interchange at Barnsdale and Hwy 416, LRT for Barrhaven as well as supporting my initiatives at the NCC Greenbelt Research lands on Woodroffe across from the NCC gates ... on Precision Agriculture (field to fork process), autonomous vehicles, and super fast delivery of rural connectivity ... leading edge; folks...that's what it is! ... Jim is an excellent mayor. He always puts Ottawa first and works very hard to keep Council on track. He is accountable and predictable and he certainly has my vote. 2. Are you, or have you been, a member of any political party? The great thing about municipal politics is that it's non-partisan. Candidates run on their convictions in service of residents. As a councillor, I've worked with all levels of government and political stripes to get things done for Barrhaven. So much of this job is about building bridges and finding common ground. 3. Have you ever donated to a political campaign? If so, to whom? I have supported those who I know will do their best for their electorate and I will continue to do so. 4. How often do you use OC Transpo services? I use OC Transpo a number of times a month. The O-Train also makes for an affordable day trip to downtown with my grandchildren. It was their first \"train\" experience. 5. Do you own a bicycle? If so, how often do you use it and for what purpose? I do. My children and grandchildren got it for me for Mother's Day a few years ago. I use it for recreational purposes which is why I am so excited about the almost completed Woodroffe multi-use pathway. Ahmad Malgarai Ahmad Malgarai, candidate for ward 3, Barrhaven CITY ISSUES 1. Taxes. Are they too high? Just about as high as they should be? Not high enough for the city we wish we had? Taxes are too high. 2. Given the option, should the city allow private pot stores? If so, in what way should the city restrict where stores can operate? Regulating marijuana dispensaries would be a huge challenge for the city in the months to come. However, the city needs to create a special license category for cannabis-related businesses, including dispensaries. The rules must create a system to consult the community before granting licenses, prohibit dispensaries from operating within 300 meters of schools, universities, colleges, community centres, religious sites or other dispensaries. 3. There are more than 10,000 people on the waitlist for affordable housing. The city has a 10-year homelessness plan with a lofty goal of ending chronic homelessness. Is this plan enough? Should the city be doing more? If so, what actions should the city take? The city's 10-year homelessness plan is not enough to really address the increased demand. We have a demand for more affordable housing in Ottawa and it's only going to get worse. There are currently more than 10,000 files with active statuses on the waiting list for subsidized housing in the city. In addition, there are over 5,000 files that have been archived. These archived files have the potential to become reactivated by the applicant within a 12-month period. The city needs a plan to cost out and allocate the needed resources, financial and non-financial, to effectively meet the targets assigned to the next five years of our city's 10-Year Plan. The city needs to work closely with federal and provincial partners to ensure flexible use of program funding in new and innovative ways in order to respond to the needs of our community. The city needs to focus on inclusionary zoning as a tool to improve the supply of affordable housing units in Ottawa, and the city needs to double the rent supplement program across all Ottawa neighbourhoods. 4. What should the city do to slow down traffic in neighbourhoods? The most cost-effective ways to slow down traffic in neighbourhoods are: A) Lower speed limits: the obvious place to start slowing cars is on the streets which children prefer to bike and play, elderly people stroll, and dogs are walked. Posted limits, reduce tools including the use of radar signs, photo radar and spot checks. B) Better street design: narrower vehicle lanes and streets, sidewalk bulb-outs, raised pedestrian crossings and speed bumps are ways to slow the speed of traffic and can each be used depending on the traffic volume and road conditions. 5. Where should the city extend LRT first after Stage 2? Kanata or Barrhaven? LRT is the single largest infrastructure project in Ottawa's history. I support extending Ottawa's light rail transit (LRT) system to Barrhaven around the same time as the Kanata extension. It is time for Barrhaven to get its fair share of city funding. 6. What should the city do to get more people using their green bins, beyond allowing plastic bags? Waste and how we deal with it is a growing issue in the city and across Canada. Waste is a problem that we all face and we all have a role to play in its solution. The city can add additional recycling bins to public areas, and through workshops teach recycling to students and their parents. However, the most effective way would be to be rewarded for recycling by creating an incentive program. The incentive program should reward people for recycling. When people recycle, they are rewarded with points that can be redeemed for coupons or discounts when they are buying compost bags at different stores. 7. Should council support opening more supervised injection sites in Ottawa? I support supervised injection sites (SIS) in Ottawa. The supervised injection sites help reduce the amount of public drug consumption in places like public washrooms, parks and other facilities commonly used by ordinary residents. I believe a person may have a substance use problem, but he/she are still a human being. Opponents say supervised injection sites will encourage addiction and discourage treatment, despite mounting evidence to the contrary. Supervised injection sites are facilities where people can use clean needles to inject drugs under the supervision of medical personnel, who can revive them in case of an overdose. Site users also have access to wound care, HIV education and referral to addiction treatment. 8. Should homeowners not connected to the city water and sewer network be forced to pay an additional fee for stormwater services, as council enacted this term? If a homeowner's pipe that carries stormwater from their property is connected into the city's sewer system, then the homeowners should pay for the service. Otherwise they should be exempt from paying the additional fee. 9. Are you happy with the snow clearing operations for roads, sidewalks and paths? If not, what should be done to improve the winter maintenance program? Snow removal services, despite being over-budget, are not able to meet the city's own service-level targets. A possible solution would be to switch to a higher proportion of contracted plowing. 10. Did council make the right decision to allow the Salvation Army to build a new shelter and social services complex in Vanier, replacing its facility in the ByWard Market? I believe the planning committee made the wrong decision. It's clear the desires of residents of Vanier were generally acknowledged, but not respected. However, homelessness is a serious social problem and the city should provide support for the city's most vulnerable residents. I support a broader discussion about the city's approach to homelessness. 11. Do you believe community design plans should be set in stone? No. Each community is unique and has distinct opportunities and challenges for managing change. 12. Should a women's bureau be created for city hall? Why or why not? I support a women's bureau. I agree that we do need more women in the higher reaches of municipal administration. As a community we all wish there are as many women on council as there are on other city departments. But this is not the fault of city council. This is a societal problem, one that rests on voters of this city and the choices they make. If voters desire more women in government offices, let's vote them in from diverse communities. Until the creation of a women's bureau, I support a resolution to demand that at least one-third of all city boards and committees be made up of women from diverse background. 13. What's been the greatest success of the current council over the past four years? The city council is getting better at working together, however there are some exceptions. 14. What's been its greatest failure? The council's biggest failure is that no council members are willing to ask the hard questions that need to be asked. Questions regarding property taxes being increased at unsustainable rate, reduced transparency, lack of competent management, and lack of fiscal discipline remain unasked and unanswered. If one visits a facility being run by the city, it is likely that the infrastructure is some varying state of disrepair. Furthermore, our streets are almost always in a sad state year-round. Snow removal services, despite being over-budget, are not able to meet the city's own service-level target. These, among others, are issues that I wish to address as a council member for the city of Ottawa. YOUR WARD 1. What are the two most important issues in your ward? Why? Issue 1: Residents of Ottawa are facing a property-tax hike that is increasing at a rate which is not sustainable for working families with small children, people with disabilities and seniors on fixed incomes. Strong fiscal management is one of my top priorities. Better oversight and transparency of infrastructure projects with an intent to reform the city's procurement process with priorities given to local companies, focus more on essential services that the city delivers, and putting a stop to wasteful expenditure. The reality is that the only way change comes is when you lead by example, if elected I will refuse a pay raise and return the council allowance to city treasuries. Also I will be donating 10 per cent of my salary to help eradicate poverty and homelessness in Ottawa. Issue 2: Barrhaven is one of the fastest growing and diverse wards, with a number of challenges such as biweekly garbage pickup, poor infrastructure and recreational facilities, and overcrowded schools. My commitment to you is that I will make sure that your tax dollars are not wasted. I believe our best days are still ahead of us if we use our resources properly. I will work closely with small and large businesses to help bring jobs for our residents and revenues to our tax base. I will support police, paramedics and firefighters to insure our children can live in safe crime-free neighbourhoods. I will represent you in the way you have come to expect. 2. If you are the incumbent, what ward-specific decision made by council in the last term are you most proud? N/A 3. What ward-specific decision do you wish council had dealt with better? The Salvation Army's planned move to Montreal Road. 4. Do you live in the ward in which you're running? If not, what's your interest in the area? I have lived in Barrhaven for a long time. I plan on living in Barrhaven with my family for the rest of my life and I continue to want to play an active role in making sure Barrhaven is a great place for the children of our community as they grow. ABOUT YOU 1. If the election were held tomorrow, which mayoral candidate would get your vote? It's too early; I would give all mayoral candidates the opportunity to present their platform until the last day of campaign 2. Are you, or have you been, a member of any political party? No. 3. Have you ever donated to a political campaign? If so, to whom? No. 4. How often do you use OC Transpo services? I take the bus to work and school twice a day! 5. Do you own a bicycle? If so, how often do you use it and for what purpose? Yes. I bike every day. Atiq Qureshi Atiq Qureshi, candidate for Ward 3 - Barrhaven CITY ISSUES 1. Taxes. Are they too high? Just about as high as they should be? Not high enough for the city we wish we had? Yes they are a bit higher than other cities in Ontario. 2. Given the option, should the city allow private pot stores? If so, in what way should the city restrict where stores can operate? No, but we can allow consumer sites only i.e. License Cannabis Cafe. Where those who want to enjoy can go and that's it. No cannabis on roads and streets. 3. There are more than 10,000 people on the waitlist for affordable housing. The city has a 10-year homelessness plan with a lofty goal of ending chronic homelessness. Is this plan enough? Should the city be doing more? If so, what actions should the city take? It should be prioritized as per lower house hold income and younger children and moved on, it should be increased by 10 per cent annually. 4. What should the city do to slow down traffic in neighbourhoods? Better town planning for future communities and with existing plan we need to put visible speed limits signs. Residential areas preferably at 30 km/hr 5. Where should the city extend LRT first after Stage 2? Kanata or Barrhaven? Being from Barrhaven, I will definitely support Barrhaven but, since it is been removed from LRT plan back in 2006 and never been on desk, Kanata section looks less time taking. We can have an alternate plan for Barrhaven, without disturbing its current infrastructure, which is less cost effective. We have to sit with VIA Rail and use that track for residents. 6. What should the city do to get more people using their green bins, beyond allowing plastic bags? We need to sit with school boards, we must have mandatory recycling subject in school. This will create a habit among young ones which eventually turn into clean city. For adults who do not contribute towards that we have no choice except surcharge. 7. Should council support opening more supervised injection sites in Ottawa? Yes, for life saving option only not to fulfill their desire. 8. Should homeowners not connected to the city water and sewer network be forced to pay an additional fee for stormwater services, as council enacted this term? If storm water effects are specifically being taken care by city in that area than as regular sewer than, yes. 9. Are you happy with the snow clearing operations for roads, sidewalks and paths? If not, what should be done to improve the winter maintenance program? No, it required scrutiny of contracts given and bring in more affordable contractors. We observed less/bad snow removal cost life & property of residents. We require additional budget for this, nothing should be more important than a life and property of residents. 10. Did council make the right decision to allow the Salvation Army to build a new shelter and social services complex in Vanier, replacing its facility in the ByWard Market? Decision is right as Salvation Army needs more space but we should address the issues of residents too, there should be some compensation for them i.e. reduction in city taxes. 11. Do you believe community design plans should be set in stone? No, it badly need revision. 12. Should a women's bureau be created for city hall? Why or why not? Yes, not a bad idea. There are a lot issues where women do not express themselves as they should be, they do not find in a comfortable position among men. Also, to my experience women tends to be better administrator to accomplish the tasks as per guidelines. 13. What's been the greatest success of the current council over the past four years? For me, only LRT at last. 14. What's been its greatest failure? Town planning, it needs a lot improvement. YOUR WARD 1. What are the two most important issues in your ward? Why? A) A change to the water flow plan by the city. People are concerned that water can flow into their backyards or seep into the ground and can affect their basements. It is at Cedarview Road. The same community is also facing issues related to high voltage power lines passing through their backyards - a sever health & life risks. B) We need to ease the traffic at Fallow field & Woodroffe Avenue, Under passes at railway crossing there, are necessary. GOD knows what's the result of 2014 study about it is, which was very highly projected by sitting Councillor but went in any city bin. I will revive it & do best to bring it in reality. 2. If you are the incumbent, what ward-specific decision made by council in the last term are you most proud? N/A. 3. What ward-specific decision do you wish council had dealt with better? Widening of Greenbank Road 4. Do you live in the ward in which you're running? If not, what's your interest in the area? Yes. ABOUT YOU 1. If the election were held tomorrow, which mayoral candidate would get your vote? May be, Jim Watson 2. Are you, or have you been, a member of any political party? Better not to say. 3. Have you ever donated to a political campaign? If so, to whom? Yes, Better not to say. 4. How often do you use OC Transpo services? About once a month. 5. Do you own a bicycle? If so, how often do you use it and for what purpose? No. Hadi Wess Hadi Wess, candidate for Ward 3 - Barrhaven CITY ISSUES 1. Taxes. Are they too high? Just about as high as they should be? Not high enough for the city we wish we had? Ottawa is for sure known to have some of the highest municipal tax rates in the country. Throughout my consultation with residents, many have mentioned that they do not mind paying taxes; however, they feel that they do not receive city services the way they deserve. Given the amount of municipal taxes they pay, the urge for better quality and delivery of city services is definitely a main concern. 2. Given the option, should the city allow private pot stores? If so, in what way should the city restrict where stores can operate? The decision of legalizing pot in Canada is majorly a federal issue, therefore city council does not mainly make decisions with regards to that. On the other hand, should pot stores be allowed, the city should enforce a code of conduct with bylaws on how this new industry should be heavily regulated, including rules and regulations that keep stores away from areas highly frequented by the underaged population (e.g. away from schools and daycares). It is also crucial that the city works closely with provincial and federal governments to ensure these policies are followed by having regular checkups on cannabis retail shops. This will assure the safety of our community and will prevent users who can't purchase cannabis online to turn to illegal channels of cannabis distribution. 3. There are more than 10,000 people on the waitlist for affordable housing. The city has a 10-year homelessness plan with a lofty goal of ending chronic homelessness. Is this plan enough? Should the city be doing more? If so, what actions should the city take? There's more work to be done with regards to addressing affordable housing. Actions to improve should involve an inclusionary zoning bylaw and a rental replacement bylaw. 4. What should the city do to slow down traffic in neighbourhoods? To accomplish less traffic, infrastructure needs to be improved. This includes widening major roads, improving public transportation, increasing parking spaces, etc. It is also important to work closely with schools and community associations to implement various traffic calming measures across Barrhaven. 5. Where should the city extend LRT first after Stage 2? Kanata or Barrhaven? LRT is one of the biggest accomplishments of the City of Ottawa. By the full implementation of this project, we would have not only addressed sustainability and worked towards a greener city, but we would have also created a safer space for pedestrians and cyclists. Kanata and Barrhaven are definitely areas where the LRT should extend as soon as possible. It is difficult to tell which one deserves the LRT quicker because this service should be available to everyone. As we move into stage two of the project, some issues become evident. Considering that Barrhaven is the fastest growing community in Ottawa, with its population constantly increasing, infrastructure needs to be prioritized. In addition, the LRT project provides no clear link between affordable housing and transit. The value of houses around the LRT station areas will increase drastically leaving no room for vulnerable populations. I believe that the plan could be improved by extending LRT to Barrhaven and by setting a strategy to address affordability. When elected, I will advocate until Barrhaven and the vulnerable populations in our communities experience LRT. 6. What should the city do to get more people using their green bins, beyond allowing plastic bags? The key is sometimes in communication, and that includes having more prominent PR campaigns to encourage residents to recycle more. More education campaigns to schools, community associations and different stakeholders would strongly contribute to raising awareness to this issue. 7. Should council support opening more supervised injection sites in Ottawa? Yes. 8. Should homeowners not connected to the city water and sewer network be forced to pay an additional fee for stormwater services, as council enacted this term? No. 9. Are you happy with the snow clearing operations for roads, sidewalks and paths? If not, what should be done to improve the winter maintenance program? Snow clearing service has been an important concern to many residents in Barrhaven. The winter maintenance program could definitely use some improvement. The major solution to that is increasing the number of snow removal vehicles and increase the frequency of their presence at our neighbourhoods. Another suggestion to improve the service and ensure convenience is to avoid blocking residents' driveways while plowing. Plowing snow should include more balance between high-traffic areas and residential areas. 10. Did council make the right decision to allow the Salvation Army to build a new shelter and social services complex in Vanier, replacing its facility in the ByWard Market? No, because it's short-sided and does not address the root cause of people who experience homelessness and the housing crisis in the city. 11. Do you believe community design plans should be set in stone? Not necessarily. It's always important to follow the plan, but there are times when circumstances change and there would be a need to alter the plan. 12. Should a women's bureau be created for city hall? Why or why not? Yes, definitely. It is very important that all levels of governance and institutions actually reflect the populations they serve. According to the Ottawa Citizen, research shows that women's participation in political decision-making has positive effects on society that can help improve the lives of both women and men. The European Institute for Gender Equality confirms that these benefits include more equitable societies, inclusive governance, higher standards of living, positive development in education, health, infrastructure, and a decrease in political corruption. 13. What's been the greatest success of the current council over the past four years? To choose a single greatest accomplishment of city council would be almost impossible. From the LRT project to becoming the high-tech hub, the council has once again delivered in order to prove that the City of Ottawa is one of the best cities to live in. As a result, we see new residents daily, moving to the city in order to not only work, but also enjoy the great quality of life. 14. What's been its greatest failure? With council's accomplishments, several shortfalls have also been visible. The lack of adhering to community design plans is an important issue to shed light on. City council seems to have been behind on this initiative. This became evident when an application to redevelop Stonebridge Golf Club has been supported without the consultation of residents. It was also seen when a 65 storey building was approved regardless of its 30 storey zoning. YOUR WARD 1. What are the two most important issues in your ward? Why? LRT. Consultations proved that neighbours' concerns have been an enlightenment, but most importantly, we need to realize that Barrhaven has grown too quickly without adequate infrastructure in planning. We need to ensure that solid infrastructure is set before developing to ensure a better present and future for Barrhaven. With that being said, the Stonebridge issue has been a recent one. Development at the expense of residents isn't healthy for the community and undermines the concerns and needs of constituents. 2. If you are the incumbent, what ward-specific decision made by council in the last term are you most proud? N/A. 3. What ward-specific decision do you wish council had dealt with better? Ensuring that the environmental assessment for the LRT in Barrhaven was made ever since 2011. The assessment is still yet to be fought for and further delay only makes the possibility of experiencing LRT in Barrhaven a harder one. 4. Do you live in the ward in which you're running? If not, what's your interest in the area? As new wards were added and boundaries were changed, my house did not make the cut for Ward 3; however, I am still part of the community of Barrhaven and its priorities are mine. I am running for Ward 3 because I have experienced issues that have not been addressed in years. I have a vision, and will not rest until I provide solutions. Ward 3 could definitely use better change, a fresh perspective, and grassroots experience. I want to be the strong voice that fights for Barrhaven as a whole. ABOUT YOU 1. If the election were held tomorrow, which mayoral candidate would get your vote? (The candidate did not answer.) 2. Are you, or have you been, a member of any political party? No. 3. Have you ever donated to a political campaign? If so, to whom? No. 4. How often do you use OC Transpo services? More than once per month. 5. Do you own a bicycle? If so, how often do you use it and for what purpose? Yes. A couple of times a week on average to run some errands and for pleasure and sport."}, {"title": "Farmers Edge and Global Ag Risk Solutions Enter Strategic Alignment to Deliver Innovative Model for Crop Insurance to Farmers", "article": "This partnership is a significant step in the evolution of digital agriculture and risk management  Farmers Edge and Global Ag Risk Solutions (Global Ag), two leading Canadian agricultural companies, announced a strategic alignment marking an era of change for crop insurance. The partnership will combine Farmers Edge field-centric data with Global Ag customized insurance products, allowing farmers to manage and increase their profits, while decreasing their risk. This partnership is a significant step in the evolution of digital agriculture and risk management (Graphic: Business Wire) Each season, farmers face uncontrollable elements and large overhead costs, such as land, machinery, and labour; farmers assume the risk that their revenue might not cover expenses. This partnership provides farmers with unique solutions to protect their assets based on a predictable annual revenue stream that includes input costs, plus an additional margin. If input costs go up, so does the coverage, giving growers the freedom and confidence to farm the way they want, without being stifled by risk. Mutual customers of Farmers Edge and Global Ag, in both Canada and the US, will have access to exclusive options and services, including customized insurance products and Farmers Edge precision digital tools. These tools automatically collect, integrate, and process data from multiple field-centric sources into one platform, FarmCommand, giving farmers deep insights to make advanced management decisions and measure results. \"Farmers, who utilize Farmers Edge precision digital tools, will be able to provide Global Ag with a rich data set to develop products that are tailor-made. No two farms are alike so why should their premiums or coverage be?\" said Wade Barnes, CEO of Farmers Edge. \"We've revolutionized the way farmers utilize their data to enhance and showcase their productivity and profitability. The next logical step is for farmers to take their data, which is now backed by a unique insurance product, to their bank and use it as a tool to get access to more capital at better terms. There has never been more risk in farming; the partnership between Farmers Edge and Global Ag Risk Solutions will protect and arm farmers against that risk. There is no other industry more ripe for disruption than the crop insurance and financial services industry.\" \"We have not seen innovation in the crop insurance industry since the early 1980s,\" said Grant Kosior, president and CEO of Global Ag Risk Solutions. \"Volatile prices for inputs and commodities make it difficult to predict farm revenue from year to year. Global Ag is reshaping the crop insurance world by providing quotes tailored to a farm's past financial records. We will have access to the data we need to speed up our claims and underwriting process the day after farmers complete harvest and shut their combines off. We're giving farmers a better, faster, and more cost-effective option -- they no longer have to go with a product that doesn't meet their needs just because it's the only one available to them.\" Both companies will cross market each other's solutions and work together to develop new, dynamic customized insurance products.

The Thought Leaders' Summit was designed to get stakeholders in the plant-based protein value chain singing from the same song sheet, albeit in four-part harmony as the industry attempts to leverage the $153 million in federal funds it has to spend. That means setting aside regional differences and traditional loyalties to focus on how the four pillars of this strategy -- developing higher-protein crops, growing them, processing them and marketing them -- can advance the sector as a whole. The hype and the optimism were reminiscent of an event 22 years ago when the Manitoba Pork Advantage was launched with similar fanfare. Its goal was to rope in the investments needed to rapidly scale up hog production in the province. That goal was achieved, but it hasn't been painless and it hasn't always been profitable. Many of the assumptions guiding the decisions of the time took turns that no one in those heady early days predicted -- the availability of cheap feed following the end of export grain freight subsidies, currency fluctuations, environmental constraints, the ability to keep out disease, public trust and just plain old politics. To its credit, the PIC initiative is showing no interest in repeating history. If anything, the two-day meeting this week was as much a cautionary tale of what must be overcome as it was a celebration of the growing global demand for plant-based protein. Every step of the value chain has what speakers identified as \"pinch points,\" with the availability of skilled workers and investment capital cited as common themes throughout. In the seed-development phase, there are concerns with declining protein density in key crops. While yields have been rising in concert with global demand, the protein content in major crops such as soybeans and canola has been trending down over the past two decades, said research economist Owen Wagner of LMC International, a U.K.-based agribusiness consulting firm. Plant breeders have been chasing increased yield and oil content of these crops due to the demand for vegetable fats and the policy-driven biofuels market. The advent of biotechnology accelerated their ability to select for desired traits. \"Our feeling is that lost in that process was the consideration for protein,\" Wagner said. \"Protein became a secondary concern and that's catching up to us now in the form of these lower protein concentrations.\" Relative to the early 1990s, those declines equate to a loss of about 350,000 tonnes of canola protein for Canada and 1.5 million tonnes of soy protein for the U.S. It's worrisome because much of the increased demand for protein used in animal industry will be for poultry and aquaculture, both of which require protein-dense feeds. In the production phase, farmers' ability to take full advantage of the digital revolution is hampered by a lack of internet access in rural areas and the fact that the multiple data-collection systems aren't compatible with each other, said Rob Saik, an agrologist and digital-farming consultant. Processing technology must move from the basics to novel processes that can capture more value, which is why that link in the chain is likely to receive as much as 40 per cent of the resources the supercluster has to allocate, participants were told. As for selling what comes out of this pipeline, Carlo Dade, director of trade and investment research with the Canada West Foundation, cautioned against placing too much stock in today's market outlooks. It's a given that demand for all forms of protein will grow as population grows and incomes rise, and that Canada is well positioned to meet that demand in any form it takes. But where and how that demand manifests is subject to change. \"We are constantly shocked by how global demand shifts,\" he said. Dade cited the sudden surge in demand for chocolate by Chinese consumers as an example of why the industry, and the regulatory framework it operates within, needs to be nimble. \"We have to ready for the Chinese chocolate surprise,\" Dade said.

The Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) were signed between the Australian Space Agency, the Canadian Space Agency, and the United Kingdom Space Agency, with the three-way deal expected to help the nations develop their respective space programs and take advantage of the global industry. \"Forging international partnerships is vital to building Australia`s space industry and ensuring our businesses can compete on the world stage,\" Minister for Industry, Science and Technology Karen Andrews said Wednesday. \"These agreements with counterpart space agencies in Canada and the United Kingdom will increase opportunities to work together and share information, technology, and personnel between our nations.\" The signing of the new MoUs took place at the International Astronautical Congress (IAC) being held this week in Bremen, Germany. The IAC is an annual meeting of international space agencies and industry. The Australian Space Agency last month signed a similar MoU with the Centre National d`Etudes Spatiales (CNES), with both agencies joining forces to develop their space capabilities, particularly in the areas of operations, science, Earth observation, positioning systems, and communications. The federal government announced during the 2018-19 Budget that it would be committing AU$41 million to the creation of the Australian Space Agency. After officially launching the initiative with an initial AU$15 million in funding to \"kick-start\" its investment in May, the government announced the agency would be led by former head of the CSIRO Dr Megan Clark for its establishment and first year of operation. Clark said the signing of the agreements represented the start of the Australian Space Agency`s journey with fellow spacefaring nations. \"These signings provide a further positive contribution that cooperation in space science, research, technology, services, applications, and international governance can bring,\" she said. \"Growing existing relationships with the United Kingdom on the likes of CSIRO`s NovaSar satellite project, Airbus` Zephyr solar-powered unmanned aircraft, and Canada`s cooperation in Earth Observation with Geoscience Australia provides more opportunity to jointly identify projects like these that can be supported and developed in both countries.\" CSIRO Futures, which is the strategy advisory arm and a partner of Australia`s national science agency, recently produced a new roadmap helping to determine the direction the country`s space industry should take, highlighting that it isn`t just about putting people on the moon, rather the commercialisation of all things space. The roadmap focuses on three main areas for potential development: Space-derived services, space object tracking, and space exploration and utilisation. The space agency last week signed a statement of strategic intent with European manufacturing giant Airbus Defence and Space SAS. Airbus has had a presence in Australia for around 25 years, supplying mostly earth observation satellite imagery. Airbus in June selected Wyndham airfield in Western Australia as the first flight base for its Zephyr solar-powered unmanned aircraft. Along with military operations, Zephyrs can be used for precision farming guidance, environmental and security monitoring, and to provide internet coverage to regions of poor or zero connectivity, a statement from Minister Andrews explains. The announcement was followed by Gilmour Space Technologies also last week securing AU$19 million in funding from CSIRO`s Innovation Fund to develop low-cost launch vehicles to put small to medium-sized satellites into low earth orbit.

News editors obtained the following quote from the background information supplied by the inventors: \"The era of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) triple-frequency signals is approaching. Not only is this due to the modernization of United States (U.S.) Global Positioning System (GPS) and Russian GLObal NAvigation Satellite System (GLONASS), but also due to the emergence of other GNSS constellations including Galileo and BeiDou. Even with different frequency plans, each of the four GNSS systems may provide signals at more than three frequencies: L1/L2/L5 from GPS, L1-CDMA/L2-CDMA/L3-CDMA/L5-CDMA from GLONASS, E1/E5a/E5b/E6 from Galileo, and B1/B2/B3 from BeiDou. \"Triple-frequency signals for different GNSS systems are generalized as GNSS-L1, GNSS-L2 and GNSS-L5, as listed in FIG. 1. As depicted, GPS L1, Galileo E1, BeiDou B1 and GLONASS L1-CDMA are represented as GNSS-L1. Similarly, GPS L2, Galileo E5b, BeiDou B3 and GLONASS L2-CDMA are represented as GNSS-L2. Additionally, GPS L5, Galileo E5a, BeiDou B2 and GLONASS L5-CDMA are represented as GNSS-L5. Three types of wide-lane (WL) combinations can be formed as shown in FIG. 2, with the maximum wavelength of 4.57-9.77 m using GNSS-L2 and GNSS-L5, and the minimum wavelength of 0.75-0.85 m using GNSS-L1 and GNSS-L5. \"GNSS systems typically include three major components: earth-orbit satellites, ground control and tracking stations, and GNSS receivers. GNSS receivers have been used in various applications, including automobile navigation, emergency and location based services, tracking systems (e.g., for vehicles, persons, pets, or freight), marine navigations (e.g., for boats and ships), aircraft autopilot systems, real-time mapping, machine guidance at construction sites, mining, precision agriculture, land surveying, and deformation monitoring. Depending on the application, positioning accuracy requirements for the GNSS receivers may differ. For example, meter level accuracy is desirable for consumer grade receivers used for recreational and navigational purposes, while sub-meter level accuracy is desirable for mapping grade receivers for Geographical Information System (GIS) feature collection. Centimeter level accuracy is desirable for survey grade receivers. Currently there are two major GNSS precise positioning techniques used to achieve centimeter level accuracy: Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) and Precise Point Positioning (PPP). \"As an alternative GNSS precise positioning technique to RTK, PPP is defined as the state-space solution to process pseudo-range and carrier-phase measurements from a single GNSS receiver by utilizing satellite constellation precise orbits and clock offsets determined by separate means. There are three key factors for PPP: precise orbit and clock, precise error source modeling, and the use of carrier phase measurements. PPP differs from RTK from several perspectives. Firstly, PPP eliminates the spatial operation limit because it has no regional base station requirement. The determination of precise GNSS orbit and clock to support PPP requires a global reference network, but its baseline length is normally hundreds to thousands of kilometers, which differs from RTK. Secondly, error source modeling of PPP is typically more complex than RTK. RTK uses the regional base station information to generate a double-difference, in which a majority of the error sources may be eliminated. Because local base stations are typically not available, the error sources affecting GNSS navigation accuracy in PPP have to be considered, such as atmospheric effects, relativistic effects, site displacements, antenna phase center corrections, and phase wind-up effects. Thirdly, PPP is a global positioning approach because its determined position solutions are referred to a global reference frame, and the corrections to support PPP (e.g., precise orbit and clock) are globally valid. However RTK provides local position solutions relative to the local base stations especially when the base coordinates are not precisely determined. Therefore PPP may provide better long-term repeatability and consistency than RTK. PPP has several advantages over RTK, but PPP requires a long time to converge the float ambiguity in order to ensure the centimeter level positioning accuracy, so this largely limits its adoption to real-time. \"In Wang and Rothacher (2013), an ambiguity resolution method for triple-frequency geometry-free with an ionosphere-free combination for long baseline RTK was tested with real data. The data was not applicable to PPP because there was no consideration of the fractional biases for PPP ambiguities. Therefore, the triple-frequency GF IF linear combination methods discussed by Wang and Rothacher are insufficient for resolving PPP ambiguity in real world conditions. \"In Li et al. (2013), consideration of PPP ambiguity resolution with GNSS triple-frequency measurement was discussed. After fixing the L2/L5 Extra Wide-Lane (EWL) and L1/L2 WL ambiguities, the new formed ionosphere-free measurement with L2/L5 WL and L1/L2 WL carriers was applied to improve the dual-frequency NL ambiguity resolution. However, Li's final PPP fixed solution still fully relies on the dual-frequency carrier phase and NL ambiguity resolution with .about.10 cm wavelength, which is not achievable reliably within a short period of time and is not satisfactory for industry grade GNSS product development. Therefore, Li does not show how to resolve PPP ambiguity using triple-frequency methods. \"In Geng and Bock (2013), the PPP ambiguity resolution approach for GPS triple-frequencies was investigated independently, but based on their result the ambiguity fixing also needed several minutes, which failed to compete with RTK. For example, Geng summarizes that when multipath effects become stronger, the performance of triple-frequency PPP ambiguity resolution is deteriorated considerably, and the correct ambiguity resolution is at 78% of all epochs. The consideration of the ambiguity fractional bias (i.e., UPD) follows the conventional approach, in which the fractional bias is modeled as one value for each satellite. The conventional approach does not handle high measurement noise issues at triple-frequency ionosphere-free carrier phases. Therefore, the methods discussed by Geng and Bock are also insufficient for resolving PPP ambiguity in real world conditions. \"In Shen and Gao (2002), a smoothing technique was applied to improve the PPP float solution performance. However Shen and Gao apply a smoothing technique only for the code measurement. Accordingly, the prior art still fails to provide a robust triple-carrier ambiguity resolution method for PPP that is capable of rapid ambiguity resolution in a variety of noise conditions.\" As a supplement to the background information on this patent application, VerticalNews correspondents also obtained the inventors' summary information for this patent application: \"Methods and systems for performing Precise Point Positioning (PPP) ambiguity resolution using Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) triple frequency signals are described.

The Oct. 2 pitch event will feature 15 companies from as far afield as Israel, Germany and British Columbia, Canada, and as close as Middleton, Viroqua and Madison with technologies that could change how crops are grown, how livestock is raised and how natural resources are sustained. Investors from the Midwest and beyond will gather to hear each company's story and to consider investments somewhere down the line. The event has the backing of investors such as Milwaukee's Golden Angels, 4490 Ventures, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board and Open Prairie, organizations such as the Wisconsin Technology Council, and private sponsors. In a state and region where agriculture is an economic staple, the right investors want to see technologies that can advance precision agriculture, use of drones, crop rotation, robotics and animal health monitoring, to name a few. The AgTech Venture Day is one specialized example of how young companies and innovators can get their ideas in front of investors who can help turn it into reality. Another upcoming event, with a track record of success that spans decades, is the Wisconsin Early Stage Symposium. Set for Nov. 7-8 at Monona Terrace, the Early Stage Symposium has introduced upand- coming companies to prospective investors and contributed to Wisconsin's high growth economy over time. This year's event will again provide platforms for emerging companies across a wide range of sectors to pitch their ideas and business plans. Those 40 or so companies will range from firms that have raised angel or venture capital in the past to first-time presenters with little more than a compelling idea. Over time, about 600 companies have pitched at the event and the list includes its share of success stories. Past presenters include Promega (then called Promega Biotec), TomoTherapy (now Accuray), Virent, Mirus Corp., Sonic Foundry, Prodesse, NimbleGen, Nerites, Idle Free Systems, Third Wave Technologies, Stratatech, PanVera, Soft Switching Technologies, Invenra, MobCraft Beer, OnKol, HealthMyne and many more. The 2018 format includes two pitch opportunities, the Tech Council Investor Networks track and the Elevator Pitch Olympics, as well as \"Investor Intros,\" which will allow pre-selected companies brief, one-on-one meetings with targeted angel and venture investors. The deadline for applying for any or all three is 5 p.m. Sept. 28 through wisearlystage.com. The Tech Council Investor Networks track will feature about two-dozen companies from the Midwest representing an array of industries, such as advanced manufacturing, biotechnology, health care, information technology, medical device and mobile application sectors. Each will present for five minutes and earn other opportunities for mentoring and exposure. Companies or entrepreneurs selected for the Elevator Pitch Olympics will give a 90-second pitch in front of conference attendees and a panel of six to eight investors. The investors will score the presenter on a scale of 1 to 5, focusing on whether the pitch was compelling enough to arrange a follow- up meeting, and will offer immediate feedback. Companies picked for the Investor Intros will have the opportunity to meet one-onone with investors from Wisconsin and beyond. To foster this type of communication, the Investor Intros will feature pre-scheduled, 7-minute strategic meetings between investors and emerging companies. This format will resemble a \"speed dating\" exercise, allowing both parties to learn more about each other and explore potential relationships. There are many ways to approach getting young companies off the ground, from boot-strapping to the \"minimal viable product\" approach. Angel and venture capital isn't right for every company, but the process of pitching to those investors can help entrepreneurs decide what's best for them and their idea.

And for a savvy businessperson, investments in research can pay a nice dividend. \"It has been estimated that a one-time investment of $1 into fundamental research will result in a 20 per cent return on investment (ROI). That is double the return you'd expect from the 500 largest companies of New York and Nasdaq stock exchanges.\" The ROI means higher wagers, more jobs and more sales, she added. \"When you look at it from that perspective, we can say that research has to be one of the best performing investment sectors.\" To that end, the government invested $2 billion to research and development in 2016. That was followed by a record $4 billion in 2017. Some of those dollars flowed Niagara's way. She said the region is fortunate to have, in its midst, a hub of research activity being done at Brock University, Niagara College and the Vineland Research and Innovation Centre. \"These are important institutions; they do important research, and they also help drive the local economy.\" She cited the work of Dr. Michael Duncan at Niagara College, who Is in the field of precision agriculture and who, in conjunction with the government, the private sector and other tech on ways to help farmers get better crop yields at a lower cost. \"He looks at data, crop yield, terrain features ... nitrogen, and the list goes on,\" Duncan said. \"He uses this data to provide useful environment information for farmers. It's really about taking farming into the 21st century using a range of high-tech gadgets.\" Post-secondary institutions, meanwhile, are also big economic drivers themselves, she said. \"Our post-secondary institutions produce over $55 billion annually in economic activity. It supports 600,000 direct and indirect jobs (across Canada).\" And those same post-secondary institutions also account for 41 per cent of research activity. \"In 2017 alone, that was more than $13 billion in R&D,\" she said. The research focus has also made Canada a top destination for international students, and students are good for business because including themselves, family and friends, they injected $15 billion into Canada's economy, she said. \"So when you think about it, a busy floor, or in this case, a busy lab, is money in the pockets of hardworking Canadians. That is money that goes back into the economy when they shop for the next smartphone or eat out at a local restaurant.\" The St. Catharines stop was the second for Duncan in Niagara on Thursday. Earlier in the day, she visited the research centre in Lincoln."}, {"title": "Farmers Edge; Court Rules in Favor of Farmers Edge on Counterclaim Filed by Farmobile", "article": "2018 SEP 6 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Agriculture Week -- The United States District Court for the District of Nebraska (No. 8:16CV191) ruled in favor of Farmers Edge(TM) on a counterclaim filed by Farmobile under the Defend Trade Secrets Act (DTSA). The Court made the ruling after a trial involving key witnesses from both Farmers Edge and Farmobile. Among the evidence reviewed was the fact that Farmobile's founders filed patent applications and founded Farmobile merely a few weeks after they left Crop Ventures, and that the patent applications were similar to work done at Crop Ventures. The Court found that \"the factual backdrop that led to this lawsuit\" and \"the close temporal connection between the individual defendants' departure from Crop Ventures and their design and development of a competing product at least suggests trade secret misappropriation.\" Based on a detailed review of the evidence, the Court found that Farmers Edge acted in good faith in bringing a claim against Farmobile and its founders under the DTSA. Farmers Edge believes that the legal and factual support discussed in the opinion should pave the way for a successful outcome in this case. In the summary judgment granted to Farmobile earlier this year, the Court focused on Farmobile's admission that it abandoned its United States patent application because of prior art. The recent ruling in favor of Farmers Edge stated, \"this Court's finding that the allegedly misappropriated information was not secret and was known in the industry will undoubtedly be challenged and could well be reversed.\" Keywords for this news article include: Canada, Agriculture, Farmers Edge.
