Archer Daniels Midland Canada - ADM Oilseeds Plant in Missouri to Expand Storage Capacity - 1/10/2015 Local farmers to benefit from increased capacity, more efficient operations in Deerfield, Missouri DEERFIELD, Mo., Oct. 1, 2015--Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE: ADM) today announced that it is investing to create an additional 2.5 million bushels of soybean storage at the company's Deerfield, Missouri, processing plant. \"Our local farmer suppliers are a vital part of our business in Deerfield, and we hope that they will be as excited as we are about expanding our bean storage capacity here,\" said Tim Cassidy, commercial manager of the Deerfield plant. \"This gives us the opportunity to receive more soybeans from our farmer partners in the Deerfield region, and to handle those crops more efficiently. We're thrilled to be expanding our storage capacity in Deerfield, and look forward to continuing to be the destination of choice for farmers.\" Construction of the additional capacity will be complete in Q4 of 2015. About ADM Deerfield In 2011, ADM began operating the soybean processing facility at Deerfield. Today, the facility, which employs 78, purchases soybeans from local farmers, and transforms those into animal feed and vegetable oil for biodiesel. Last year, ADM spent more than $3.5 billion with farmers and other businesses in Missouri. About ADM Thompsons Limited - Precision ag systems can take your ability to analyze profits way past yesterday's cost-revenue calculations - 25/9/2015 It's been the mantra of agricultural economists, bankers and even agronomists for the past 20 years. \"Know your cost of production.\" At every podium at every conference, you can almost guarantee the question is going to get asked. How can a farmer farm successfully without knowing their cost of production? We're always told every successful corporate executive outside of agriculture knows the cost of their widgets or grommets, usually down to the last fraction of a penny. Then the question comes again: Can agriculture afford to be different? But agriculture HAS changed, especially in the past 10 to 15 years, maybe not because the idea of farming for profitability is so new (it isn't) but because farmers now have the ability to measure specific properties on the farm, from fertility levels to soil organic matter percentages to cation exchange capacity. Of course, farming has also changed because the numbers are getting so much more volatile, which puts additional pressure on farm decision-making, not just from year to year but sometimes from one week to the next. \"It's not precision ag anymore, its agronomy.\" -- Mike Wilson, Advanced Agronomy Solutions Manager, Thompsons Limited The equipment and systems used to support these decisions are far more complex than they were even five years ago, just as the complexity of our seed technologies has leapt ahead, with double- and triple-stacked traits as well as drought tolerance and above- and below-ground pest protection. It's a new universe compared to when Bt genetics first hit the market in the early 1990s. All of these things have changed the landscape in which farmers conduct business. Yet the focus in the fields still tends to be centred on productivity. How is your company rep or your ag dealer helping you drive yield? In spite of the layers and the complexity, yield remains the single most-important factor in measuring success, and some are arguing that's only because there's a comfort level that comes with yield, along the same lines of \"if it's bigger, it must be better.\" Now it's all being challenged by individuals including Mike Wilson, a certified crop adviser with Thompson's limited. For the past two years, Wilson has been building tools that can monitor measure and collate farm details into a workable program to increase profitability. \"A lot of this is still in the experimental stages,\" says Wilson, who's based at the company's Blenheim, Ont. office. \"With some of our key customers, we're starting to see some really positive results, and it's starting to confirm that we are on the right track and it is something that we're going to be able to take to the mainstream as we move forward to develop into a more encompassing program for all of our customers.\" Contrary to the perception that \"precision ag\" is something new, it really has been around for 20 years, if GPS-based yield monitors represent its beginning. The yield monitor quickly evolved towards variable-rate technology (VRT) but then developed at a much slower pace, if for no other reason than the theory of VRT was created without farmers necessarily having the ability to make full use of the data. Now that hardware exists and is being upgraded constantly, there are more growers willing to adapt to it, in spite of the steep angle of its learning curve. It's in recognition of these changes, along with multi-hybrid planter units and automated down-pressure systems, that Wilson has renamed his department \"Advanced Agronomy.\" \"It's not precision ag anymore, its agronomy,\" Wilson says, noting how it's been influenced by a number of different catalysts, from land prices to commodity price volatility, and from input costs to market demand. \"That's how we're going to farm in the future and that's how we're going to be more profitable,\" Wilson continues. \"The progressive farmer, the farmer who's in it to make money and treat it as a business, this gets their attention every time. They want to be more profitable and usually with profitability comes more bushels anyway -- we wind up being more productive as well.\" It's interesting that in the past, the two have been positioned as exclusive aspects of farming, much like oil and protein in soybeans, where you can't have high levels of both, only one or the other. Wilson believes the idea that profitability leads to improved productivity may be a starting point for the discussion. There are some fields in Ontario, he says, that are incapable of producing more than say, 125 to 150 bushels, and that no matter how much fertilizer is applied, or how high the plant densities are pushed, they can't produce more. Wilson has witnessed one field where the combination of low yield potential and high fertilizer and chemical inuts was costing the farmer $400 per acre every year. The challenge is convincing growers that in spite of combining more corn and thinking they're making more money, they may actually be losing money by doing so. What helps is Wilson's system, where there are multiple layers of data and calculations that can show land or rent prices, fuel costs, inputs and fertilizers, so the losses become easier to outline on the page or the computer monitor. Maybe the farmer can just cut back on seeding rates or drop fertilizer allotments, thereby improving per-bushel cost enough to net more per acre. It's similar to a pitch senior agronomist Dale Cowan made several years ago: stop growing corn on the headlands where the yields are at their lowest. Those numbers are just dragging down the field's average, he once said. Instead, throw down the cheapest cereal or grass seed you can find, let it grow for two or three years, and let the roots break down the compacted layers and add some organic matter to the headlands. Wilson agrees. \"If we're farming based on your farm's average, we're going to continue to produce average yields,\" he says. \"If we start creating management zones and farming the farm based on zones, then we increase profitability, because that spot of the field that only yields 125 bushels, we've been wasting money on for years. Let's save our money, or better yet, let's spend it where it's needed. That area of the field that yields 250-plus because it's the best spot on the farm and we've been fertilizing for 180 bushels, can it yield more?\" Wilson insists it can, and that with the latest upgrades in measuring nutrients and performance, farming by zones also becomes more economical. \"Now we're getting more bushels off the farm for the same amount of money, or we're getting the same bushels for less money,\" Wilson says. \"It can shake out many different ways.\" It also starts with the essential step of a yield map. Without some form of precision agriculture, decisions based on management zones are not possible. And there are some misnomers tied to this trend. Wilson has actually proved some of the systems that fall under the umbrella of \"precision ag\" may not help drive profits. The ultimate goal for Wilson is to have the recommendations from the advanced agronomy calculations match the variation in the field. If grid sampling can't match what the customer knows is happening in the field, then the information is incomplete. What has to be kept in mind is that the customer's stake in this is the biggest factor to be considered. What's changed in the last few years isn't just the layering of information that's become available. It's that we also have the means of analyzing and incorporating that information. We can look at yield zones on a map, bare-ground imagery that shows colour variation and variability, or even an elevation layer from RTK or a UAV flight, and if those components can be combined, and the customer agrees that this is the shape and condition of the field, that's the most important facet. \"Then we can start measuring more of what's happening with greater specificity, and have a stronger correlation to the results, because we're actually applying in those yield zones more accurately,\" says Wilson. \"It gives farmers a better in-depth look at each zone, and allows them to make better decisions on things they may have questioned before.\" On a much smaller scale Chris Boersma, who farms around Ridgetown, Ont., has been working with Wilson for the past year or two but has been engaged in improving his profitability since the late 1980s, when he was involved with a group called \"the Most Economical Yield.\" For Boersma, it's not a new concept; what's changed is the capacity to measure against the expectations of farmers who consider using this relatively new system. \"It's more intensive now; there are a lot more details to it and there's more paperwork involved, and a lot more to consider,\" says Boersma. \"You understand that the crop is influenced by 100 different factors and you're trying to manage 80 of them, so there's more intensity, without a doubt. But you have to be of the mind and have the resources to do it, and if a farmer doesn't have that, they're not likely to see the benefit of it.\" -- Chris Boersma, Ridgetown, Ontario area farmer Plus there's the level of the return on investment; it isn't a dollar at a time. Instead, with this management zone or Advanced Agronomy concept, the farmer is aiming to shave a few pennies here, or maybe a nickel or a dime there. But together, they might add up to dollars per acre. It's a longer-term process and it requires greater management input, but once you get started with it, the benefits only continue to grow, especially as the equipment and software continue to drive deeper for more detail. But Boersma agrees that convincing a grower that there's value in a process that might cost a dollar or two -- or more -- per acre to get started is a difficult pitch. The value of that information, generated on a 12- or 30-square-foot basis, continues to build. Added to that is the potential for measurements to become better defined, similar to being able to measure parts per million. Now there's the capability to measure in parts per billion and parts per trillion, and that's opened the door for better standards and more specific applications. As the scale continues to shrink, the value only gets bigger. \"Now because of technology, I can get the percentage return on any one product based on a number of different scenarios, without a lot of extra labour or work throughout the season,\" explains Boersma. \"That's because every implement's recording what's applied, and the combine's picking it up, and it's all reporting that if we spent $1 per acre on product A, we got $1.10 back or $1.80.\" It's not necessarily an indication of increased yield; it's a reflection of the product applied, and a return on that investment, so the correlation is much more direct. Prerequisites In some ways, Advanced Agronomy is similar to other trends where there are innovators and then early adapters. There are two primary differences, says Boersma. The first is the capital investment and the sizes of the farm play a role in that investment. Smaller farmers are less likely to be able to justify that kind of financial commitment. The second difference from other trends is the learning curve, which tends to be more vertical. \"With the technology, the equipment is data logging everything,\" says Boersma, noting that he can see a spot in the field where a spray application was missed or went awry. \"It's probably a combination of things, but everything comes together.\" Diagnosis and prediction of in-field dry-down of a mature small grain, coarse grain, or oilseed crop using field-level analysis and forecasting of weather conditions, crop characteristics, and observations and user input of harvest condition states Mewes, John J, Salentiny, Dustin M. Abstract A modeling framework for evaluating the impact of weather conditions on farming and harvest operations applies real-time, field-level weather data and forecasts of meteorological and climatological conditions together with user-provided and/or observed feedback of a present state of a harvest-related condition to agronomic models and to generate a plurality of harvest advisory outputs for precision agriculture. A harvest advisory model simulates and predicts the impacts of this weather information and user-provided and/or observed feedback in one or more physical, empirical, or artificial intelligence models of precision agriculture to analyze crops, plants, soils, and resulting agricultural commodities, and provides harvest advisory outputs to a diagnostic support tool for users to enhance farming and harvest decision-making, whether by providing pre-, post-, or in situ-harvest operations and crop analyzes. The Industry Canadian Wheat Board For 75 years, the Canadian Wheat Board has been associated around the world with the prairie farmer and the best wheat and barley in the world. Its presence in the international grain industry is as identifiable as the maple leaf, and its record has been built through the hard work that is engrained into the fabric of our country. CWB is excited to begin transitioning toward a private operating model independent of government that includes a network of strategic grain-handling assets and farmer ownership. Network of strategic grain-handling assets CWB has begun to plan the development of a network of strategic grain-handling assets for CWB-marketed grain to help secure CWB a strong position in the grain marketing supply chain. Canola Council of Canada The Canola Council is the first industry association in Canada to encompass all links in the value chain. Together, we are building on the strengths of canola, Canada's greatest agricultural success story. Our members include canola growers, crop input suppliers, grain handling companies, exporters, processors, food and feed manufacturers and governments. All sit at the same table to develop a common platform for growth. Become a member. Our mission is to advance the growth and profitability of the canola industry based on innovation, sustainability, resilience and the creation of superior value for a healthier world. Our goal is to ensure the industry's continued growth, demand, stability and success - achieving 52 bu/acre and 26 MMT by the year 2025. Read about Keep it Coming: 52 by 2025. Core funding comes from a voluntary industry levy paid directly to the Council by the three Prairie canola grower associations, processors, exporters as well as life science company contributions. See core funders. Federal budget support AG trade and investment The canola industry is pleased with the renewed commitment to market access and Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations included in yesterday's federal budget. The budget, tabled by Finance Minister Joe Oliver, included an $18.1 million increase in funding to the Market Access Secretariat as well as a renewed commitment to work towards concluding the TPP - a 12 country negotiation including key markets like Japan. \"The TPP is a tremendous opportunity for canola to have tariff free access for canola into Japan and other growing Pacific markets,\" says Patti Miller, president of the Canola Council of Canada (CCC). \"In fact, without a TPP agreement our industry will lose out on billions of increased value-added exports.\" Japan is a long standing, stable and valuable market for canola. Exports to Japan were worth $1.24 billion in 2014, comprised primarily of seed since high tariffs prevent significant oil exports. Miller's comments reflect how Australia has already secured preferential access to the Japanese canola oil market. \"Without an agreement with Japan, the Canadian canola industry will continue to face higher tariffs on canola oil than Australian exporters, so these negotiations are very important,\" says Miller. \"With 90% of Canada's canola exported as seed, oil or meal, the increased investment in the Market Access Secretariat of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada is also very positive for our industry,\" says Miller. \"We rely on the Secretariat as our partner to resolve market access issues - whether it's blackleg in China, food safety certification in Taiwan or other priorities.\" The increased funding of $18.1 million is over two years, starting in 2016/17. It will support new agricultural trade commissioners who work on market access issues abroad and support a more active role in setting international science-based standards. There were also increased resources in the budget for trade commissioners abroad, who often work closely with agricultural trade commissioners at Canadian embassies and High Commissions in export markets. \"We are also pleased to see additional funds towards market development and manufacturing tax relief that will encourage continued investment in value-added processing,\" says Miller. The budget allocates an additional $12 million to expand AAFC's AgriMarketing Program, as well as an accelerated capital cost allowance rate on machinery and equipment. The CCC is a full value chain organization representing canola growers, processors, life science companies and exporters. Keep it Coming 2025 is the strategic plan to ensure the canola industry's continued growth, demand, stability and success - achieving 52 bushels per acre to meet global market demand of 26 million metric tonnes by the year 2025. Canadian Grain Commission The Canadian Grain Commission is a federal government agency. It regulates grain handling in Canada and certifies the quality, safety and quantity of export shipments of Canadian grain. The Canadian Grain Commission is Canada's scientific research organization on grain quality.

Through unique projects and applied research activities Cigi is also working with industry to identify diverse applications for Canada's field crops. Based in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, Cigi is a one-stop shop of technical expertise and facilities uniquely housed less than one roof. Since 1972 more than 39,000 people representing grain, oilseed, pulse and special crops industries from 115 countries have participated in Cigi programs and seminars. Notes to the financials statements PURPOSE OF THE ORGANIZATION The Canadian International Grains Institute (the \"Institute\") is a not-for-profit educational organization which functions in a market development role providing information about Canada's grain, oilseed, pulse and special crops industries to international and domestic participants. In addition, the organization provides technical information and support regarding the proper utilization of Canadian grains, oilseeds, pulse, special crops and their products. The Institute was incorporated, on the recommendation of the Canadian Wheat Board and Canadian Grain Commission, on July 24, 1972 as a corporation without share capital under the Canada Business Corporations Act. As a not-for-profit organization it holds a tax exempt status under the Income Tax Act. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Canadian accounting standards for not-for-profit organizations and include the following significant accounting policies: Revenue recognition The Institute follows the deferral method of accounting for contributions. Restricted contributions are recognized as revenue in the year in which the related expenses are incurred. Unrestricted contributions are recognized as revenue when received or receivable if the amount to be received can be reasonably estimated and collection is reasonably assured. Course fees are recognized as revenue when the courses are held. Other revenues, including sundry and farmer funded check-off revenue, are recognized as revenue when received or receivable if the amount to be received can be reasonably estimated and collection is reasonably assured. Fixed assets Purchased fixed assets are recorded at acquisition cost. Contributed fixed assets are recorded at fair value at the date of contribution. Amortization is provided on a straight-line basis over the assets' estimated useful lives as disclosed in Note 5. Supplies The cost of all supplies, program materials and textbooks are expensed in the year of acquisition. Contributed services Contributed services are recorded at their estimated fair value. Contributed services consist of technical marketing support - in kind Foreign currency translation Foreign currency accounts are translated into Canadian dollars on the following basis: Monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect at the statement of financial position date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities and revenue and expenses are translated at the exchange rate in effect at the original transaction date. Exchange gains or losses on translation of foreign currency balances are included in results of operations. Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognized at fair value. The Institute subsequently measures all its financial assets and financial liabilities at amortized cost, except for investments in equity instruments that are quoted in an active market, which are measured at fair value. Changes in fair value are recognized in the statement of operations. Financial assets measured at amortized cost include cash, accounts receivable, short-term investments, and due from Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost include accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Employee future benefits Pension plan The Institute, together with other related and unrelated parties, is part of a defined benefit pension plan (Public Service Superannuation Act pension plan) that satisfies the definition of a multi-employer plan. The costs of the benefit plan are not allocated to the individual entities within the group. As a result, individual entities within the group are not able to identify their share of the underlying assets and liabilities. Therefore, the plan is accounted for as a defined contribution plan. Post-retirement and separation benefits The post-retirement and separation benefits liabilities are actuarially determined using the projected benefits method prorated on service and best estimates assumptions. Plan assets are valued at fair value. The excess of any actuarial gain (loss) is recognized directly in the statement of net assets. Internally restricted net assets The Institute has internally restricted assets to stabilize income during the transition of operations and funding arrangements, as well as anticipated future staff benefits, and lease renewal costs. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Use of estimates The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with Canadian accounting standards for not for-profit organizations requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of the revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include the liability for separation benefits and post-retirement benefits and the useful lives of fixed assets. Actual results could differ from these estimates. New accounting standards adopted in the current year The new accounting standards for employee future benefits, Part III section 3463 and Part II 3462, have been adopted by the Institute effective April 1, 2014. The new standards require all remeasurements to be recognized directly in net assets in the period they occur. Previously all remeasurements were recognized in the statement of operations. As a result of applying the standards retroactively, excess of revenue over expenses for the year ending March 31, 2014 has been reduced by $7,000. BANK INDEBTEDNESS The Institute has an operating line of credit available with the Bank of Montreal to a maximum of $400,000 bearing interest at the prime plus 1%. The line of credit is secured by a pledged investment of $400,000. As at March 31, 2015 the operating line was not in use. INVESTMENTS As at March 31, 2015 the Institute held $825,000 of investments in the form of two 12 month cashable GICs earning interest at rates between 1.05% and 1.40%, which mature between April 21, 2015 and March 30, 2016. Of these funds $400,000 is pledged to the Bank of Montreal for the availability of an operating line as disclosed in Note 3. The remaining balance along with accrued interest totalling $431,000 has been applied against the separation benefit liability at year end.

In 2013, AGT commissioned its first large-scale pulse ingredient and fractionation facility in Minot, North Dakota, focused on production of flours, proteins, starches and fibres derived from pulses for use in food ingredients and branded feed products including pet food and aquaculture. The commissioning was completed in 2014, with additional capacity added later that year. AGT Food and Ingredients Inc. Announces Second Quarter 2015 Results and Dividend REGINA, Aug 11, 2015 - AGT Food and Ingredients Inc. (TSX:AGT) (\"AGT\" or the \"Company\") has announced its financial results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015. Results include: Adjusted EBITDA* was $22.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $24.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014, and compared to $22.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015. Adjusted EBITDA* was $90.3 million for the trailing twelve months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $74.1 million for the trailing twelve months ended June 30, 2014, an increase of 22%. Adjusted earnings per share* increased to $0.45 ($0.44 fully diluted) for the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $0.44 ($0.43 fully diluted) for the three months ended June 30, 2014. Cash flow from operating activities increased to $44.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to a decrease of $12.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and compared to an increase of $38.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014. Food ingredients and packaged foods segment represented 21.5% of total tonnes invoiced and 38.5% of Adjusted EBITDA* for the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to 14.0% of total tonnes invoiced and 25.8% of Adjusted EBITDA* for the three months ended June 30, 2014. Dividend of $0.15 per share for the quarter ($0.60 per share on an annualized basis). \"This has been a good and consistent quarter for AGT. With what appears to be the return to more seasonal buying and the quarter two period reset in global pulses markets, we are pleased with how both our legacy and food ingredient and packaged foods segments are performing overall. There were limited carry-in stocks for the period, but buyers were purchasing at relatively higher margins to supply markets until the fall harvest in North America, where we are expecting significant production volumes for pulses. Harvest is underway in Canada and the U.S. and we believe the expected production levels will fuel and supply import demand in our key markets. These are positive trends in our legacy business, particularly in the traditional shipping periods ahead. Our food ingredient and packaged foods segment continues to make gains, with increased volumes, margins, earnings and percentage of AGT's sales overall. Customers are continuing to embrace our pulse ingredients and we feel this trend will advance this segment to the forefront of AGT's business, where we believe it can really show how strong these investments have been.

Cautionary Statements Non-IFRS Financial Measures *AGT provides some non-IFRS measures as supplementary information that Management believes may be useful to investors to explain AGT's financial results. These non-IFRS measures include Adjusted Gross Profit* (gross profit plus depreciation in cost of sales and finance income), Adjusted EBITDA* (earnings before finance expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, restructuring costs and any effects of non-cash, non-recurring and other costs and foreign exchange adjustment), Adjusted Net Earnings* and Adjusted Net Earnings Per Share* (earnings before any effects of non-cash, non-recurring and other costs, restructuring costs and foreign exchange adjustments), Net Debt* (bank indebtedness, short term financing and long term debt less cash) and Net Working Capital* (current assets less current liabilities). Adjusted Net Earnings* and Adjusted Net Earnings Per Share* do not include the tax effect of non-cash, non-recurring and other costs and foreign exchange. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA*, Adjusted Net Earnings* and Adjusted Net Earnings Per Share*, Net Debt* and Net Working Capital* are important indicators of AGT's ability to generate liquidity through operating cash flow to fund future working capital needs, service outstanding debt and fund future capital expenditures and uses the metric for this purpose. The exclusion of non-cash and foreign exchange adjustments eliminates the non-cash impact on Adjusted EBITDA*, Adjusted Net Earnings* and Adjusted Net Earnings Per Share*. Adjusted EBITDA* and Adjusted Net Earnings*, Adjusted Net Earnings Per Share*, Net Debt* and Net Working Capital* are also used by investors and analysts for the purpose of valuing AGT. The intent of these measures is to provide additional useful information to investors and analysts and the measure does not have any standardized meaning under IFRS. Adjusted Gross Profit*, Adjusted EBITDA* and Adjusted Net Earnings*, Adjusted Net Earnings Per Share*, Net Debt* and Net Working Capital* should therefore not be considered in isolation or used as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA* to EBITDA (earnings before finance expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) and of net earnings (loss) determined in accordance with IFRS to Adjusted EBITDA*, Adjusted Net Earnings* and Adjusted Net Earnings Per Share*, see the table on page 41 in the related management's discussion and analysis for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015.

ADM Reports Second Quarter Adjusted Earnings of $0.60 per Share Net earnings of $386 million, or $0.62 per share CHICAGO, August 4, 2015--Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE: ADM) today reported financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2015. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.60, down from $0.79 in the same period last year. Adjusted segment operating profit was $724 million, down 13 percent from $835 million in the year-ago period. Net earnings for the quarter were $386 million, or $0.62 per share, and segment operating profit was $808 million. \"Our second-quarter results demonstrate the strength and value of our geographic and businessportfolio diversity,\" said ADM Chief Executive Officer Juan Luciano. \"In Corn, domestic and export demand for ethanol was robust, but record industry production limited margins. This was partially offset by strong results from our corn sweeteners and starches business. \"In Oilseeds, good meal demand supported strong North American soybean crushing results. And South American origination and export volumes were up, leading to good throughput at our expanded origination and port network. These, combined with the flexibility of our global crush plants, helped the Oilseeds team deliver another strong performance. \"The WFSI team had an excellent quarter and continues to make great progress toward achieving their targeted cost and revenue synergies. \"Ag Services earnings were impacted by lower margins and volumes of North American exports, as they were less competitive globally, and by a sharp upward move in commodity prices at the end of the quarter. But, within our Ag Services segment, the milling business had record second-quarter results. \"We've continued to advance our strategic plan that's improving our ROIC and growing our EVA. Among numerous other actions, we closed the sale of our global chocolate business to Cargill; we closed the Barcarena port transaction with Glencore in June; and we remain on track to close both our Eaststarch transaction and the sale of our global cocoa business later this year.\" Second Quarter 2015 Highlights Adjusted EPS of $0.60 excludes approximately $0.11 of gains on asset sales and acquisitionrelated revaluations, $0.06 of LIFO charges, $0.04 of charges related to asset impairments and restructurings, and a $0.01 gain related to effective tax rate adjustment. Agricultural Services decreased $57 million as lower global merchandising results and lower earnings from reduced North American export margins and volumes were partially offset by record second-quarter profits from milling operations. Corn Processing decreased $80 million on lower bioproducts results. Oilseeds Processing results were solid, as strong global soy crush and South American origination offset lower softseed and refining results. Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients earned a strong $104 million in the second reporting period for this business unit. Trailing four-quarter-average adjusted ROIC was 9 percent, up 120 basis points year over year and 240 basis points above annual WACC of 6.6 percent. During the first half of 2015, the company returned $1.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and the repurchase of 24 million shares. Agricultural Services Earnings Decline on Lower Merchandising Volumes and Margins Agricultural Services operating profit was $127 million, down $57 million from the year-ago period. Merchandising and handling earnings declined $74 million to $41 million. Strong South American exports that benefited the Oilseeds business segment reduced margins and volumes of North American exports reflected in Agricultural Services. In addition, Global Trade Desk profits were negatively impacted by the significant end-of-quarter increase in certain commodity prices as well as reduced volumes and margins. Transportation results declined $8 million to $19 million, amid lower barge freight demand and increased costs related to high-water conditions in the U.S. Milling and other results improved $25 million to $67 million, due mainly to higher product margins and strong merchandising results. ADM's global milling operations had record second-quarter results. Corn Processing Earnings Decline with Strong Sweetener Results Offset by Lower Ethanol Results Corn processing operating profit decreased from $268 million to $188 million. Sweeteners and starches results improved $22 million to $145 million with very good North American sweetener volumes and margins, good demand for coproducts, and solid results from the Almex and Eaststarch joint ventures. Bioproducts results declined from $145 million to $43 million due to lower ethanol industry margins. Increased ethanol exports and record U.S. driving miles supported robust demand, but record industry production resulted in margins lower than the prior year, though higher than the first quarter. Oilseeds Earnings Solid as Strong Soy Crush and South American Grain Origination Offset Lower Softseed and European Refining Results Oilseeds operating profit of $301 million increased $4 million from the year-ago results. Crushing and origination operating profit increased $35 million to $198 million. Strong soybean meal demand, combined with ample global bean supplies, supported strong global soy crush results. Large South American corn and soybean harvests helped drive volumes through the origination and recently expanded port operations there. Lower margins and volumes driven by concerns about seed supply significantly reduced softseed results. Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other generated a profit of $61 million for the quarter, down $27 million from year-ago results that benefited from $16 million in retroactively applied biodiesel blender's credits. Strong North American refining margins were offset by lower results from South America and Europe. Oilseeds results in Asia for the quarter increased $13 million from the year-ago period mainly due to improved results from Wilmar. Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients Delivers Excellent Second Reporting Quarter In the second quarter, Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients operating profit was $104 million. Wild Flavors had strong results in North America, and the specialty proteins business had one of its best quarters ever. The business continues its strong progress toward achieving the cost and revenue synergies identified last year, with nearly 600 projects in the pipeline and more than 50 revenue synergy wins across the business units and geographies. Note that when reviewing comparative performance, the second-quarter 2014 results of ADM and WFSI do not include revenues or costs of Wild Flavors and SCI, because they were acquired in the fourth quarter of 2014 and the new segment was created on January 1, 2015. Other Items of Note For the second quarter, the effective tax rate was 27 percent, versus 28 percent in the same period last year. Segment Operating profit of $808 million as reported for the quarter includes a gain of $27 million in Agricultural Services related to purchasing the remaining equity interests in North Star Shipping and MinMetal; a $6 million gain in Corn Processing from the sale of the lactic acid business; a $68 million gain in Oilseeds Processing from the sale of port assets in Brazil to a new joint venture with Glencore; and impairment charges totaling $31 million, primarily related to certain international Oilseeds facilities. As additional information to help clarify underlying business performance, the tables on page 9 include both adjusted EPS as well as adjusted EPS excluding significant timing effects.

Bunge Reports First Quarter 2015 Results WHITE PLAINS, N.Y., April 30, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Bunge Limited (NYSE: BG) Total segment EBIT of $373 million, up $298 million vs. last year Agribusiness and Food & Ingredients off to good starts with favorable full-year outlooks Expect Sugar & Bioenergy to end year EBIT and free cash flow positive Repurchased $200 million of common shares during the quarter Overview Soren Schroder, Bunge's Chief Executive Officer, stated, \"We had a good start to the year with strong results in Agribusiness and Food & Ingredients and an improvement in Sugar & Bioenergy. \"Our Agribusiness operations in North America, Europe and Brazil performed well, capitalizing on strong soybean crushing margins and executing high margin oilseed export programs. Food & Ingredients continued to make progress with its commercial and operational excellence programs, largely offsetting the impacts of significant foreign currency devaluations and slowing economies in certain markets. \"Looking ahead, demand remains solid. Soybean harvests in South America are historically large, which aligns well with our footprint, and farmers in the region have much of their harvests remaining to be priced. Farmers in the Northern Hemisphere are expected to plant large crops, which should drive high asset utilizations later in the year. We also continue to press ahead in driving greater efficiency and unlocking value through our performance improvement initiatives, which is evident in our results. The rolling four quarter ROIC for our core Agribusiness and Food & Ingredients operations is 10.7%, tracking well above its 7% cost of capital. We expect strong returns to continue through the course of the year, while also growing earnings on a trajectory to reach our 2017 target of $8.50per share. \"We continue to follow our strategy of investing in our core businesses. Earlier this month, we announced the creation of a joint venture to invest in the Canadian Wheat Board. This investment, which provides access to high quality Canadian grain, improves the balance of our global grain network and provides greater market opportunities for Canadian growers. We remain committed to our balanced approach to capital allocation, and during the first quarter we bought back $200 million of common shares.\" First Quarter Results Agribusiness Agribusiness had a strong first quarter in both Oilseeds and Grains. In Oilseeds, North American processing and global oilseed trading & distribution were the largest contributors to the improved performance. North American processing benefitted from high crush margins resulting from strong global demand and higher volume. Results in our trading & distribution business were higher as we executed oilseed export programs at attractive margins. Processing results in Brazil were good. Higher soybean processing results inEurope were more than offset by weak softseed performance caused by slow farmer selling. Results in Asia were higher as soy processing margins in China improved from the depressed levels seen for most of 2014. In Grains, higher results in the quarter were largely due to improved performance in global trading & distribution, which benefitted from improved risk management and lower ocean freight costs. Grain origination results in Brazil were strong, having experienced a significant pick up in volume during March with the devaluation of the real, but were lower than last year. Grain origination results in most other regions were down, primarily due to slow farmer selling. In the first quarter, we realized approximately $70 million of gains from mark-to-market reversals on contracts which negatively impacted Q4. The remaining $10 million that impacted the fourth quarter should mostly reverse in Q2 as we execute on the contracts. Edible Oil Products Results in the quarter were significantly higher than the prior year, primarily driven by North America and Europe. Our U.S operations benefitted from the combination of higher margins and lower costs, reflecting our initiatives to improve asset efficiency and margins. InEurope, results benefitted from effective commercial strategies and our ongoing focus on costs which largely offset the impacts of devaluing currencies and slowing economies in certain markets. Results in Brazil were comparable to last year as our commercial and operational improvement programs helped offset the impacts of currency devaluation, slowing economic growth and higher energy prices. Milling Products Higher results in the quarter were driven by improved performance in wheat milling. Our Mexican operations benefitted from higher margins, additional synergies from the integration of the mills we acquired from Altex and the recovery of mark-to-market losses on foreign exchange which were incurred in the fourth quarter. Results in our Brazilian wheat milling operations were slightly higher than last year as our continued focus on operational and commercial improvements more than offset the impacts of foreign currency translation. In U.S. corn milling, results were slightly lower due to a decrease in volumes. Sugar & Bioenergy The first quarter is the inter-harvest period in Brazil when sugarcane mills in the Center-South region typically do not operate for most of the quarter and are selling sugar and ethanol inventories from the previous sugarcane harvest. Improved results in sugarcane milling were primarily driven by better margins, due to higher prices of sugar and ethanol in local currency, and lower costs. Results in our trading & distribution business were down slightly. In our biofuel joint-ventures, lower results in the U.S. more than offset higher results in Argentina. Last year's results were impacted by approximately $31 million of temporary mark-to-market losses related to hedges on our forward sugar sales. Fertilizer Lower results in the quarter were primarily due to lower margins in our Argentina operations resulting from a strike during the quarter which shut down one of our plants and required an increase in higher cost imports. The situation has been resolved and the facility is now operating normally. Imports at our Brazilian port were also down compared to last year. Cash Flow Cash generated by operations in the first quarter 2015 was $308 million compared to cash used of approximately $1.1 billion in the same period last year. The year-over-year variance reflects higher earnings, lower commodity prices and our continued focus on optimizing working capital. Income Taxes The tax rate for the quarter ended March 31, 2015 was approximately 26%. Outlook Drew Burke, Chief Financial Officer, stated, \"Agribusiness had a solid start to the year and the full-year outlook is favorable. With the arrival of South American crops, global export demand is shifting to this region. In Oilseeds, processing margins have improved inBrazil and Argentina and should remain good through September when export demand begins to shift back to North America. North America and Europe are entering their slow season where processing margins and utilizations will decrease. Livestock margins have recently improved in China supporting good crush margins and a favorable outlook for the remainder of the year. In Grains, South American farmers produced record crops, much of which remains to be sold. Farmers in the Northern Hemisphere are expected to plant large crops this spring, which should drive strong asset utilization and exports later in the year. However, in the near term, farmer selling has been slow, which if it persists, could shift earnings into the second half of the year. \"In Food & Ingredients, we expect 2015 results to be considerably higher year-over-year, driven by our operational excellence initiatives. However, the strong U.S. dollar and slowing economies in certain markets could cause the amount of increase to be less than we earlier expected. \"In Sugar & Bioenergy, our sugarcane crop is developing well and product prices are at levels that give us confidence that we will finish the year profitable and free cash flow positive. Due to the seasonality of the Brazilian sugarcane harvest, we expect results in this segment to be weighted toward the second half of the year.\" Conference Call and Webcast Details Bunge Limited's management will host a conference call at 10:00 a.m. EDT on April 30, 2015 to discuss the company's results.

Cargill reports third-quarter fiscal 2015 earnings MINNEAPOLIS - April 9, 2015 - Cargill today reported net earnings of $425 million in the fiscal 2015 third quarter ended Feb. 28, 2015, a 33 percent increase from $319 million in the year-ago period. Through nine months, the company earned $1.63 billion, up 13 percent from last year. Revenues in the third quarter decreased 11 percent to $28.4 billion; nine-month revenues totaled $91.97 billion. \"Cargill's results were led by strong performance in our global group of meat and animal nutrition businesses,\" said David MacLennan, Cargill's president and chief executive officer. \"In volatile petroleum markets, we saw a rebound in our energy businesses, having gained momentum from strategic changes made in the prior fiscal year. Faced with slowing growth and currency shifts in a range of markets, our food segment lagged expectations.\" MacLennan noted the company's third quarter was up over a relatively weak comparative period in fiscal 2014. \"One of the qualities that has made Cargill successful throughout our 150 years is our ability to meet challenges by uncovering new opportunities. With the uncertainties in the global economy, we are directing our full talent and capabilities to help customers adapt and thrive in this new environment. That's essential to our growth goals, too.\" Segment performance: The Animal Nutrition & Protein segment made the largest contribution to Cargill's third-quarter earnings. On a combined basis, the animal protein businesses were up considerably over a solid quarter in the prior year, with strong performance in Australian beef processing, Central American poultry, and U.S. pork and turkey processing. Aided by gains in sales volume, the segment's animal nutrition businesses jointly increased earnings from the year-ago period. The animal nutrition operations in Venezuela incurred a charge related to the country's revision of its currency exchange system. In Velddriel, Netherlands, Cargill opened its newly expanded animal nutrition innovation center, where Cargill scientists can work with experts from nearby universities to conduct research that supports the development of new products and services for customers in dairy, poultry and swine. Also during the quarter, Cargill divested a feed yard in Lockney, Texas, a move related to the idling of its Plainview, Texas, beef processing plant in 2013. It closed a turkey slicing and packaging facility in Springfield, Missouri, relocating production to two other company locations. Earnings in Food Ingredients & Applications were below the prior-year period, as segment businesses faced macroeconomic headwinds in several regions. Slowing economic growth and excess processing capacity in developing markets such as China, Brazil and Indonesia created a difficult operating environment. The strong value of the U.S. dollar against depreciating currencies like the euro and Brazilian real also hampered results, as earnings were translated back to dollars at lower rates. Cargill revalued certain food and salt assets in Venezuela and took a charge against earnings after the country's government restructured its foreign exchange mechanisms. By contrast, results in U.S. road salt and deicing were up significantly over a good quarter last year, with teams executing well through a harsh winter in the U.S. Northeast. Some of the segment's food ingredient and staple foods businesses also posted improved earnings. Earnings rose year-on-year in Origination & Processing, based on strong performance in North America and external events that reduced segment results in the comparative quarter, including China's rejection of U.S. corn cargoes containing an unapproved genetically modified trait and service disruptions to North American railways due to severe weather. In the current period, the combination of record U.S. crops, a robust export pull and limited supply from South America created healthy volumes in the North American crush sector. Grain origination and farmer services in Canada also were strong, supported by the country's good-sized 2014 crop and continued carryover from 2013's record deliveries. Meanwhile, Russian restrictions on wheat exports, changes in the export competitiveness of different origins and events such as a truckers' strike in Brazil created challenges in some markets. During the quarter, Cargill completed the acquisition of Indonesian palm oil producer Poliplant Group. The new assets should allow Cargill's palm oil business to take efficient, cost-effective steps in building an integrated supply chain that meets customers' needs for sustainable palm oil. The company also started up its new canola oil refinery in Clavet, Saskatchewan. With an annual refining capacity of about 450,000 metric tons, the facility will better serve customers in the expanding North American canola market. Industrial & Financial Services earnings were down due to decreased results in asset management. The segment's energy businesses staged a rebound after an unprecedented price spike in U.S. power markets marred results a year ago. In the current period, the energy team successfully navigated the dramatic decline in global crude oil prices and the volatility in petroleum markets that followed. The segment's steel processing operations were well positioned to meet manufacturing customers' demand for just-in-time inventory in a falling price environment linked to the slowdown in global steel consumption.

Revenues for first nine months of fiscal 2015 were $26.6 billion, down 19 percent from $32.7 billion for the same period a year ago, primarily due to lower average prices for the refined energy products, grains and fertilizer that make up a significant portion of CHS business. Earnings for the third quarter of fiscal 2015 (March 1- May 31, 2015) were$178.1 million, down 53 percent from $379.5 million for the same period of fiscal 2014. The third quarter of fiscal 2014 included a one-time gain of$108.8 million attributed to the establishment of the Ardent Mills flour milling joint venture in May 2014. Fiscal 2015 third quarter revenues of $8.7 billion declined 28 percent from the same three-month period a year ago. For the first nine months of fiscal year 2015, Energy segment earnings declined primarily due to significantly reduced refining margins and scheduled maintenance at its McPherson, Kan., refinery, along with, to a lesser extent, decreased propane earnings. CHS Ag segment earnings through the third quarter also declined. This decrease was attributed to lower earnings from logistics within grain marketing compared with the first three quarters of fiscal 2014, as well as lower grain and wholesale crop nutrients volumes. In addition, through the third quarter of fiscal 2015, CHS retail facilities experienced lower agronomy margins. Earnings for CHS renewable fuels marketing and production operations declined due to lower market prices which resulted in lower marketing commissions; those lower earnings were partially offset by the 2014 acquisition of a Rochelle, Ill., ethanol plant. CHS reports results for its business services operations and its two food processing-related joint ventures under the Corporate and Other category which reported lower earnings through the third quarter of fiscal 2015 primarily due to the one-time gain in fiscal 2014 associated with the formation of the Ardent Mills milling joint venture. In addition to reporting fiscal 2015 third quarter results, CHS announced today that the company will not issue non-qualified equity to eligible cooperative member-owners as part of its patronage distribution for fiscal 2015.

By the Numbers * Fortune 500 company * One of North America's leading food companies * 36,000+ employees, with 500 based in Canada * Over $18 Billion in net sales Canada Malting Company Canada Malting Co. Limited was formed in 1902 by the amalgamation of three malting companies in Ontario, Canada. In 1906, the company's first modern malthouse was built in Montreal. At the time, it was the largest malthouse in North America. It was followed by the construction of additional malthouses in Winnipeg, Manitoba; Calgary, Alberta; Thunder Bay, Ontario; and Toronto, Ontario. Expansion continued to six malthouses, making Canada Malting the largest malt producer in the world. Canada Malting expanded internationally with the purchase of Great Western Malting Co. (U.S.) in 1989, Bairds Malt (U.K.) in 1990 and interest in two South American malthouses in the mid-1990s. In 1995, Canada Malting was purchased by joint venture partners ConAgra Foods and Tiger Brands. Canada Malting, along with Great Western Malting, Barrett Burston Malting and Bairds Malt, became part of ConAgra Malt. In 2006, Castle Harlan, together with its affiliate CHAMP Private Equity, acquired ConAgra Malt and created United Malt Holdings (UMH). In November 2009, UMH (consisting of Canada Malting, Great Western Malting, Bairds Malt and Barrett Burston Malting) was purchased by GrainCorp, a leading Australian grain handler and marketer. The acquisition led to the creation of GrainCorp Malt and transformed GrainCorp into an international agribusiness with operations in Australia, the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. Today, GrainCorp Malt is one of the world's largest producers of malt for use in the brewing and distilling industries.

General Mills Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year Fiscal 2015 Results MINNEAPOLIS, July 1, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- General Mills (NYSE: GIS) today reported results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year ended May 31, 2015. Fiscal 2015 was a 53-week year, with the extra week falling in the fourth quarter. Fourth Quarter Financial Summary Net sales of $4.3 billion essentially matched year-ago levels. On a constant-currency basis, fourth-quarter net sales were up 6 percent. Total segment operating profit increased 9 percent to $800 million. In constant currency, total segment operating profit increased 13 percent. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) totaled 30 cents compared to 65 cents a year ago. Adjusted diluted EPS of 75 cents rose 12 percent from 67 cents in last year's fourth quarter. On a constant-currency basis, adjusted diluted EPS increased 18 percent. The extra week contributed approximately 4 cents to adjusted diluted EPS. Fiscal 2015 Financial Summary Net sales declined 2 percent to $17.6 billion. On a constant-currency basis, net sales increased 1 percent. Total segment operating profit declined 4 percent to $3.0 billion. In constant currency, total segment operating profit declined 2 percent. Diluted EPS totaled $1.97 compared to $2.83 a year ago. Adjusted diluted EPS, which excludes certain items affecting comparability of results, totaled $2.86 in fiscal 2015, up 1 percent from $2.82 a year ago. On a constant-currency basis, adjusted diluted EPS increased 4 percent. Cash returned to shareholders in fiscal 2015 totaled $2.2 billion, including an 8 percent increase in dividends paid per share and share repurchases that reduced average diluted shares outstanding by 4 percent. Constant-currency net sales, total segment operating profit, total segment operating profit growth rate in constant currency, adjusted diluted EPS, and adjusted diluted EPS growth rate in constant currency are each non-GAAP measures. Please see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements below for reconciliation of these measures to the relevant GAAP measures. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ken Powell said, \"General Mills fiscal 2015 operating performance was mixed. Our Convenience Stores & Foodservice segment recorded good sales growth, increased its operating profit margin, and delivered record profit results. Our International segment also achieved good margin expansion and profit growth in constant currency. However, sales and profit declined for U.S. Retail - our largest operating segment. We returned our U.S. yogurt business to growth, and our brands gained share in categories representing 65 percent of our U.S. Retail measured sales volume, but overall sales trends reflected the impact of changing consumer food preferences. \"Our actions to respond to evolving consumer food interests - including bolstering our natural and organic portfolio with the addition of Annie's - helped strengthen our business performance in the second half of the year,\" Powell continued. \"This Consumer First product and marketing focus, combined with our significant productivity and cost-savings programs, positions General Mills to deliver stronger growth in 2016.\" Fourth Quarter Results Fourth-quarter net sales of $4.3 billion essentially matched year-ago levels. Pound volume contributed 3 points of net sales growth, including incremental contributions from the Annie's organic foods business acquired in October 2014 and an extra week in this year's period. Net price realization and mix also contributed 3 points of growth. These factors were offset by a 6 point reduction in net sales from foreign currency exchange effects. On a constant-currency basis, net sales increased 6 percent. Adjusted gross margin, which excludes mark-to-market effects and certain other items affecting comparability, increased 70 basis points due to net price realization (please see Note 10 below for reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure). Selling, general, and administrative expenses declined due to a 6 percent decrease in advertising and media expense, and savings from restructuring actions (please see Note 6 for more information on our restructuring actions). Total segment operating profit increased 9 percent to $800 million. The company recorded an intangible asset impairment charge of $260 million, a $79 million charge related to the repatriation of foreign earnings, and restructuring and project-related charges totaling $35 million pretax (please see Note 3, Note 9, and Note 6 below for more information on these charges). Net earnings attributable to General Mills totaled $187 million and diluted EPS totaled 30 cents. Adjusted diluted EPS, which excludes certain items affecting comparability, totaled 75 cents for the fourth quarter, up 12 percent from 67 cents a year ago. On a constant-currency basis, fourth-quarter adjusted diluted EPS increased 18 percent. Full Year Results Fiscal 2015 net sales decreased 2 percent to $17.6 billion. Pound volume reduced net sales growth by 1 percent, including incremental contribution from the extra week. Net price realization and mix contributed 2 points of net sales growth. This was offset by a 3 point reduction in net sales growth from foreign currency exchange effects. On a constant-currency basis, net sales increased 1 percent. Adjusted gross margin declined 70 basis points, reflecting volume deleverage. Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased 4 percent due to a 5 percent decrease in advertising and media expense, along with savings from restructuring actions. Total segment operating profit declined 4 percent to $3.0 billion. Restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs, along with project-related costs recorded in cost of sales, totaled $617 million. Fiscal 2015 net earnings attributable to General Mills totaled $1.2 billion and diluted EPS totaled $1.97. Adjusted diluted EPS totaled $2.86 in fiscal 2015, up 1 percent from $2.82 earned last year. On a constant-currency basis, adjusted diluted EPS increased 4 percent. Contributions from the 53rd Week General Mills estimates that the extra week contributed roughly 1 point of net sales growth in fiscal 2015, and 6 points of net sales growth in the fourth quarter. Earnings contributed by the extra week totaled approximately $0.04 per diluted share. U.S. Retail Segment Results Fiscal 2015 net sales for General Mills' U.S. Retail segment declined 1 percent to $10.5 billion, reflecting lower pound volume. Annie's contributed 1 point of net sales growth and 1 point of pound volume growth. The Snacks and Yogurt operating units led U.S. Retail sales performance for the year. Cereal unit net sales declined, but the company's brands increased their share of U.S. cereal category sales. Advertising and media expense was 6 percent below last year's level. U.S. Retail operating profit declined 7 percent to $2.2 billion. Fourth-quarter net sales for the U.S. Retail segment increased 5 percent to $2.5 billion. Pound volume contributed 3 points to net sales growth, while net price realization and mix added another 2 points. Segment operating profit totaled $565 million, 13 percent above year-ago results. International Segment Results Fiscal 2015 net sales for General Mills' consolidated international businesses declined 5 percent to $5.1 billion due to foreign currency exchange effects. Pound volume essentially matched year-ago levels, and net price realization and mix contributed 6 points of net sales growth. Foreign-currency translation effects reduced net sales growth by 11 points. On a constant-currency basis, International segment net sales increased 6 percent overall, including gains of 17 percent in Latin America, 5 percent in the Asia / Pacific region, and 5 percent in Europe. Constant-currency net sales in Canada essentially matched year-ago levels. Advertising and media expense for the segment declined 5 percent. International operating profit totaled $523 million, down 2 percent as reported but up 9 percent in constant currency (please see Note 10 below for reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures). In the fourth quarter, International segment net sales totaled $1.2 billion, down 9 percent compared to the prior year, as foreign currency exchange effects reduced net sales growth by 18 points.

Convenience Stores and Foodservice Segment Results Fiscal 2015 net sales for the Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment totaled $2.0 billion, 4 percent above prior-year results. Pound volume added 1 point of net sales growth, while net price realization and mix added 3 points. The yogurt, frozen breakfast, snacks, and cereal platforms led net sales growth for the year. Segment operating profit totaled $353 million, an increase of 15 percent. In the fourth quarter, Convenience Stores and Foodservice net sales grew 4 percent to $527 million, driven by increases in pound volume. Segment operating profit rose 17 percent to $101 million reflecting the extra week and favorable business mix. Joint Venture Summary Combined after-tax earnings from the Cereal Partners Worldwide (CPW) and Haagen-Dazs Japan (HDJ) joint ventures in fiscal 2015 declined 6 percent to $84 million, reflecting unfavorable foreign currency exchange and an asset impairment charge at CPW in South Africa. Constant-currency after-tax earnings from joint ventures essentially matched year-ago levels. Constant-currency net sales declined 2 percent for CPW but grew 6 percent for HDJ. In the fourth quarter, after-tax earnings from joint ventures totaled $18 million, up 9 percent as reported and up 23 percent in constant currency (please see Note 10 below for reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures). Other Income Statement Items Unallocated corporate items totaled $414 million net expense in 2015, compared to $258 million net expense in 2014.

An additional $60 million of restructuring charges and $13 million of project-related charges were recorded in cost of sales. Net interest expense in 2015 totaled $315 million, an increase of 4 percent from the prior-year level reflecting a higher debt level partially offset by a lower average interest rate. The effective tax rate for 2015 was 33.3 percent, including a charge in the fourth quarter related to the repatriation of foreign earnings (please see Note 9 below for more information on our effective tax rate). Excluding that charge and certain other items affecting comparability of results, the effective tax rate was 30.5 percent in 2015, compared to 32.2 percent in fiscal 2014. For the fourth quarter, the effective tax rate excluding items affecting comparability was 28.4 percent in 2015 compared to 29.7 percent last year (please see Note 10 below for reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures). Cash Flow Items Cash provided by operating activities totaled $2.5 billion in 2015, essentially matching the previous year. Capital investments totaled $712 million, including investments to launch gluten free Cheerios in the U.S. and Yoplait in China in fiscal 2016. Dividends paid increased to $1.0 billion. General Mills repurchased approximately 22 million shares of common stock in 2015 for a total of $1.2 billion. Average diluted shares outstanding declined 4 percent in 2015 to 619 million. Update on Cost Savings Initiatives On June 25, 2015, General Mills announced Project Compass, a new initiative designed to enable our International segment to accelerate long-term growth through increased organizational effectiveness and reduced administrative expense. The company expects this initiative to generate $25 to $30 million in savings in fiscal 2016, and annual savings of $45 to $50 million by fiscal 2017. The company now anticipates the combination of Project Compass and the cost-reduction projects initiated in fiscal 2015 will generate cost savings of $285 to $310 million in fiscal 2016 and more than $400 million by fiscal 2017 (please see Note 6 below for more information). Outlook \"Where we had consumer-focused news and innovation on our brands in fiscal 2015, we generated growth,\" Powell said. \"We expect to expand the impact of our Consumer First strategic focus across our worldwide operations in fiscal 2016 to generate sustainable topline growth. Our plans include a strong line-up of core brand renovation and new product innovation. We will have six months of incremental contribution from the Annie's business. And we will drive significant productivity from our ongoing Holistic Margin Management (HMM) program and our new cost-savings initiatives.\" General Mills anticipates the combination of HMM and cost savings projects will more than offset input cost inflation, estimated at 2 percent for 2016. On a constant-currency basis, General Mills fiscal 2016 net sales are expected to essentially match the 2015 levels that included a 53rd week. Total segment operating profit is expected to grow at a low single-digit rate in constant currency. Constant-currency adjusted diluted EPS is expected to grow at a mid single-digit rate from the base of $2.86 earned in fiscal 2015. At current exchange rates, the company estimates a 4-cent headwind to fiscal 2016 adjusted diluted EPS from currency translation. General Mills will hold a briefing for investors today, July 1, 2015, beginning at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time. You may access the web cast from General Mills' internet home page: generalmills.com.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of General Mills, Inc. (we, us, our, General Mills, or the Company) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for annual and interim financial information. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included and are of a normal recurring nature. Certain reclassifications to our previously reported financial information have been made to conform to the current period presentation. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we changed how we assess operating segment performance to exclude the asset and liability remeasurement impact of hyperinflationary economies. This impact is now included in unallocated corporate items. All periods presented have been changed to conform to this presentation. Beginning with the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we realigned certain operating units within our U.S. Retail operating segment. We also changed the name of our Yoplait operating unit to Yogurt and our Big G operating unit to Cereal. Frozen Foods transitioned into Meals and Baking Products. Small Planet Foods transitioned into Snacks, Cereal, and Meals. The Yogurt operating unit was unchanged. We revised the amounts previously reported in the net sales percentage change by operating unit within our U.S. Retail segment. These realignments had no effect on previously reported consolidated net sales, operating segments' net sales, operating profit, segment operating profit, net earnings attributable to General Mills or earnings per share. At the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we made a strategic decision to redirect certain resources supporting our Green Giant business in our U.S. Retail segment to other businesses within the segment. Therefore, future sales and profitability projections in our long range plan for this business declined. As a result of this triggering event, we performed an interim impairment assessment of the Green Giant brand intangible asset as of May 31, 2015 and determined that the fair value of the brand intangible asset no longer exceeded the carrying value of the asset. Significant assumptions used in that assessment included our updated long-range cash flow projections for the Green Giant business, an updated royalty rate, a weighted-average cost of capital, and a tax rate. We recorded a $260 million impairment charge in restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 related to this asset. Venezuela is a highly inflationary economy and, we remeasure the value of the assets and liabilities of our Venezuelan subsidiary based on the exchange rate at which we expect to remit dividends in U.S. dollars. In February 2014, the Venezuelan government established a new foreign exchange market mechanism (SICAD 2) and at that time indicated that it would be the market through which U.S. dollars would be obtained for the remittance of dividends. On February 12, 2015, the Venezuelan government replaced SICAD 2 with a new foreign exchange market mechanism (SIMADI). We expect to be able to access U.S. dollars through the SIMADI market. SIMADI has significantly higher foreign exchange rates than those available through the other foreign exchange mechanisms. In fiscal 2015, we recorded an $8 million foreign exchange loss in unallocated corporate items resulting from the remeasurement of assets and liabilities of our Venezuelan subsidiary at the SIMADI rate of 199 bolivars per U.S. dollar. Our Venezuela operations represent less than 1 percent of our consolidated assets, liabilities, net sales, and segment operating profit. As of May 31, 2015, we had $0.3 million of non-U.S. dollar cash balances in Venezuela. On October 21, 2014, we acquired Annie's, Inc. (Annie's), a publicly traded food company headquartered in Berkeley, California, for an aggregate purchase price of $821.2 million, which we funded by issuing debt. We consolidated Annie's into our Consolidated Balance Sheets and recorded goodwill of $589.8 million, an indefinite lived intangible asset for the Annie's brand of $244.5 million and a finite lived customer relationship asset of $23.9 million. The pro forma effects of this acquisition were not material. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we sold certain grain elevators in our U.S. Retail segment for $124.0 million in cash and recorded a pre-tax gain of $65.5 million. We are currently pursuing several multi-year restructuring initiatives designed to increase our efficiency and focus our business behind our key growth strategies. During the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we approved Project Catalyst, a restructuring plan to increase organizational effectiveness and reduce overhead expense. In connection with this project, we expect to eliminate approximately 800 positions primarily in the United States. We expect to incur approximately $148 million of net expenses relating to these actions of which approximately $118 million will be cash. These actions were largely completed in fiscal 2015. Project Century (Century) is a review of our North American manufacturing and distribution network to streamline operations and identify potential capacity reductions. In addition to the actions taken at certain facilities described below, we incurred $17 million of restructuring charges in fiscal 2015 related to Century of which $6 million was cash. As part of Century, we approved actions in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 to reduce our refrigerated dough capacity and exit our Midland, Ontario, Canada and New Albany, Indiana facilities, which support our U.S. Retail, International, and Convenience Stores and Foodservice supply chains. The Midland action will affect approximately 100 positions and we expect to incur approximately $21 million of net expenses relating to this action, of which approximately $12 million will be cash. We recorded $6 million of restructuring charges relating to this action in fiscal 2015. The New Albany action will affect approximately 400 positions and we expect to incur approximately $84 million of net expenses relating to this action of which approximately $44 million will be cash. We recorded $51 million of restructuring charges relating to this action in fiscal 2015. We anticipate these actions will be completed by the end of fiscal 2018. During the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we approved a restructuring plan to consolidate yogurt manufacturing capacity and exit our Methuen, Massachusetts facility in our U.S. Retail and Convenience Stores and Foodservice supply chains as part of Century. This action will affect approximately 250 positions. We recorded $44 million of restructuring charges in fiscal 2015. We expect to incur approximately $69 million of net expenses relating to this action of which approximately $18 million will be cash. We expect this action to be completed by the end of fiscal 2016. Also as part of Century, during the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we approved a restructuring plan to eliminate excess cereal and dry mix capacity and exit our Lodi, California facility in our U.S. Retail supply chain. This action will affect approximately 430 positions. We recorded $63 million of restructuring charges in fiscal 2015. We expect to incur approximately $102 million of net expenses relating to this action of which approximately $41 million will be cash. We expect this action to be completed by the end of fiscal 2016. During the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we approved a plan to combine certain Yoplait and General Mills operational facilities within our International segment to increase efficiencies and reduce costs. This action will affect approximately 240 positions. We recorded $13.9 million of restructuring charges in fiscal 2015. We expect to incur approximately $15 million of net expenses relating to this action and to make approximately $14 million in cash payments. We expect this action to be completed by the end of fiscal 2016. In fiscal 2015, we paid $64 million in cash related to restructuring initiatives. In addition to restructuring charges, we expect to incur approximately $65 million of additional project-related costs, which will be recorded in cost of sales, all of which will be cash. We recorded $13 million in cost of sales for project-related costs in fiscal 2015. Subsequent to our fiscal 2015 year end, in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we approved Project Compass, a restructuring plan designed to enable our International segment to accelerate long-term growth through increased organizational effectiveness and reduced administrative expense. In connection with this initiative, we expect to eliminate approximately 675 to 725 positions. We expect to record total restructuring charges of approximately $57 to $62 million pre-tax, primarily reflecting one-time employee termination benefits, of which approximately $54 to $57 million will be recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. We expect approximately $54 to $59 million of the total expense will result in future cash expenditures. These restructuring actions are expected to be completed by the end of fiscal 2017. We expect that these actions will generate annual cost savings of approximately $45 to $50 million, with approximately $25 to $30 million of cost savings being realized in fiscal 2016. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, unallocated corporate expense totaled $110 million compared to $116 million in the same period last year. We recorded $19 million of restructuring charges and $10 million of restructuring initiative project-related costs in costs of sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. We also recorded $8 million of integration costs resulting from the acquisition of Annie's and a $1 million foreign exchange loss related to the remeasurement of assets and liabilities of our Venezuelan subsidiary in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 compared to $62 million in the prior year. We recorded an $8 million net decrease in expense related to mark-to-market valuations of certain commodity positions and grain inventories in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, compared to a $6 million net decrease in expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. For fiscal 2015, unallocated corporate expense totaled $414 million compared to $258 million last year. In fiscal 2015 we recorded a $90 million net increase in expense related to mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories, compared to a $49 million net decrease in expense last year. In addition, we recorded $60 million of restructuring charges, and $13 million of restructuring initiative project-related costs in cost of sales in fiscal 2015. We recorded an $8 million foreign exchange loss related to the remeasurement of assets and liabilities of our Venezuelan subsidiary compared to $62 million in fiscal 2014. We also recorded $16 million of integration costs resulting from the acquisition of Annie's in fiscal 2015. Our consolidated effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 of 33.3 percent was consistent with fiscal 2014. We incurred a 4 percentage point increase in our fiscal 2015 tax rate related to the repatriation of $606 million of foreign earnings. We expect to make $24 million in cash tax payments related to this action. This was offset by changes in earnings mix by country, certain favorable discrete items, and favorable state tax rate changes. We have included ten measures in this release that are not defined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP): (1) constant-currency net sales growth rates, (2) diluted EPS excluding certain items affecting comparability, (3) diluted EPS excluding certain items affecting comparability growth rate on a constant-currency basis, (4) total segment operating profit, (5) constant-currency total segment operating profit growth rate, (6) constant-currency International segment operating profit growth rate, (7) constant-currency net sales growth rate for our International segment in total and by region, (8) constant-currency after-tax earnings from joint ventures, (9) earnings comparisons as a percent of net sales excluding certain items affecting comparability, and (10) effective income tax rate excluding certain items affecting comparability. We believe that these measures provide useful supplemental information to assess our operating performance. These measures are reconciled below to the measures as reported in accordance with GAAP, and should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, our diluted EPS and operating performance measures as calculated in accordance with GAAP. Certain measures in this release are presented excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange (constant-currency). To present this information, current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than United States dollars are translated into United States dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, rather than the actual average exchange rates in effect during the current fiscal year. Therefore, the foreign currency impact is equal to current year results in local currencies multiplied by the change in the average foreign currency exchange rate between the current fiscal period and the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.

In addition, the Company has an 84 percent interest in Pacific Coast Canola, LLC, which operates the largest commercial-scale canola processing facility west of the Rocky Mountains. Legumex Walker Reports Second Quarter 2015 Results WINNIPEG, MB (August 14, 2015) - Legumex Walker Inc. (TSX: LWP) (the \"Company\") today reported its financial results for the three months ended June 30, 2015. All figures are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise stated. As a part of the ongoing process to identify and consider strategic and financial alternatives, in the second quarter of 2015, the Board of Directors determined that it was appropriate to consider a sale of its Special Crops and Oilseeds businesses. Consequently, in its financial statements for the period ending June 30, 2015, the results of the Special Crops and Oilseeds segments have been presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in its efforts to sell its Special Crops and Oilseeds businesses. Highlights for Second Quarter Ended June 30, 2015 (all comparative metrics are relative to the second quarter of 2014, unless otherwise stated): Special Crops Segment Revenue was $81.6 million compared with $97.6 million based on a 30% decrease in tonnes sold (83,900 tonnes from 119,200 tonnes); Adjusted gross profit1 was $ 7.8 million compared with $9.4 million; Commodity margin of $157 per tonne compared with $130; and, Adjusted EBITDA1 of $3.3 million (after increasing its allowance for doubtful accounts by $2.0 million) compared with $6.6 million. Oilseed Processing (Canola) Segment Tonnes crushed increased 17% to 59,300 from 50,600; Adjusted gross loss1 was $1.7 million compared with adjusted gross profit1 of $2.9 million, reflecting historically low board crush margins; and, Adjusted EBITDA1 was negative $2.8 million compared with positive $1.9 million. Consolidated Consolidated revenues were $83.5 million compared with $131.8 million; Adjusted gross profit1 was $6.1 million compared with $12.3 million; Adjusted EBITDA 1 was negative $1.0 million compared with $6.6 million; and, Net loss attributable to shareholders was $ 37 million compared with net earnings of $1.9 million and includes an impairment loss of $33.7 million recognized on Oilseed Segment assets. Developments Subsequent to End of Second Quarter: As discussed in the press release dated July 31, 2015, Pacific Coast Canola, LLC (\"PCC\"), of which Legumex Walker owns 84%, received notice making a demand for repayment of all amounts due under its senior credit facility (\"the Facility\"). The lender has since provided PCC with a forbearance in respect of the Facility and PCC continues to operate. The forbearance from AgCountry is subject to a number of conditions, including PCC being in compliance with the covenants under the credit agreement (other than the covenants in respect of which AgCountry has provided a forbearance) and PCC being able to refinance the facility in accordance with the terms of the forbearance. Legumex Walker has received forbearances with respect to its other credit facilities that are subject to \"cross default\" provisions. \"Our Special Crops business continued to perform well in the second quarter with commodity margins up year-over year and in line with our strong first quarter as we continued to see significantly improved performance over the fourth quarter last year,\" said Joel Horn, President and Chief Executive Officer, Legumex Walker Inc. \"The strong commodity margins would have resulted in Adjusted EBITDA of $5.3 million, however, to account for ongoing global economic uncertainties the Company increased its allowance for doubtful accounts by $2 million which resulted in a reported Adjusted EBITDA of $3.3 million.\" \"At PCC, a confluence of many macro-economic factors, including historic lows for the price of vegetable oils, a bad canola crop, a ten year low in the CAD/USD exchange rate and a massive drop in crude oil prices, created a historically low crush margin environment that had a significant impact on performance and, ultimately, led to the demand for repayment of PCC's senior credit facility. Although PCC has received a forbearance and is working to address the matter, it is not expected that Legumex Walker would recapture any equity value from the sale of PCC assets. Importantly, this matter is isolated to PCC and has no impact on the operations of Legumex Walker's Special Crops operations.\" Strategic Review Update The Company's previously announced strategic review process, initiated in March of this year, is ongoing. As announced in its news release of March 16, 2015, the Company established a Special Committee composed of independent directors to oversee the strategic review, which is intended to identify and consider strategic and financial alternatives available to the Company with the ultimate goal of maximizing shareholder value. Such strategic and financial alternatives may include a transaction, as well as the continued execution of its business plan. The Special Committee expects to provide an update in the coming weeks as the process nears its completion. Although the Company has initiated a strategic review process, there is no certainty that any transaction or alternative will be undertaken. The Company has not set a definitive schedule to complete its evaluation and, notwithstanding the above-mentioned alternatives, no decision on any particular alternative has been reached at this time. The Company does not intend to make further announcements or disclose developments with respect to this process unless the evaluation has been completed and the Board has approved a definitive transaction and the Company has entered into a definitive agreement or unless otherwise required by law or regulation or disclosure of which is deemed appropriate. Non-GAAP Measures This news release contains references to \"Adjusted Gross Profit\" and \"Adjusted EBITDA\". Adjusted Gross Profit is defined for the purposes of this news release as gross profit before depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined for the purposes of this news release as earnings (loss) from operations before other income and expenses, depreciation and amortization, financing costs, and income taxes. Management believes that Adjusted Gross Profit, and Adjusted EBITDA are useful supplemental measures of cash flow prior to finance costs, capital expenditures, income taxes and other non-cash items included in earnings. Management uses Adjusted Gross Profit or Loss as financial measures of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Gross Profit or Loss are not recognized earnings measures under Canadian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or IFRS (collectively referred to herein as \"Canadian GAAP\") and do not have standardized meanings prescribed by Canadian GAAP. Therefore, Adjusted Gross Profit, and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Investors are cautioned that Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to net earnings or loss (which are determined in accordance with Canadian GAAP) as an indicator of the performance of the Company or as a measure of liquidity and cash flows. The Company believes that Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA are useful supplemental measures of cash flow prior to debt service, investing and financing activities and income taxes. The Company's method of calculating Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA may differ materially from the methods used by other public companies and, accordingly, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other public companies. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Earnings (loss) is set out in section 12 of the MD&A (as defined below).

According to news reporting out of North Bay, Canada, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"Information on spatial and temporal variability of crop growth status is important for understanding the interaction between plants and environmental conditions. In particular, information at the sub-field level is critical for detecting and combating within-field yield-limiting factors for implementation of precision agriculture.\" Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Nipissing University, \"High-resolution optical satellite sensors are useful tools to acquire the necessary information in this regard. This study used multi-temporal RapidEye data to estimate the green effective plant area index (PAH and leaf chlorophyll content of two field crops, spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and canola (Brassica napus L.). The objective was to evaluate the capability of RapidEye imagery for detecting within-field variability of crop growth conditions. Field experiments were carried out in northern Ontario over two consecutive years, 2012 and 2013. Several vegetation indices were selected and derived from the RapidEye data to correlate with crop PAI measured using digital hemispherical photography and leaf chlorophyll content index (CCI) measured using a CCM-200 chlorophyll meter. Results showed that the effective PAI and CCI of the two crops were best correlated with different indices. For effective PAI, the modified triangular vegetation index 2 (MTVI2) was the best for spring wheat (R-2 = 0.74, RMSE = 0.72 and n = 200) whereas the red-edge normalized difference vegetation index (NDVIRE) was the best for canola (R-2 = 0.83, RMSE = 0.49 and n = 147). For CCI, the chlorophyll vegetation index (CVI) was the best for spring wheat (R-2 = 0.78, RMSE = 4.1 and n = 128) whereas the red-edge chlorophyll index (CIRE) was the best for canola (R-2 = 0.33, RMSE = 6.4 and n = 88). The study also confirmed that the combined transformed chlorophyll absorption reflectance index/optimized soil adjusted vegetation index (TCARI/OSAVI) was satisfactory for spring wheat leaf chlorophyll content estimation when the crop canopy is not sparse. Using selected vegetation indices, RapidEye data can be used to map the within-field variability of crop growth conditions, which is useful for applications in precision agriculture.\" According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The reflectance in the red-edge or the green bands is useful in mapping crop leaf chlorophyll variability.\" Our news journalists report that additional information may be obtained by contacting J.L.

According to news originating from Ottawa, Canada, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"In recent years, the impact of chlorophyll content on the estimation of the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) has attracted increased attention. In this study, chlorophyll-related vegetation indices (VIs) were selected and tested for their capability in crop FPAR estimation using simulated Sentinel-2 data.\" Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, \"These indices can be categorized into four classes: 1) the ratio indices; 2) the normalized difference indices; 3) the triangular area-based indices; and 4) the integrated indices. Two crops, wheat and corn, with distinctive canopy and leaf structure were studied. Measured FPAR and Sentinel-2 reflectance simulated from field spectral measurements were used. The results showed that VIs using the near-infrared and red-edge reflectance, including the modified Simple Ratio-2 (mSR2), the red-edge Simple Ratio (SR705), the Red-Edge Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (ND705), MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (MTCI), and the Revised Optimized Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI[705, 750]), had a strong linear correlation with FPAR, especially in the high biomass range. When the red-edge reflectance was used, the ratio indices (e.g., mSR2 and SR705) had a stronger correlation with crop FPAR than the normalized difference indices (e.g., ND705). Sensitivity analysis showed that mSR2 had the strongest linear correlation with FPAR of the two crops across a growing season. Further analysis indicated that indices using the red-edge reflectance might be useful for developing FPAR retrieval algorithms that are independent of crop types.\" According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"This suggests the potential for high resolution and high-quality mapping of FPAR for precision farming using the Sentinel-2 data.\" The news correspondents report that additional information may be obtained from T.F.

Patent Issued for Particulate Material Delivery System for Variable Rate Sectional Control (USPTO 9144190)", "article": "2015 OCT 12 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Journal of Engineering -- According to news reporting originating from Alexandria, Virginia, by VerticalNews journalists, a patent by the inventors Henry, James W. (Saskatoon, CA); Stuart, Graham D. (Saskatoon, CA); Wolowski, Evan J. B. (Saskatoon, CA); Petruic, Matthew G. (Saskatoon, CA), filed on January 21, 2013, was published online on September 29, 2015. The assignee for this patent, patent number 9144190, is CNH Industrial Canada, Ltd. (Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, CA). Reporters obtained the following quote from the background information supplied by the inventors: \"Modern large acreage seeding implements pneumatically deliver seed, fertilizer, and/or other product to fields. An example is an air cart and an air drill that are pulled together behind a tractor to deliver product. Different seeding styles can be implemented by using different openers on the air drills. Knife, ribbon band, ribbon band sweep, double-shoot, and disk openers can be used for different seeding styles that can open correspondingly different styles of furrows to receive the seed. The air cart pneumatically conveys seed to the air drill for delivery into the furrow(s). Air carts include one or more storage compartments that hold product(s), each of which has an associated metering box. The metering box divides product(s) from the associated storage compartment(s) into equal sections for delivery of equal product volumes. The equally divided product(s) is entrained in an airflow established by a fan and delivered through manifolds and distribution lines that direct the product from the air cart, to the air drill, and to the field being planted with seed.\" In addition to obtaining background information on this patent, VerticalNews editors also obtained the inventors' summary information for this patent: \"The present invention is directed to a particulate material delivery system that allows for variable rate sectional control while delivering particulate material to an agricultural field. The system may be incorporated with air carts and air drills, and that includes a metering system having multiple metering units that are independently controllable. This may allow for individual controlling product delivery rates through metering units so as to independently control the delivery rate(s) to each of multiple secondary distribution headers or manifolds, which may allow for sectional control of product delivery from the air drill. \"According to one aspect of the present invention, a particulate material delivery system is provided that may include an air cart and a planter that are towable behind a tractor. A metering system of the particulate material delivery system receives a product from the air cart and delivers the product to the planter for distribution to the ground, such as an agricultural field. The metering system may include multiple metering units that receive separate portions of the product from the air cart. Multiple prime movers may drive the multiple metering units. A controller is connected to and individually controls the multiple prime movers such that distribution rates of the multiple metering units can be varied independently of each other. The multiple prime movers may be electric motors. \"According to another aspect, each of the multiple metering units may include a metering roller, and a shaft that supports and rotates the metering roller. The electric motors may directly drive ends of the shafts that support the metering roller. \"According to another aspect, each of the multiple metering units may include a metering roller having an external gear at an outer circumferential surface thereof. Each electric motor may directly drive the external gear of a respective metering roller. \"According to another aspect, each of the multiple metering units may include a metering roller having an internal gear at an inner circumferential surface thereof. Each electric motor may directly drive the internal gear of a respective metering roller. \"According to another aspect, an airflow characteristic of an airflow that entrains the product may be controlled based on a delivery rate of at least one of the multiple metering units for pneumatically conveying product from the multiple metering units toward multiple opener units of the drill. The delivery rate of the product to multiple locations of the agricultural field may be individually controlled by controlling the delivery rate of product through each of the multiple metering units and controlling the airflow characteristic. This may allow for providing a particulate material delivery system that provides delivery consistency and control without requiring singulation-type equipment such as row-unit planters, which may provide a relatively simple and cost-effective air-seeder-type particulate material delivery system with a high amount of delivery accuracy. This may allow for delivery rate variability at secondary headers or manifolds of a single drill which allows for site specific precision farming. This may also allow for relatively more application precision by way of variable rate sectional control of a drill as compared to typical drills that each typically allows for delivery rate variability of only the whole drill. \"Other aspects, objects, features, and advantages of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description and accompanying drawings. It should be understood, however, that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating preferred embodiments of the present invention, are given by way of illustration and not of limitation. Many changes and modifications may be made within the scope of the present invention without departing from the spirit thereof, and the invention includes all such modifications.\" Keywords for this news article include: Agricultural, CNH Industrial Canada Ltd.

Barrick Gold Corporation - Processing Restrictions at Veladero Lifted - 25/9/2015 Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:ABX)(TSX:ABX) (Barrick or the \"company\") today announced that restrictions on processing activities at the Veladero mine in San Juan province, Argentina, have been lifted. A local court previously restricted the addition of new reagents to the mine's heap leach circuit following the failure of a valve on a pipe carrying cyanide solution at the leach pad, which led to a release of solution. The safety of people and the environment has been the company's top priority since the faulty valve was detected. Barrick immediately implemented a comprehensive downstream water monitoring program. This monitoring, as well as testing results from an independent third-party laboratory, have confirmed that there are no risks to the health of downstream communities as a result of this incident. These findings are consistent with independent water testing results released by other third parties in San Juan province, including the Public Health Department and the state water distribution company. A series of additional preventative measures and controls have been implemented at the leach pad to ensure it is safe to resume full operations. An investigation into the root causes of this incident remains underway. Barrick does not anticipate any material impact to production at Veladero as a result of this incident. Latest Research Analysis of the economic feasibility of a mining project due to the presence of natural underground cavities Iure Borges de Moura Aquino, Hernani Mota de Lima Abstract The legislation for the protection and conservation of caves is recent in Brazil. In 2008, the Decree 6.640 was enacted and in 2009, the Normative Instruction No 2 by the Brazilian Environment Ministry (MMA, Portuguese acronyms) was published. Mining operations cause a significant impact on the caves when they are present in or next to the mineral body. The impacts include the suppression of cavities and impacts on physical and bio-speleological stability of the caves. On the other hand, the actual legislation causes a significant impact on the mineable reserves when cavities are present. This article aims to assess the impact of the natural cavities on the feasibility of a mining project, based on the federal legislation, as well as to propose alternatives to combine mining activity with cave protection. For this research, three scenarios of open pit for a hypothetical ore body were considered for the assessments. This paper presents the results achieved for the three and comments on the necessity of researches to conciliate the conservation of the natural underground cavities with the mining activities. The Industry Mining Facts Minerals and metals are the building blocks of the computers and smartphones we rely on, of the vehicles and public transit that get us places, of the buildings where we live and work, and of green technologies that help make the world a more sustainable place. Just as we as individuals depend on mining to support our daily lives, Canada relies on the industry to keep the economy humming. Mining is one of Canada's most important economic sectors and a major job creator. A major employer: Approximately 380,000 people across Canada work in the mining and mineral processing industries. Mining is the largest private sector employer of Aboriginal peoples in Canada on a proportional basis, and employment is poised to increase. Canada has one of the largest mining supply sectors globally with more than 3,400 companies supplying engineering, geotechnical, environmental, financial and other services to mining operations. Those who work in mining enjoy the highest wages and salaries of all industrial sectors in Canada with an average annual pay exceeding $110,000, which surpassed the average earnings of workers in forestry, manufacturing, finance and construction by a range of $31,000 to $46,000 for those sectors. An economic engine: Mining contributed $54 billion to Canada's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2013. The industry accounted for 19.6% of the value of Canadian goods exports in 2013. Canada's value of mineral production was nearly $43.6 billion in 2013. The mining industry's payments to Canadian federal and provincial governments total $71 billion in taxes and royalties over the last decade (2003-2012). A global leader: Thanks to its rich geology, Canada is one of the largest mining nations in the world producing more than 60 minerals and metals. Canada ranks in the top five countries in the global production of 11 major minerals and metals: First in potash Second in uranium and cobalt Third in aluminum and tungsten Fourth in platinum group metals, sulphur and titanium Fifth in nickel and diamonds 57% of the world's public mining companies are listed on the TSX and TSX-Venture Exchanges. Together, the two exchanges handled 48% of global mining equity transactions in 2013, and accounted for 46% of global mining equity capital for that year. Globally, Canada is recognized for its leadership in safety and sustainability. Mining companies in Canada were the first in the world to develop an externally-verified performance system for sustainable mining practices with the creation of MAC's Towards Sustainable Mining initiative in 2004. Leading Companies Agnico Eagle Mines Limited Agnico Eagle's mission is to run a high quality, easy to understand business, that generates superior long-term per share returns for our shareholders, creates a great place to work for our employees, and that is a leading contributor to the well-being of the communities in which we operate. Agnico Eagle Reports Second Quarter 2015 Results TORONTO, July 29, 2015 /PRNewswire/ - Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (NYSE:AEM, TSX:AEM) (\"Agnico Eagle\" or the \"Company\") today reported quarterly net income of $10.1 million, or net income of $0.05 per share for the second quarter of 2015. This result includes non-recurring losses of $12.9 million ($0.06 per share), unrealized gains on financial instruments of $9.4 million ($0.04 per share), non-cash foreign currency translation losses of $4.8 million ($0.02 per share), non-cash stock option expense of $4.1 million ($0.02 per share), a non-cash foreign currency translation gain on deferred tax liabilities of$3.2 million ($0.01 per share) and various mark-to-market and other adjustment gains of $0.8 million ($0.01 per share). Excluding these items would result in adjusted net income of $18.5 million or adjusted net income of $0.09 per share for the second quarter of 2015. In the second quarter of 2014, the Company reported net income of $22.2 million or net income of $0.12 per share. For the first six months of 2015, the Company reported net income of $38.8 million, or $0.18 per share. This compares with the first six months of 2014 when net income was $119.3 million, or $0.66 per share. Financial results in the 2015 period were negatively impacted by lower gold prices (approximately 8% lower) and lower by-product metals revenues. Second quarter 2015 cash provided by operating activities was $188.3 million ($152.8 million before changes in non-cash components of working capital). This compares to cash provided by operating activities of $182.7 million in the second quarter of 2014 ($136.5 million before changes in non-cash components of working capital). The increase in cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital during the current period was mainly due to an increase of 24% in gold production. For the first six months of 2015, cash provided by operating activities was $331.8 million ($329.6 million before changes in non-cash components of working capital), as compared with the first half of 2014 when cash provided by operating activities was $433.1 million ($343.6 million before changes in non-cash components of working capital). The decrease in cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital during the period was mainly due to a decrease of 8% in gold prices compared to the 2014 period, which more than offset a 17% increase in gold production. \"With continued strong operating performance, favourable local currency foreign exchange rates, and near-term opportunities to increase production at several of our mines, we remain well-positioned to manage the current price volatility in the gold market\", said Sean Boyd, Agnico Eagle's Chief Executive Officer. \"In these challenging times, we will continue to focus on reducing costs and we will remain measured in our approach to managing and growing our business\", added Mr. Boyd. Second Quarter 2015 highlights include: Quarterly gold production - Payable gold production1 in Q2 2015 was 403,678 ounces of gold at total cash costs2 per ounce on a by-product basis of $601 and all-in sustaining costs3 (\"AISC\") on a by-product basis of $864 per ounce Second consecutive record quarter of precious metal production from Mexican operations - In the second quarter of 2015, payable gold and silver production from Mexican operations was 92,056 ounces and 685,869 ounces, respectively. Total cash costs per ounce of gold on a by-product basis averaged $394 2015 production guidance maintained and cost forecasts reduced - Expected gold production for 2015 is maintained at approximately 1.6 million ounces with total cash costs on a by-product basis of $600 to $620 per ounce (previously $610 to $630) and AISC of approximately $870 to $890 per ounce (previously $880 to $900) Vault Extension and Goldex Deep 1 approved for mining; 2015 capital for both projects increased by a total of approximately $36 million - The Vault extension is expected to reduce the potential production gap between the end of production at Meadowbank and the start of production at Amaruq (not yet approved for construction) by approximately one year. Goldex Deep 1 adds approximately seven years of production at approximately 100,000 ounces of gold per year Drilling at Amaruq's Whale Tail deposit confirms grades and thicknesses; mineralization extended to depth - Highlights include: 13.2 grams per tonne (\"g/t\") gold over 14.3 metres at 133 metres depth, and 13.9 g/t gold over 11.0 metres at 194 metres depth. The deepest intercept to date on the property yielded 8.8 g/t gold over 6.0 metres at 568 metres depth, almost 200 metres deeper than previous intercepts Continued focus on debt reduction - In Q2 2015, $25 million was repaid under the Company's credit facility, C$20 million (reflecting the Company's 50% interest) was repaid under the Canadian Malartic General Partnership (the \"Partnership\") secured loan facility, and the Canadian Malartic senior unsecured convertible debentures (C$37.5 million, reflecting the Company's 50% interest) were fully converted by the holders. As a result, the Company's indebtedness was reduced by approximately $70 million A quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share was declared Second Quarter Financial and Production Highlights In the second quarter of 2015, strong operational performance continued at the Company's mines. Payable gold production in the second quarter of 2015 was 403,678 ounces compared to 326,059 ounces in the second quarter of 2014. The higher level of production in the 2015 period was primarily due to the inclusion of a full quarter of production from Canadian Malartic, increased throughput levels at Goldex, increased mill capacity at Kittila, higher grades at LaRonde and Pinos Altos and increased heap leach stacking at La India and Creston Mascota. A detailed description of the production and cost performance of each mine is set out below. Total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis for the second quarter of 2015 were lower at $601 versus $631 per ounce for the second quarter 2014. The reduction in total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis in the second quarter of 2015 was a result of higher silver production, higher gold production at most of the Company's mines and weaker local currencies compared to the second quarter of 2014. In the second quarter of 2015 the value of the Canadian dollar, Euro and Mexican Peso were 1%, 2%, and 17% lower, respectively than the Company's 2015 currency price assumptions (see February 11, 2015 news release). Payable gold production for the first half of 2015 was 807,888 ounces, compared to payable gold production of 692,480 ounces in the comparable 2014 period (which included only 11,878 ounces from Canadian Malartic for production from June 16 to June 30, 2014). For the first half of 2015, total cash costs on a by-product basis were $595 per ounce. This compares with $582 per ounce on a by-product basis in the first half of 2014. The higher costs in the 2015 period are due to the increased costs at Meadowbank when compared to the 2014 period. In 2014, Meadowbank had record production and lower costs as a result of processing higher grade ore from the Goose and reserve grade ore from the Portage deposits. AISC for the second quarter of 2015 was lower at $864 versus $1,003 per ounce for the second quarter 2014. The lower AISC is primarily due to higher production, lower than forecast total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis, lower G&A expenditures and timing of capital expenditures. For the first half of 2015, AISC was $835 versus $890 per ounce for the 2014 period. The lower AISC in the 2015 period are due to the same reasons set out above. Cash Position Remains Strong; Debt Levels Reduced; and Capex Increased to Fund Near-term Production Opportunities Cash and cash equivalents and short term investments increased to $183.9 million at June 30, 2015, from the March 31, 2015 balance of $172.1 million. The outstanding balance on the Company's $1.2 billion credit facility was reduced from $400 million at March 31, 2015 to $375 million at June 30, 2015. This result in available credit lines of approximately $825 million, as well as the $300 million accordion feature. As of June 30, 2015, C$20 million (reflecting the Company's 50% interest) was repaid under the Canadian Malartic General Partnership secured loan facility. Also, the Canadian Malartic convertible debentures with principal outstanding of C$37.5 million (reflecting the Company's 50% interest), assumed with the joint acquisition of Osisko Mining Corporation (\"Osisko\") on June 16, 2014, was fully converted by the holders. Total capital expenditures made by the Company in the second quarter of 2015 were $111.5 million, including $18.9 million at LaRonde, $18.2 million at Meadowbank, $17.2 million at Pinos Altos, $13.9 million at Kittila, $12.0 million at Goldex, $11.4 million at Meliadine, $10.7 million at Canadian Malartic (50% basis), $6.2 million at La India, $1.7 million at Lapa and $0.2 million at Creston Mascota. Total capital expenditures for the first six months of 2015 were $194.4 million including $35.5 million at LaRonde, $29.3 million at Pinos Altos, $27.7 million at Meadowbank, $24.3 million at Kittila, $21.9 million at Goldex, $21.4 million at Canadian Malartic (50% basis), $19.8 million at Meliadine, $8.5 million at La India, $4.4 million at Lapa and $0.5 million at Creston Mascota. Total sustaining capital expenditures made by the Company in the second quarter were $81.9 million, including $18.9 million at LaRonde, $18.2 million at Meadowbank, $11.1 million at Kittila, $10.6 million at Canadian Malartic (50% basis), $10.3 million at Pinos Altos, $6.2 million at La India, $4.7 million at Goldex, $1.7 million at Lapa, and $0.2 million at Creston Mascota. Total sustaining capital expenditures for the first six months of 2015 were $142.8 million including $35.5 million at LaRonde, $27.7 million at Meadowbank, $20.1 million at Kittila, $19.8 million at Canadian Malartic (50% basis), $17.3 million at Pinos Altos, $9.0 million at Goldex, $8.5 million at La India, $4.4 million at Lapa, and $0.5 million at Creston Mascota. For 2015, capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $539 million, representing a $58 million increase from the previously announced figure. The increase is primarily due to additional expenditures for the development of Goldex Deep 1, the Vault pit extension, expansion of the existing Meliadine surface and underground infrastructure, and the sealift of additional equipment for the 2016 Meliadine work program. Based on the exploration success in the first six months of the year, the 2015 expensed exploration budget has been increased by approximately $20 million to $114 million. The additional expenditure includes a phase two exploration program at the Amaruq project; an initial exploration program at the Barsele project in Sweden; a slight increase in exploration spending at the Pandora property and the Odyssey deposits; and additional drilling on the new parallel zone at Kittila. Expenditures at Amaruq and El Barqueno could potentially increase further, based on exploration results. Revised 2015 Guidance - Production Maintained, Costs Lowered, Depreciation Increased Production guidance for 2015 is maintained at approximately 1.6 million ounces of gold with total cash costs on a by-product basis of $600 to $620 per ounce (previously $610 to $630) and AISC of approximately $870 to $890 per ounce (previously $880 to $900). The Company expects depreciation and amortization expense to be in the range of $575 to $600 million. Previous guidance was $550 to $575 million. The increase is primarily due to the finalization of the purchase price allocation associated with the Canadian Malartic acquisition. NORTHERN BUSINESS OPERATING REVIEW ABITIBI REGION, QUEBEC Agnico Eagle is currently Quebec's largest gold producer with a 100% interest in three mines (LaRonde, Goldex and Lapa) and a 50% interest in the Canadian Malartic mine. These mines are located within 50 kilometres of each other, which provide operating synergies and allows for the sharing of technical expertise. LaRonde Mine - Gold Production Steadily Increasing, Commissioning of Coarse Ore Conveyor on Track for Late Q3 2015 The 100% owned LaRonde mine in northwestern Quebec achieved commercial production in 1988. The LaRonde mill processed an average of 6,242 tonnes per day (\"tpd\") in the second quarter of 2015, compared with an average of 6,197 tpd in the corresponding period of 2014. Minesite costs per tonne4 were approximately C$99 in the second quarter of 2015, higher than the C$96 per tonne experienced in the second quarter of 2014. The increased costs in the 2015 period were primarily due to higher underground development, mill maintenance and site administration costs compared to the prior-year period. For the first six months of 2015, the LaRonde mill processed an average of 6,223 tpd, compared to 6,194 tpd in the first six months of 2014. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$101, compared to C$96 per tonne in the first six months of 2014. Costs were higher due to the reasons described above in spite of the higher throughput. LaRonde's total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis were $613 in the second quarter of 2015 on payable production of 64,007 ounces of gold. This compares with the second quarter of 2014 when total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis were $732 on production of 48,494 ounces of gold. Costs in the 2015 period were positively impacted by higher gold grades and favourable foreign exchange rates. In the first six months of 2015, LaRonde produced 122,900 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $656 on a by-product basis. This is in contrast with the first six months of 2014 when the mine produced 107,846 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $645 on a by-product basis. Production in the 2015 period was positively impacted by higher grades. Costs were lower in the 2014 period due to higher by-product production and revenues. During the quarter, work continued on the installation of the coarse ore conveyor system that will extend from the 293 level to the crusher on the 280 level. Installation of the new conveyor and the connection of an internal ramp at the 281 level are expected to be completed by the end of the third quarter of 2015. These two infrastructure components should help to improve mining flexibility and reduce congestion in the deeper portions of the mine. Studies are continuing to assess the potential to extend the mineral reserve base and carry out mining activities between the 311 and 371 levels at LaRonde. At present, the mineral reserve base extends to the 311 level, which is 3.1 kilometres below the surface. In 2014, conversion drilling added approximately 444,000 ounces of gold (2.6 million tonnes at 5.33 g/t gold) to the indicated mineral resources between the 311 and 341 levels. Drilling is ongoing to further expand the known mineral resource between the 311 and 341 levels. Additional holes are also being drilled to evaluate the extent of the mineralization down to the 371 level (a depth of 3.7 km below the surface). Canadian Malartic Mine - Mining Productivity Improves, North Zone Mining Rate Increases in Q2 2015 In June 2014, Agnico Eagle and Yamana Gold Inc. (\"Yamana\") acquired all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Osisko and created the Canadian Malartic General Partnership (the \"Partnership\") that owns and operates the Canadian Malartic mine in northwestern Quebec through a joint management committee. Each of Agnico Eagle and Yamana has an indirect 50% ownership interest in the Partnership. During the second quarter of 2015, the Canadian Malartic mill processed an average of 50,705 tpd (on a 100% basis). This period included a five day planned shutdown for maintenance to the crushing and grinding circuit, and two days of unplanned maintenance on the conveying system, which reduced mill availability. Comparisons with the 2014 period are not relevant given that the Partnership only took control of the operations on June 16, 2014. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$20 (C$23 including royalties), which was in line with guidance. The average stripping ratio in the second quarter of 2015 was 2.64 to 1.0. For the first six months of 2015, the Canadian Malartic mill processed an average of 51,343 tpd. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$20 (C$23 including royalties). For the second quarter of 2015, Agnico Eagle's share of production at the Canadian Malartic mine was 68,441 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $609 on a by-product basis. In the first six months of 2015, Agnico Eagle's share of production at the Canadian Malartic mine was 136,334 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $621 on a by-product basis. Since acquiring the mine in June 2014, the Partnership has been working on several initiatives to optimize the operations. Current opportunities include: Improving SAG mill liners in an attempt to reduce the number of planned shutdowns to three per year (currently four per year) Increasing gyratory crusher availability by redirecting ore containing scrap steel to a separate crusher Maintaining mining throughput levels at two million tonnes per month in the North zone (which contains higher grades) Waste rock backfilling of the Gouldie pit, to reduce haulage distances and noise In the first quarter of 2015, the Partnership reported that discussions were ongoing with permitting authorities regarding pre-crushing activities at Canadian Malartic. In the second quarter of 2015, discussions about improving the efficiency and environmental performance of the existing mobile crusher took place with the Quebec Ministry of Sustainable Development, Environment, Wildlife and Parks. The Ministry is reviewing this concept and an application for a Certificate of Authorization is being prepared for possible submission later this year. At this point, milling levels are expected to be approximately 53,000 tpd through 2016. For the full year 2015, Agnico Eagle's estimated share of gold production from Canadian Malartic remains unchanged at 280,000 ounces. Permitting activities for the Barnat Extension and deviation of Highway 117 are continuing. An Environmental Impact Assessment (\"EIA\") was submitted in February 2015, and questions were received from permitting authorities in April and May 2015. Answers to the first round of questions are expected to be submitted by the end of August 2015. The process remains on schedule for receipt of the necessary permits in November 2016. In March 2015, the Partnership increased its interest in the Malartic CHL property to 100% by acquiring the remaining 30% interest from Abitibi Royalties Inc. (RZZ:TSX-V). The Malartic CHL property adjoins the Canadian Malartic mine to the east and hosts part of the Odyssey North discovery. Drilling continues on the Odyssey North and Odyssey South zones with data currently being compiled and interpreted. Exploration Update on Pandora and Kirkland Lake Projects Canadian Malartic Corporation, a company in which each of Agnico Eagle and Yamana has an indirect 50% interest, is exploring, among other things, a portfolio of properties in the Kirkland Lake area of Ontario and the Pandora property in the Abitibi region of Quebec. At the Upper Beaver property in Kirkland Lake, a mineral resource update is underway and the Partnership will decide the best alternative to develop the property. At Pandora, underground development on the 101-W exploration drift from the adjacent Lapa mine commenced in February 2015 and approximately 285 metres of drifting was completed during the second quarter of 2015. Approximately 433 metres of development has been completed year to date, and for the full year, approximately 940 metres of development is planned. In mid-June 2015, exploration drilling resumed from the 101-W drift and approximately 7,400 metres of underground drilling is planned in 2015 to test for extensions to the Branch zone and C zone on the Pandora property. Lapa - Zulapa Z7 Zone Continues to Yield Higher Grades and Recoveries The 100% owned Lapa mine in northwestern Quebec achieved commercial production in May 2009. The Lapa circuit, located at the LaRonde mill, processed an average of 1,387 tpd in the second quarter of 2015. This compares with an average of 1,789 tpd in the second quarter of 2014. Throughput in the 2015 period was lower because of downtime related to the discovery of fatigue cracks in the feed head of the Lapa ball mill. This component is being repaired and ore is currently being processed through the old LaRonde copper regrind circuit. As a result, throughput levels are expected to be lower than normal through at least the middle of the third quarter of 2015. Excess ore is currently being stockpiled and there is sufficient mill capacity that should allow the Company to meet its annual throughput rate (tonnes and ounces) over the balance of 2015. Minesite costs per tonne were C$126 in the second quarter of 2015, compared to the C$105 in the second quarter of 2014. Costs in the 2015 period were higher due to lower throughput compared to the same period in 2014. For the first six months of 2015, the Lapa mill processed an average of 1,538 tpd, compared to 1,769 tpd in the first six months of 2014. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$122, above the C$107 per tonne in the first six months of 2014 due to reasons explained above. Payable production in the second quarter of 2015 was 19,450 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $678. This compares with the second quarter of 2014, when production was 18,821 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $832. In the 2015 period, production was higher and costs were lower due to higher gold grades, better recoveries and favourable foreign exchange rates. In the first six months of 2015, Lapa produced 45,370 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $615 on a by-product basis. This compares to the first six months of 2014 when the mine produced 42,230 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $738 on a by-product basis. The higher production and lower costs in the 2015 period are due to the reasons outlined above. At Lapa, 2015 is the last full year of production based on the current life of mine plan. In 2016, production is expected to exhibit a decline from the current level. Additional exploration drilling is ongoing in the Zulapa Z7 zone at depth and, if successful, could extend Lapa's mine life. Goldex - Deep 1 Project Approved for Mining; Production Expected to Extend Through 2024 The 100% owned Goldex mine in northwestern Quebec began operation in 2008 but mining operations in the original orebody, the Goldex Extension Zone (\"GEZ\") were suspended in October 2011 (see October 19, 2011 news release). In July 2012, the M and E satellite zones were approved for development. Mining operations resumed on the M and E satellite zones in September 2013. Mining operations at GEZ remain suspended. The Goldex mill processed an average of 6,640 tpd in the second quarter of 2015. This compares with an average of 5,692 tpd in the second quarter of 2014. The higher throughput in the 2015 period was due to more mature mining fronts and productivity improvements compared to the 2014 period. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$34 in the second quarter of 2015, which was essentially unchanged from the C$34 per tonne experienced in the second quarter of 2014. For the first six months of 2015, the Goldex mill processed an average of 6,468 tpd, compared to 5,544 tpd in the first six months of 2014. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$34, the same as the first six months of 2014. Payable gold production in the second quarter of 2015 was 26,462 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $633. This compares with the second quarter of 2014, when production was 23,929 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $670. The decrease in total cash costs in the 2015 period was largely a result of increased production due to higher tonnage and favourable foreign exchange rates compared to the 2014 period. In the first six months of 2015, Goldex produced 55,712 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $585 on a by-product basis. This compares to the first six months of 2014 when the mine produced 43,359 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $711 on a by-product basis. The higher production and lower costs in the 2015 period are due to the same reasons as outlined above. Following the completion of a positive internal technical study, the Goldex Deep 1 Project was approved for production by Agnico Eagle's Board of Directors. The study focused on mining the lower part of the Dx zone and the top of D zone (see Goldex composite longitudinal section below) from a depth of 850 metres to 1,200 metres (Level 120). The Company plans to undertake development from the current Goldex infrastructure, with existing equipment and personnel. The planned mining method is long-hole stoping with cemented paste backfill, which is the same method currently used at Goldex. Mineralogy in the D and Dx zones is very similar to what is currently being mined in M, M2, M5, E and E2 zones. Metallurgical testing of both the D and Dx zones has indicated that recoveries for the Deep 1 project are expected to be approximately 91.5%, which is in line with current recoveries at Goldex. No changes to the processing plant are anticipated. Tailings deposition at the Manitou site is expected to continue, as the site has ample capacity. The mining rate for Deep 1 is expected to be approximately 6,000 tpd, which would allow for the potential processing of up to 2,000 tpd of ore from other sources such as the Akasaba West Project. The average grade milled is expected to be approximately 1.69 g/t gold and the minesite costs per tonne are estimated to be approximately C$35 to C$40. Gold production is expected to average in excess of 100,000 oz per year from 2018 through 2024 at an average total cash cost per ounce on a by-product basis of between $610 and $630. Development capital is forecast to be approximately $135 to $140 million, and sustaining capital is estimated at approximately $60 to $70 million per year. The development capital includes the cost of the installation of an automated conveyor system. The Dx zone contains approximately 51,000 ounces of gold in indicated mineral resources (0.7 million tonnes at 2.12 g/t gold) and approximately 172,000 ounces of gold in inferred mineral resources (3.7 million tonnes at 1.46 g/t gold). The D zone contains approximately 727,000 ounces of gold in indicated mineral resources (10.2 million tonnes at 2.21 g/t gold) and approximately 709,000 ounces of gold in inferred mineral resources (12.9 million tonnes at 1.70 g/t gold). The internal technical study was carried out using a gold price assumption of $1,200 per ounce and an US$/C$ exchange rate of 1.20. The advancement of the Deep 1 project at Goldex also unlocks significant upside potential through: Potential for additional mineral resource conversion in Deep 1 Potential for mining at Deep 2 (below Level 120) Potential to develop the South Zone (a narrow high-grade zone accessible via Deep 1 infrastructure) Potential development of the Akasaba West deposit An Environmental Impact Assessment (\"EIA\") on the Akasaba West deposit is expected to be submitted later in the third quarter of 2015, which will allow the environmental review process to commence. The Company anticipates the EIA approval in the fall of 2017. Based on an internal technical study, the Akasaba West deposit has the potential to produce approximately 20,000 to 25,000 ounces of gold and 8.5 to 10.0 million pounds of copper per year for four to five years. The average total cash cost per ounce on a by-product basis is estimated to be approximately $400. Capital costs (including closure costs) are estimated at approximately C$50 million. At Goldex, 2015 capital spending guidance has been increased by $9 million. The higher planned capital expenditure is due to: Use of a contractor to complete the near surface ramp access to the M3 and M4 zones Acceleration of the Deep 1 underground development program Accelerated mineral resource conversion drilling at Deep 1 FINLAND AND SWEDEN Agnico Eagle's Kittila mine in Finland is the largest primary gold producer in Europe, and hosts the Company's largest mineral reserve base. Exploration activities continue to expand the mineral resource base and studies are underway to evaluate the potential to cost-effectively increase production. Kittila - Gold Production Increases, Unit Costs Decline, Drilling Encounters New Parallel Zone in Close Proximity to Main Rimpi Ramp The 100% owned Kittila mine in northern Finland achieved commercial production in 2009. The Kittila mill processed an average of 4,170 tpd in the second quarter of 2015 compared to the 2,720 tpd in the second quarter of 2014. The higher throughput in the 2015 period is a result of the mill expansion completed in the fourth quarter of 2014. Minesite costs per tonne at Kittila were approximately EUR75 in the second quarter of 2015, compared to EUR81 in the second quarter of 2014. Costs decreased in the second quarter of 2015 due to the increased throughput when compared with the 2014 period. For the first six months of 2015, the Kittila mill processed an average of 4,004 tpd, compared to 3,065 tpd in the first six months of 2014. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately EUR76 in the first six months of 2015, the same as the EUR76 per tonne in the comparable 2014 period. Since the expansion, the mill has shown potential to operate in excess of 4,000 tpd and efforts are ongoing to optimize throughput and recovery rates; in conjunction, the Company is also working to optimize underground mining rates and evaluate the potential to develop new mining areas. Unit costs are expected to improve once steady state operations are achieved. Second quarter 2015 payable gold production at Kittila was 41,986 ounces with a total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $776. In the second quarter of 2014, the mine produced 31,830 ounces at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $862. The higher production in the 2015 period is a result of the increased mill capacity compared to the 2014 period. Costs decreased in the second quarter of 2015 primarily due to increased production, lower energy costs and a favourable foreign exchange rate. In the first six months of 2015, Kittila produced 86,640 ounces of gold at a total cash cost per ounce of $727 on a by-product basis. This is in contrast to the first six months of 2014, when the mine produced 70,382 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $825 on a by-product basis. The lower cash costs in 2015 are mainly due to reasons described above. Previous drilling from the surface at Kittila has outlined a significant zone of mineralization at Rimpi with potentially wider widths and better grades than those currently being mined. The main underground ramp at Kittila is being extended to reach the Rimpi Zone and a new surface ramp is also being developed to access the shallower portions of the Rimpi deposit. The surface ramp had advanced 715 metres to 119 metres depth by the end of June. In April, the Company announced that drilling had encountered a new parallel lens of mineralization approximately 1.3 kilometres below surface and 150 metres east of the main Kittila ore zone, within the sheared and altered structure that hosts the known Kittila deposits (see April 30, 2015 press release). A recent hole in this area (ROU15-603) yielded 5.2 g/t gold (uncapped) over 13.3 metres (estimated true width) at approximately 975 metres below surface. Further details on this intercept and the drill hole coordinates are set out in the tables below. This latest intersection is located approximately 150 metres below the main exploration ramp being driven towards Rimpi and opens up the possibility that the up-dip extension of the new mineralized zone may be present at a similar elevation east of the ramp. This new lens could provide additional tonnage should further drilling confirm the continuity of the mineralization. Additional drilling is underway, and a second underground deep drill rig is expected to start operating in the fourth quarter 2015 to test for extensions of the new parallel zone. At the Kuotko deposit, located approximately 15 kilometres north of Kittila, drilling is ongoing to infill and expand the existing approximately 170,000 ounce inferred resource (1.8 million tonnes at 2.9 g/t gold). Metallurgical testing is underway, and on completion of the drilling, studies will be carried out to assess the viability of mining the deposit as an open pit. If the studies are positive, permit applications would then be expected to be submitted by the end of 2015. Barsele Project - Joint Venture Transaction Completed Late Q2 2015 On June 11, 2015, Agnico Eagle acquired a 55% interest in Orex Minerals Inc's (REX: TSX-V) Barsele project in Sweden. The Company can earn an additional 15% interest in the project through the completion of a pre-feasibility study. The Barsele property is known to contain intrusive-hosted gold mineralization and gold-rich volcanogenic massive sulphide mineralization. In 2015, the Company plans to spend approximately $3.25 million on exploration to further evaluate the mineral potential of the property. NUNAVUT REGION With the Company's largest producing mine (Meadowbank) and two significant development assets and exploration projects (Meliadine and Amaruq) located in Nunavut, Agnico Eagle has the potential to build an operating platform that could have the ability to generate strong production and cash flows over several decades. Meadowbank - Mine Life Extended as Vault Pit Extension Approved The 100% owned Meadowbank mine in Nunavut, northern Canada, achieved commercial production in March 2010. The Meadowbank mill processed an average of 11,199 tpd in the second quarter of 2015, compared to the 11,549 tpd achieved in the second quarter of 2014. Year-over-year mill throughput levels were lower due to a higher percentage of Vault ore processed which has a higher hardness factor. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$74 in the second quarter of 2015. These costs were higher than the C$70 per tonne in the second quarter of 2014. The higher costs per tonne were primarily due to lower throughput compared to the respective 2014 period. For the first six months of 2015, the Meadowbank mill processed an average of 11,103 tpd, compared to 11,299 tpd in the first six months of 2014. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$73 in the first six months of 2015, which was the same as the C$73 per tonne in the comparable 2014 period. Payable production in the second quarter of 2015 was 91,276 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $688. This compares with the second quarter of 2014 when 118,161 ounces were produced at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $563. The lower production and higher costs in the 2015 period compared to the 2014 period are primarily due to the processing of lower grade ore (down 18%) and lower recoveries (down 2.5%). In the first six months of 2015, Meadowbank produced 179,799 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $672 on a by-product basis. In the first six months of 2014 the mine produced 274,605 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $489 on a by-product basis. The lower production and higher costs in the 2015 period compared to the previous period was a result of the final high grade ore from the Goose and Portage pits that was mined in the first quarter 2014. In 2013, approximately 246,000 ounces were removed from mineral reserves at the Vault deposit due to a change in the gold price assumption used to calculate mineral reserves at December 31, 2013. Given the current US dollar to Canadian dollar foreign exchange rate (which yields favourable revenues and costs in Canadian dollar terms), lower fuel costs, and the growing significance of the Amaruq Project, the Company has decided to proceed with the expansion of the Vault pit. With the expansion, the Meadowbank mine is now expected to be in production until the third quarter of 2018 (approximately one year longer than originally forecast). The extension of the Meadowbank mine life is expected to help bridge the production gap between the end of production at Meadowbank and the potential start of production at a satellite operation at Amaruq (not yet approved for construction). The Meadowbank 2015 guidance for total cash costs per ounce of gold on a by-product basis is unchanged at $656. Meadowbank's average annual total cash costs per ounce of gold on a by-product basis for 2016 through 2018 are expected to be approximately $750 to $800. Including the revised Meadowbank production profile, the Company's average annual production for 2015 to 2017 is still expected to be approximately 1.6 million ounces. The 2015 capital budget at Meadowbank has been increased by $27 million to reflect additional costs associated with developing the Vault extension (higher deferred stripping and the purchase of additional mining trucks). Amaruq Project - Drilling Continues to Infill Whale Tail Zone; Positive Results at Mammoth Lake; Phase Two Exploration Program Underway Agnico Eagle has a 100% interest in the Amaruq project in Nunavut, northern Canada. The large property consists of 114,761 hectares of Inuit-owned and federal Crown land, located approximately 50 kilometres northwest of the Meadowbank mine. The purpose of the 2015 winter and spring exploration program was to infill the Whale Tail zone from surface to 200 metres depth in order to convert inferred to indicated mineral resources at open pit depths, with some additional exploration drill holes as deep as 350 metres and drilling into geophysical (magnetic and electromagnetic) targets in the Mammoth Lake area. The Company last reported exploration results from this project on June 9, 2015. As of June 30, the $16-million phase one 2015 drill program was complete with a total of 162 holes (48,081 metres). Drilling Confirms and Expands Whale Tail Mineralized Zone To date, the Whale Tail deposit has been defined over at least 1.2 kilometers of strike length between surface and 450 meters depth, suggesting potential for both open pit and underground mining. The deposit remains open at depth and along strike. Recent work confirms that Whale Tail consists of multiple lenses of mineralization with a high-grade wide core. Some of the most significant results include 10.2 g/t gold over 6.8 meters at 109 meters depth and 13.2 g/t gold over 14.3 meters at 133 meters depth (hole AMQ15-249). Hole AMQ15-236 intersected three lenses between 226 and 276 meters depth including 13.0 g/t gold over 7.1 meters at 276 meters depth. Hole AMQ15-250 intersected three lenses: 13.9 g/t gold over 11.0 meters at 194 meters depth, 4.8 g/t gold over 6.5 meters at 219 meters depth, and 10.2 g/t gold over 9.8 meters at 279 meters depth. Hole AMQ15-221 intersected two lenses below 300 meters depth including 7.3 g/t gold over 5.4 meters at 336 meters depth. The deepest intercept to date on the property is in a structure north of Whale Tail (first described in the June 9, 2015 news release): hole AMQ15-234 intersected 8.8 g/t gold over 6.0 metres at 568 metres depth, almost 200 metres deeper than any previous intercept. Another intercept that may be associated with the same structure is between the east end of the Whale Tail zone and the R zone, where hole AMQ15-225 intersected 4.9 g/t gold over 3.9 metres at 164 metres depth. This opens up a new exploration area that could potentially connect the Whale Tail deposit with the IVR deposit. Positive Results from Initial Drill Holes at Mammoth Lake The first drill results in the east part of Mammoth Lake area (located west of the Whale Tail zone) show mineralization between 50 and 300 metres depth that appears to connect with the Whale Tail deposit, possibly extending the strike length of the combined mineralization to approximately 2.0 kilometres. In the extreme east part of Mammoth Lake, 600 metres west of the known Whale Tail zone, hole AMQ15-261 intersected 6.2 g/t gold over 11.3 metres at 74 metres depth. Two hundred metres farther west, hole AMQ15-246 yielded two intercepts: 2.0 g/t gold over 8.8 metres at 248 metres depth and 6.8 g/t gold over 12.9 metres at 277 metres depth. As well, hole AMQ15-264 yielded 8.0 g/t gold over 8.4 metres at 195 metres depth. Another 1,400 metres farther southwest on the west side of Mammoth Lake, hole AMQ15-226 intersected 13.3 g/t gold over 3.0 metres at 162 metres depth. Recent drill intercepts from the Whale Tail zone and Mammoth Lake area are set out in the table below and the drill hole collars are located on the Amaruq project local geology map. Pierce points are shown on the Whale Tail composite longitudinal section; the Mammoth Lake collar coordinates are given in a second table. All intercepts reported for the Amaruq project show capped grades over estimated true widths, based on a preliminary geological interpretation that will be updated as new information becomes available with further drilling. Amaruq project local geology map Amaruq project - Whale Tail composite longitudinal section In February 2015, the Company announced an initial inferred mineral resource containing 1.5 million ounces of gold (6.6 million tonnes at 7.07 g/t gold) at the Amaruq project, based on drilling from 2013 through October 2014. An updated Amaruq mineral resource including initial indicated mineral resources is expected later this summer based on the drilling completed through the end of June. The phase two exploration program, budgeted at approximately $15 million, is now underway. This program, which is planned to include approximately 50,000 metres of drilling, prospecting, and geochemical sampling (soil, till, and rock), is expected to continue through August 2015. The main objectives of the phase two program are: Step out drilling between the Mammoth Lake and Whale Tail areas to try and link the two zones together Continue drilling in the western part of Mammoth Lake with the objective of defining the extent (size) of this new discovery Drilling at IVR to test for a potential link with the Whale Tail zone and investigate continuity of mineralization at depth and long strike to the east where field work has identified coincident geophysical and geochemical anomalies Additional deep drilling at Whale Tail (at a depth of approximately 500 metres below surface) The Company has also expanded the airborne geophysical (VTEM) coverage on the Amaruq project. This year an additional 68,044 hectares were surveyed resulting in total coverage of approximately 81,000 hectares (approximately 71% of the Amaruq property). Data from the VTEM survey is currently being reviewed with the intent of developing additional targets for evaluation. Studies are ongoing to evaluate the potential to develop the Amaruq deposit as a satellite operation to Meadowbank. Meliadine Project - Inuit Impact Benefit Agreement Signed and 2015 Budget Increased The Meliadine gold project was acquired in July 2010 and is the Company's largest development project based on mineral reserves and mineral resources. The Company has a 100% interest in the 111,757 hectare property, which is linked to the town of Rankin Inlet in Nunavut by a 25 kilometre all-weather access road. On July 13, 2015, the Kivalliq Inuit Association (KIA) and Agnico Eagle signed the Inuit Impact Benefit Agreement (IIBA) for the Meliadine gold project. Through the IIBA both Agnico Eagle and the KIA are intent on ensuring that business opportunities, employment and training opportunities arising from this potential mine will benefit the Inuit of the Kivalliq Region. The IIBA addresses protection of Inuit values, culture and language, protection of the land, water and wildlife and provides financial compensation to Inuit over the mine life. In moving forward, Agnico Eagle and the KIA will work toward a rate of 50% Inuit employment. With the signing of the Meliadine IIBA, the first financial payment from Agnico Eagle to KIA totaling C$1.5 million has been made. On March 12, 2015, the Company completed and filed with Canadian securities regulators an updated National Instrument 43-101 (\"NI 43-101\") technical report on the Meliadine gold project. The updated technical study was based on extracting only the 3.3 million ounces of gold in proven and probable mineral reserves (13.9 million tonnes of ore at 7.44 g/t gold), which is all contained in the Tiriganiaq and Wesmeg deposits. The Meliadine property also hosts 3.3 million ounces of measured and indicated mineral resources (20.2 million tonnes at 5.06 g/t gold), and 3.5 million ounces of inferred mineral resources (14.1 million tonnes at 7.65 g/t gold). In addition, there are numerous other known gold occurrences in the 80 km long greenstone belt that require further evaluation. Internal studies suggest that if the mine were to be developed there could be considerably more gold available to be added to the mine plan from the Tiriganiaq and Wesmeg/Normeg deposits, which could potentially extend the mine life, improve the project economics, and increase the after-tax internal rate of return (\"IRR\"). The Company is currently evaluating potential expanded production scenarios at Meliadine. At the end of the second quarter 2015, the underground ramp had been advanced by 867 metres, and is now at a depth of approximately 275 metres below surface. This year's plan calls for total underground development of approximately 2,500 metres. This development will allow for more cost-effective exploration and conversion drilling of the deeper parts of the Tiriganiaq and Wesmeg/Normeg deposits and help to optimize potential mining plans. The Company is currently studying options and alternatives in Nunavut to capitalize on the large and growing mineral resource base in the region and to maximize value. In order to keep the Meliadine project on track for a potential late 2019 startup, the 2015 capital budget has been increased by $22 million. The increased budget will be used to expand the existing surface and underground infrastructure and sealift additional equipment for the 2016 work program. The timing of future capital expenditures on the Meliadine project beyond 2015 and the determination of whether to build a mine at Meliadine are subject to approval by Agnico Eagle's Board of Directors, prevailing market conditions and outcomes of the various potential scenarios being evaluated. SOUTHERN BUSINESS OPERATING REVIEW At present, Agnico Eagle's southern business operations are focused in Mexico. These operations have been the source of growing precious metals production (gold and silver) with stable operating costs since 2009. Pinos Altos - Strong Performance Driven by Lower Costs and Higher Throughput The 100% owned Pinos Altos mine in northern Mexico achieved commercial production in November 2009. The Pinos Altos mill processed 5,854 tpd in the second quarter of 2015, compared to 5,513 tpd processed in the second quarter of 2014. During the second quarter of 2015, approximately 114,800 tonnes of ore were stacked on the leach pad at Pinos Altos, compared to 154,200 tonnes in the comparable 2014 period. Minesite costs per tonne at Pinos Altos were $43 in the second quarter of 2015, slightly lower than the $46 in the second quarter of 2014. The difference in minesite costs per tonne was largely attributable to variations in the proportion of heap leach ore to milled ore and open pit ore to underground ore, currency variations and routine fluctuations in the waste to ore stripping ratio in the open pit mines. For the first six months of 2015, the Pinos Altos mill processed an average of 5,758 tpd, compared to 5,448 tpd processed in the first six months of 2014. Approximately 189,200 tonnes of ore were stacked on the Pinos Altos leach pad during the first six months of 2015, compared to 293,300 tonnes in the prior year period. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately $45 compared to $48 per tonne in the first six months of 2014 with variance due to the proportion of heap leach to mill ore and the proportion of underground ore to open pit, and variations in the proportion of waste to ore mined, and variations in the currency exchange rate. Payable production in the second quarter of 2015 was 50,647 ounces of gold at a total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $384. This compares with production of 43,978 ounces at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $516 in the second quarter of 2014. Higher production in 2015 is largely due to higher throughput and higher grades processed over the comparable prior year period. The decrease in the year over year total cash costs per ounce is largely due to higher silver production (offset, in part by a decline in realized silver prices) and favourable foreign exchange rates compared to the prior year period. In the first six months of 2015, Pinos Altos produced 100,753 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $371 on a by-product basis. This is in contrast to the first six months of 2014 when the mine produced 89,195 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $498 on a by-product basis. The lower cash costs in the first six months of 2015 are primarily due to favourable foreign exchange rates and higher silver production compared to the prior year period of 2014. Site clearing and geotechnical studies have been completed for the Phase IV heap leach pad at Pinos Altos. Engineering design work is in progress with completion expected by year-end 2015. The Pinos Altos shaft sinking project remains on schedule for completion in 2016. At the end of the second quarter of 2015, the shaft had reached a depth of approximately 573 metres, and development activities had commenced on level 28. When the shaft is completed, it will allow better matching of the mill capacity with the future mining capacity at Pinos Altos once the open pit mining operation begins to wind down as planned over the next several years. The Company continues to evaluate a number of regional satellite opportunities. A 6,000 metre in-fill and conversion drill program on the Sinter deposit is 50% complete with the expectation to add this deposit to the Pinos Altos mine plan beginning in 2020. Creston Mascota Deposit at Pinos Altos - Improved Ore Stacking in Q2 2015 The Creston Mascota deposit at Pinos Altos has been operating as a satellite operation to the Pinos Altos mine since late 2010. Approximately 608,500 tonnes of ore were stacked on the Creston Mascota leach pad during the second quarter of 2015, compared to approximately 394,800 tonnes stacked in the second quarter of 2014. In the 2015 period, additional ore was encountered outside the block model, which resulted in more tonnes at lower grades being stacked compared to the 2014 period. Minesite costs per tonne at Creston Mascota were $11 in the second quarter of 2015, compared to $18 in the second quarter of 2014. Costs in the 2015 period were lower due to currency fluctuations, a reduced stripping ratio, lower fuel consumption and reduced power requirements compared to the 2014 period. For the first six months of 2015, approximately 1,135,500 tonnes of ore were stacked on the Creston Mascota leach pad, compared to 773,700 tonnes in the prior year period. For the first six months of 2015, mine site costs per tonne at Creston Mascota were $11, compared to $18 per tonne in the first six months of 2014. Costs were lower in the 2015 period due to the reasons outlined above. Payable gold production at Creston Mascota in the second quarter of 2015 was 15,606 ounces at a total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $402. This compares to 11,159 ounces at a total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $613 during the second quarter of 2014. Production was higher in the 2015 period due to more tonnes stacked, compared to the 2014 period. Cash costs were lower in the 2015 period based on lower minesite costs per tonne (see above), increased production and a favourable foreign exchange rate compared to the 2014 period. Payable gold production for the first six months of 2015 was 28,054 ounces at a total cash costs per ounce of $421 on a by-product basis. This compares to 21,476 ounces at a total cash costs per ounce of $606 on a by-product basis in the first six months of 2014. The higher production and lower costs in the 2015 period are due to the reasons outlined above. In April 2015, higher grade mineralization was encountered at the bottom of the pit and outside the Creston Mascota block model. Additional drilling is in progress to test for continuity of this mineralization, and results are currently being compiled. In the second half of 2015, a 3,500 metre infill and conversion drill program is planned on the Bravo satellite zone which would offer the potential to extend the Creston Mascota mine life. La India - Gold Production Exceeds Design Expectation as Growth Studies Continue The La India mine property in Sonora, Mexico, located approximately 70 kilometres from the Company's Pinos Altos mine, was acquired in November 2011 through the purchase of Grayd Resources, which held a 56,000 hectare land position in the Mulatos Gold belt. Commissioning of the mine commenced ahead of schedule in the third quarter of 2013 and commercial production was declared as of February 1, 2014. Approximately 1,359,500 tonnes of ore were stacked on the La India leach pad during the second quarter of 2015, compared to approximately 1,137,500 tonnes stacked in the second quarter of 2014. Minesite costs per tonne at La India were $9 in the second quarter of 2015, compared to the $8 in the second quarter of 2014. Tonnage variation reflects the ramp up to design capacity and the increased minesite costs reflect normal variations in waste/ore stripping ratio. In the first six months of 2015, approximately 2,738,000 tonnes of ore were stacked on the La India leach pad, compared to approximately 2,156,400 stacked in the first six months of 2014. Minesite costs per tonne at La India were $9 in the first six months of 2015, compared to the $7 in the first six months of 2014. The higher production and costs in the 2015 period are due to the reasons outlined above. Payable gold production at La India in the second quarter of 2015 was 25,803 ounces at total cash costs per ounce of $410 on a by-product basis were. Production in the second quarter of 2014 was 17,809 ounces at a total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $443. Total cash costs in the 2015 period were favourably impacted by higher production volumes and favourable foreign exchange rates. For the first six months of 2015, La India produced 52,326 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $414 on a by-product basis. This compares to 28,017 ounces at a total cash costs per ounce of $437 on a by-product basis in the first six months of 2014. During the quarter, approximately 40% of the earthworks had been completed on the second phase leach pad. An additional contractor is being used to expedite the process. This leach pad expansion will provide the capacity for the current planned life-of-mine production at La India and approximately 5.0 million tonnes of additional stacking. Construction of the Main Zone haul road is 65% complete, with work expected to be finished late in the third quarter of 2015. Block model reconciliation remains favourable. Infill drilling and technical evaluations are underway to develop a more predictive model. Drilling is expected to be completed later this fall, and the information is expected to be incorporated into the year-end 2015 mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates. A re-logging program has been completed on holes drilled between 2004 and 2011 on the Main Zone and the La India Zone. This resulted in the delineation of new geological domains containing gold bearing sulphide mineralization. Preliminary metallurgical testing of this material indicates that some transition and sulphide mineralization at La India may be heap leachable. Follow-up work is in progress with the potential to reassign some of the sulphide mineral inventory back into the mineral resource category. El Barqueno - Soltoro Acquisition Further Consolidates Land Position, Drilling Continues with a Focus on Resource Delineation The El Barqueno property in Jalisco State, Mexico now covers a land position of 41,112 hectares. Exploration by previous operators outlined several mineralized zones through surface exploration and diamond drilling, which in comparison is larger than the strike length of the mineralized systems at both the La India and Pinos Altos properties combined. In early June 2015, Agnico Eagle completed the acquisition of Soltoro Ltd., which added more than 30,000 hectares of property in the Barqueno district in Jalisco state, including the El Rayo silver-gold project and the El Tecolote property that are contiguous with and to the east of Agnico Eagle's El Barqueno property. The Company believes that the El Barqueno and surrounding properties have the potential to host significant gold-silver mineralization that could be developed as a combination open pit and underground mine with heap leach and/or mill processing facilities. In the second quarter of 2015, 60 holes totaling approximately 12,714 metres were drilled at El Barqueno. Work primarily focused on the Pena de Oro, Azteca-Zapoteca and Angostura zones. At Pena de Oro, drilling has been on 80 metre by 80 metre centres along a one kilometre strike length. The mineralization shows good continuity and remains open along strike and at depth. At Azteca-Zapoteca, mineralization extends for over one kilometre along strike and is also open at depth and along strike. The Company last reported results from these target areas on June 9, 2015, and additional results from these zones are expected to be released in the third quarter of 2015. The initial 2015 drill program was completed in June and a supplemental program has been approved to infill the mineralized areas as well as to test extensions to the known mineralization. Metallurgical and mineralogical studies have been commissioned to further increase the understanding of the mineral resource potential. An inferred/indicated mineral resource is expected to be completed by the end of the year for the Pena de Oro and Azteca-Zapoteca areas to open-pit mineable depths (surface to 200 metres depth). The Angostura prospect is also being studied for a potential inferred mineral resource estimate by year-end. An additional 10,000-metre reconnaissance drill program is being proposed to commence in the third quarter of the year. The program will be designed to test other new high-priority targets outside the main deposits such as the Zapote, Poncho East and West, Esperanza and Falco areas defined last year and earlier this year using prospecting, geological mapping and sampling, and geochemical (stream sediment and soil surveys) and geophysical (magnetic, radiometrics, and electromagnetic) surveys.

(TSE: AGU) Our vision to help feed the world responsibly means not only helping farmers grow more food, but doing it in ways that protect the environment, support economic vitality and enhance communities. One of the greatest challenges the global community has ever faced is how to sustainably feed a rapidly growing population. This challenge is complex and won't be solved quickly, but we believe we're stronger working together. By collaborating with multiple groups, we build long-term, impactful programs and solutions that we continually learn from and build upon. So that, together, we can feed the world responsibly and improve the lives of future generations. Agrium Reports Strong Results despite Challenging Market Conditions ALL AMOUNTS ARE STATED IN U.S. $ Agrium Inc. (TSX:AGU) (NYSE:AGU) announced today 2015 second quarter net earnings from continuing operations of $675-million ($4.71 diluted earnings per share), compared to $625-million ($4.34 diluted earnings per share) in the second quarter of 2014. The increase in earnings was supported by higher Wholesale volumes and lower production costs for most products. Retail results were impacted by lower crop prices, drought in Western Canada and wet conditions in the U.S. Corn Belt, which affected growers' decisions and limited the opportunities for use of certain crop inputs and services. Highlights: Second quarter adjusted net earnings of $701-million or $4.90 per share and $5.01 per share in the first half of 2015 on the same basis (see page 2 for adjusted net earnings reconciliation)(1). Strong nitrogen operational performance contributed to Wholesale gross profit of $409-million compared to $227-million in the second quarter of 2014. Our total ammonia production for the first half of 2015 was the highest since 2000. The Vanscoy potash facility continues to ramp-up production after completion of the expansion project and is hitting new daily production targets. Retail gross profit of $1.3-billion was 6 percent lower than the second quarter of 2014. Results were primarily impacted by lower earnings in Canadian retail and the lower Canadian dollar, as well as compression of seed margins across all regions. Repurchased $100-million or 952,053 shares since the beginning of April. 2015 annual guidance range narrowed to $7.00 to $7.50 diluted earnings per share (see page 3 for further detail). Revision to timeline and scope of Borger nitrogen expansion project. Agrium has exceeded its 2017 Operational Excellence targets of $350-million of one-time savings and $125-million of recurring EBITDA value through primarily our portfolio review, utilization rates, distribution network synergies, and cost reductions. \"Agrium's solid second quarter earnings were supported by the strong competitive advantages across our product portfolio, the diversity of our product and geographic mix and our continued focus on operational excellence. Wholesale delivered impressive results across all products, supported by lower costs and higher volumes. Retail earnings held up well despite approximately a 5 percent decline in crop input expenditures across the North America market and the impact of the severe weather conditions across this region. We believe we outperformed against our U.S. retail peers achieving an increase in U.S. normalized comparable store sales in a down market, a demonstration of the strength of our business model and market position,\" commented Chuck Magro, Agrium's President and CEO. \"Agrium is committed to delivering on our capital allocation vision as we execute our Operational Excellence initiatives, optimize our portfolio and continue to return capital to shareholders through future dividend growth and share repurchases,\" added Mr. Magro. Forecasted annual effective tax rate of 28 percent used for adjusted net earnings and per share calculations. These are non-IFRS measures which represent net earnings adjusted for certain income (expenses) that are considered to be non-operational in nature. We believe these measures provide meaningful comparison to the earnings of other companies by eliminating share-based payments expense (recovery), gains (losses) on foreign exchange, gains (losses) on non-qualifying derivative hedges and other one-time adjustments. These should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS and may not be directly comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. UPDATED ANNUAL 2015 GUIDANCE Based on our Market Outlook, Agrium expects to achieve annual diluted earnings per share of $7.00 to $7.50 in 2015 compared to our previous estimate of $7.00 to $8.25 per share. We have narrowed the guidance range due primarily to the impact of low crop prices on grower decisions and lower expected potash and phosphate pricing in the second half of the year relative to our previous guidance. We are assuming a normal fall season, recognizing there is risk to fall nutrient applications in regions impacted by drought or a delay in the North American harvest. As a result, our Retail EBITDA(4) for 2015 is now expected to be from $1.00-billion to $1.05-billion. This incorporates challenges that our Canadian retail operations face in 2015 due to the drought and lower crop prices, while our U.S. Retail operations is expected to achieve earnings in-line with 2014 levels. Our annual nitrogen and potash production targets remain unchanged. However, strong sales in the second quarter resulted in low beginning inventories to start the third quarter, which will impact sales volumes in this period. We have updated our finance costs range for 2015 to $240-million to $255-million to reflect a higher than anticipated cost of financing for our customer pre-payment programs. Our estimates of the Canada and U.S. foreign exchange rates and NYMEX for 2015 have been narrowed from our previous estimates based on current market conditions. We have also updated the range for our annual effective tax rate for 2015 to 28 percent to 29 percent to reflect the impact of the recently announced increase to the Alberta corporate income tax rate effective July 1, 2015, increasing from 10 percent to 12 percent. As a result, we had a one-time deferred tax liability charge in the second quarter, which contributed to the increase in our annual effective tax rate for 2015. This guidance and updated additional measures and related assumptions are summarized in the table on page 3. Guidance excludes the impact of share-based payments expense (recovery), gains (losses) on foreign exchange and non-qualifying derivative hedges. Represents diluted per share information attributable to equity holders of Agrium. One-time adjustment mainly relates to the increase in current and deferred taxes due to an increase in the Alberta corporate income tax rate. Forecasted annual effective tax rate of 28 percent used for adjusted net earnings and per share calculations. Earnings (loss) from continuing operations before finance costs, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. This is a non-IFRS measure.

Sales and gross profit Retail sales and gross profit decreased for the second quarter and first half of 2015 compared to the same periods last year primarily due to unfavorable weather conditions and competitive pricing pressure as a result of lower crop prices and reduced U.S. corn acreage which impacted our crop nutrients and seed sales and margins. Wholesale's nitrogen and phosphate sales and gross profit increased for the second quarter and first half of 2015 compared to the same periods last year as a result of higher nitrogen volumes, higher ammonia and phosphate realized selling prices, lower natural gas costs and manufacturing cost efficiencies. Product purchased for resale had lower sales and gross profit as a result of the 2014 strategic review that led to Agrium exiting portions of this business. Overall, Wholesale had higher gross profit for the second quarter and first half of 2015 compared to the same periods last year. Expenses General and administrative expense decreased by $16-million for the second quarter and $18-million for the first half of 2015 compared to the same periods last year as a result of reduced payroll and office expense costs as we began to realize reductions related to our Operational Excellence program. Share-based payments Due primarily to Agrium's share price increases in 2015, our share-based payments expense increased by $22-million for the second quarter and $36-million for the first half of 2015 compared to the same periods last year. Other Expenses (Income) We began to designate all of our natural gas derivatives as qualifying hedges for accounting purposes beginning January 1, 2015 and, accordingly, we no longer have natural gas derivatives not designated as hedges. The related gains or losses are recorded as part of cost of product sold when we sell the related product and unrealized gains or losses are recorded in equity. Previously, we recorded these natural gas derivative gains and losses directly to other expenses, resulting in natural gas derivative gains of $32-million in the first half of 2014. We completed the sale of our Niota and Meredosia storage and distribution facilities in the first quarter of 2015 resulting in a gain on sale of assets of $38-million. Environmental remediation and asset retirement obligations expense decreased for the second quarter and first half of 2015 compared to the same periods last year as higher provisions were recorded for our plant and mine sites in 2014. Effective Tax Rate The effective tax rates on continuing operations were 30 percent for the second quarter and 29 percent for the first half of 2015 and are higher than the effective tax rate of 28 percent for both the second quarter and first half of last year due to an increase in deferred taxes relating to the increase in the Alberta corporate income tax rate. BUSINESS SEGMENT PERFORMANCE Retail sales and gross profit were lower than the same period last year due to lower prices for all crops this spring and reduced corn acreage in the U.S. North American operations were also impacted by the drought in Western Canada and California and excessive moisture across the U.S. Corn Belt and the southern and northeastern states during June. The wet conditions in the U.S. Corn Belt impacted total seeded acreage and the ability of growers to apply nutrients and crop protection products in late spring. Regionally, the U.S. EBITDA contribution was lower by $12-million over the same period last year, while South America was also lower. Canadian results accounted for the majority of the variance in EBITDA compared to the second quarter of 2014, while Australia was the only region to report an increase in EBITDA this quarter. Retail selling expenses as a percentage of sales were unchanged year-over-year on realization of Operational Excellence initiatives. Total nutrient sales were 4 percent lower compared to the same period last year, primarily due to lower average nutrient selling prices. Total nutrient volumes were 1 percent lower this quarter across our Retail operations compared to the same period last year. Virtually all of the reduction was due to lower demand in Canada related to drought conditions and lower crop prices. Nutrient sales volumes in the U.S. were up 2 percent this quarter, despite lower corn and total seeded acreage this year. Nutrient sales volumes were marginally lower in our international markets due to dry conditions and lower planted wheat acreage in both our South American and Australian markets. Nutrient margins on a per tonne basis were lower across all regions, with the largest decline in Canada, but only a 4 percent reduction in the U.S. and Australia compared to the same quarter last year. The significant weakening in the Canadian dollar in 2015 had an estimated $10/tonne negative impact on nutrient margins in our Canadian operations. Crop protection products Total crop protection sales were down 1 percent year-over-year, mostly as a result of dry conditions in Australia and South America and foreign exchange differences in the businesses outside of the U.S. North American crop protection sales increased slightly compared to last year, despite significant industry headwinds this spring. The increase was a result of higher herbicide and insecticide sales in our U.S. operations despite the wet conditions during June across the U.S. Corn Belt. Crop protection margins as a percentage of sales increased year-over-year, largely due to the strength of the performance from our Loveland proprietary product line, which registered over a 10 percent increase in sales this quarter and gained a further 2 percentage points increase in the proportion of Loveland's sales out of our total crop protection sales. Seed The lower crop price environment this spring had the largest impact on the seed business. Seed sales and margins were negatively impacted by competitive pressures between suppliers and some trading down by growers in terms of seed genetics. The reduction was also due to a shift in crop mix from corn and cotton to soybeans, as well as significant unseeded soybean acreage in the U.S. due to the wet weather later this spring. Seed margins as a percentage of sales decreased by 2 percent from the second quarter of 2014; however, higher margin Dyna-Gro seed sales showed a year-over-year increase in sales which helped mitigate some of the impact on seed results. Merchandise Merchandise sales decreased compared to the same period last year as a result of lower fuel prices and lower equipment sales in Canadian retail and lower merchandise sales in Australia as part of our stock keeping unit (\"SKU\") rationalization, which has had a positive impact on Australian working capital leverage. Gross profit and gross margin as a percentage of sales were higher this quarter due to a decrease in lower margin Canadian fuel sales and higher overall product prices in the Australian business which consistently has higher margin products. Services and other Sales and gross profit for application services and other were both down 3 percent compared to the same period last year. The decline was due to reduction in the Canadian and Australian markets related to dry weather conditions. Nitrogen gross profit increased 167 percent compared to the same period last year due to higher sales volumes and lower cost of product sold. This was partially offset by lower urea and UAN prices in the current quarter. Sales volumes increased by 35 percent over the same period last year due to stronger operating rates and a greater draw-down in inventories this year. Cost of product sold for nitrogen decreased from the second quarter of 2014. The reduction in per tonne costs was primarily due to significantly lower natural gas prices, stronger operating rates and the weaker Canadian dollar. Nitrogen margins reached $220 per tonne this quarter, almost double last year's level. Potash Potash gross profit decreased in the current quarter due to lower total sales tonnes than the same period last year, partially offset by higher realized sales prices. Sales volumes were 10 percent lower this quarter due to low opening inventories as the Vanscoy facility gradually ramps up to full production after the completion of the expansion project at the end of 2014. Vanscoy's production this quarter was 460,000 tonnes, in line with the targeted level. Realized sales prices were higher than the same period last year. Overall potash prices rose in both domestic and international markets, but with a stronger increase in international markets. Cost of product sold was higher than the same period last year due to lower production volumes and higher maintenance costs associated with the planned turnaround at Vanscoy in June this quarter. As a result, cash cost of product manufactured was $110 per tonne this quarter compared to last year at $92 per tonne. Phosphate Phosphate gross profit increased due to a combination of higher volumes, lower costs and an improvement in sales price relative to the previous year. Sales volumes increased by 8 percent due to higher product availability and sales prices were $67 per tonne higher than the same quarter last year as a result of tight regional supply and demand fundamentals. Overall phosphate margins were $102 per tonne this quarter, an $80 per tonne increase over the same period last year. Wholesale Other Gross profit for Wholesale's Other product category decreased this quarter primarily due to lower sales volumes and margins in the product purchased for resale business as these operations were significantly scaled back as part of our portfolio review. ESN(r) gross profit increased this quarter due to higher sales volumes and lower cost of product sold. Other EBITDA for our other non-operating business unit for the second quarter of 2015 had net earnings of $3-million, compared to a net expense of $6-million for the second quarter of 2014. The variance was due to the following: A $12-million higher gross profit recovery for the second quarter of 2015 compared to the second quarter of 2014. This is a result of lower inter-segment inventory held at the end of the second quarter; A $12-million decrease in environmental remediation liability expense as higher provisions were recorded for our plant and mine sites in 2014; and, A $22-million increase in share-based payments expense related to a strengthening in the fair value of our share-based payment plans against our peer group. Summary of Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Our investing capital expenditures decreased in the first half of 2015 compared to the first half of 2014 due to the completion of the tie-in of our Vanscoy potash facility expansion in the fourth quarter of 2014, partially offset by increased expenditures relating to the Borger nitrogen expansion project. We incurred investing capital expenditures amounting to $192-million for the expansion of the Borger nitrogen facility. The timeline and scope of the Borger nitrogen expansion project have been revised. The refresh of the existing ammonia facility and the new 610,000 tonne urea facility will be completed as planned; however, the completion date has been extended to the end of 2016 in order to manage costs, and the 145,000 tonne ammonia expansion portion of the project has been cancelled to minimize project risk. The total capital expenditure for the revised scope is expected to be within 5 percent of the $720-million estimate. We expect Agrium's remaining capital spending to approximate $500-million to $600-million in 2015. We anticipate that we will be able to finance the announced projects through a combination of cash provided from operating activities and existing credit facilities. Short-term Debt Our short-term debt of $681-million at June 30, 2015 is outlined in note 5 of our Summarized Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our short-term debt increased by $416-million during the three months ended June 30, 2015, which in turn contributed to a decrease in our unutilized short-term financing capacity to $2.2-billion as at June 30, 2015. Capital Management Our revolving credit facilities require that we maintain specific interest coverage and debt-to-capital ratios, as well as other non-financial covenants as defined in our credit agreements. We were in compliance with all covenants at June 30, 2015. NORMAL COURSE ISSUER BID In January 2015, the Toronto Stock Exchange (\"TSX\") accepted Agrium's notice of intention to make a normal course issuer bid (\"NCIB\") whereby Agrium may purchase up to 7,185,866 common shares on the TSX and New York Stock Exchange during the period from January 26, 2015 to January 25, 2016. During the six months ended June 30, 2015, we purchased 952,053 shares at an average share price of $104.99 for total consideration of $100-million. There were no share repurchases subsequent to June 30, 2015. Shareholders can obtain a copy of the NCIB notice submitted to the TSX from Agrium without charge upon request. OUTSTANDING SHARE DATA Agrium had 142,791,278 outstanding shares at July 31, 2015. At that date, under our stock option plans, shares expected to be issued for options outstanding were negligible. The agricultural products business is seasonal in nature. Consequently, comparisons made on a year-over-year basis are more appropriate than quarter-over-quarter comparisons. Crop input sales are primarily concentrated in the spring and fall crop input application seasons. Crop nutrient inventories are normally accumulated leading up to each application season. Our cash collections from accounts receivables generally occur after the application season is complete and our customer prepayments are mostly concentrated in December and January. ADDITIONAL IFRS AND NON-IFRS FINANCIAL MEASURES Certain financial measures in this MD&A are not prescribed by IFRS. We consider these financial measures discussed herein to provide useful information to both management and investors in measuring our financial performance and financial condition. In general, an additional IFRS financial measure is a measure relevant to understanding a company's financial performance that is not a minimum financial statement measure mandated by IFRS. A non-IFRS financial measure generally either excludes or includes amounts not excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS. Non-IFRS financial measures are not recognized measures under IFRS and our method of calculation is unlikely to be directly comparable to that of other companies. These non-IFRS measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES We prepare our financial statements in accordance with IFRS, which requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates in applying accounting policies. For further information on the Company's critical accounting estimates, refer to the section \"Critical Accounting Estimates\" in our 2014 annual MD&A, which is contained in our 2014 Annual Report. Since the date of our 2014 annual MD&A, there have not been any material changes to our critical accounting estimates. BUSINESS RISKS The information presented in the \"Enterprise Risk Management\" section on pages 64 - 68 in our 2014 Annual Report and under the heading \"Risk Factors\" on pages 22 - 31 in our 2014 Annual Information Form has not changed materially since December 31, 2014. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2015 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PUBLIC SECURITIES FILINGS MARKET OUTLOOK Prospects for global crop prices have improved since June due to less than ideal weather conditions across a number of geographies. Excessive moisture in the U.S. Corn Belt has led to the deterioration in crops and led to lower than anticipated planted acreage in some areas. Severe drought across much of Western Canada has also reduced yield expectations. While new crop futures prices have recently declined, the rally in crop prices in late June and early July is evidence of how sensitive global crop supply and demand is to relatively small changes in yield expectations. In areas with excessive moisture, it has been difficult to get equipment into the fields to apply crop nutrients and crop protection products, which in some cases has led to missed applications. In drought areas growers have in some cases sought to reduce crop nutrient and crop protection applications on struggling crops. The prospects outside of drought impacted areas are more positive for the remainder of 2015 as stronger prices in early July offered growers higher priced selling opportunities and improved grower sentiment. Furthermore, in areas with excess moisture, the wet conditions tend to lead to increased disease pressure, supporting fungicide demand. Following the end of the northern hemisphere's spring application season, crop nutrient prices have generally weakened, driven by the seasonal slow-down in demand. Tightened Chinese urea export supplies and seasonal demand fuelled an increase in urea prices in-season. However, the expectation of a return of increased Chinese supply to the export market, combined with new exportable supply in Algeria, Saudi Arabia and the U.S. in the second half of the year have pressured global prices. We expect Chinese anthracite-based urea costs to continue to provide a floor to the urea market in the second half of 2015, and that Indian import demand will be strong, particularly in light of the strong start to the monsoon season. Potash shipments to China and India have been robust in recent months and are expected to provide a solid base to global demand in the second half of 2015. In contrast, Brazilian demand has been relatively slow, down 21 percent year-over-year in the first half of 2015. However, we expect the pace of demand to improve in the third quarter, in advance of the domestic planting season. Following the spring season, North American potash prices declined, significantly narrowing the premium relative to other major global markets. The phosphate market has been relatively stable, with robust Indian demand offset by relatively weak Brazilian import demand and record Chinese DAP/MAP exports.

Barrick Gold Corporation (TSX: ABX) Our vision is the generation of wealth through responsible mining wealth for our owners, our people, and the countries and communities with which we partner. We aim to be the leading mining company focused on gold, growing our cash flow per share by developing and operating high quality assets through disciplined allocation of human and financial capital and operational excellence. Those who founded and first led the company were committed to a culture of partnership and the values underpinning such a culture: trust, transparency, shared responsibility and accountability, and a sense of emotional and financial ownership. The company is returning to its roots as a lean and nimble organization, with minimal bureaucracy. A small head office manages the company with a balance of entrepreneurialism and prudence, focusing on only a few core activities: defining and implementing strategy, allocating human and financial capital, and fulfilling the obligations required of a public company. Leaders at the operational level have greater autonomy, responsibility, and accountability, functioning as business owners. Free from bureaucracy and middle management, they are focused on maximizing free cash flow, and the head office is focused on allocating that cash flow to maximize shareholder returns. Barrick has mining operations in Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile, Dominican Republic, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Saudi Arabia, United States and Zambia. More than 75 percent of the company's gold production comes from the Americas region. Barrick Reports Second Quarter 2015 Results Company reported a net loss of $9 million ($0.01 per share) in the second quarter; adjusted net earnings were $60 million ($0.05 per share)1. Free cash flow was $26 million1 and operating cash flow was $525 million. Production in the second quarter was 1.45 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs (AISC) of $895 per ounce1. Full-year gold production is now expected to be 6.1-6.4 million ounces, reflecting the impact of asset sales. All-in sustaining cost guidance for 2015 has been reduced to $840-$880 per ounce. Total debt reduced by approximately $250 million in first half. $2.45 billion in asset sales and joint ventures announced to date. Targeting $2 billion in reduced expenditures across the company by the end of 2016. Capital and other expenditures reduced by $240 million in the second quarter. Lowered quarterly dividend to two cents per share. Scenario planning completed for gold prices down to $900 per ounce. On track to achieve approximately $50 million in G&A cost savings in 2015, exceeding original $30 million target for the year. Targeting $90 million in annualized savings in 2016, up from original target of $70 million. Completed Preliminary Economic Assessments on projects with the potential to significantly extend mine life at Lagunas Norte and Pueblo Viejo. TORONTO, August 5, 2015 -- Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:ABX)(TSX:ABX) (Barrick or the \"company\") reported a net loss of $9 million ($0.01 per share) for the second quarter, with adjusted net earnings of $60 million ($0.05 per share). Free cash flow was $26 million, compared to negative free cash flow of $128 million in the prior year period. Operating cash flow in the second quarter was $525 million. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $725 million1. On an unadjusted basis, EBITDA was $690 million. Gold production guidance for 2015 has been adjusted to 6.1-6.4 million ounces to reflect the impact of divestments, with production 55 percent weighted to the second half of the year. Costs are expected to be 10 percent lower in the second half of 2015. Full-year all-in sustaining cost guidance is $840-$880 per ounce, down from $860-$895 per ounce. The implementation of a lean, decentralized operating model designed to maximize free cash flow and take costs out of the business has helped to mitigate the impact of recent gold price declines. We have cut $300 million in capital spending so far this year and are on track to achieve $90 million in reduced general and administrative (G&A) expenditures by 2016. We have also made significant progress on our debt reduction target. Our current focus is on improving productivity and reducing operating costs to ensure our business is robust enough to generate a 10-15 percent return on invested capital through the metal price cycle. STRENGTHENING THE BALANCE SHEET Earlier this year, we set a debt reduction target of $3 billion for 2015. Thus far, we have announced agreements representing$2.45 billion from asset sales, joint ventures and streaming. In addition, we have also retired approximately $250 million in debt using cash on hand in the first half of this year. Collectively, these actions represent $2.7 billion, or 90 percent of our target. Transactions announced to date include: Sale of 100 percent of the Cowal mine for $550 million in cash, further focusing the geographic footprint of our portfolio by divesting the last Barrick-operated mine in Australia. Sale of a 50 percent interest in Barrick (Niugini) Ltd. for $298 million in cash2, establishing a long-term strategic partnership with China's Zijin Mining. Sale of a 50 percent interest in the Zaldivar copper mine for $1.005 billion in cash2, realizing significant value from a non-core operation while maintaining a sizeable stake in this cash-generating asset. This transaction has also resulted in a new partnership with Antofagasta Plc, one of the world's leading copper companies, with significant opportunities to collaborate on potential projects in the future. Streaming agreement on a portion of Barrick's share of gold and silver production from Pueblo Viejo for $610 million in cash2, structured to maintain significant exposure to higher metal prices. With a $4 billion undrawn credit facility and $2.1 billion in cash on hand at the end of the second quarter, we will continue to pursue our debt reduction target in a disciplined manner and will take only those actions that make sense for the business, on terms we consider favorable to our shareholders. Additional asset divestments Over the last several months, Barrick has received a number of proposals and expressions of interest relating to the proposed acquisition of various non-core assets in Nevada and Montana. Over the next several weeks, we intend to commence a formal process to sell Bald Mountain, Round Mountain (50 percent interest), Spring Valley (70 percent interest), Ruby Hill, Hilltop and Golden Sunlight. These assets represent an attractive portfolio of producing and development-stage assets in a politically stable and highly prospective region. OPERATIONAL FOCUS Our strategy is focused on maximizing free cash flow per share from a portfolio of high-quality gold assets in our core regions, underpinned by disciplined capital allocation and operational excellence. In the past six months, we have taken significant actions to improve our business plans, resulting in positive free cash flow in the second quarter. We remain focused on improving productivity and driving down costs to ensure we can continue to generate free cash flow in the current gold price environment. Anticipating the potential for weaker gold prices in the second half of 2015, we challenged our leaders to cut spending by $1 billion. We have now increased this target. By the end of 2016, we are targeting $2 billion in reduced expenditures across the company. These reductions will come from operating expenses, capital spending and corporate overhead. We have identified$1.4 billion in potential opportunities to date. This will strengthen the resilience of our portfolio in a lower gold price environment, while positioning us to deliver stronger margins when gold prices recover. These efforts are benefiting from the outcomes of our Value Realization reviews, which have now been completed for all operations. This process has identified concrete projects to maximize free cash flow, extend mine lives and lower costs. The reviews also support non-core asset sales by ensuring we understand the full value of every mine before proceeding with any divestiture. For details on key Value Realization opportunities identified at Lagunas Norte and Pueblo Viejo, please see Appendix 1 on page 9. For certain related risk factors please see the cautionary statement on forward-looking information at the end of this press release. We have also carried out a series of scenario planning exercises that detail actions we can take to optimize mine plans and increase flexibility in a lower gold price environment. These actions include: Adjust life-of-mine plans to maximize short-term free cash flow Place higher-cost operations on temporary care and maintenance Defer stripping activities Close or divest mines that do not meet capital allocation objectives Increase cut-off grades Reduce mining/processing rates Further reduce G&A and exploration Further reduce sustaining capital Process higher-grade stockpiles Capital Costs As we continue to review all expenditures for 2015 and 2016, we are cancelling or deferring spending that does not meet our capital allocation objectives, which include, first and foremost, the ability to meet a hurdle rate of 15 percent. In the second quarter, we identified $240 million in reductions that have now been removed from our plans. Total capital expenditures for 2015 are now expected to be $1.6-$1.9 billion , 20 percent lower than in 2014. Exploration expenditures are now expected to be $180-$220 million, a reduction of 17 percent from our original 2015 guidance. Sixty-five percent of our exploration budget is allocated to mine site exploration, with 35 percent directed at greenfield projects, primarily on our newest discovery Alturas and the El Indio belt. Reductions identified in the second quarter include: Sustaining capital reduced by $100 million to $1.4-$1.6 billion; Expansion capital reduced by $50 million to $100-$150 million, driven by efficiencies and reductions at Turquoise Ridge,Cortez and Ruby Hill; Project capital reduced by $50 million to $100-$150 million, primarily reflecting reductions at Pascua-Lama and Spring Valley; and Exploration budget reduced by $40 million to $180-$220 million, focusing expenditures on our most promising opportunities where we see the highest potential returns. G&A Expenses We are focused on reducing costs and improving productivity across the entire business. Excluding severance and one-time costs, the company is on track to capture approximately $50 million in savings from reduced G&A expenditures and overhead costs in 2015, exceeding our original target of $30 million for the year. We expect to reach $90 million in annualized G&A savings by 2016. FINANCIAL DISCUSSION Second quarter 2015 adjusted net earnings were $60 million ($0.05 per share) compared to $159 million ($0.14 per share) in the prior year period. The net loss for the quarter was $9 million ($0.01 per share) compared to a net loss of $269 million ($0.23 per share) in the prior year quarter. Lower adjusted net earnings reflect lower gold sales and lower realized gold and copper prices compared to the prior year period. Significant adjusting items for the quarter (net of tax and non-controlling interest effects) include: $22 million in impairment charges primarily related to power assets at Pueblo Viejo; $30 million in unrealized foreign currency translation losses; $17 million in costs related to the closure of our Perth office; and A $15 million positive adjustment reflecting the impact of the increase in the discount rate used to calculate the provision for environmental remediation at closed mines. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $725 million compared to $990 million in the prior year period. On an unadjusted basis, EBITDA was $690 million for the second quarter compared to $478 million in the prior year period. Operating cash flow was $525 million compared to $488 million in the prior year period. The company generated positive free cash flow of $26 million in the second quarter compared to an outflow of $128 million in the prior year period, reflecting higher operating cash flow and lower capital expenditures as a result of the company's continued emphasis on rigorous capital discipline. The Board of Directors has decided to reduce the company's quarterly dividend by 60 percent, from five cents per share to two cents per share. The Board believes this reduction is a prudent measure to increase financial flexibility in light of current market conditions. The dividend will be paid on September 15, 2015 to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 31, 20153. The Board has approved a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the \"DRIP\"), which we intend to make available to eligible shareholders for the first time with payment of the above-mentioned dividend on September 15, 2015 to shareholders of record on August 31, 2015. The DRIP will allow registered or beneficial holders of Barrick's common shares who reside in Canada or the United Statesto reinvest cash dividends paid on their common shares in additional common shares at a discount to the average market price (as defined in the DRIP), currently set at three percent and subject to change at the discretion of the Board. Additional details about the DRIP and enrollment instructions will be provided at a later date. OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS AND GUIDANCE Reflecting the divestiture of Cowal and 50 percent of Barrick (Niugini) Ltd., 2015 gold production is now anticipated to be 6.1-6.4 million ounces at reduced AISC of $840-$880 per ounce. Production is 55 percent weighted to the second half of the year, primarily due to higher planned production at Goldstrike, Cortez and Pueblo Viejo. Third quarter AISC are expected to be lower than our AISC in the first half of the year, and fourth quarter AISC are expected to be significantly lower than the third quarter, driven largely by higher production at Goldstrike, Pueblo Viejo and Cortez in the second half of the year. Cortez The Cortez mine produced 193,000 ounces at AISC of $811 per ounce in the second quarter. Production benefited from positive grade reconciliations in the Cortez Hills open pit and improved underground productivity, as well as from some initial treatment of refractory ore through Goldstrike's thiosulfate (TCM) process. AISC were positively impacted by higher production, lower operating costs and lower sustaining capital. Production in 2015 is forecast to be 825,000-900,000 ounces at AISC of $760-$835 per ounce. Production in the second half is fourth-quarter weighted as the open pit transitions into higher-grade ore and as the ramp-up of the TCM circuit at Goldstrike allows for additional processing of refractory ore from Cortez. Goldstrike The Goldstrike mine contributed 206,000 ounces in the second quarter, in line with plan. AISC of $732 per ounce were better than expected on higher tonnes and grades from the underground operation, as well as lower sustaining capital. Grades and recoveries from the TCM circuit continue to be consistent with feasibility results. Several adjustments were implemented to improve the throughput of the circuit during the commissioning phase and the process is expected to ramp up on schedule this year. Production and AISC guidance for 2015 is 1.00-1.15 million ounces and $700-$800 per ounce. The third quarter is expected to be the stronger of the two remaining quarters on higher anticipated open pit grades. Pueblo Viejo Barrick's 60 percent share of production from Pueblo Viejo for the second quarter was 131,000 ounces at AISC of $682 per ounce. Production in the quarter was lower than planned due to lower gold recoveries, largely related to a higher proportion of carbonaceous ore. AISC were also impacted by lower silver recoveries associated with a temporary shutdown of the lime boil process during scheduled autoclave maintenance. Recent modifications to the lime boil are showing significantly improved silver recoveries and the first copper concentrate was shipped in the second quarter. Attributable production in 2015 is forecast to be 625,000-675,000 ounces at AISC of $540-$590 per ounce. Production is expected to be higher and costs lower in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter on higher-expected grades, improved recoveries and better autoclave availability, as maintenance shutdowns were weighted to the first half of 2015. Lagunas Norte The Lagunas Norte mine contributed 155,000 ounces at AISC of $509 per ounce in the second quarter. Production was in line with expectations while AISC were better than plan on lower sustaining capital. Production in 2015 is anticipated to be 600,000-650,000 ounces at AISC of $600-$650 per ounce. Veladero The Veladero mine produced 151,000 ounces of gold in the second quarter, in line with plan. AISC of $961 per ounce benefited from higher than expected sales and lower sustaining capital. Production guidance for 2015 is 575,000-625,000 ounces at AISC of $950-$1,035 per ounce, with second half costs expected to be highest in the third quarter related to capitalize stripping and sustaining capital, as well as lower byproduct credits. Turquoise Ridge The Turquoise Ridge mine contributed 52,000 ounces (75 percent basis), in line with expectations. AISC of $780 per ounce reflect higher sustaining capital associated with the focus on growing production and improving ventilation. Costs are expected to be highest in the third quarter related to these efforts as well as to feasibility and detailed engineering work for the second shaft project. The mine is forecast to produce 175,000-200,000 ounces (75 percent basis) in 2015 at AISC of $775-$825 per ounce. Porgera The Porgera mine produced 118,000 ounces (95 percent basis), slightly below plan on lower open pit grades. AISC of $1,128 per ounce were lower than expected as a result of lower capitalized stripping costs due to fewer waste tonnes mined and lower sustaining capital. Reflecting the partial divestiture, attributable production in 2015 is now expected to be 400,000-450,000 ounces at AISC of $1,025-$1,125 per ounce. Other Mines Barrick's other mines -- consisting of Bald Mountain, Round Mountain, Golden Sunlight, Ruby Hill, Hemlo , Cowal, KCGM and Pierina -- contributed 320,000 ounces at AISC of $895 per ounce in the second quarter. An improved closure plan at Pierina is expected to contribute approximately 270,000 ounces over the next three-and-a-half years for minimal capital. Acacia Mining Barrick's share of second quarter production was 119,000 ounces at AISC of $1,149 per ounce. Attributable 2015 production from Acacia is anticipated to be 480,000-510,000 ounces at AISC of $1,050-$1,100 per ounce. Production will be weighted to the second half of 2015, driven by operational improvements and a planned ramp-up at Bulyanhulu. Global Copper Copper production in the second quarter was 115 million pounds at C1 cash costs of $1.94 per pound. For 2015, copper production is anticipated to be 480-520 million pounds at C1 cash costs of $1.75-$2.00 per pound. Lumwana contributed 63 million pounds at C1 cash costs of $2.01 per pound in the second quarter, in line with expectations. The Zambian government has ratified amendments to the country's mining tax regime that replaced the recently-adopted 20 percent gross royalty on open pit mines with a nine percent royalty, and reintroduced a 30 percent corporate income tax and a 15 percent variable profits tax. Production is anticipated to be 250-270 million pounds at C1 cash costs of $1.90-$2.15 per pound in 2015. Production of 52 million pounds at Zaldivar at C1 cash costs of $1.85 per pound in the second quarter was in line with plan. Production for 2015 is anticipated to be 230-250 million pounds at C1 cash costs of $1.65-$1.95 per pound. At Jabal Sayid, first shipments of low-cost copper-in-concentrate are anticipated in early 2016. Once the mine reaches full production, the average annual output is expected to be 100 million pounds per year with the potential to increase to 130 million pounds. Lagunas Norte Refractory Material Mine Life Extension Project: Since it began operations in 2005, Lagunas Norte has outperformed production expectations and become one of our most profitable mines. In 2014, the mine produced 582,000 ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of $543 per ounce. In its early years, production peaked at more than one million ounces per year. To date, Lagunas Norte has operated as an oxide heap leach mine. The mine will transition from oxide ore into mixed oxide/refractory material as it approaches the end of its current mine life in 2018. We have now completed a Preliminary Economic Assessment (\"PEA\") on a plan to extend the life of Lagunas Norte by approximately 12 years by mining the refractory material below the oxide ore body in the current pit. The refractory material cannot be economically processed using heap leaching due to low recoveries. The plan contemplates the installation of a new grinding-flotation-autoclave processing circuit to treat the refractory material. Work has begun on a Pre-Feasibility Study (\"PFS\") to further assess the technical and financial viability of, and risks associated with, the project, which has the potential to add nearly two million ounces of measured and indicated gold resources that are not currently included in the mine's existing mineral reserves and resources. Based on the preliminary analysis completed to date, Barrick expects that approximately $500 million would be required to build the facilities necessary to treat the refractory material. The PEA for this initiative will be incorporated in an updated technical report prepared by Barrick's independent technical advisor, Roscoe Postle Associates Inc. (\"RPA\"), which Barrick intends to file within 45 days. We expect to complete the PFS on this opportunity by the end of 2015. The table below summarizes the mineral resources associated with the Refractory Material Mine Life Extension Project that, except as otherwise noted, are not included in the mine's mineral resource statement as at December 31, 2014. Gold Mineral Resources Associated with the Refractory Material Mine Life Extension Project Notes: Mineral resources have been estimated as at December 31, 2014 based on a gold price of $1,400 per ounce. All estimates have been made in accordance with the standards of the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum in National Instrument 43-101. Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. Gold cut-off grades ranged from 0.48 g/t to 1.00 g/t depending on the material type. Gold recovery as a result of this initiative is expected to reach an average of 90 percent. Numbers may not add due to rounding. Includes 2.013 million tonnes of measured and indicated resources grading 1.15 g/t gold (74 thousand contained ounces of gold) that were previously reported in the mine's resource statement as at December 31, 2014. This material is expected to be reclaimed from the existing leach facility and reprocessed through the new facility for this initiative. The PEA for the Refractory Material Mine Life Extension Project is preliminary in nature and is based in part on inferred resources which are considered too speculative geologically to have economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and there is no certainty that the PEA will be realized. Pueblo Viejo Expansion of Tailings Storage Capacity: Pueblo Viejo is one of the world's largest, lowest-cost gold mines. In 2014, Barrick's 60 percent share of production from the Pueblo Viejo mine was approximately 665,000 ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of$588 per ounce. As reported in the mine's resource statement as at December 31, 2014, in addition to existing reserves, Pueblo Viejo has approximately six million ounces of gold and 37 million ounces of silver in the measured and indicated resource category (Barrick's 60 percent share). A significant portion of these resources are not currently included in reserves due to tailings storage constraints. We have completed a PEA evaluating a plan to remove these constraints to tailings capacity, which if implemented could allow Barrick to significantly extend the life of the mine. Barrick expects to complete further engineering work and commission a PFS in the second half of 2016 to refine the technical and financial analysis for the increase in tailings storage capacity and confirm whether the measured and indicated resources described above can be brought into reserves. Conversion of Power Plant and Lime Kilns to Natural Gas Fuel: Energy is one of the biggest cost drivers at any mining operation. We have completed a PFS on an initiative to reduce energy costs at Pueblo Viejo by converting the fuel supply for the Quisqueya I power plant that supplies electricity to the mine to natural gas from more expensive heavy fuel oil, and retrofitting the lime kilns to burn natural gas instead of diesel. The power plant was originally designed to operate on multiple fuel types, including natural gas. The PFS evaluated the delivery and use of liquid or compressed natural gas to the mine and power plant. Barrick is currently engaged in negotiations regarding the supply of natural gas to the Quisqueya I power plant and the Pueblo Viejo mine. If a supply agreement is successfully negotiated, this initiative to transition to natural gas could be implemented as early as 2017. Barrick anticipates that the conversion of the power plant and lime kilns at the mine site will require only minimal capital investment by Pueblo Viejo and that all capital costs associated with the construction of the natural gas infrastructure including the necessary natural gas pipeline to the power plant would be borne by the natural gas supplier.

Cameco Corporation (TSE: CCJ) Cameco is one of the world's largest uranium producers accounting for about 16% of the global production from its mines in Canada, the US and Kazakhstan. Our leading position is backed by about 429 million pounds of proven and probable reserves and extensive resources. Cameco reports second quarter financial results SASKATOON, SASKATCHEWAN--(July 30, 2015) ALL AMOUNTS ARE STATED IN CDN $ (UNLESS NOTED) higher revenue and gross profit for the quarter and first six months average realized uranium price outperforming spot and long-term market prices strong uranium production for the quarter, maintaining annual production and sales targets Cameco (TSX:CCO)(NYSE:CCJ) today reported its consolidated financial and operating results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2015 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). \"The company continues to perform well,\" said Tim Gitzel, president and CEO, \"despite the tough market conditions. \"Despite some supply disruptions in the first half of the year, prices and demand remained 'flat' due to the current oversupply in the market. However, the long-term outlook for nuclear energy, underpinned by strong fundamentals, remains positive. With the long-term view in mind, we remain focused on keeping costs down and running our operations safely and efficiently to ensure we maintain the flexibility to respond to market conditions as they evolve.\" SECOND QUARTER Net earnings attributed to equity holders this quarter were $88 million ($0.22 per share diluted) compared to net earnings of $127 million ($0.32 per share diluted) in the second quarter of 2014. In addition to the items noted below, our net earnings were affected by mark-to-market gains on foreign exchange derivatives. On an adjusted basis, our earnings this quarter were $46 million ($0.12 per share diluted) compared to $79 million ($0.20 per share diluted) (non-IFRS measure, see section) in the second quarter of 2014. The change was mainly due to: higher administrative costs a favourable settlement of $28 million with respect to a dispute regarding a long-term supply contract with a utility customer recorded in the second quarter of 2014 Partially offset by: higher gross profit from uranium and fuel services segments settlement costs of $12 million with respect to the early redemption our Series C debentures recorded during the second quarter of 2014 See Financial results by segment below for more detailed discussion. FIRST SIX MONTHS Net earnings in the first six months of the year were $79 million ($0.20 per share diluted) compared to $259 million ($0.65 per share diluted) in the first six months of 2014. In addition to the items noted below, our net earnings were affected by mark-to-market losses on foreign exchange derivatives. Our 2014 earnings also included a gain on the sale of our interest in BPLP of $127 million. On an adjusted basis, our earnings for the first six months of this year were $115 million ($0.29 per share diluted) (non-IFRS measure, see section) unchanged from the first six months of 2014. Key variances include: higher administration costs a favourable settlement of $28 million with respect to a dispute regarding a long-term supply contract with a utility customer recorded in the second quarter of 2014 lower tax recovery Partially offset by: higher gross profit from our uranium, fuel services and NUKEM segments lower losses from equity accounted investments Our 2014 adjusted net earnings were also impacted by: an early termination fee of $18 million incurred in 2014 as a result of the cancellation of our toll conversion agreement with Springfields Fuels Ltd. (SFL), which was to expire in 2016 settlement costs of $12 million with respect to the early redemption our Series C debentures recorded in 2014 See financial results by segment below for more detailed discussion. Also of note: Ken Seitz, our senior vice-president and chief commercial officer is resigning effective August 15, 2015, to take a chief executive officer position with a company outside the nuclear industry. Mr. Seitz had oversight for our marketing, corporate development, and exploration activities. At this time, the plan is to reallocate these activities, and his other responsibilities, among members of our officer team. This re-allocation will be finalized in September 2015. Uranium market update The market continued to be flat in the second quarter, with spot prices remaining in the mid-$30s (US). The quantity transacted in the spot market was at normal levels, though no significant price trends emerged. We believe this flat environment is simply a function of the currently over-supplied market, where we believe participants' uncovered requirements start to open up in the next two to three years. There were supply disruptions in the first half of 2015 that reduced the over-supply situation, but the reductions did not result in any notable change in spot or term demand from utilities. Japan restarts remain the most important driver of market sentiment in the short term. While the market has been disappointed with ongoing delays, the first reactor restarts appear to be imminent with Kyushu having loaded fuel into Sendai unit 1 for anticipated restart in August, while preparing Sendai unit 2 for restart this fall. We remain confident that a significant number of units will be restarted in Japan over time, though the regulatory approval process and restart schedules are clearly hard to predict. Beyond these short-term challenges in the market, longer term, strong fundamentals underpin a positive outlook for the industry. Globally, there are 64 reactors currently under construction, with a net increase of 82 reactors expected over the next 10 years. China continues to execute on its remarkable nuclear growth plan, with 26 reactors operating and 24 under construction. India continues to demonstrate confidence in its nuclear growth strategy, evidenced by the signing of new long-term uranium supply agreements with major producers, including Cameco. On the supply side, we continue to see depressed market conditions having a negative impact on future supply potential, as suppliers struggle to justify the underlying economics. The cancellation of a planned mine expansion in Australia further supports our view that current price levels do not justify the development of new uranium supply projects. Demand growth combined with the timing, development and execution of new supply projects and the continued performance of existing supply, will determine the pace of market recovery. Caution about forward-looking information relating to our uranium market update This discussion of our expectations for the nuclear industry, including its growth profile, future global uranium supply and demand, and net increase in reactors, is forward-looking information that is based upon the assumptions and subject to the material risks discussed under the heading Caution about forward-looking information below. Outlook for 2015 Our strategy is to profitably produce at a pace aligned with market signals, while maintaining the ability to respond to conditions as they evolve. Our outlook for 2015 reflects the expenditures necessary to help us achieve our strategy. Our outlook for NUKEM revenue and unit cost, as well as consolidated revenue, administration costs and tax rate has changed. To provide additional insight following our acquisition of NUKEM in 2013, we provided an outlook for NUKEM's direct administration costs and tax rate. However, NUKEM's direct administration costs and tax rate are immaterial in the context of our consolidated results. We provide outlook for consolidated direct administration costs and for our consolidated tax rate based on taxes incurred in Canada and in foreign jurisdictions; we do not provide any further breakdown for our other segments. As a result, we will no longer provide an outlook for direct administration costs or tax rate specific to the NUKEM segment. We do not provide an outlook for the items in the table that are marked with a dash. 2015 FINANCIAL OUTLOOK Our 2015 outlook for sales volume does not include sales between our uranium, fuel services and NUKEM segments. For comparison of our 2015 outlook and 2014 results for revenue, we do not include sales between our uranium, fuel services and NUKEM segments. Based on a uranium spot price of $36.00 (US) per pound (the Ux spot price as of July 27, 2015), a long-term price indicator of $44.00 (US) per pound (the Ux long-term indicator on July 27, 2015) and an exchange rate of $1.00 (US) for $1.22 (Cdn). This increase is based on the unit cost of sale for produced material and committed long-term purchases. If we make discretionary purchases in 2015, then we expect the overall unit cost of sales to increase further. Direct administration costs do not include stock-based compensation expenses. Our outlook for NUKEM revenue has changed to an increase of 20% to 25% (previously increase of 5% to 10%) due to our expectation that NUKEM sales volumes will be higher in the range, and the effect of foreign exchange. Consolidated revenue is now expected to increase by 5% to 10% (previously an increase of up to 5%) due to our expectation that sales volumes for the uranium and NUKEM segments will be higher in the range. We have also adjusted our outlook for NUKEM cost of sales. Unit cost of sales is now expected to increase 5% to 10% (previously increase up to 5%) due to the effect of foreign exchange. Consolidated administration costs are now expected to increase 5% to 10% (previously an increase of up to 5%) due to increased costs under our collaboration agreements and the effect of foreign exchange. We have adjusted our outlook for the consolidated tax rate to a recovery of 40% to 45% (previously 45% to 50%) due to the expected impact of the changes to the consolidated outlook noted above, and a change in the distribution of earnings between jurisdictions. In our uranium and fuel services segments, our customers choose when in the year to receive deliveries, so our quarterly delivery patterns, sales volumes and revenue can vary significantly however, the majority of delivery notices have been received for 2015, reducing variability for the remainder of the year. We expect uranium deliveries in the third quarter to be similar to the first two quarters, and fourth quarter deliveries to be higher. REVENUE AND EARNINGS SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS For the rest of 2015: An increase of $5 (US) per pound in both the Ux spot price ($36.00 (US) per pound on July 27, 2015) and the Ux long-term price indicator ($44.00 (US) per pound on July 27, 2015) would increase revenue by $48 million and net earnings by $27 million. Conversely, a decrease of $5 (US) per pound would decrease revenue by $45 million and net earnings by $24 million. a one-cent change in the value of the Canadian dollar versus the US dollar would change adjusted net earnings by $5 million, with a decrease in the value of the Canadian dollar versus the US dollar having a positive impact ADJUSTED NET EARNINGS (NON-IFRS MEASURE) Adjusted net earnings are a measure that does not have a standardized meaning or a consistent basis of calculation under IFRS (non-IFRS measure). We use this measure as a more meaningful way to compare our financial performance from period to period. We believe that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, certain investors use this information to evaluate our performance. Adjusted net earnings are our net earnings attributable to equity holders, adjusted to better reflect the underlying financial performance for the reporting period. The adjusted earnings measure reflects the matching of the net benefits of our hedging program with the inflows of foreign currencies in the applicable reporting period, and has also been adjusted for NUKEM purchase price inventory write-downs and recoveries, income taxes on adjustments, impairment charges on non-producing property, and the after tax gain on the sale of our interest in BPLP. Adjusted net earnings are non-standard supplemental information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information prepared according to accounting standards. Other companies may calculate this measure differently, so you may not be able to make a direct comparison to similar measures presented by other companies. Discontinued operation On March 27, 2014, we completed the sale of our 31.6% limited partnership interest in BPLP, which was accounted for effective January 1, 2014. The aggregate sale price for our interest in BPLP and certain related entities was $450 million. We realized an after tax gain of $127 million on this divestiture. As a result of the transaction, we presented the results of BPLP as a discontinued operation and we revised our statement of earnings, statement of comprehensive income and statement of cash flows to reflect the change in presentation. See note 4 to the interim financial statements for more information.

See Uranium 2015 Q2 updates below for more information. The 13% increase in uranium revenues was a result of a 14% increase in the Canadian dollar average realized price, partially offset by a 1% decrease in sales volume. The US dollar average realized price increased by 1% compared to 2014 mainly due to higher prices on fixed price contracts, while the higher Canadian dollar realized prices this quarter were a result of the weakening of the Canadian dollar compared to 2014. This quarter the exchange rate on the average realized price was $1.00 (US) for $1.25 (Cdn) compared to $1.00 (US) for $1.11 (Cdn) in the second quarter of 2014. Total cost of sales (including D&A) increased by 12% ($297 million compared to $266 million in 2014) due to a 14% increase in the unit cost of sales, partially offset by a 1% decrease in sales volume. The increase in the unit cost of sales was mainly the result of an increase in the volume of material purchased in the quarter at prices higher than our average cost of inventory. The net effect was a $17 million increase in gross profit for the quarter. FIRST SIX MONTHS Production volumes for the first six months of the year were 8% higher than in the previous year due to the addition of production from Cigar Lake, partially offset by lower production at McArthur/Key Lake, our US operations and Inkai. See Uranium 2015 Q2 updates below for more information. Uranium revenues increased 9% compared to the first six months of 2014 due to a 9% increase in the Canadian dollar average realized price. Sales volumes in the first six months were the same as in 2014. Our Canadian dollar realized prices for the first six months of 2015 were higher than 2014, primarily as a result of the weakening of the Canadian dollar compared to 2014. For the first six months of 2015, the exchange rate on the average realized price was $1.00 (US) for $1.23 (Cdn) compared to $1.00 (US) for $1.10 (Cdn) for the same period in 2014. Total cost of sales (including D&A) increased by 12% ($552 million compared to $495 million in 2014) mainly due to a 12% increase in the unit cost of sales. The increase was mainly the result of an increase in the volume of material purchased in the first six months at prices higher than our average cost of inventory, and an increase in unit production costs. The net effect was an $11 million increase in gross profit for the first six months. We are active in the uranium market, buying and selling uranium on the spot market and under long-term contracts when we expect it will be beneficial for us. Purchases are impacted by foreign exchange rates, and may, in some cases, require we pay prices higher or lower than current spot prices. Depending on the volume and unit cost of purchases in a quarter, our average cost of inventory can be impacted, which flows through to our cost of sales. The table below shows the costs of produced and purchased uranium incurred in the reporting periods (which are non-IFRS measures, see the paragraphs below the table). These costs do not include selling costs such as royalties, transportation and commissions, nor do they reflect the impact of opening inventories on our reported cost of sales. Cash cost per pound, non-cash cost per pound and total cost per pound for produced and purchased uranium presented in the above table are non-IFRS measures. These measures do not have a standardized meaning or a consistent basis of calculation under IFRS. We use these measures in our assessment of the performance of our uranium business. We believe that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, certain investors use this information to evaluate our performance and ability to generate cash flow. These measures are non-standard supplemental information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared according to accounting standards. These measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under IFRS. Other companies may calculate these measures differently, so you may not be able to make a direct comparison to similar measures presented by other companies. To facilitate a better understanding of these measures, the following table presents a reconciliation of these measures to our unit cost of sales for the second quarter and the first six months of 2015 and 2014. SECOND QUARTER Total revenue for the second quarter of 2015 remained the same as the prior year at $70 million. A 27% decrease in sales volumes was offset by a 40% increase in average realized price, primarily due to the mix of products sold. The total cost of products and services sold (including D&A) decreased by 7% ($50 million compared to $54 million in the second quarter of 2014) due to the decrease in sales volumes, partially offset by an increase in the average unit cost of sales. When compared to 2014, the average unit cost of sales was 30% higher due to the mix of fuel services products sold. The net effect was a $3 million increase in gross profit. FIRST SIX MONTHS In the first six months of the year, total revenue increased by 24% due to a 6% increase in sales volumes and a 17% increase in realized price that was the result of increased realized prices for UF6 and the mix of products sold. The total cost of sales (including D&A) increased 17% ($109 million compared to $93 million in 2014) due to an increase in sales volume and a 12% increase in the average unit cost of sales, which resulted from the mix of fuel services products sold. The net effect was a $9 million increase in gross profit.

Total revenues increased by 31% as a result of average realized prices which were 21% higher than those realized in the second quarter of 2014. Gross margin percentage was 14% in the second quarter of 2015, a 33% decrease compared to the second quarter of 2014. The allocation of the historic purchase price to the sale of inventory on hand at the time of acquisition of NUKEM, impacted margins for the quarter. The net effect was a $2 million decrease in gross profit. FIRST SIX MONTHS During the six months ended June 30, 2015, NUKEM delivered 4.0 million pounds of uranium, an increase of 82%, due to timing of customer requirements and generally lower activity in the market during 2014. Total revenues increased 89% due to an 82% increase in sales volumes and a 4% increase in average realized price. Gross margin percentage was 12% for the first six months of 2015 as compared to 11% for the same period in 2014. Included in the 2014 margin was a $6 million write-down of inventory compared to a $3 million recovery in 2015. The write-down in 2014 was a result of a decline in the spot price during the period. The net effect was a $12 million increase in gross profit.

Air and road access to our operations has improved and we have resumed normal shipping of packaged product from our operations. We still expect to meet our 2015 production target of 25.3 million to 26.3 million pounds, and our sales target of 31 million to 33 million pounds. The fire risk across northern Saskatchewan has diminished, although we continue to monitor the situation closely and support our employees, their families and communities impacted by the situation. MCARTHUR RIVER/KEY LAKE Production for the quarter was 38% higher compared to the same period last year but 7% lower for the first half of the year due to the timing of mill maintenance, including an unplanned mill maintenance outage during the first quarter. The operation remains on track to achieve our planned 2015 production. We now have a licence production limit of 25 million pounds per year (100% basis) at both McArthur River and Key Lake. The increased production limit aligns with our strategy to maintain the flexibility to adjust to market conditions. CIGAR LAKE The jet boring system at the Cigar Lake mine continued to perform as expected, and during the first half of 2015, we successfully mined 4.8 million pounds of uranium for shipment to the McClean Lake mill. We are continuing to ramp up mine production, and now have three jet boring machines (JBS) commissioned for use underground. The mined ore is routinely transported to the McClean Lake mill, which, during the second quarter, packaged approximately 2.4 million pounds (100% basis, 1.2 million pounds our share), for total production of 3.1 million pounds during the first half of 2015. Cigar Lake remains on track to achieve the annual production target of 6 million to 8 million packaged pounds (100% basis). Commercial production signals a transition in the accounting treatment for costs incurred at the mine. Cigar Lake met all of the criteria for commercial production, including cycle time and process specifications, in the second quarter. Therefore, effective May 1, 2015, we began charging all production costs, including depreciation, to inventory and subsequently recognizing them in cost of sales as the product is sold. We expect Cigar Lake to produce between 6 million and 8 million packaged pounds in 2015; our share is 3 million to 4 million pounds. As we ramp up production to 18 million pounds (100% basis) by 2018, volumes may not be linear year-to-year, but will vary based on our operational experience. To ensure the most efficient operation of the mine and mill throughout the year, we expect to continually manage ore supply and, therefore, may halt and resume mining several times during a quarter without impacting planned annual production. Caution about forward-looking information relating to Cigar Lake This discussion of our expectations for Cigar Lake, including our plan for 6 million to 8 million packaged pounds (100%) in 2015, is forward-looking information that is based upon the assumptions and subject to the material risks discussed under the heading Caution about forward-looking information below. INKAI Production was 14% lower for both the second quarter and the first six months of the year compared to the same periods in 2014 due to the timing of new wellfield development. The operation remains on track to achieve our planned 2015 production. The block 3 test leach facility is now operational and state commissioning of the test wellfields was accomplished during the second quarter. Our application for an extension of the block 3 deposit evaluation period is still pending final approval from the Ministry of Energy of the Republic of Kazakhstan. Inkai continues working on the final appraisal of the mineral potential of block 3 according to Kazakhstan standards.

FNV) Franco-Nevada is the leading gold-focused royalty and stream company by both gold revenues and number of gold assets. The Company is gold-focused but also has the largest and most diversified portfolio of royalties and streams by commodity, geography, revenue type and stage of project. The portfolio is actively managed with the aim to maintain over 80% of revenue from precious metals (gold, silver & PGM). The Company does not operate mines, develop projects or conduct exploration. Franco-Nevada's business model is focused on managing and growing its portfolio of royalties and streams. The advantages of this business model are: Market Exposure to the gold price and exploration optionality; Limited exposure to many of the risks associated with operating companies; A free cash-flow business with limited cash calls; A high-margin business that can generate cash through the entire commodity cycle; A scalable and diversified business in which a large number of assets can be managed with a small stable overhead; A forward-looking business in which management focuses on growth opportunities rather than operational or development issues; and A perpetual discovery option over large areas of geologically prospective lands with no cost other than the initial investment. Franco-Nevada's financial results in the short-term are primarily tied to the price of commodities and the amount of production from its portfolio of producing assets. From time to time, financial results are also supplemented by acquisitions of new producing assets. Over the longer-term, results are impacted by the availability of exploration and development capital applied by other companies to advance Franco-Nevada's advanced and exploration assets into production. Franco-Nevada has a long-term focus in making its investments and recognizes it is in a cyclical industry. Franco-Nevada has historically operated by maintaining a strong balance sheet so that it can make investments during commodity cycle downturns. At year-end 2014, Franco-Nevada had $677.8 million in working capital and an undrawn $500.0 million unsecured credit facility. Franco-Nevada's shares are listed on the Toronto and New York stock exchanges under the symbol FNV. An investment in Franco-Nevada's shares is expected to provide investors with yield and more upside than gold ETF without exposure to operating cost inflation. Since its IPO over seven years ago, Franco-Nevada's share price has outperformed the gold price and all relevant gold equity benchmarks. Franco-Nevada Reports Q2 2015 Results and Declares Quarterly Dividend TORONTO, August 10, 2015 - Franco-Nevada Corporation (TSX: FNV; NYSE: FNV) today reported second quarter 2015 financial results realizing 83,040 Gold Equivalent Ounces (\"GEOs\") from its mineral assets and $10.3 million in revenue from its oil & gas assets. Net Income and Adjusted Net Income2 were $21.6 million, or $0.14 per share, and $22.9 million, or $0.15 per share, respectively, with Adjusted EBITDA3 being $82.2 million, or $0.53 per share. \"Franco-Nevada's diversified portfolio continues to deliver very stable revenues and cash flows despite declining commodity prices,\" said David Harquail, President and CEO. \"Our balance sheet remains very liquid with no debt.

At South Arturo, Premier Gold Mines Limited reports construction is progressing well with Barrick as a 60% owner/operator. Production is expected to be processed at Goldstrike and is forecasted to be over 200,000 ounces in 2016. Franco-Nevada holds a 4-9% royalty depending on metallurgy, grade and throughput. Gold - Canada: GEOs from Canadian assets decreased in the quarter due to lower production at the Sudbury streams and Hemlo NPI. Lake Shore Gold Corp. has announced a second gold discovery at its 144 Gap Zone where Franco-Nevada holds a 2.25% NSR. Rubicon Minerals Corporation announced its first gold pour at its Phoenix project where Franco-Nevada holds a royalty. Gold - Latin America: Candelaria had a strong quarter delivering 24,192 GEOs to Franco-Nevada. On July 29, 2015, Lundin announced an updated mine plan for Candelaria.

At June 30, 2015, the Company held $940 million of cash and cash equivalents, money market investments of $54 million and had $2.2 billion undrawn on its $3 billion revolving credit facility. The Company has included non-GAAP performance measures on an attributable (or Goldcorp's share) basis throughout this document. Attributable performance measures include the Company's mining operations, including its discontinued operation, and projects, and the Company's share of Alumbrera and Pueblo Viejo. The Company believes that disclosing certain performance measures on an attributable basis is a more relevant measurement of the Company's operating and economic performance, and reflects the Company's view of its core mining operations. The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, the Company and certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company's performance and ability to generate cash flow; however, these performance measures do not have any standardized meaning. Accordingly, it is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company has included non-GAAP performance measures - total cash costs, by-product and co-product, per gold ounce, throughout this document. In the gold mining industry, total cash costs is a common performance measure but does not have any standardized meaning. The Company follows the recommendations of the Gold Institute Production Cost Standard. The Gold Institute, which ceased operations in 2002, was a non-regulatory body and represented a global group of suppliers of gold and gold products. The production cost standard developed by the Gold Institute remains the generally accepted standard of reporting cash costs of production by gold mining companies. In addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, the Company assesses this measure in a manner that isolates the impacts of gold production volumes, the by-product credits, and operating costs fluctuations such that the non-controllable and controllable variability is independently addressed. The Company uses total cash costs, by-product and co-product, per gold ounce, to monitor its operating performance internally, including operating cash costs, as well as in its assessment of potential development projects and acquisition targets. The Company believes these measures provide investors and analysts with useful information about the Company's underlying cash costs of operations and the impact of by-product credits on the Company's cost structure and is a relevant metric used to understand the Company's operating profitability and ability to generate cash flow. When deriving the production cash costs associated with an ounce of gold, the Company includes by-product credits as the Company considers that the cost to produce the gold is reduced as a result of the by-product sales incidental to the gold production process, thereby allowing the Company's management and other stakeholders to assess the net costs of gold production. The Company and certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company's performance and ability to generate cash flow. Accordingly, it is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Total cash costs on a by-product basis are calculated by deducting Goldcorp's share of by-product silver, copper, lead and zinc sales revenues from Goldcorp's share of production costs. Total cash costs on a co-product basis are calculated by allocating Goldcorp's share of production costs to each co-product based on the ratio of actual sales volumes multiplied by budget metal prices, as compared to realized sales prices. The Company uses budget prices to eliminate price volatility and improve co-product cash cost reporting comparability between periods. If silver, lead and zinc for Penasquito, silver for Marlin, Cerro Negro and Pueblo Viejo, and copper for Alumbrera and Pueblo Viejo were treated as co-products, Goldcorp's share of total co-product cash costs, including discontinued operations, for the three months ended June 30, 2015, would be $656 per ounce of gold, $8.24 per ounce of silver, $4.20 per pound of copper, $0.64 per pound of zinc, and $0.59 per pound of lead (June 30, 2014 - $643 per ounce of gold, $9.85 per ounce of silver, $2.56 per pound of copper, $0.70 per pound of zinc and $0.92 per pound of lead). Using actual realized sales prices, co-product total cash costs, including discontinued operations, would be $664 per gold ounce for the three months ended June 30, 2015 (June 30, 2014 - $649). Refer to page 38 for a reconciliation of total cash costs to reported production costs. All-in sustaining costs and all-in costs are non-GAAP performance measures that the Company believes more fully define the total costs associated with producing gold; however, these performance measures have no standardized meaning. Accordingly, it is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company reports these measures on a gold ounces sold basis. The Company's all-in sustaining and all-in cost definitions conform to the guidance note released by the World Gold Council, which became effective January 1, 2014. The World Gold Council is a non-regulatory market development organization for the gold industry whose members comprise global senior gold mining companies. Refer to page 39 for a reconciliation of all-in sustaining costs. Adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share are non-GAAP performance measures. The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, the Company and certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company's performance. Accordingly, it is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Refer to page 41 for a reconciliation of adjusted net earnings to reported net earnings attributable to shareholders of Goldcorp. Adjusted operating cash flows is a non-GAAP performance measure which comprises Goldcorp's share of operating cash flows before working capital changes and which the Company believes provides additional information about the Company's ability to generate cash flows from its mining operations. Accordingly, it is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Refer to page 42 for a reconciliation of adjusted operating cash flows before working capital changes to reported net cash provided by operating activities. Free cash flows is a non-GAAPperformance measure which the Company believes, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, the Company and certain investors use to evaluate the Company's ability to generate cashflows. Accordingly, it is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Free cash flows are calculated by deducting from net cash provided by operating activities, Goldcorp's share of expenditures on mining interests, deposits on mining interest expenditures and capitalized interest paid, and adding Goldcorp's share of net cash provided by operating activities from Alumbrera and Pueblo Viejo. Refer to page 42 for a reconciliation of free cash flows to reported net cash provided by operating activities. OVERVIEW Goldcorp is a leading gold producer engaged in the operation, exploration, development, and acquisition of precious metal properties in Canada, the United States, Mexico, and Central and South America. The Company's current sources of operating cash flows are primarily from the sale of gold, silver, copper, lead and zinc. Goldcorp is one of the world's fastest growing senior gold producers. Goldcorp's strategy is to provide its shareholders with superior returns from high quality assets. Goldcorp has a strong balance sheet. Its low-cost gold production is located in safe jurisdictions in the Americas and remains 100% unhedged. Goldcorp is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (symbol: GG) and the Toronto Stock Exchange (symbol: G). At June 30, 2015, the Company's principal producing mining properties were comprised of the Red Lake, Porcupine, Musselwhite and Eleonore gold mines in Canada; the Penasquito gold/silver/lead/zinc mine and the Los Filos gold mine in Mexico; the Marlin gold/silver mine in Guatemala; the Cerro Negro gold/silver mine and the Alumbrera gold/copper mine (37.5% interest) in Argentina; and the Pueblo Viejo gold/silver/copper mine (40.0% interest) in the Dominican Republic. The Cerro Negro gold/silver mine and the Eleonore gold mine achieved commercial production effective January 1, 2015 and April 1, 2015, respectively. On March 13, 2015, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of Probe Mines Ltd. (\"Probe\"), which owns the Borden gold project in Canada. The Company's significant development projects at June 30, 2015 included the Borden and Cochenour gold projects in Canada; the Camino Rojo gold/silver project in Mexico; and the El Morro gold/copper project (70.0% interest) in Chile. On June 30, 2015, the Company disposed of its 25.9% equity interest in Tahoe Resources Inc. (\"Tahoe\") which was previously recognized as an investment in an associate. The Wharf and Marigold gold mines in the United States were sold on February 20, 2015 and April 4, 2014, respectively, and have been classified as discontinued operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014. The Company realized an average gold price of $1,189 per ounce during the second quarter of 2015 compared to $1,217 per ounce during the first quarter of 2015. The decrease in the realized average gold price was a result of ongoing negative sentiment in the market concerning the impact of an expected interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve before year end. The gold price traded between $1,165 and $1,225 per ounce during the second quarter of 2015; closing at the lower end of the range. Also impacting prices for the metal during the second quarter was lower physical demand from both India and China, as a result of lower than expected monsoon rains, and instability in the Chinese share market, respectively. Gold production for the second quarter of 2015 was 908,000 ounces, an increase of 183,200 ounces, or 25%, from the first quarter of 2015. Gold production for 2015 is expected to be weighted to the second half of the year due primarily to the new mine ramp-ups and the planned mine sequence at Penasquito. Record production of 298,000 gold ounces was achieved at Penasquito, a 142,400 ounce, or 92%, increase compared to the first quarter, due to higher sulphide grades as a result of an 18.5% positive model reconciliation realized from mining in Phase 5C in the heart of the deposit. Cerro Negro and Eleonore increased production by 38,700 gold ounces and 11,300 ounces, respectively, as both mines continued to ramp up operations. Eleonore focused on water effluent quality, stoping productivity and grade variability over the second quarter of 2015. During the quarter Eleonore resolved the remaining issues relating to the water effluent quality and continued to improve stoping productivity and mining flexibility. The ore grade variability is now within expectations based on the additional studies that have been performed. At Cochenour, intersected gold grades remain consistent with expectations; however recent drill data and newly discovered mineralized zones indicate a change in orientation of a portion of the veins compared to the existing model. Additional advanced exploration and analysis is required to support final mine planning and infrastructure. Processing of mill feed from the first test stopes is expected in the fourth quarter of 2015. All-in sustaining costs of $846 per ounce for the second quarter of 2015 decreased 4% from $885 per ounce for the first quarter of 2015 due to higher gold sales volumes, primarily as a result of the record production at Penasquito in the second quarter and Eleonore achieving commercial production on April 1, 2015, partially offset by increased production costs as Eleonore and Cerro Negro continue to ramp up. Goldcorp achieved positive free cash flow of $174 million for the second quarter of 2015 as compared to negative cash flow of $360 million in the first quarter. With the completion of a major capital spending campaign as Cerro Negro and Eleonore achieved commercial production in 2015, free cash flows increased in the second quarter as cash flows from operations were positively impacted with the ramp up of these operations and record production from Penasquito. Additionally, the Company's expenditures and deposits on mining interests decreased by $80 million, or 20%, compared to the first quarter following completion of the project expenditures at Eleonore and Cerro Negro. CORPORATE DEVELOPMENTS Sale of Tahoe: On June 30, 2015, the Company completed its divestiture of its 25.9% investment in Tahoe following completion of a secondary offering. A total of 58,051,692 Tahoe common shares beneficially held by Goldcorp were sold at an offering price of C$17.20 per share for gross proceeds of approximately C$998 million ($800 million). Extension of Credit Facility: On June 11, 2015, the Company announced that it had increased its credit facility from $2.0 billion to $3.0 billion and extended the term to June 10, 2020, under existing terms and conditions.

REVIEW OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION Three Months Ended June 30, 2015 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2014 Net earnings attributable to shareholders of Goldcorp for the second quarter of 2015 was $392 million, or $0.47 per share, compared to net earnings attributable to shareholders of Goldcorp of $181 million, or $0.22 per share, for the second quarter of 2014. Compared to the second quarter of 2014, the net earnings attributable to shareholders of Goldcorp for the three months ended June 30, 2015 was impacted by the following factors: Revenues increased by $304 million, or 34%, due to a $304 million increase in gold revenues as a result of higher gold sales volumes, primarily due to Cerro Negro and Eleonore achieving commercial production in 2015, resulting in all proceeds from sales being recognized as revenues, and record production at Penasquito in the second quarter of 2015. The positive impact of increased gold sales volumes was partially offset by lower realized gold prices; Production costs increased by $146 million, or 30%, primarily due to Cerro Negro and Eleonore achieving commercial production on January 1, 2015 and April 1, 2015, respectively. Excluding the impact of those mines, production costs decreased by $23 million due to El Sauzal entering reclamation in 2015, a $17 million decrease in reclamation and closure costs at the Company's inactive and closed sites, and the favourable impact of the strengthening US dollar; Depreciation and depletion increased by $178 million, or 100%, due to Cerro Negro and Eleonore achieving commercial production, a higher depletion rate at Marlin resulting from a reduction of proven and probable gold reserves due to the impact of the 10% mining royalty effective January 1, 2015, new assets put into service at Penasquito and higher sales volumes; An $8 million increase in exploration expense, primarily arising from drilling focused on HG Young at Red Lake; The Company's share of net losses of associates of $19 million for the second quarter of 2015 was primarily comprised of net losses of $8 million and $7 million from Pueblo Viejo and Alumbrera, respectively. The Company's share of net losses from Pueblo Viejo was impacted by a $15 million, after tax, impairment expense recognized on certain power assets. In the second quarter of 2014, the Company's share of net earnings from associates was $60 million, comprised of $45 million and $6 million from Pueblo Viejo and Alumbrera, respectively, and $9 million of net earnings from the Company's investment in Tahoe; Corporate administration, excluding share-based compensation expense, was $38 million, a $5 million decrease as compared to the second quarter of 2014, primarily due to the favourable impact of the weakening Canadian dollar. Share-based compensation expense was $15 million for the second quarter of 2015, a decrease of $1 million compared to the second quarter of 2014 primarily due to a decrease in value of the Company's performance share units (\"PSUs\") and phantom share units; An $8 million gain on derivatives in the second quarter of 2015 comprised of net gains on foreign currency, heating oil and commodity contracts. In the second quarter of 2014, an $11 million net gain on derivatives was comprised of a $9 million net gain on foreign currency, heating oil and commodity contracts; a $1 million unrealized gain on the conversion feature of the $863 million convertible senior notes which were repaid upon maturity during the third quarter of 2014; and a $1 million net gain on the Company's contract to sell 1.5 million ounces of silver to Silver Wheaton at a fixed price over each of the four years ended August 5, 2014; A $99 million gain ($95 million, net of tax) on dilution of the Company's investment in Tahoe to 25.9% on April 1, 2015 as a result of Tahoe's acquisition of Rio Alto Mining Ltd (\"Rio Alto\"); A$315 million gain on disposition of mining interests in the second quarter of 2015 arising on the disposition of the Company's remaining 25.9% investment in Tahoe on June 30, 2015 for a total gain of $299 million ($252 million, net of tax), and the sale of the Arturo project for which the Company recognized a gain of $16 million ($11 million, net of tax); Finance costs increased by $32 million primarily due to interest expense on the Company's borrowings that is no longer eligible for capitalization as a result of commercial production being achieved at Cerro Negro and Eleonore; Other income increased by $3 million for the second quarter of 2015 and included interest income arising on the Company's cash and cash equivalent and loans held with Pueblo Viejo, insurance recoveries of $3 million and foreign exchange gains on accounts payable and debt denominated in Mexican and Argentine pesos, and Canadian dollars, partially offset by foreign exchange losses on value added tax receivables denominated in Mexican and Argentine pesos, and cash and cash equivalents denominated in Canadian dollars; Income tax expense for the three months ended June 30, 2015 totaled $90 million (three months ended June 30, 2014 - income tax expense of $13 million) and was primarily impacted by: A $22 million foreign exchange loss on the translation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities arising primarily from the Placer Dome and Glamis acquisitions in 2006 and the Camino Rojo and Cerro Negro acquisitions in 2010, compared to a $24 million foreign exchange gain in the second quarter of 2014. The foreign exchange related deferred income tax impacts resulted from the weakening Mexican and Argentine Peso and the strengthening Canadian dollar (three months ended June 30, 2014 - strengthening Mexican peso and Canadian dollar, and weakening Argentine Peso); A$51 million deferred income tax expense arising on the disposition of Company's investment in Tahoe in the second quarter of 2015; and A lower effective tax rate in the second quarter of 2015, after adjusting for the above noted items and the non-deductible share-based compensation expense. The second quarter of 2015 was favourably impacted by the elimination of the Ontario Resource Tax Credit and an increase in the tax deductible foreign exchanges losses on US dollar denominated debt in Argentina. These favourable impacts were partially offset by non-deductible net losses from associates for the second quarter of 2015, compared to non-taxable net income for the second quarter of 2014. Net loss from discontinued operations of $6 million for the second quarter of 2015 comprised of a deferred tax impact arising on the disposition of Wharf which was sold on February 20, 2015. Net loss from discontinued operations for the second quarter of 2014 of $11 million was comprised of $19 million of net losses from the Company's 66.7% share of Marigold, which was sold on April 4, 2014, partially offset by $8 million of net earnings from Wharf. Adjusted net earnings amounted to $65 million, or $0.08 per share, for the three months ended June 30, 2015, compared to $164 million, or $0.20 per share, for the second quarter of 2014. Compared to the second quarter of 2014, adjusted net earnings were impacted by higher production costs, increased depreciation and depletion expense and lower gold and silver realized prices, partially offset by higher sales volumes. Total cash costs (by-product) increased to $547 per gold ounce, in the second quarter of 2015, as compared to $470 per gold ounce in the second quarter of 2014. The higher cash costs was primarily due to higher production costs following achievement of commercial production at Cerro Negro and Eleonore in 2015 and a decrease in by-product copper and silver sales credits due to lower copper sales volumes and lower silver realized prices, partially offset by higher gold sales volumes and the favourable impact of the strengthening US dollar. Adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share are non-GAAP performance measures. The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, the Company and certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company's performance. Accordingly, it is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Refer to page 41 for a reconciliation of adjusted net earnings to reported net earnings (loss) attributable to shareholders of Goldcorp. The Company has included non-GAAP performance measures - total cash costs, by-product and co-product, per gold ounce, throughout this document. In the gold mining industry, total cash costs is a common performance measure but does not have any standardized meaning. The Company follows the recommendations of the Gold Institute Production Cost Standard. The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, the Company and certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company's performance and ability to generate cash flow. Accordingly, it is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Total cash costs on a by-product basis are calculated by deducting Goldcorp's share of by-product silver, copper, lead and zinc sales revenues from Goldcorp's share of production costs.

REVIEW OF QUARTERLY FINANCIAL RESULTS - Three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2015 Net earnings attributable to shareholders of Goldcorp for the second quarter of 2015 was $392 million, or $0.47 per share, compared to a net loss attributable to shareholders of Goldcorp of $(87) million, or $(0.11) per share, for the first quarter of 2015. Compared to the prior quarter, the net earnings attributable to shareholders of Goldcorp for the three months ended June 30, 2015 was impacted by the following factors: Revenues increased by $171 million, or 17%, due to a $158 million increase in gold revenues and a $19 million increase in lead and zinc revenues, net of refining charges, partially offset by a $5 million decrease in silver revenues. Gold, lead and zinc revenues increased due to higher sales volumes, primarily at Penasquito, which saw record production during the second quarter, and Eleonore achieving commercial production on April 1, 2015; Production costs increased by $20 million, or 3%, primarily due to Eleonore achieving commercial production, partially offset by the first quarter being negatively impacted by a $22 million expense arising from revisions to reclamation and closure cost estimates at the Company's inactive and closed mines, and the favourable foreign exchange effect of the strengthening US dollar; Depreciation and depletion increased by $34 million, or 11%, primarily due to depreciation and depletion associated with Eleonore's first quarter of commercial production and higher sales volumes; The Company's share of net losses of associates of $19 million for the second quarter of 2015 was primarily comprised of net losses of $8 million and $7 million from Pueblo Viejo and Alumbrera, respectively. The Company's share of net losses from Pueblo Viejo was impacted by a $15 million, after tax, impairment expense recognized on certain power assets. The Company's share of net earnings from associates of $35 million in the prior quarter was comprised of net earnings of $28 million and $12 million from Pueblo Viejo and Tahoe, respectively, partially offset by a net loss from Alumbrera of $5 million; An $8 million gain on derivatives for the second quarter of 2015 comprised of net gains on foreign currency, heating oil, and commodity contracts, compared to a $42 million loss on foreign currency, heating oil and commodity contracts in the first quarter of 2015; A $99 million gain ($95 million, net of tax) on dilution of the Company's investment in Tahoe to 25.9% on April 1, 2015 as a result of Tahoe's acquisition of Rio Alto; A$315 million gain on disposition of mining interests in the second quarter of 2015 arising on the disposition of the Company's remaining 25.9% investment in Tahoe on June 30, 2015 for a total gain of $299 million ($252 million, net of tax), and the sale of the Arturo project for which the Company recognized a gain of $16 million ($11 million, net of tax); Finance costs increased by $16 million primarily due to interest expense that is no longer eligible for capitalization as a result of Eleonore achieving commercial production; Other income of $3 million for the second quarter of 2015 included interest income arising on the Company's cash and cash equivalent and loans held with Pueblo Viejo, insurance recoveries of $3 million and foreign exchange gains on accounts payable and debt denominated in Mexican and Argentine pesos, and Canadian dollars, partially offset by foreign exchange losses on value added tax receivables denominated in Mexican and Argentine pesos, and cash and cash equivalents denominated in Canadian dollars. Other income of $18 million in the first quarter of 2015 was primarily comprised of a $15 million net foreign exchange gain driven by the weakening of the Canadian dollar and Mexican and Argentine peso. Income tax expense for the three months ended June 30, 2015 totaled $90 million (three months ended March 31, 2015 - income tax expense of $129 million) and was primarily impacted by: A $22 million foreign exchange loss on the translation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities arising primarily from the Placer Dome and Glamis acquisitions in 2006 and the Camino Rojo and Cerro Negro acquisitions in 2010, compared to a $122 million foreign exchange loss in the first quarter of 2015. The foreign exchange related deferred income tax impacts resulted from the weakening Mexican and Argentine Peso and the strengthening Canadian dollar (three months ended March 31, 2015 - weakening Mexican peso, Argentine peso and Canadian dollar); A$51 million deferred income tax expense arising on the disposition of Company's investment in Tahoe in the second quarter of 2015; and Alower effective tax rate compared to the first quarter of 2015 after adjusting for the above noted items and the non-deductible share-based compensation expense. The second quarter of 2015 was favourably impacted by the elimination of the Ontario Resource Tax Credit and lower non-deductible costs than incurred in the first quarter of 2015. These favourable impacts were partially offset by non-deductible net losses from associates for the second quarter of 2015, compared to non-taxable net income for the first quarter of 2015. Net loss from discontinued operations of $6 million for the second quarter of 2015 comprised of a deferred tax impact arising on the disposition of Wharf which was sold on February 20, 2015. Net earnings from discontinued operations of $52 million for the first quarter of 2015 was comprised of the $49 million net gain on the sale of Wharf and $3 million of net earnings of Wharf until February 20, 2015, the date of disposition. Adjusted net earnings amounted to $65 million, or $0.08 per share (1) , for the three months ended June 30, 2015, compared to $12 million, or $0.01 per share, for the first quarter of 2015.Compared to the prior quarter, adjusted net earnings increased due to higher gold, lead and zinc revenues, partially offset by increased production costs and depreciation and depletion. Total cash costs (by-product) were $547 per gold ounce (2) , in the second quarter of 2015, as compared to $585 per gold ounce in the prior quarter. The decrease in cash costs per ounce was primarily due to increased gold sales volumes and higher lead and zinc by-product credits as a result of increased sales volumes, partially offset by lower gold and silver realized prices and higher production costs. Adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share are non-GAAP performance measures. The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, the Company and certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company's performance.

Six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2014 Net earnings attributable to shareholders of Goldcorp for the six months ended June 30, 2015 were $305 million, or $0.37 per share, compared to net earnings attributable to shareholders of Goldcorp of $279 million, or $0.34 per share, for the six months ended June 30, 2014. Compared to the six months ended June 30, 2014, net earnings attributable to shareholders of Goldcorp for the six months ended June 30, 2015 were impacted by the following factors: Revenues increased by $443 million, or 25%, due to a $459 million increase in gold revenues, partially offset by a $16 million decrease in silver, lead and copper revenues. The increase in gold revenues was primarily due to Eleonore and Cerro Negro achieving commercial production in 2015 and increased sales volumes from Penasquito, partially offset by lower realized gold prices; Production costs increased by $279 million, or 28%, primarily due to Cerro Negro and Eleonore achieving commercial production in 2015. Excluding the impact of those mines, production costs decreased by $27 million due to the favourable impact of the strengthening US dollar and El Sauzal entering reclamation in 2015; Depreciation and depletion increased by $331 million, or 95%, due to Cerro Negro and Eleonore achieving commercial production, a higher depletion rate at Marlin resulting from a reduction of proven and probable gold reserves and higher sales volumes; An $11 million increase in exploration expense, primarily arising from drilling focused on HG Young at Red Lake; The Company's share of net earnings of associates of $16 million was primarily comprised of net earnings of $20 million from Pueblo Viejo, which was impacted by a $15 million impairment expense arising on certain power assets and a net loss of $12 million from Alumbrera. The Company's share of net earnings of associates of $116 million in the six months ended June 30, 2014 was comprised of $76 million of net earnings from Pueblo Viejo, which included a $6 million reversal of impairment expense previously recognized, $18 million of net earnings from Alumbrera and net earnings of $22 million from the Company's equity investments in Tahoe and Primero. The Company sold its investment in Primero on March 26, 2014; Corporate administration, excluding share-based compensation expense, was $78 million, a decrease of $7 million from the comparative 2014 period primarily due to the favourable impact of the weaker Canadian dollar. Share-based compensation expense of $30 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014 was $10 million lower than in the six months ended June 30, 2014 due to a decrease in the fair value of the Company's PSUs; A $34 million net loss on derivatives for the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to an $8 million net gain on derivatives in the comparative period, comprising realized and unrealized gains and losses on the Company's foreign currency, heating oil and commodity contracts; A $99 million gain ($95 million, net of tax) on dilution of the Company's investment in Tahoe to 25.9% on April 1, 2015 as a result of Tahoe's acquisition of Rio Alto; A$315 million gain on disposition of mining interests in the second quarter of 2015 arising on the disposition of the Company's remaining 25.9% investment in Tahoe on June 30, 2015 for a total gain of $299 million ($252 million, net of tax), and the sale of the Arturo project for which the Company recognized a gain of $16 million ($11 million, net of tax). An $18 million net gain on disposition of mining interests was recognized in the comparative period, arising on disposition of the Company's investment in Primero; Finance costs increased by $43 million primarily due to interest expense that is no longer eligible for capitalization as a result of Cerro Negro and Eleonore achieving commercial production; Other income of $21 million comprised mainly of interest income arising on the Company's cash and cash equivalent and loans held with Pueblo Viejo and foreign exchange gains on accounts payable and debt denominated in Mexican and Argentine pesos, and Canadian dollars, partially offset by foreign exchange losses on value added tax receivables denominated in Mexican and Argentine pesos, and cash and cash equivalents denominated in Canadian dollars. Other expense of $22 million in the comparative period was primarily comprised of foreign exchange losses; Income tax expense for the six months ended June 30, 2015 totaled $219 million (six months ended June 30, 2014 - income tax expense of $102 million) and was primarily impacted by: A $144 million foreign exchange loss on the translation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities arising primarily from the Placer Dome and Glamis acquisitions in 2006 and the Camino Rojo and Cerro Negro acquisitions in 2010, compared to a $82 million foreign exchange loss for the six months ended June 30, 2014. The foreign exchange related deferred income tax impacts resulted from the weakening Mexican Peso, Argentine Peso and Canadian dollar (six months ended June 30, 2014 - weakening Canadian dollar and Argentine Peso, and strengthening Mexican peso); A$51 million deferred income tax expense arising on the disposition of Company's investment in Tahoe in the second quarter of 2015; and A higher effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2015, after adjusting income taxes for the above noted items and the non-deductible share-based compensation expense, as a result of a decrease in the tax deductible foreign exchange losses on US dollar denominated debt in Argentina, lower income from associates not being subject to tax and the gain on sale of Primero in the first quarter of 2014 not being subject to tax. These unfavourable items were partially offset by the favourable impact from the elimination of the Ontario Resource Tax Credit. Net earnings from discontinued operations of $46 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 comprised of a $43 million net gain on the sale of Wharf and $3 million of net earnings of Wharf until February 20, 2015, the date of disposition. Anet loss from discontinued operations of $2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014 included a $15 million net loss recognized on the sale of the Company's 66.7% share of Marigold, which was classified as a discontinued operation during 2014 and $13 million net earnings from Wharf. Adjusted net earnings amounted to $77 million, or $0.09 per share, for the six months ended June 30, 2015, compared to $373 million, or $0.46 per share, for the six months ended June 30, 2014. Compared to the six months ended June 30, 2014, adjusted net earnings decreased due to higher production costs and depreciation and depletion expense, partially offset by increased revenues primarily resulting from higher sales volumes. Total cash costs (by-product) increased to $565 per gold ounce (2) , for the six months ended June 30, 2015, as compared to $490 per gold ounce for the six months ended June 30, 2014. The increase in cash costs was primarily due to higher production costs due to Cerro Negro and Eleonore achieving commercial production in 2015, lower realized gold prices and a decrease in by-product sales credits due to lower realized silver, copper and lead prices and lower copper volumes, partially offset by higher gold sales volumes.

Mission To create sustainable value through increased commodity exposure on a per share basis, in high-quality and growing long-life deposits in mining-friendly jurisdictions. Competitive Strengths Growth in copper, gold and zinc production with exploration upside Consistent performance from reliable operations Disciplined and clear growth strategy already being executed Strong financial position Experienced management and operating team Hudbay Releases Second Quarter 2015 Results TORONTO, ONTARIO -- (Marketwired) -- 07/29/15 -- HudBay Minerals Inc. (\"Hudbay\" or the \"company\") (TSX: HBM)(NYSE:HBM) today released its second quarter 2015 financial results. In the second quarter of 2015, operating cash flow before stream deposit and change in non-cash working capital increased to $20.7 million from $11.8 millionin the second quarter of 2014. The net loss and loss per share in the second quarter of 2015 were $55.2 million and $0.24, respectively, compared to net income and income per share of $0.3 million and nil, respectively, in the second quarter of 2014. Net loss and loss per share in the second quarter of 2015 were affected by, among other things. The Constancia mine commenced production in December 2014, and achieved commercial production on April 30, 2015. Ocean shipments began in April 2015, and the mine and concentrator are currently processing ore at or above design capacity. Hudbay expects to achieve full year 2015 production and operating cost guidance for all of its operations. Financial and Operating Results Cash flow from operations was positively impacted by increased revenue as a result of significant increases in production of all metals as the Constancia mine achieved commercial production at the end of April 2015. Copper, gold, silver and zinc production increased by 270%, 37%, 301% and 9%, respectively, in the second quarter of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. In addition, cash costs per pound of copper produced, net of by-product credits, declined by 37% compared to the same period in 2014, to US$1.29. The business benefited from slightly higher production volumes in Manitoba, weaker local currencies, lower energy and other input costs and the achievement of commercial production from the large-scale Constancia mine during the second quarter. While improved when compared to the prior year, cash flow from operations and net earnings were negatively impacted by unsold copper, gold, and silver during the quarter. At quarter end, Hudbay had approximately 73,100 tonnes of unsold copper concentrate containing 19,200 tonnes of copper, 30,300 ounces of gold and 579,300 ounces of silver. Shipments from the Constancia mine to the port in Matarani were constrained during May and June by several factors including truck availability, protests along the lower part of the trucking route, unrelated to Constancia, and road refurbishment activities along the route that increased cycle times for concentrate trucks. Steps have been taken to increase the size of the trucking fleet, and the excess inventory is expected to be drawn down over the second half of 2015. In addition, limitations on rail service resulted in a continued build up of copper concentrate inventory in Manitoba. However, additional leased rail cars are expected to enter service during the third quarter which is expected to draw down inventory levels. Also, cash flow from operations was negatively affected by a $10.5 million increase in cash taxes, when compared to the prior year's quarter, as gross profit, before depreciation and the non-cash pension expense, increased by 68% to $63.4 million. In addition to the pension expense resulting from pension enhancements agreed to as part of the Manitoba collective bargaining process and the Lalor concentrator impairment charge, net earnings were also negatively affected by higher depreciation resulting from commercial production at Constancia and Lalor, and higher interest expense as interest related to the Constancia project is no longer being capitalized. Recent Developments On May 4, 2015, Hudbay closed a transaction to acquire a 100% interest in the New Britannia mine and mill, located in Snow Lake, Manitoba. While there are presently no plans to bring the New Britannia mine back into production, based on its initial review, Hudbay believes the New Britannia mill (the \"NBM Mill\"), if refurbished, has the potential to process approximately 2,000 tonnes per day of gold zone ore from the Lalor mine. As a result of the acquisition of the NBM Mill, Hudbay no longer plans to construct a new concentrator at Lalor, and during the three months ended June 30, 2015, an impairment loss of $24.6 million related to its Lalor concentrator assets was recognized. Hudbay has received commitments from its current lenders to increase the size of its corporate revolving credit facility from US$300 million to US$400 million. The upsized credit facility will be on substantially similar terms to the existing revolving credit facility and will be repayable in March 2018. Hudbay expects to complete definitive documentation for the credit facility amendments during the third quarter of 2015. The collective agreements with each of the seven labour unions representing employees at the Manitoba business unit expired on December 31, 2014. The members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, Local No. 1848 have been on strike since May 2, 2015. The other six unions, representing approximately 88% of Hudbay's employees in Manitoba, have ratified new three year agreements. The Manitoba operations continue to operate under a comprehensive contingency plan. A semi-annual dividend of $0.01 per share was declared on July 29, 2015. The dividend will be paid on September 30, 2015 to shareholders of record as of September 11, 2015. Peru Operations Review Mining operations continue to progress as planned and cost optimization is underway. Equipment availabilities are within design parameters and both loading and hauling efficiencies are consistent with expectations. Optimization of plant performance was a primary focus in the later part of the second quarter of 2015 in response to normal ramp up challenges regarding ore blending and recoveries. Coordination among the mine planning, mine operations and plant operations groups has resulted in progress, and recoveries are now in line with expectations. Daily ore throughput continues to meet ramp-up milestones. Since the end of the second quarter, daily ore throughput has averaged approximately 80,000 tonnes and copper recoveries have averaged approximately 75%. Commissioning of the molybdenum flotation circuit commenced late in the second quarter of 2015, and ramp up of production is planned during the third quarter. Manitoba Operations Review For the second quarter of 2015, ore processed was 3% higher compared to the same period of 2014 primarily as a result of increased production at Lalor partially offset by lower production at the 777 mine. Compared to the second quarter of 2014, zinc and gold grades were 7% and 11% higher, and copper and silver grades were 7% and 17% lower as a result of normal mine sequencing. Recoveries of zinc and gold in the second quarter of 2015 were consistent with the same period of 2014, and recoveries of copper and silver in the second quarter of 2015 were 4% and 13% higher compared to the same period of 2014 as a result of higher copper ore grades received by the Flin Flon concentrator. Combined operating costs per tonne of ore processed in the second quarter of 2015 were 25% higher, compared to the same period in 2014, primarily due to increased production at the Snow Lake operations which have higher unit costs, as well as increased unit costs at the Flin Flon operations resulting from decreased production at the 777 mine. Year-to-date ore processed was 9% higher than the same period in 2014 as a result of increased production from Lalor and Reed. Year-to-date copper, zinc and gold grades were 5%, 4% and 6% higher, respectively, and silver grades were 15% lower compared to the same period of 2014 as a result of normal mine sequencing. Year-to-date recoveries of copper, zinc and gold were consistent with the same period of 2014. Recoveries of silver were 14% higher compared to the same period of 2014 as a result of higher copper ore grades received by the Flin Flon concentrator. Combined operating costs per tonne of ore processed year-to-date in 2015 were 17% higher, compared to the same period in 2014, primarily due to the same factors that affected second quarter production and costs. Lalor Copper-Gold Zone Exploration Results The Phase 1 copper-gold zone drill program at Lalor included a total of 14 holes (totalling approximately 4,500 metres) drilled from the 1,025 metre level; assay results from seven holes were released with Hudbay's first quarter results in May. Assay results from the remaining seven holes are shown in the table on the following page and were similar to those from previous holes, confirming a high grade thick core down the middle of the main zone with decreasing grade and thickness towards the contacts, as well as separate hanging wall and footwall mineralization. The Phase 2 exploration ramp extension to the north, which will allow testing of the copper-gold zones down plunge, and step out drilling to the east and west, is progressing well and is expected to be complete by the end of August. Drilling from the Phase 2 exploration ramp is anticipated to commence in September 2015 with approximately 8,500 metres of drilling planned. The Phase 2 portion of the ramp development continues to maintain a drift size capable of accommodating future mine equipment and related infrastructure for mining the copper-gold zones. Conversion to US Dollar Reporting Following the declaration of commercial production at Constancia, Hudbay has determined that, effective July 1, 2015, the appropriate functional currency of its corporate entity has changed from Canadian dollars to US dollars. In addition, Hudbay intends to change its reporting currency to US dollars effective with the financial reports for the three and nine months ending September 30, 2015. Non-IFRS Financial Performance Measures Operating cash flow per share and cash cost per pound of copper produced are included in this news release because the company believes that, in the case of operating cash flow per share, it helps investors and management to evaluate changes in cash flow while taking into account changes in shares outstanding, and in the case of cash cost per pound of copper produced, it helps investors assess the performance of the company's operations. These measures do not have a meaning prescribed by IFRS and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with IFRS and are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under IFRS. Other companies may calculate these measures differently. Reconciliation of Cash Cost, After By-product Credits (non-IFRS) to Cost of Sales (IFRS) Cash cost per pound of copper produced (\"cash cost\") is a non-IFRS measure that management uses as a key performance indicator to assess the performance of the company's operations. Hudbay's calculation designates copper as its primary metal of production as it has been, and is expected to be, the largest component of revenues. Two changes have been made to the cash cost calculation beginning with the period ended June 30, 2015. First, the basis of measurement has been changed from pounds of copper sold to pounds of copper produced. This change has been made to better align the costs of production in the same period as the copper produced and reduce variation in cash cost due to inventory sales timing. Second, royalties have been removed from the cash cost. This change increases consistency between Hudbay's cash cost calculation and industry peers. The calculation is presented in two manners: Cash cost, before by-product credits - This measure is gross of by-product revenues and is a function of the efforts and costs incurred to mine and process all ore mined. However, the measure divides this aggregate cost over only pounds of copper produced, Hudbay's primary metal of production. This measure is generally less volatile from period to period, as it is not affected by changes in the price received for by-product metals. It is, however, significantly affected by the relative mix of copper concentrate and finished zinc production, and an increase in production of zinc metal will tend to result in an increase in cash costs under this measure. Cash cost, net of by-product credits - In order to calculate the cost to produce and sell copper, the net of by-product credits measure subtracts the revenues realized from the sale of the metals other than copper. The by-product revenues from zinc, gold, silver, and molybdenum are significant and are integral to the economics of Hudbay. The economics that support Hudbay's decision to produce and sell copper would be different if the company did not receive revenues from the other significant metals being extracted and processed. This measure provides management and investors with an indication of the minimum copper price consistent with positive operating cash flows and operating margins, assuming that realized by-product metal prices are consistent with those prevailing during the reporting period. It also serves as an important operating statistic that management and investors utilize to measure Hudbay's operating performance versus that of its competitors. However, it is important to understand that if by-product metal prices decline alongside copper prices, the cash cost net of by-product credits would increase, requiring a higher copper price than that reported to maintain positive cash flows and operating margins.

Lundin Mining Second Quarter Result TORONTO, ONTARIO--(Marketwired-July29, 2015) - LundinMining Corporation (TSX:LUN)(OMX:LUMI) (\"Lundin Mining\" or the \"Company\") today reported net earnings of $53.7 million or net earnings attributable to Lundin shareholders (after deducting non-controlling interests) of $46.4 million ($0.06 per share) for the quarter ended June 30, 2015. Cash flows of $262.7 million were generated from operations in the quarter, not including the Company's attributable cash flows from Tenke Fungurume. Earnings for the three month period included a full quarter of operating and financial results from Candelaria, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2014 and Eagle, which was commissioned in the same period. Candelaria and Eagle generated operating earnings of $141.3 million and $40.3 million, respectively, in the current quarter. Paul Conibear, President and CEO commented, \"With another strong operating quarter, the Company remains very well positioned to continue to deliver record levels of cash flow at good margins despite the current commodity price environment. Our strong year-to-date performance coupled with weaker local currencies, has once again enabled us to improve our annual cash cost guidance across several of our operations.\" \"We are also extremely pleased that several key milestones have recently been achieved at Candelaria, including the approval of the Environmental Impact Assessment (\"EIA\"), and the completion of an optimized mine plan. Through these important advancements, Lundin Mining is expected to continue to generate excellent shareholder value well into the future,\" added Mr. Conibear.

Neves-Corvo Zinc Expansion The Feasibility Study examining an expansion of the zinc operations at Neves-Corvo achieved substantial completion by quarter end. The scope of the study includes underground development of the lower Lombador zinc deposits, a major underground conveying system to take ore to the existing shaft, expansion of shaft capacity to 5.6 million tonnes per year, zinc plant expansion to 2.5 million tonnes per year ore throughput, and construction of expanded water treatment, paste backfill and tailings storage infrastructure. Maximum zinc production is nominally 165 ktpa with 25 ktpa of lead by-product. The estimated capital cost, including the first full year of underground development costs, is approximately EUR245 million. The project schedule is estimated to be approximately 24 months from approval to proceed through to commissioning of the expanded facilities. An investment decision on zinc expansion has been deferred pending additional work to improve the existing zinc plant metallurgical recoveries and plant stability, and pending improved metal markets.

Quarter Highlights Operational Performance For the second quarter of 2015, all of the Company's operations continued to perform well, with most operations meeting or exceeding expectations. Production results continue to be strong, cash costs remain competitive, and favourable profit margins were maintained at all operations. Candelaria (80%): The Candelaria operations produced, on a 100% basis, 46,651 tonnes of copper, and approximately 464,000 ounces of silver and 26,900 ounces of gold in concentrate, with copper and gold production better than expectations as a result of higher throughputs and good metallurgical recoveries. Copper cash costs1 of $1.21/lb for the quarter benefitted from lower mine and mill costs, favourable foreign exchange rates, and higher production. Cash cost/lb of copper, zinc and nickel are non-GAAP measures defined as all cash costs directly attributable to mining operating, less royalties and by-product credits. Eagle (100%): Eagle's operational results were generally in-line with expectations, with nickel production (6,349 tonnes) meeting expectations, and copper production (5,403 tonnes) exceeding expectations for the quarter with higher than expected head grades and recoveries. Nickel cash costs of $2.15/lb for the quarter were higher than full year guidance of $2.00/lb as a result of lower than expected copper by-product credit pricing and higher treatment charges. Neves-Corvo (100%): Neves-Corvo produced 15,348 tonnes of copper and 16,022 tonnes of zinc in the second quarter. Copper production exceeded the prior year comparable period by 14% due to higher head grades and the continued rollout of bulk mining methods in more areas. Zinc production fell short of the prior year comparable period, resulting from a reduction in mill throughput and below target metal recovery in the zinc plant. Copper cash costs of $1.43/lb for the quarter were lower than guidance ($1.60/lb) due primarily to favourable foreign exchange rates. Zinkgruvan (100%): Zinc production was strong in the second quarter of 2015, with the mine once again hoisting a record volume of ore. Zinc production of 21,237 tonnes was 10% higher than the comparable period in 2014 due to higher head grades and recoveries. Lead production exceeded expectations in the current quarter, but fell short of the prior year comparable period as mining took place in areas with lower lead grades. Cash costs for zinc of $0.43/lb for the quarter were higher than guidance ($0.35/lb) due to lower by-product credit pricing. Aguablanca (100%): Aguablanca had another strong quarter of operational performance as mining transitioned from open pit to underground. Current quarter production of 2,245 tonnes of nickel and 1,975 tonnes of copper exceeded both expectations and the prior year comparable period. Cash costs of $1.72/lb of nickel for the quarter were significantly below expectations and the prior year comparable period as mining of the open pit was extended early into the second quarter. Tenke (24%): Tenke operations continue to perform well. Lundin's attributable share of second quarter production included 12,544 tonnes of copper cathode and 996 tonnes of cobalt in hydroxide. The Company's attributable share of sales included 11,376 tonnes of copper at an average realized price of $2.63/lb and 893 tonnes of cobalt at an average realized price of $9.27/lb. Tenke operating cash costs for the second quarter of 2015 were $1.07/lb of copper sold, lower than the latest guidance, primarily reflecting higher cobalt credits, partly offset by lower copper sales volumes. Cash distributions received by Lundin Mining in the quarter were $5.9 million, in-line with expectations. An additional $0.8 million was received from the Freeport Cobalt operations. Year-to-date cash distributions to the Company from Tenke and Freeport Cobalt totalled $17.0 million.

The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of Candelaria's ($141.3 million) and Eagle's ($40.3 million) operating results. Operating earnings were also positively impacted by favourable foreign exchange rates ($21.6 million), partially offset by lower realized metal prices and price adjustments ($40.3 million) from our European operations. On a year-to-date basis, operating earnings were $517.0 million, an increase of $399.7 million in comparison to the first six months of 2014 ($117.3 million). The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of Candelaria's ($305.0 million) and Eagle's ($96.4 million) operating results. Sales for the quarter ended June 30, 2015 were $501.3 million, an increase of $309.5 million in comparison to the second quarter of the prior year ($191.8 million). The increase was mainly due to incremental sales from Candelaria and Eagle of $256.5 million and $85.0 million, respectively, and higher sales volumes ($12.9 million) from the Company's European operations, partially offset by lower realized metal prices and price adjustments ($40.3 million) from the Company's European operations. On a year-to-date basis, sales were $1,032.8 million, an increase of $691.1 million in comparison to the first six months of 2014 ($341.7 million). The increase was mainly due to incremental sales from Candelaria and Eagle of $548.7 million and $173.4 million, respectively, and higher European sales volumes ($52.5 million), partially offset by lower realized metal prices and price adjustments ($74.9 million) from the Company's European operations. Average metal prices for copper, nickel and lead for the quarter ended June 30, 2015 were lower (11%, 30%, and 7%, respectively) in comparison to the second quarter of the prior year, while zinc prices increased from the prior year comparable period (6%). On a year-to-date basis, average metal prices for copper, nickel and lead were lower (14%, 17%, and 11%, respectively) in comparison to the first six months of 2014, while zinc prices increased from the prior year comparable period (4%). Operating costs (excluding depreciation) for the quarter ended June 30, 2015 were $251.6 million, an increase of $140.6 million in comparison to the second quarter of the prior year ($111.0 million). The increase was largely due to the incremental costs from Candelaria and Eagle of $115.2 million and $44.7 million, respectively, partially offset by favourable foreign exchange rates in the Euro and Swedish krona ($21.6 million). On a year-to-date basis, operating costs (excluding depreciation) were $502.2 million, an increase of $291.0 million in comparison to the first six months of 2014 ($211.2 million). The increase was largely due to the incremental costs from Candelaria and Eagle of $243.7 million and $77.0 million, respectively, partially offset by favourable foreign exchange rates in the Euro and Swedish krona ($41.4 million). Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 when measured against the comparable period in 2014. The increase was attributable to the acquisition of Candelaria (Q2 2015 - $80.7 million; YTD - $165.8 million) and the start of commercial production at Eagle (Q2 2015 - $34.2 million; YTD - $70.7 million). Net earnings for the quarter ended June 30, 2015 were $53.7 million, an increase of $14.0 million in comparison to the second quarter of the prior year ($39.7 million). Net earnings were impacted by: Addition of Candelaria ($44.0 million) and the second full quarter of operations at Eagle ($6.9 million); offset by interest expense associated with the senior secured notes ($19.4 million); and Lower income from investment in Tenke ($14.4 million). On a year-to-date basis, net earnings were $137.0 million, an increase of $83.9 million in comparison to the first six months of 2014 ($53.1 million). Net earnings were impacted by: Addition of Candelaria ($108.1 million) and Eagle's first two full quarters of operations ($22.4 million); and a foreign exchange gain of $10.8 million; partially offset by lower income from investment in Tenke ($23.5 million); and Interest expense associated with the senior secured notes ($38.6 million). Cash flow from operations for the quarter ended June 30, 2015 was $262.7 million, an increase of $228.9 million in comparison to the second quarter of the prior year ($33.8 million). The increase was primarily due to the operating earnings from Candelaria ($141.3 million) and Eagle ($40.3 million), and changes in non-cash working capital and long-term inventory ($86.3 million), partially offset by lower realized metal prices and price adjustments ($40.3 million) from our European operations. On a year-to-date basis, cash flow from operations was $486.6 million, an increase of $425.3 million in comparison to the first six months of 2014 ($61.3 million). The increase was attributable to the operating earnings from Candelaria ($305.0 million) and Eagle ($96.4 million), and changes in non-cash working capital and long-term inventory ($87.5 million), partially offset by higher income taxes paid ($38.1 million). Corporate Highlights On July 23, 2015, the Company announced that it had received approval of its EIA for the extension of operations and mine life at its Candelaria Mine in Chile. Refer to the new release entitled \"Lundin Mining Receives Approval of Environmental Impact Assessment for the Candelaria Mine\" on the Company's website. Financial Position and Financing Net debt position at June 30, 2015 was $497.2 million compared to $829.2 million at December 31, 2014 and $649.2 million at March 31, 2015. The $152.0 million decrease in net debt during the quarter was largely attributable to operating cash flows of $262.7 million, partially offset by investments in mineral properties, plant and equipment of $78.8 million and interest payments of $38.8 million. For the six months ended June 30, 2015, net debt decreased by $332.0 million due primarily to operating cash flows of $486.6 million, partially offset by investments in mineral properties, plant and equipment of $142.7 million. The Company has a revolving credit facility available for borrowing up to $350 million. As at June 30, 2015, the Company had no amount drawn on the credit facility. A letter of credit in the amount of $19.7 million (SEK 162 million) is outstanding. Net debt at July 29, 2015 is approximately $525 million. Outlook 2015 Production and Cost Guidance Production and cash cost guidance for 2015 have been adjusted to account for mine site performance and foreign exchange rates to-date, and second half expectations. Guidance on Tenke's copper production and cash costs have been updated to reflect the most recent guidance provided by Freeport. Cash cost and production guidance for the Aguablanca Mine is currently under review. While both nickel and copper production year-to-date have been above expectations, a permitting complexity has arisen that could affect production levels and cost projections towards the end of the year. The Spanish mining authority had previously granted approvals to convert from open pit to underground mining; however another government agency has recently requested a new EIA on the change in mining method. The Company is cooperating fully with this request and will have a third party authored underground mining EIA submitted shortly. The Company may undertake a full or partial shutdown of the underground operations pending the EIA approval. Stockpiles are sufficient to continue processing at full tonnages until early in the fourth quarter. Updated guidance will be provided in the next quarterly outlook. 2015 Guidance Guidancea Revised Guidance (contained tonnes) Tonnes C1 Cost Tonnes C1 Costb Copper Candelaria (80%) 130,000 - 135,000 $1.55/lb 135,000 - 140,000 $1.35/lb Eagle 20,000 - 23,000 20,000 - 23,000 Neves-Corvo 50,000 - 55,000 $1.60/lb 50,000 - 55,000 $1.55/lb Zinkgruvan 2,000 - 3,000 2,000 - 3,000 Aguablanca 5,500 - 6,000 5,500 - 6,000 Tenke (24%)c 49,500 $1.26/lb 50,000 $1.12/lb Total attributable 257,000 - 271,500 262,500 - 277,000 Nickel Eagle 25,000 - 28,000 $2.00/lb 25,000 - 28,000 $2.00/lb Aguablanca 7,000 - 7,500 $3.75/lb 7,000 - 7,500 $3.75/lb Total 32,000 - 35,500 32,000 - 35,500 Zinc Neves-Corvo 68,000 - 73,000 60,000 - 65,000 Zinkgruvan 78,000 - 82,000 $0.35/lb 80,000 - 85,000 $0.40/lb Total 146,000 - 155,000 140,000 - 150,000 Lead Neves-Corvo 4,000 - 5,000 4,000 - 5,000 Zinkgruvan 27,000 - 30,000 30,000 - 33,000 Total 31,000 - 35,000 34,000 - 38,000 Guidance as outlined in our Management's Discussion and Analysis for the quarter ended March 31, 2015. Cash costs remain dependent upon exchange rates (forecast at EUR/USD:1.15, USD/SEK:8.25, USD/CLP:625) and metal prices (forecast at Cu: $2.70/lb, Zn: $0.95/lb, Pb: $0.80/lb, Ni: $6.25/lb, Co: $13.00/lb). Prior guidance forecast EUR/USD at 1.10. Freeport has provided 2015 sales and cash costs guidance. Tenke's 2015 production is assumed to approximate sales guidance. 2015 Capital Expenditure and Exploration Guidance Capital expenditures for 2015 are expected to be $350 million (excluding Tenke). The Company expects to spend $40 million less on sustaining capital expenditures at Candelaria and $10 million less on sustaining capital expenditures at Neves-Corvo. In total, this represents a reduction of $50 million from the previous guidance. The Company estimates its share of expansion related initiatives and sustaining capital funding for 2015 at Tenke to be $80 million, $10 million less than previously guided. All of the capital expenditures are expected to be self-funded by cash flow from Tenke operations. The Company expects to receive cash distributions from Tenke in 2015 of approximately $20 - $30 million, slightly increased from previous guidance of $20 million. The total exploration expense is expected to be $60 million, unchanged from previous guidance.

(TSE: POT) Who we are PotashCorp is the world's largest fertilizer company by capacity, producing the three primary crop nutrients: potash (K), nitrogen (N) and phosphate (P). We are the world's leading potash producer by capacity and our Canadian operations represent nearly one-fifth of global capacity1. To enhance our global footprint, we also have investments in four potash-related businesses in South America, the Middle East and Asia. With operations and business interests in seven countries, PotashCorp is an international enterprise and plays an important role in helping the world grow the food it needs. What we produce Our potash, phosphate and nitrogen products help provide the primary nutrients that crops need. They are also used to make livestock feeds and industrial goods. Produced from mineral deposits (potash and phosphate) and from the air we breathe (nitrogen), our main products are: potash, in standard and granular grades DAP (diammonium phosphate), MAP (monoammonium phosphate) and phosphoric acid Ammonia and urea Why fertilizer? With world population rising, arable land per person diminishing and demand increasing for higher quality diets that include more fruits and vegetables and protein from crop-fed livestock, the need to maximize the efficiency of farmland has never been greater. Every crop harvested removes nutrients from the soil, which must be replaced to keep soil healthy and productive. Responsible for more than 40 percent of the world's total crop yield, fertilizers feed plants, which help to feed animals and people. Where we serve Our products serve customers throughout the global marketplace from China, the world's most populous nation and largest fertilizer consumer, to India, with its 1.2 billion people. From Latin America an agricultural superpower to the rice and oil palm producing fields of Other Asian countries and the breadbasket markets of North America. Together these five regions account for nearly three-quarters of the world's population and roughly 80 percent of the total fertilizer consumption. Delivering when we're needed As the world's food challenges become more pressing, we're taking an active role in meeting them, investing heavily in our assets to deliver quality product when and where our customers need it. We are adding to our current potash capacity without building a new mine - an advantage as demand is expected to rise. And through our partnerships and investments, we strive to better serve customers in emerging markets. How we do business We hold ourselves to the highest business standards and consider factors beyond financial performance when evaluating our success. Guided by our Core Values, we cultivate mutually beneficial relationships with our communities, customers, employees, investors and other people critical to our success. Acting with a long-term view, we make decisions that consider people and the planet, always looking for opportunities to improve.

During the first six months of this year, our offshore shipments reached a record total and we believe these conditions will continue to support further growth of our potash business in the years ahead.\" Saskatoon, Saskatchewan - Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc. (PotashCorp) reported second-quarter earnings of $0.50 per share ($417 million), bringing the first-half total to $0.94 per share ($787 million). Earnings for both the quarter and the first six months trailed 2014's comparable period amounts of $0.56 per share ($472 million) and $0.95 per share ($812 million), respectively. Improved potash and phosphate contributions were offset by weaker nitrogen earnings, resulting in gross margin of $711 million in this year's second quarter (down 5 percent) and $1.4 billion for the first half (up 5 percent). Cash from operating activities of $836 million in the second quarter and $1.4 billion for the first half of 2015 surpassed last year's comparable totals due to favorable changes in non-cash operating working capital. Earnings before finance costs, income taxes and depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $792 million for the quarter and $1.5 billion for the first six months were below 2014 comparative figures. Our investments in Arab Potash Company (APC) in Jordan, Israel Chemicals Ltd. (ICL) in Israel, Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile S.A. (SQM) in Chile and Sinofert Holdings Limited (Sinofert) in China contributed $64 million to our quarterly earnings. This result exceeded the $55 million earned in the second quarter of 2014 and brought first-half contributions to $97 million, down significantly from last year's total of $155 million, which included a special dividend from ICL. Market Conditions Global potash shipments remained strong during the second quarter, especially to China and India where higher contract volumes supported robust shipments for most producers. Demand in other offshore markets remained at historically high levels, although the impacts of weaker crop economics, currency volatility and credit availability slowed purchases from 2014's record pace - most notably in Brazil. In North America, a shortened planting season and greater availability of product from offshore suppliers kept domestic producer sales below 2014's exceptionally strong comparative period. In nitrogen, prices for most products declined from those realized in second-quarter 2014 as market fundamentals weakened on increased global supply and record Chinese urea exports over the past 12 months. As the quarter progressed, urea prices found support on stronger demand in key import markets and slowing exports from China, while ammonia markets stabilized due to supply constraints in major exporting regions. In phosphate, solid phosphate fertilizer prices were generally consistent with those in the second quarter of 2014 as improved Indian demand more than offset weakness in Latin America and record Chinese exports. Robust demand for other phosphate products - most notably liquid fertilizers in India and North America - supported improved prices relative to 2014's second quarter. Potash Potash gross margin of $417 million for 2015's second quarter and $845 million for the first six months reflected improved realizations, with results in both periods exceeding the respective totals of $395 million and $695 million generated in 2014. While total sales volumes for both the quarter (2.5 million tonnes) and first six months (4.9 million tonnes) were in line with those of 2014, offshore shipments were especially robust, up 18 percent and 17 percent, respectively. Canpotex3 shipments reached record levels for both periods in 2015 due to improved rail logistics and enhanced infrastructure and distribution capabilities. For the quarter, the majority of Canpotex's shipments were to Latin America (37 percent) and Other Asian countries outside of China and India (30 percent), while China and India accounted for 20 percent and 8 percent, respectively. North American sales volumes declined for both the quarter (down 31 percent) and the first six months (down 25 percent) from the exceptionally strong comparative periods in 2014. Our average realized potash price of $273 per tonne for the second quarter was up from $263 per tonne in the same period last year. This improvement reflected higher prices in most markets compared to last year's second quarter when realizations were still recovering from the lows experienced in early 2014. Per-tonne cost of goods sold for the second quarter was slightly above the same period in 2014. The favorable impact of a weakened Canadian dollar and operational efficiencies was more than offset by fewer tonnes sourced from our lower-cost mines. This was due largely to the Allan Canpotex proving run that we completed in the second quarter of 2014. Nitrogen Weaker prices for all nitrogen product categories resulted in gross margin of $222 million for the quarter and $403 million for the first six months, trailing last year's comparable periods by 27 percent and 26 percent, respectively. Our US operations accounted for 71 percent of our nitrogen gross margin for the quarter, with Trinidad providing the remainder. Second-quarter sales volumes of 1.6 million tonnes were relatively flat with the same period in 2014. Total first-half sales volumes were 2.9 million tonnes - 11 percent below the same period last year. This reduction was primarily due to first-quarter headwinds, which included market weakness, mechanical challenges at Lima and greater gas curtailments in Trinidad. Our average realized price of $334 per tonne during the quarter declined from the $393 per tonne in the same period last year. This was largely the result of increased supply in key producing regions, which pressured benchmark prices and realizations for all our products. Cost of goods sold for the quarter averaged $201 per tonne, down from $213 per tonne in 2014's second quarter, driven primarily by lower natural gas costs in both the US and Trinidad. Phosphate Phosphate gross margin of $72 million for the second quarter (up 50 percent) and $130 million for the first six months of 2015 (up 76 percent) improved significantly from the comparable periods in 2014. The absence of accelerated depreciation charges incurred in 2014 related to the closure that year of our Suwannee River chemical plant - as well as higher average netbacks this year - supported improved margins and more than offset lower sales volumes. Absence of production from Suwannee River reduced tonnes available for sale. Sales volumes of 0.7 million tonnes for the quarter and 1.3 million tonnes for the first six months trailed comparative periods in 2014 by 20 percent and 18 percent, respectively. Our average realized phosphate price for the quarter was $553 per tonne, up from $509 per tonne in the same period last year, reflecting a greater proportion of sales from higher-netback feed, industrial and liquid fertilizer products. Cost of goods sold of $450 per tonne for the second quarter was slightly below the same period in 2014. The absence of accelerated depreciation charges more than offset the negative impact of reduced production. Financial Provincial mining and other taxes for the second quarter increased to $90 million from the $69 million recorded in 2014, reflecting the impacts of a weaker Canadian dollar, higher potash prices and changes in the timing of allowable deductions within Saskatchewan's potash taxation regulations. Lower total earnings resulted in income tax expense declining to $152 million in the second quarter from $166 million during 2014's comparable period. Capital-related cash expenditures totaled $294 million during the quarter, exceeding the total in the same period last year, as we advanced work at our potash expansions in Rocanville and New Brunswick as well as our nitrogen expansion in Lima. During the quarter, we proposed to acquire K+S for EUR41 per share. This business combination would bring together complementary assets to create a well-capitalized, more diversified company across products, geographies, distribution and customers. Despite K+S' initial rejection, we believe that our proposal balances the interests of investors and other stakeholders, including the employees and communities in which the companies operate. As such, we remain focused on engaging with and having constructive discussions with K+S management that would include commitments to secure German locations and employment. Please bear in mind that we have not yet decided to make a formal offer. Potash Market Outlook Our expectations of global potash demand remain unchanged as we anticipate 2015 shipments of approximately 60 million tonnes. In North America, demand for our summer-fill program has been strong. We expect shipments in this market to accelerate through the remainder of the year, although competitive pressures have resulted in lower prices than recognized during the first six months. We now expect total 2015 shipments of 9.0-9.5 million tonnes. In Latin America, we anticipate strong third-quarter demand ahead of its key planting season. However, reduced credit availability and currency weakness in Brazil could slow purchases compared to the record pace in 2014. For the full year, we now forecast shipments of 10.6-11.1 million tonnes for this region. In China, strong shipments are expected through the second half as suppliers deliver against significant annual contracted volumes. Rising demand in China for compound fertilizers and bulk blends with higher potassium content is expected to require optional tonnage deliveries and push Canpotex sales volumes above its 1.8 million tonne minimum. Based on this strength - and increased domestic production - we now expect total shipments to reach 14.2-14.7 million tonnes. In India, potash demand continues to improve without meaningful subsidy change. Robust demand for direct application and compound fertilizers - as well as a later first-half contract settlement - is expected to result in significant Canpotex shipments through the rest of 2015. We maintain our full-year shipment estimate of 4.5-5.0 million tonnes and believe total deliveries could reach the upper end of our range. In Other Asian countries (outside of China and India), we maintain our estimate for shipments of 8.4-8.8 million tonnes. Significant competitive pressures and currency volatility could weigh on prices in these markets through the balance of the year. Financial Outlook With the first half behind us, we have revised our full-year expectations for our potash business. Our full-year sales volumes estimate has been narrowed to 9.3-9.6 million tonnes and - due to a decline in certain spot market prices through the second quarter - we have lowered the upper end of our previous potash gross margin range, now forecast at $1.5-$1.7 billion. We maintain our combined nitrogen and phosphate gross margin estimate of $1.0-$1.2 billion in 2015. In nitrogen, we expect greater supply will lead to a more subdued market and weaker prices relative to 2014, although lower natural gas prices are expected to keep cost of goods sold below last year's level. In phosphate, a shift to a more profitable product mix and supportive market fundamentals are expected to keep realizations above those of 2014. Additionally, we expect to benefit from per-tonne costs trending lower through the balance of the year on improved mining conditions at Aurora. We have increased our estimate of income from offshore equity investments to a range of $190-$210 million due to increased dividend income from ICL in the first half of the year. Selling and administrative expenses are now forecast in the range of $235-$245 million and finance costs are now expected to be in the range of $190-$200 million. As a result of the noted changes, we have revised our full-year 2015 earnings guidance to $1.75-$1.95 per share. For the third quarter, we forecast a range of $0.35-$0.45 per share. Other annual guidance numbers - including those noted above - are outlined in the table below. 2015 Guidance Earnings per share Annual: $1.75-$1.95 Q3: $0.35-$0.45 Potash sales volumes 9.3-9.6 million tonnes Potash gross margin $1.5-$1.7 billion Nitrogen and phosphate gross margin $1.0-$1.2 billion Capital expenditures* ~$1.2 billion Effective tax rate 26-28 percent Provincial mining and other taxes** 20-22 percent Selling and administrative expenses $235-$245 million Finance costs $190-$200 million Income from offshore equity investments*** $180-$210 million Annual Foreign Exchange Rate CDN$1.24 per US$ Annual EPS sensitivity to Foreign Exchange US$ strengthens vs. CDN$ by $0.02 = +$0.01 EPS * Does not include capitalized interest ** As a percentage of potash gross margin *** Includes income from dividends and share of equity earnings Notes 1.

Silver Wheaton Corp. (TSE: SLW) Silver Wheaton is the largest precious metal streaming company in the world. The company has entered into a number of agreements where, in exchange for an upfront payment, it has the right to purchase, at a low fixed cost, all or a portion of the silver and/or gold production from several high-quality mines located in politically stable regions around the globe. Silver Wheaton currently has streaming agreements for 21 operating mines and 6 development stage projects. The company's growth profile is driven by a portfolio of world-class assets, including precious metal and gold streams on Hudbay's Constancia project and Vale's Salobo and Sudbury mines. Silver Wheaton's unique business model creates significant shareholder value by providing: Leverage to increases in the price of silver and gold; Additional growth through the acquisition of new streams; A dividend yield, which has the potential to grow over time; and, Participation in the exploration success of the mines underlying its current agreements. Silver Wheaton offers these benefits while at the same time reducing many of the downside risks faced by traditional mining companies. In particular, Silver Wheaton offers its investors both capital and operating cost certainty. Other than its initial upfront payment, Silver Wheaton typically has no ongoing capital or exploration costs. Furthermore, its operating costs have historically been fixed at approximately US$4 per ounce of silver and US$400 per ounce of gold produced, allowing shareholders to benefit from strong margin growth in a rising silver and gold price environment. The company has an experienced management team with a strong track record of success, and is well positioned for further growth. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition for the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2015 Highlights Operations Record attributable silver equivalent production for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 of 10.9 million ounces (7.2 million ounces of silver and 50,500 ounces of gold) and 21.2 million ounces (13.5 million ounces of silver and 104,200 ounces of gold), respectively, representing an increase of 29% and 21% over the comparable periods in 2014. Record silver equivalent sales volume for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 of 10.0 million ounces (5.6 million ounces of silver and 61,000 ounces of gold) and 17.8 million ounces (11.2 million ounces of silver and 89,400 ounces of gold), respectively, representing an increase of 34% and 14% over the comparable periods in 2014. As at June 30, 2015, approximately 6.5 million payable silver equivalent ounces attributable to the Company have been produced at the various mines and will be recognized in future sales as they are delivered to the Company under the terms of their contracts, virtually unchanged from the balance at March 31, 2015. Payable ounces produced but not yet delivered to Silver Wheaton are expected to average approximately 2 to 3 months of annualized production but may vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors including mine ramp-up, delays in shipments, etc.1 Average realized sale price per silver equivalent ounce sold for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 of $16.38 ($16.42 per ounce of silver and $1,195 per ounce of gold) and $16.60 ($16.69 per ounce of silver and $1,201 per ounce of gold), compared with $19.83 and $20.11 for the comparable periods in 2014, representing a decrease of 17%. Revenue for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 of $164.4 million and $294.9 million, respectively, compared with $148.6 million and $313.9 million for the comparable periods in 2014, representing an increase of 11% and a decrease of 6%, respectively, relative to the comparable periods in 2014. Net earnings for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 was $53.7 million ($0.13 per share) and $103.1 million ($0.27 per share), respectively, compared with $63.5 million ($0.18 per share) and $143.3 million ($0.40 per share) for the comparable periods in 2014, representing a decrease of 15% and 28%, respectively. Operating cash flows for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 of $109.3 million ($0.27 per share2) and $198.4 million ($0.51 per share2), respectively, compared with $102.5 million ($0.29 per share2) and $217.4 million ($0.61 per share2) for the comparable periods in 2014, representing an increase of 7% and a decrease of 9%, respectively. On August 11, 2015, the Board of Directors declared a dividend in the amount of $0.05 per common share as per the Company's stated dividend policy whereby the quarterly dividend will be equal to 20% of the average of the operating cash flow of the previous four quarters. This dividend is payable to shareholders of record on August 26, 2015 and is expected to be distributed on or about September 4, 2015. The Company has implemented a dividend reinvestment plan (\"DRIP\") whereby shareholders can elect to have dividends reinvested directly into additional Silver Wheaton common shares at a discount of 3% of the Average Market Price, as defined in the DRIP. Average cash costs1 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 of $4.76 and $4.63 per silver equivalent ounce, respectively, compared with $4.72 and $4.64 per silver equivalent ounce, respectively, for the comparable periods in 2014.1 Cash operating margin2 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 of $11.62 and $11.97 per silver equivalent ounce, respectively, compared with $15.11 and $15.47 per silver equivalent ounce, respectively, for the comparable periods in 2014.2 Other As per Hudbay Minerals Inc.'s (\"Hudbay\") second quarter 2015 MD&A, Hudbay's Constancia mine in Peru achieved commercial production on April 30, 2015. On July 6, 2015, the Company announced that it had received a proposal letter (the \"Proposal\") from the Canada Revenue Agency (\"CRA\") in which the CRA is proposing to reassess Silver Wheaton under various rules contained in the Income Tax Act (Canada). The Proposal outlines CRA's position that the transfer pricing provisions of the Income Tax Act (Canada) relating to income earned by the Company's foreign subsidiaries outside of Canada should apply such that the income of Silver Wheaton subject to tax in Canada should be increased for the 2005 to 2010 taxation years (the \"Relevant Taxation Years\") by approximately Cdn$715 million, which represents substantially all of the income of the Company's foreign subsidiaries. This amount represents a potential income inclusion and does not reflect the resultant tax liability. If Silver Wheaton is reassessed, the Company currently estimates on a preliminary basis that this would result in federal and provincial tax of approximately Cdn$190 million. The Proposal also indicates that the CRA is seeking to apply transfer pricing penalties of approximately Cdn$72 million in respect of the Relevant Taxation Years. The Proposal does not indicate the amount of interest or other penalties in respect of the Relevant Taxation Years. The issuance of the Proposal does not require the Company to pay any amount to the CRA at this time. If Silver Wheaton receives a notice of reassessment, Silver Wheaton intends to file a notice of objection and would be required to pay 50% of the reassessed amount of tax, interest and penalties. Management believes that the Company has filed its tax returns and paid applicable taxes in compliance with Canadian tax law, and as a result no amounts have been recorded for any potential liability arising from this matter (including other penalties and interest). Silver Wheaton intends to vigorously defend its tax filing positions. Overview Silver Wheaton Corp. is a mining company which generates its revenue from the sale of silver and gold. The Company is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and the Toronto Stock Exchange and trades under the symbol SLW. Currently, the Company has entered into 18 long-term purchase agreements and one early deposit long-term purchase agreement associated with silver and/or gold (\"precious metal purchase agreements\"), relating to 28 different mining assets, whereby Silver Wheaton acquires silver and gold production from the counterparties for a per ounce cash payment which is fixed by contract, generally at or below the prevailing market price. Attributable silver and gold as referred to in this MD&A and financial statements is the silver and gold production to which Silver Wheaton is entitled pursuant to the various purchase agreements. During the three months ended June 30, 2015, the per ounce price paid by the Company for silver and gold under the agreements averaged $4.26 and $395, respectively. The primary drivers of the Company's financial results are the volume of silver and gold production at the various mines to which the precious metal purchase agreements relate and the price of silver and gold realized by Silver Wheaton upon the sale of silver and gold received. Outlook Silver Wheaton is the largest pure precious metals streaming company in the world. Based upon its current agreements, forecast 2015 estimated annual attributable production is approximately 43.5 million silver equivalent ounces, including 230,000 ounces of gold. By 2019, estimated annual attributable production is anticipated to increase significantly to approximately 51 million silver equivalent ounces, including 325,000 ounces of gold. This anticipated growth is expected to be driven by the Company's portfolio of low-cost and long-life assets, including gold and precious metal streams on Vale's Salobo mine and Hudbay's Constancia mine. The $72 million of cash and cash equivalents as at June 30, 2015 combined with the liquidity provided by the available credit under the $2 billion Revolving Facility and ongoing operating cash flows, positions the Company well to fund all outstanding commitments and known contingencies as well as providing flexibility to acquire additional accretive precious metal stream interests. San Dimas On October 15, 2004, the Company entered into an agreement with Goldcorp Inc. (\"Goldcorp\") to acquire an amount equal to 100% of the silver produced by Goldcorp's Luismin mining operations in Mexico (owned at the date of the transaction) for a period of 25 years. The Luismin mining operations consisted primarily of the San Dimas and the Los Filos mines. On August 6, 2010, Goldcorp completed the sale of the San Dimas mine to Primero Mining Corp. (\"Primero\"). In conjunction with the sale, Silver Wheaton amended its silver purchase agreement relating to the mine. The term of the agreement, as it relates to San Dimas, was extended to the life of mine. During the first four years following the closing of the transaction, Primero delivered to Silver Wheaton a per annum amount equal to the first 3.5 million ounces of payable silver produced at San Dimas and 50% of any excess, plus Silver Wheaton received an additional 1.5 million ounces of silver per annum which was delivered by Goldcorp. Beginning on August 6, 2014, which was the fourth anniversary of the closing, Primero will deliver a per annum amount to Silver Wheaton equal to the first 6 million ounces of payable silver produced at San Dimas and 50% of any excess. Goldcorp will continue to guarantee the delivery by Primero of all silver produced and owing to the Company until 2029. Primero has provided Silver Wheaton with a right of first refusal on any metal stream or similar transaction it enters into. As per Primero's second quarter MD&A, the San Dimas mill averaged 2,816 tonnes per day (\"tpd\") in the second quarter, and the expansion of the San Dimas mine and mill from 2,500 tpd to 3,000 tpd is ahead of its originally planned completion of mid-2016 and now expected to be completed in April 2016 following the completion of the tailings filter system. As per Primero's July 20, 2015 news release, drilling results through the end of June 2015 have increased the Jessica vein's known extent to approximately 300 meters of strike length and 300 meters of dip, and remains open laterally for 1.7 kilometers between two major faults. The Jessica vein was not included in Primero's year-end 2014 reserve and resource estimation, but has since been included in its 2015 mine plan and is expected to provide approximately 5% of San Dimas' total mill feed in 2015. According to Primero, based on the full drill results through the end of June 2015, the Company expects to replace its estimated full-year 2015 production. As at June 30, 2015, approximately 0.8 million ounces of cumulative payable silver ounces have been produced at San Dimas but not yet delivered to the Company, representing an increase of 0.5 million payable silver ounces during the three month period ended June 30, 2015. As reported by Primero on July 6, 2015, silver deliveries had been delayed as a result of a suspension of Primero's import and export licenses in May 2015 by the Mexican customs authorities due to a discrepancy over Primero's address related to its corporate office relocation from Mexico City to Durango, Mexico. As per Primero's August 6, 2015 news release, the import and export license has been reinstated and normal course imports and exports have resumed, including the commencement of sales of all inventoried silver. As at June 30, 2015, the Company has received approximately 66.2 million ounces of silver related to San Dimas under the agreement, generating cumulative operating cash flows of approximately $928 million. As at December 31, 2014, the San Dimas mine had proven and probable silver reserves of 50.5 million ounces, measured and indicated silver resources of 6.4 million ounces and inferred silver resources of 61.3 million ounces (as described in the Attributable Reserves and Resources section of this MD&A). Yauliyacu On March 23, 2006, the Company entered into an agreement with Glencore International AG (\"Glencore\") to acquire an amount equal to 100% of the silver produced from Glencore's Yauliyacu mining operations in Peru, up to a maximum of 4.75 million ounces per year, for a period of 20 years. In the event that silver sold and delivered to Silver Wheaton in any year totals less than 4.75 million ounces, the amount sold and delivered to Silver Wheaton in subsequent years will be increased to make up for any cumulative shortfall, to the extent production permits. The cumulative shortfall as at March 23, 2015, representing the nine year anniversary, was 19.7 million ounces. During the term of the agreement, Silver Wheaton has a right of first refusal on any future sales of silver streams from the Yauliyacu mine and a right of first offer on future sales of silver streams from any other mine owned by Glencore at the time of the initial transaction. Since mid-2009, concentrate shipments from the Yauliyacu mine have been affected by the shut-down of La Oroya smelter in Peru, resulting in an inconsistent delivery schedule. As at June 30, 2015, approximately 0.8 million ounces of cumulative payable silver ounces have been produced at Yauliyacu but not yet delivered to the Company, representing a decrease of 0.2 million payable silver ounces during the three month period ended June 30, 2015. As at June 30, 2015, the Company has received approximately 23.8 million ounces of silver related to the Yauliyacu mine under the agreement, generating cumulative operating cash flows of approximately $358 million. As at December 31, 2014, the Company's share of the Yauliyacu proven and probable silver reserves was 15.0 million ounces, measured and indicated silver resources was 45.5 million ounces and inferred silver resources was 28.7 million ounces (as described in the Attributable Reserves and Resources section of this MD&A). Penasquito On July 24, 2007, the Company entered into an agreement with Goldcorp to acquire an amount equal to 25% of the silver produced from Goldcorp's Penasquito mining operations (the \"Penasquito mine\") in Mexico for the life of mine. As disclosed in Goldcorp's second quarter 2015 MD&A, progress on the construction of the Northern Well Field (\"NWF\") project was limited due to continued social issues with local communities. According to Goldcorp, the remaining NWF work is on hold until a fair resolution of the issues is reached with the communities, but contingency plans remain in place for a fresh water supply to Penasquito until the NWF is fully operational. It was also reported that the Metallurgical Enhancement Project (\"MEP\") continues to demonstrate the potential to significantly enhance the overall economics and mine life of Penasquito, and that during the quarter, the pilot plant construction was completed and pilot plant testing commenced. MEP permit applications were submitted in May 2015 and the feasibility study remains on track for completion in early 2016. As at June 30, 2015, approximately 0.9 million ounces of cumulative payable silver ounces have been produced at Penasquito but not yet delivered to the Company, representing an increase of 0.3 million payable silver ounces during the three month period ended June 30, 2015.1 As at June 30, 2015, the Company has received approximately 29.4 million ounces of silver related to the Penasquito mine under the agreement, generating cumulative operating cash flows of approximately $600 million. As at December 31, 2014, the Company's 25% share of the Penasquito proven and probable silver reserves was 152.8 million ounces, measured and indicated silver resources was 108.5 million ounces and inferred silver resources was 5.4 million ounces (as described in the Attributable Reserves and Resources section of this MD&A). Barrick On September 8, 2009, the Company entered into an agreement with Barrick to acquire an amount equal to 25% of the life of mine silver production from its Pascua-Lama project which is located in Chile and Argentina, as well as 100% of the silver production from its Lagunas Norte mine and Pierina mine, which are both located in Peru, and its Veladero2 mine which is located in Argentina (collectively referred to as the \"Barrick mines\") until the end of 2013. During the fourth quarter of 2013, Barrick announced the temporary suspension of construction activities at its Pascua-Lama project, other than those required for environmental and regulatory compliance. During 2014, the project was placed on care and maintenance. As a result of Barrick's decision to temporarily suspend construction activities at the Pascua-Lama project, and the various amendments to the precious metal purchase agreement between Silver Wheaton and Barrick, Silver Wheaton is now entitled to 100% of the silver production from Barrick's Lagunas Norte mine, Pierina mine (now in closure) and Veladero mine until the earlier of April 1, 2018 and the date Barrick satisfies the completion test. In addition, Silver Wheaton has agreed to extend the completion test deadline an additional 4  1/2  years to June 30, 2020. If the requirements of the completion test have not been satisfied by the revised outside completion date, the agreement may be terminated by Silver Wheaton. In such an event, Silver Wheaton will be entitled to the return of $625 million less a credit for silver delivered up to that date. Barrick has also granted Silver Wheaton a five year right of first refusal on any further metal stream sales in connection with the Pascua-Lama project, where more than 50% of the value is derived from silver. In 2013, Barrick initiated the closure of its Pierina mine. As at June 30, 2015, all cumulative payable silver ounces produced at Barrick to which Silver Wheaton is entitled have been delivered to the Company.1 As at June 30, 2015, the Company has received approximately 14.0 million ounces of silver related to the Barrick mines under the agreement, generating cumulative operating cash flows of approximately $300 million. As at December 31, 2013, the Company's 25% share of the Pascua-Lama proven and probable silver reserves were 168.7 million ounces, measured and indicated silver resources was 28.7 million ounces and inferred silver resources was 3.2 million ounces (as described in the Attributable Reserves and Resources section of this MD&A). In addition, as at December 31, 2014, the Company's estimated share of the proven and probable silver reserves contained in the Lagunas Norte and Veladero mines is 55.4 million ounces. Update on Matters Relating to Project Development Pascua-Lama SMA Regulatory Sanctions As per Barrick's second quarter 2015 financial statements, on April 22, 2015, Chile's environmental regulator, known as the SMA, reopened the administrative proceeding against Compania Minera Nevada (\"CMN\"), Barrick's Chilean subsidiary that holds the Chilean portion of the Pascua-Lama project, in accordance with the Environmental Court Decision. Barrick states that CMN has filed a petition to limit the scope of this administrative proceeding to the original allegations before the environmental regulator at the time it issued the May 2013 Resolution. A decision from the SMA is pending in this matter. Additionally, Barrick states that on April 22, 2015, CMN was notified that the SMA has initiated a new administrative proceeding for alleged deviations from certain requirements of the Pascua Lama project's environmental approval, including with respect to the Pascua Lama project's environmental impact and a series of monitoring requirements. In May 2015, CMN submitted a compliance program to address certain of the allegations and presented its defense to the remainder of the alleged deviations. Barrick states that the SMA rejected CMN's proposed compliance program on June 24, 2015, and that CMN filed an administrative appeal of this decision on July 3, 2015. A decision from the SMA on the administrative appeal and on CMN's defense to the remainder of the alleged deviations is pending. Barrick indicates that further submissions may be required if CMN's administrative appeal is denied, and that the new administrative proceeding against CMN is separate from the original administrative proceeding described above, and could result in additional sanctions including new administrative fines and/or the revocation of the Pascua Lama project's environmental permit. Pascua-Lama Chilean Environmental Court Ruling As per Barrick's second quarter 2015 financial statements, on March 23, 2015, the Environmental Court ruled in favor of CMN in this matter, finding that the Pascua-Lama project has not damaged glaciers in the Pascua-Lama project area. Barrick states that as the plaintiffs did not appeal, this matter is now closed. 777 On August 8, 2012, the Company entered into an agreement with Hudbay to acquire an amount equal to 100% of the life of mine silver and gold production from its currently producing 777 mine, located in Canada. Silver Wheaton's share of gold production at 777 will remain at 100% until the later of the end of 2016 or the satisfaction of a completion test relating to Hudbay's Constancia mine, after which it will be reduced to 50% for the remainder of the mine life. Hudbay has granted Silver Wheaton a right of first refusal on any future streaming agreement, royalty agreement, or similar transaction related to the production of silver or gold from 777. The silver production, sales and related costs associated with this agreement are reflected in this MD&A and financial statements as part of Other mines. As at June 30, 2015, approximately 0.3 million ounces of cumulative payable silver equivalent ounces (including approximately 3,400 ounces of gold) have been produced at 777 but not yet delivered to the Company, representing a decrease of 0.2 million payable silver equivalent ounces during the three month period ended June 30, 2015.1 As at June 30, 2015, the Company has received approximately 1.5 million ounces of silver and 154,000 ounces of gold related to the 777 mine under the agreement, generating cumulative operating cash flows of approximately $147 million. As at December 31, 2014, the Company's share of 777's proven and probable reserves was 6.3 million ounces of silver and 310,000 ounces of gold, measured and indicated resources was 0.6 million ounces of silver and 20,000 ounces of gold and inferred resources was 0.8 million ounces of silver and 20,000 ounces of gold (as described in the Attributable Reserves and Resources section of this MD&A). Salobo On February 28, 2013, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire from Vale an amount of gold equal to 25% of the life of mine gold production from its currently producing Salobo mine, located in Brazil. On March 2, 2015, the Company agreed to amend the agreement with Vale to acquire from Vale an additional amount of gold equal to 25% of the life of mine gold production from any minerals from the Salobo mine that enter the Salobo mineral processing facility from and after January 1, 2015. This acquisition is in addition to the 25% of the Salobo mine gold production that the Company acquired pursuant to the agreement in 2013. Under the amended agreement, on March 24, 2015 the Company paid Vale cash consideration of $900 million for the increased gold stream. In addition, the Company is required to make ongoing payments of the lesser of $400 per ounce of gold (subject to an inflationary adjustment of 1% commencing as of January 1, 2017) for the full 50% of gold production or the prevailing market price per ounce of gold delivered. As reported by Vale, Vale is in the process of ramping up mill throughput at the Salobo mine from 12 million tones per annum (\"Mtpa\") to 24 Mtpa, with the potential to further increase throughput beyond 24 Mtpa. Under the terms of the amended agreement, if the expansion to 24 Mtpa is not completed by December 31, 2016, the Company continues to be entitled to a gross up (a temporary increased percentage of gold production) based on the pro rata achievement of the target production. Extensive mineral reserves and exploration potential suggest that an even greater throughput expansion potential exists. If throughput capacity is expanded within a predetermined period, the Company will be required to make an additional payment to Vale, relative to the 50% stream, based on a set fee schedule ranging from $88 million if throughput is expanded beyond 28 Mtpa by January 1, 2036, to up to $720 million if throughput is expanded beyond 40 Mtpa by January 1, 2018. There will be no additional deposit due if the expansion does not occur until after January 1, 2036. Any further future increase in mill throughput at the Salobo mine is expected to allow the Company to enhance its production growth profile and benefit from any future exploration successes at the Salobo mine. As at June 30, 2015, approximately 1.1 million ounces of cumulative payable silver equivalent ounces (approximately 14,900 ounces of gold) have been produced at Salobo but not yet delivered to the Company, representing a decrease of 0.4 million payable silver equivalent ounces during the three month period ended June 30, 2015.1 As of June 30, 2015, the Company has received approximately 102,800 ounces of gold related to the Salobo mine under the agreement, generating cumulative operating cash flows of approximately $87 million. As at December 31, 2014, the Company's 50% share of the Salobo proven and probable gold reserves was 6.7 million ounces, measured and indicated gold resources was 1.5 million ounces and inferred gold resources was 0.7 million ounces (as described in the Attributable Reserves and Resources section of this MD&A). Sudbury On February 28, 2013, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire from Vale an amount of gold equal to 70% of the gold production from certain of its currently producing Sudbury mines located in Canada, including the Coleman mine, Copper Cliff mine, Garson mine, Stobie mine, Creighton mine, Totten mine and the Victor project (the \"Sudbury mines\") for a period of 20 years. As at June 30, 2015, approximately 0.7 million ounces of cumulative payable silver equivalent ounces (approximately 9,900 ounces of gold) have been produced at Sudbury but not yet delivered to the Company, representing a decrease of 0.3 million payable silver equivalent ounces during the three month period ended June 30, 2015.1 As of June 30, 2015, the Company has received approximately 68,300 ounces of gold related to the Sudbury mines under the agreement, generating cumulative operating cash flows of approximately $59 million. As at December 31, 2014, the Company's 70% share of the Sudbury mines proven and probable gold reserves was 680,000 ounces, measured and indicated gold resources was 320,000 ounces and inferred gold resources was 120,000 ounces (as described in the Attributable Reserves and Resources section of this MD&A).

On November 4, 2013, the Company amended its agreement with Hudbay to include the acquisition of an amount equal to 50%1 of the life of mine gold production from Constancia. If the Constancia processing plant fails to achieve at least 90% of expected throughput and silver recovery by December 31, 2016, Silver Wheaton would be entitled to continued delivery of 100% of the gold production from Hudbay's 777 mine. If the completion test has not been satisfied by December 31, 2020, Silver Wheaton would be entitled to a proportionate return of the upfront cash consideration relating to Constancia. In addition, Silver Wheaton would be entitled to additional compensation in respect of the gold stream should there be a delay in achieving completion or mining the Pampacancha deposit beyond the end of 2018. Hudbay has granted Silver Wheaton a right of first refusal on any future streaming agreement, royalty agreement, or similar transaction related to the production of silver or gold from Constancia (see additional discussion below). Keno Hill In June 2014, the Company amended its silver purchase agreement with Alexco to increase the production payment to be a function of the silver price at the time of delivery. In addition, the area of interest was expanded to include properties currently owned by Alexco and properties acquired by Alexco in the future which fall within a one kilometer radius of existing Alexco holdings in the Keno Hill Silver District. The amended agreement is conditional on Alexco paying Silver Wheaton $20 million by December 31, 2015. Constancia As disclosed in Hudbay's second quarter 2015 MD&A, the Constancia mine achieved commercial production on April 30, 2015. Attributable production to Silver Wheaton from Constancia in the second quarter was approximately 0.6 million ounces of silver and 3,510 ounces of gold. Hudbay also reported that ocean shipments began in April 2015 and that the mine and concentrators are currently operating at or above design capacity. Hudbay also reports that during the second quarter, shipments of concentrate from the Constancia mine to the port in Matarani, Peru were constrained by several factors including truck availability, protests (unrelated to Constancia) along the lower part of the trucking route, and road refurbishment activities along the route that increased cycle times for concentrate trucks. According to Hudbay, steps have been taken to increase the size of the trucking fleet, and the excess inventory is expected to be drawn down over the second half of 2015. General As at June 30, 2015, approximately 1.9 million ounces of cumulative payable silver equivalent ounces (including approximately 8,000 ounces of gold) have been produced at the Other mines but not yet delivered to the Company, representing an increase of 0.3 million payable silver equivalent ounces during the three month period ended June 30, 2015.1 As at June 30, 2015, the Company has received approximately 42.8 million ounces of silver and 129,000 ounces of gold under these agreements, generating cumulative operating cash flows of approximately $900 million.

Early Deposit Silver and Gold Interest On November 11, 2013, the Company entered into a life of mine early deposit precious metal purchase agreement (the \"Early Deposit Agreement\") to acquire from Sandspring Resources Ltd. (\"Sandspring\") an amount of gold equal to 10% of the gold production from its Toroparu project (\"Toroparu\") located in the Republic of Guyana, South America. Under the Early Deposit Agreement, Silver Wheaton was to pay Sandspring total cash consideration of $148.5 million, of which $13.5 million has been paid to date, with the additional $135 million to be payable on an installment basis to partially fund construction of the mine. On April 22, 2015, the Company amended its Early Deposit Agreement to include the acquisition of an amount equal to 50% of the silver production from Toroparu. Silver Wheaton will make a total upfront cash payment of $5 million in connection with this amendment, of which $1 million has been paid to date, $1 million will be paid in two equal installments over the remainder of 2015, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, and $3 million will be payable on an installment basis to partially fund construction of the mine. In addition, Silver Wheaton will make ongoing payments of the lesser of $3.90 per ounce of silver (subject to an inflationary adjustment of 1% beginning in the fourth year of production) or the prevailing market price per ounce of silver delivered. As a result of the addition of the silver stream to the Early Deposit Agreement, Silver Wheaton will now pay Sandspring total consideration of $153.5 million. Under the amended Early Deposit Agreement, the due date for the feasibility study, environmental study and impact assessment and other related documents (collectively the \"Feasibility Documentation\") was extended to December 31, 2016. There will be a 60 day period following the delivery of a Feasibility Documentation, or after December 31, 2016 if the Feasibility Documentation has not been delivered to Silver Wheaton by such date, where Silver Wheaton may elect not to proceed with the Early Deposit Agreement, at which time Silver Wheaton will be entitled to a return of the amounts advanced less $2 million which is non-refundable or, at Sandspring's option, the gold stream percentage will be reduced from 10% to 0.909% and the silver stream percentage will be reduced from 50% to nil. Silver Wheaton may also elect to terminate the Early Deposit Agreement upon the occurrence of certain events prior to the payment of any initial construction payment and elect to reduce the stream percentages or obtain a return of the amounts advanced less $2 million. As at March 31, 2013, the Company's 10% share of the Toroparu proven and probable gold reserves was 410,000 ounces, measured and indicated gold resources was 240,000 ounces and inferred gold resources was 310,000 ounces.

The Company also has a right of first refusal on any silver streaming, royalty or any other transaction on the Metates properties. Results of Operations and Operational Review The Company currently has nine reportable operating segments: the silver produced by the San Dimas, Yauliyacu, Penasquito and Barrick mines, the gold produced by the 777, Sudbury and Salobo mines, the silver and gold produced by the other mines and corporate operations. For the three months ended June 30, 2015, attributable silver equivalent production was 10.9 million ounces (7.2 million ounces of silver and 50,500 ounces of gold), relative to 8.5 million ounces (6.3 million ounces of silver and 32,800 ounces of gold) for the comparable period in 2014, with the 2.4 million ounce increase being primarily attributable to the following factors: 1.5 million silver equivalent ounce (270%) increase related to gold production at the Salobo mine (19,300 gold ounces), with the increase in gold production being primarily due to higher throughput as a result of the continuing ramp up of the first 12 Mtpa line, the commissioning of the second 12 Mtpa line which commenced late in the second quarter of 2014, and the acquisition of an additional 25% gold interest in the Salobo mine as explained in the Silver and Gold interest section of this MD&A, partially offset by lower grades; 669,000 ounce (60%) increase related to the San Dimas mine, due to a combination of (i) the annual sharing threshold increasing from 3.5 million ounces to 6.0 million ounces per year, effective August 6, 2014; and (ii) a 17% increase in mill throughput as a result of the expansion to 2,500 tpd which was completed early in 2014, partially offset by (iii) the cessation on August 6, 2014 of Goldcorp's obligation to deliver 1.5 million ounces of silver to the Company annually; 311,000 ounce (104%) increase related to the Barrick mines, due primarily to higher grades at Veladero. For the three months ended June 30, 2015, net earnings and cash flow from operations were $53.7 million and $109.3 million, respectively, relative to $63.5 million and $102.5 million for the comparable period in 2014, with the $9.8 million decrease in net earnings being primarily attributable to the following factors: $12.2 million increase related to a 18% increase in payable silver ounces produced; and $4.1 million increase related to a 53% increase in payable gold ounces produced; and $2.0 million decrease related to the composition of mines from which silver is produced; and $3.6 million increase related to the composition of mines from which gold is produced; and $5.9 million decrease as a result of the timing of shipments of stockpiled concentrate and dore, primarily attributable to the following factors: $9.0 million decrease relating to the San Dimas mine, as more fully described under San Dimas in the Silver and Gold Interests section of this MD&A; and $5.4 million decrease relating to the Penasquito mine; partially offset by $6.3 million increase relating to the Yauliyacu mine which continues to have an inconsistent delivery schedule as a result of the shut-down of the La Oroya smelter in Peru; and $23.4 million decrease due to a reduction in the operating margin per ounce, due primarily to an 17% decrease in the average realized selling price per silver equivalent ounce sold; and $1.6 million increase as a result of a decrease in corporate costs as explained in the Corporate Costs section of this MD&A ($0.3 million decrease from a cash flow perspective). For the six months ended June 30, 2015, attributable silver equivalent production was 21.2 million ounces (13.5 million ounces of silver and 104,200 ounces of gold), relative to 17.4 million ounces (13.2 million ounces of silver and 66,600 ounces of gold) for the comparable period in 2014, with the 3.7 million ounce increase being primarily attributable to the following factors: 2,961,000 silver equivalent ounce (267%) increase related to gold production at the Salobo mine (37,600 gold ounces), with the increase in gold production being primarily due to higher throughput as a result of the continuing ramp up of the first 12 Mtpa line, the commissioning of the second 12 Mtpa line which commenced late in the second quarter of 2014, and the acquisition of an additional 25% gold interest in the Salobo mine as explained in the Silver and Gold interest section of this MD&A; 989,000 ounce (36%) increase related to the San Dimas mine, due to a combination of (i) the annual sharing threshold increasing from 3.5 million ounces to 6.0 million ounces per year, effective August 6, 2014; and (ii) a 23% increase in mill throughput as a result of the expansion to 2,500 tpd which was completed early in 2014, partially offset by (iii) the cessation on August 6, 2014 of Goldcorp's obligation to deliver 1.5 million ounces of silver to the Company annually; 650,000 ounce (108%) increase related to the Barrick mines, due primarily to higher grades at Veladero;and 365,000 silver equivalent ounce (41%) increase related to gold production at the Sudbury mines (3,400 gold ounces), with the increase in gold production being primarily due to higher grades, throughput and recoveries and; partially offset by 727,000 ounce (18%) decrease related to the Penasquito mine, due primarily to lower grades and recovery; and 439,000 ounce (10%) decrease related to the Other mines, due primarily to the disposal of the Campo Morado silver interest, the cessation of silver deliveries from the Mineral Park mine and lower grades and throughput at the Cozamin mine, partially offset by the ramping up of production at the Constancia mine. For the six months ended June 30, 2015, net earnings and cash flow from operations were $103.1 million and $198.4 million, respectively, relative to $143.3 million and $217.4 million for the comparable period in 2014, with the $40.2 million decrease in net earnings being primarily attributable to the following factors: $7.6 million increase related to a 5% increase in payable silver ounces produced; and $10.3 million increase related to a 55% increase in payable gold ounces produced; and\\$0.8 million decrease related to the composition of mines from which silver is produced; and $3.7 million increase related to the composition of mines from which gold is produced; and $14.3 million decrease as a result of the timing of shipments of stockpiled concentrate and dore, primarily attributable to the following factors: $8.4 million decrease relating to the San Dimas mine, as more fully described under San Dimas in the Silver and Gold Interests section of this MD&A; and $6.7 million decrease relating to the Salobo mine; partially offset by $1.6 million increase relating to the Other mines, primarily attributable to Zinkgruvan; and $45.7 million decrease due to a reduction in the operating margin per ounce, due primarily to an 18% decrease in the average realized selling price per silver equivalent ounce sold; and $1.1 million decrease as a result of an increase in corporate costs, as explained in the Corporate Costs section of this MD&A ($7.5 million decrease from a cash flow perspective).

Sherritt Announces Q2 2015 Results Nickel production increases 8% over Q2 2014 and Net Direct Cash Costs decline at Moa and Ambatovy Toronto, Ontario - July 28, 2015 - Sherritt International Corporation (\"Sherritt\" or the \"Corporation\") (TSX: S), a world leader in the mining and refining of nickel from lateritic ores, today reported its financial results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015. \"Our metals business continues to provide stable production while we find ways to lower cash costs. Our business-wide emphasis on controlling costs while ramping up to full production at Ambatovy contributed to lower cash costs of US$5.48 at Ambatovy, and US$4.12 at Moa,\" said David Pathe, President and CEO. \"Despite a once in ten year maintenance shutdown at Fort Saskatchewan and some unplanned disruptions at Ambatovy in the quarter, we saw overall nickel production increase by 8% over the prior year period,\" continued Pathe. \"During the quarter, we obtained three more certificates from the Independent Engineer, leaving two outstanding certificates to attain financial completion at the end of September.\" Q2 HIGHLIGHTS Average reference prices for our primary products were down significantly year over year, with nickel down 30% and oil down 45% from the same quarter last year. Finished nickel production was 8% higher at 8,035 tonnes, in a quarter that included a once-in-10 year maintenance shutdown at Fort Saskatchewan and Ambatovy production impacts from a strike and damage to ore thickeners. Net direct cash costs fell for the second consecutive quarter this year, to US$4.12 per pound at the Moa JV and US$5.48 per pound at Ambatovy. Ambatovy's Independent Engineer signed off on the Efficiency, Production and Environmental Certificates, leaving two remaining certificates required for Financial Completion. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 47% from the same quarter last year, and 9% from Q1 2015 Adjusted EBITDA, consistent with the decline in metal and oil prices. Combined adjusted operating cash flow per share increased to $0.09 per share in the second quarter this year from $0.06 per share in the same quarter last year. Combined administration expenses declined for the second consecutive quarter this year, to $17.3 million compared to $27.5 million in the second quarter of 2014. OUTLOOK AND SIGNIFICANT ITEMS We lowered production guidance at Ambatovy and narrowed the expected production range to 45,000 - 48,000 tonnes (100% basis) finished nickel, from the original guidance of 47,000 - 52,000 tonnes finished nickel (100% basis). Mixed sulphide and cobalt production expectations have also been revised as presented in the Outlook table. This change recognizes the production impacts in the second quarter, and our schedule to return to operations with both thickeners online. We reduced expected capital spending in Oil and Gas to $81 million from the $96 million projection provided as part of the Q1 2015 disclosure, which was itself a downward revision from the original $107 million estimate. These revisions are consistent with the objective of preserving capital and adjusting capital spending as new results are analyzed. In the first quarter this year, we had a tax recovery of $30.1 million due to the reduction in statutory tax rates in Cuba accompanying Cuba's new foreign investment regime. In the second quarter, we had an additional tax recovery of $13.2 million in Oil and Gas, as we received clarification from the Cuban tax authority pertaining to a further recovery, which will be a nonrecurring item. We recorded a $19.1 million gain on the sale of our corporate head office. Q2 2015 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS During the second quarter, $27.6 million ($0.09 per share) in adjusting items occurred that primarily included a $19.1 million gain on the sale of the corporate office, and a $13.2 million tax recovery due to the reduction in statutory tax rates in Cuba. This tax recovery follows a similar tax recovery of $30.1 million recognized in the first quarter of 2015. We received clarification from the Cuban tax authority pertaining to this additional recovery, which will be a non-recurring item. Metal markets Nickel prices continued to deteriorate in the second quarter, reaching a new six year low in July when spot prices dipped below US$ 5.00 per pound for the first time since 2009. At the prices reached in July approximately 50% of global nickel production is below break even on a C1 cash cost basis. Despite some nickel production being curtailed in the last year it appears that more significant production cuts will be required in order to have any impact on market fundamentals. Weaker nickel demand is supported by the decline in stainless steel output as many mills are entering a period of planned maintenance outages and stainless steel inventories remain high. Longer term, a supply deficit is still expected, although timing is expected to shift from the latter half of 2015 to 2016 as a consequence of reduced global stainless steel demand. A decline in nickel ore inventories in China, a modest reduction in LME inventory levels and less than 50% capacity utilization of Chinese NPI production facilities as reported by Shanghai Metal Markets support the thesis that Chinese NPI production has declined. This had been an expected consequence of NPI production being generally at a higher cost than current market. The average reference price for cobalt was relatively flat year over year and over the first quarter this year over year. Realized price differences between Moa and Ambatovy in cobalt generally reflect the longer shipment times to customers from Ambatovy, and timing of revenue recognition. Moa Joint Venture (50% interest) and Fort Site Adjusted EBITDA declined by 35% ($7.8 million) during the second quarter compared to the prior year period primarily due to lower nickel prices, partially offset by lower fuel oil and other energy prices and higher fertilizer prices. Finished nickel production of 3,877 tonnes (50% basis) for the second quarter of 2015 was 7 tonnes higher than the prior year quarter despite a longer planned annual maintenance shutdown. Stable operations at Moa continue to have a positive impact on mixed sulphides availability. Finished cobalt production of 429 tonnes (50% bases) for the second quarter of 2015 was higher than the prior year quarter, consistent with the trend in Q1 2015. A modestly higher cobalt ratio in the feed contributed to the increase. Nickel recovery at Moa of 89% in the quarter was consistent with the prior year quarter, and up slightly from the 88% historical standard. The net direct cash cost of US$4.12 per pound of nickel was down 18% (US$0.93 per pound) from the second quarter of 2014, despite flat production, as lower fuel oil and energy prices and lower third party feed costs were partially offset by higher sulphur and sulphuric acid prices. Fertilizer's EBITDA contributions have been strong both in the quarter and year to date, although the impact was partly offset by reduced production and sales volumes. Lower opening inventories after a strong Q4 2014 and the maintenance shutdown that occurred this quarter impacted production and sales volumes. Capital spending of $15.9 million in the quarter and $24.0 million year to date is mainly attributable to the higher planned spending, with expansion capital as budgeted for the construction of the 2,000 tonne per day acid plant which will eliminate the need to import acid. Ambatovy Joint Venture (40% interest) Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter was negative $1.7 million during the quarter compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $2.1 million in the same quarter last year. For the six month period ended June 30, 2015, Adjusted EBITDA of $2.6 million compares with negative $2.3 million in the first half of last year. During the quarter, finished nickel production was 4,158 tonnes (10,395 tonnes, 100% basis), an improvement of 15% over last year. Nickel average-realized prices in the quarter followed the decline in reference prices year over year. Average-realized prices for cobalt strengthened in the second quarter this year compared to their year ago level mainly because of exchange rate benefit, but also from the first quarter this year without any exchange rate benefit. The change from Q1 to Q2 this year relates to the timing of shipments and revenue recognition. Second quarter throughput and production were impacted by a strike in April, and by unplanned repair and redesign work required on both ore thickeners, one of which has returned to service. As announced in the May Ambatovy monthly production update, both ore thickeners were damaged in the third week of May, 2015 after two power failures and were subsequently emptied and taken offline for repair. Unthickened ore was processed directly through the PAL circuit during late May and June, reducing ore throughput capacity by approximately 15%. Ore Thickener 1 has since returned to service and is operating normally, with overall ore throughput rate capacity currently reduced by approximately 6%. Ore Thickener 2 will be re-assembled with additional support to the bridge structure, with the repair scheduled for Q3 this year. Capital spending is not expected to increase beyond the original 2015 guidance of $35 million (40% basis). Q2 nickel recovery was 86% compared to 85% in Q1 primarily due to efficiency improvements in the mixed sulphide precipitation circuit resulting from operational and process control improvements. The net direct cash cost (NDCC) of nickel was US$5.48 per pound in the second quarter of 2015, compared to US$5.74 in the first quarter this year, when production was higher. Mining, processing and refining costs per pound continue to fall with lower commodity input costs and lower maintenance costs, apart from the thickener repairs. Impacts to NDCC from the ore thickener failures have been limited, as fixed costs over lower unit volumes have been offset by savings in input costs, specifically sulphuric acid. Significant fixed cost reductions have also been identified and realised in response to the continued nickel price deterioration, including the head count reduction of approximately 1,100 employees and contractors as previously announced. The estimated annual savings from this reduction are approximately $5 million. Production in the second half of 2015 is expected to return to forecast levels with the outlook impacted by the unplanned and now resolved challenges experienced in the first half. Accordingly, we have narrowed our expected outlook range with a modest reduction to 45,000 - 48,000 tonnes nickel. Financial completion is described in Note 6 to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the period ended June 30, 2015. The two remaining certificates required to achieve financial completion are Legal and Other Conditions Certificate, which requires, among other things, registration of security interests over the project's assets and real property; and the Financial Certificate, which requires the funding of a senior debt reserve account in an amount equivalent to six months principal and interest payable, or approximately US$48 million for Sherritt's 40% share. Upon submission of the final certificates, the US$1.7 billion Ambatovy Joint Venture Financing (100% basis, balance at June 30, 2015) becomes non-recourse to the Ambatovy partners, and the interest rate increases by approximately 1% from approximately LIBOR plus 1.4% to LIBOR plus 2.55%. For the three months ended June 30, 2015, the Joint Venture partners were required to fund US$90.0 million on a 100% basis (US$36 million, Sherritt's 40% share) to cover obligations including the required semi-annual principal payments on the project finance facility. Further funding is required for obligations including the senior debt reserve account described above, prior to the September 30 2015 deadline for financial completion. OIL AND GAS Adjusted EBITDA was 48% ($27.6 million) lower in the second quarter compared to the prior year period, with realized oil and gas prices down 37% over the same period. In our Cuban operation, the averagerealized price in the second quarter was $45.71 per barrel, an improvement over the average-realized price of $41.44 in the first quarter this year, as WTI and Brent crude prices showed some signs of stabilization in the second quarter. Gross working interest (\"GWI\") oil production in Cuba decreased by 5% (921 barrels of oil per day in the second quarter compared to the prior year period, primarily due to natural reservoir declines and lower than expected production from development wells drilled under the Puerto Escondido/Yumuri Production Sharing Contract (PSC) extension. We have now drilled and completed a total of six new wells with a seventh in progress, fulfilling our commitments under the PSC extension. To date, oil production from the PSC extension wells has been lower than expected, with four of the six wells producing oil, and one being evaluated. After evaluation including results of the well currently in progress, we will determine what new drill activity to conduct, if any, on the PSC extension. Unit operating costs in Cuba increased 32% ($2.44 per barrel) in the second quarter compared to the prior year period, mainly reflecting increased workover costs, lower production and the weaker Canadian dollar. Q2 unit operating costs were also higher than Q1 this year, with lower production and increased workover costs accounting for the majority of the change. Cost-recovery oil production for the three and six months increased, consistent with the lower realized prices and an increase in eligible expenditures that can be claimed compared to the prior year periods. On a year to date basis, capital spending of $43.5 million is up 39% year over year, consistent with the higher capital expenditures required drilling the PSC extension. Consistent with the objective of preserving capital and adjusting capital spending as new production results are analyzed, we are reducing estimated capital spending for the second consecutive quarter to $81 million from $96 million estimated last quarter. POWER Quarterly Adjusted EBITDA increased by 17% ($1.1 million) year over year with most of the benefit coming from higher average-realized pricing, which is mainly due to the weaker Canadian dollar. The average-realized price of electricity was 13% higher ($5.93 per MWh) in the second quarter compared to the prior year period. In the second quarter this year, electricity production and sales were consistent with the prior year period. On a year to date basis, production and sales are higher in the first six months of 2015, with six months of production from the Boca de Jaruco Combined Cycle Project compared to five months in the same period last year. Operating costs increased by 8% ($1.24 per MWh) in the second quarter compared to the prior year period, due to an increase in turbine maintenance and equipment repairs. STRATEGIC PRIORITIES 2015 Sherritt continues to execute against its stated strategy to focus on its core competencies, improve its liquidity position and streamline its operations, consisting of the following near-term priorities: NON-GAAP MEASURES The Corporation uses combined results, Adjusted EBITDA, average-realized price, unit operating cost, and adjusted operating cash flow to monitor the performance of the Corporation and its operating divisions and believes these measures enable investors and analysts to compare the Corporation's financial performance with its competitors and evaluate the results of its underlying business. These measures do not have a standard definition under IFRS and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. As these measures do not have a standardized meaning, they may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other companies.

TECK REPORTS UNAUDITED SECOND QUARTER RESULTS FOR 2015 Vancouver, BC - Teck Resources Limited (TSX: TCK.A and TCK.B, NYSE: TCK) (\"Teck\") reported second quarter adjusted profit attributable to shareholders of $79 million, or $0.14 per share, compared with $72 million or $0.13 per share in 2014. Profit attributable to shareholders was $63 million ($0.11 per share) compared with $80 million ($0.14 per share) a year ago. \"Our operations have turned in a solid performance for the quarter,\" said Don Lindsay, President and CEO. \"All of our operations have remained cash flow positive after sustaining capital investment and our balance sheet remains strong with over $6.5 billion of liquidity. This has been achieved notwithstanding a material drop in the U.S. dollar spot coal price since the beginning of 2015.\" Highlights and Significant Items Profit attributable to shareholders was $63 million and EBITDA was $596 million in the second quarter. Gross profit before depreciation and amortization was $676 million in the second quarter compared with $636 million in the second quarter of 2014. Cash flow from operations, before working capital changes, was $531 million in the second quarter of 2015 compared with $520 million a year ago. We have reached agreements with the majority of our customers for the third quarter of 2015, based on a quarterly benchmark of US$93 per tonne for the highest quality product and we expect total sales in the third quarter, including spot sales, to be at least 6.0 million tonnes of steelmaking coal. All critical milestones are being achieved on the Fort Hills oil sands project. The partners are focused on opportunities to manage capital cost in the current economic environment. A falling Canadian dollar, lower oil prices and our cost reduction program have contributed to reduce our U.S. dollar unit costs for our products with copper and coal unit costs falling by US$0.15 per pound and US$17 per tonne, respectively, compared to last year. The Red Dog concentrate shipping season commenced on June 28, with the first vessel sailing. We expect sales of 170,000 tonnes of contained zinc metal in the third quarter and 200,000 tonnes in the fourth quarter reflecting the normal seasonal pattern of Red Dog sales. Our liquidity remains strong at over $6.5 billion inclusive of $1.5 billion cash at July 22, 2015 and US$4.2 billion of undrawn, committed credit facilities. Our cash balance is in line with expectations and consistent with our goal of finishing the year with at least $1.0 billion in cash. On May 28, in response to steelmaking coal market conditions we announced rotating shutdowns totaling three weeks in the third quarter at our steelmaking coal mines. These shutdowns have commenced and further steps to reduce production may be taken in the fourth quarter unless the supply-demand balance in the market improves. On June 25, unexpected ground movement was observed in the area of the SX-EW plant at our Quebrada Blanca Operations in Chile leading to a temporary suspension of cathode production. Partial production has since resumed. Production in the second half of 2015 is expected to be reduced by 5,000 to 10,000 tonnes of copper cathode. As planned, Duck Pond ceased operations on June 30 after exhausting all of its remaining ore resources. On July 9, we increased our cash position by US$162 million as a result of entering into a gold offtake agreement and terminating a separate royalty agreement with subsidiaries of Royal Gold, Inc. related to our Carmen de Andacollo Operation. We were the top-ranked mining company and fourth-ranked company overall named to the Best 50 Corporate Citizens in Canada ranking by media and investment research company Corporate Knights and were also named one of the Top 50 Socially Responsible Corporations in Canada by Sustainalytics, a global responsible investment research firm. Overview We are responding to challenging market conditions by focusing management's efforts on cost reduction initiatives and capital discipline. Prices for all of our major commodities fell significantly in the quarter, putting downward pressure on margins and profits. This has been partly offset by the weaker Canadian dollar. Our focus on cost reduction has partially mitigated the effects of lower prices. Our site operating costs for our coal business unit were down 15%, or $8 per tonne compared to a year ago. Copper unit costs were also down in both Canadian and U.S. dollar terms and both our copper and zinc business units reported significantly higher profits than in the first quarter of the year. However, our coal business unit profits fell sharply and at the end of June we began our announced program of rotating shutdowns in our coal business unit. During these shutdowns, we expect to be able to reduce inventories while maintaining our unit costs. We may consider additional shutdowns based on our assessment of market conditions. In our zinc business unit we completed the restart of the Pend Oreille mine in the quarter, which is now supplying concentrates to our Trail Operations. We continue to maintain strong discipline on capital spending. The Fort Hills project remains on time and on budget. In April we announced a dividend of $0.15 per share compared to a dividend of $0.45 per share which had been our recent practice. In June we extended the maturity of our US$3.0 billion committed line of credit by one year to July 2020 and augmented our liquidity with the addition of a US$1.2 billion committed line of credit maturing June 2017. Subsequent to quarter end we entered into an additional gold streaming arrangement with RGLD Gold AG, a wholly owned subsidiary of Royal Gold Inc., which provided proceeds of US$162 million. Profit and Adjusted Profit Profit attributable to shareholders was $63 million, or $0.11 per share, in the second quarter compared with $80 million or $0.14 per share in the same period last year. Adjusted profit attributable to shareholders, before items identified in the table below, was $79 million, or $0.14 per share, in the second quarter compared with $72 million or $0.13 per share in the same period last year. The tax item in the current quarter is the effect on our deferred tax balances of a 2% increase in the Alberta corporate tax rate. Performance Gross profit before depreciation and amortization from our coal business unit increased from year ago levels as the benefits of our cost reduction program and lower fuel prices more than offset lower realized coal prices. The average realized coal price of US$95 per tonne was 14% lower than the second quarter of 2014, reflecting oversupplied steelmaking coal market conditions and a large drop in spot price assessments. The favourable effect of a stronger U.S. dollar in the second quarter partly offset the lower coal price, which weakened by 5% in Canadian dollar terms compared with the same period a year ago. Second quarter production of 6.6 million tonnes was 3% higher than the same period a year ago. Unit cash production costs (CAD) at the mines were 15% lower this quarter than in the comparative period as a result of initiatives undertaken through our cost reduction program, slightly higher production rates and lower energy prices. Property, plant and equipment expenditures totaled $23 million in the second quarter, of which $16 million was spent on sustaining capital. Capitalized stripping costs were $108 million in the second quarter compared with $137 million a year ago. We continue to implement the water quality management measures contemplated by our Elk Valley Water Quality Plan. The water treatment facility built at our Line Creek Operations is now expected to be commissioned in the fourth quarter of 2015. Markets Coal prices declined further during the quarter. Although Chinese imports have declined substantially compared to the prior year, demand in the rest of the world has been strong for our products, with record first half sales. Given oversupply in the market, we do not expect a substantial recovery in price until a better market balance is established. Coal prices for the third quarter of 2015 have been agreed with the majority of our quarterly priced customers based on US$93 per tonne for the highest quality products. This is consistent with prices reportedly achieved by our competitors. Additional sales priced on a spot basis will reflect market conditions when sales are concluded. Operations Coal processing performance was excellent. The annual cycle of maintenance shutdowns in our processing facilities was completed during the quarter and processing yields were above budget. Despite slightly higher raw strip ratios, mined material movement was 10% higher in the quarter compared to the same period in 2014, owing largely to improved productivity in our truck and shovel operations, supported somewhat by slightly shorter haul distances. Our cost reduction initiatives continue to produce significant results and remain focused on improvements in equipment and labour productivity, reduced use of contractors, reduced consumable usage and limiting the use of higher cost equipment. However, a number of factors have partially offset the strong performance of our cost reduction program. These included the effects of the strengthening U.S. dollar on some inputs and higher electricity costs. In the second quarter of 2015, we continued to experience the positive effects of lower energy prices. Combined with reduced fuel usage and equipment productivity improvements from a number of our cost reduction initiatives, energy costs per tonne produced have decreased by 37% compared to the second quarter of 2014. In response to current market conditions, we began rotating temporary shutdowns of each of our steelmaking coal operations. Three-week shutdowns will be staggered over the summer months among the operations and began in June. By carefully managing the timing and duration of these shutdowns and drawing from existing inventories of clean coal, we will continue to meet all contracted and committed coal sales for our entire suite of coal products. Additional coal production adjustments will be considered over the course of 2015 as market conditions continue to evolve. On July 11 a localized rainfall event resulted in two separate landslides impacting the main site access road and infrastructure corridor between the mine and plant at the Line Creek Operation. No one was injured and the damage caused to the access road, raw coal conveyor and other infrastructure will be repaired, however, the slides have resulted in a suspension of mining and processing activities at the site, but are not expected to affect overall production or sales for the coal business unit. Cost of Sales Site cash cost of sales in the second quarter of 2015, before depreciation and inventory writedowns, was $45 per tonne, $8 per tonne or 15% lower than a year ago. Our total cost of sales for the quarter also included a $12 per tonne charge for the amortization of deferred stripping costs and $15 per tonne for other depreciation. In U.S. dollar terms, unit costs have fallen by $17 per tonne from $85 per tonne to $68 per tonne due to reductions in the site costs as shown in the Canadian dollar unit cost table and the change in exchange rates. Outlook In response to steelmaking coal market conditions, temporary shutdowns began in June and will be staggered over the summer months among the operations. By carefully managing the timing and duration of these shutdowns and drawing from existing inventories of clean coal, we will continue to meet all contracted and committed coal sales for our entire suite of coal products. The durations of the individual site shutdowns may be varied to account for the loss of production from the Line Creek operation noted above. As a result of the planned temporary shutdowns of our coal mining operations in the third quarter discussed above, production will be reduced by approximately 1.5 million tonnes to 5.7 million tonnes, a reduction of 22% for the quarter, with expected sales to be at least 6 million tonnes. Vessel nominations for quarterly contract shipments are determined by customers and final sales and average prices for the quarter will depend on product mix, market direction for spot priced sales, timely arrival of vessels, as well as the performance of the rail transportation network and coal-loading facilities. On an annual basis, in light of the announced adjustments to our production plans in the third quarter we now expect our 2015 coal production to be in the range of 25 to 26 million tonnes. If market conditions do not improve, we may reduce production further in the fourth quarter. Gross profit before depreciation and amortization from our copper business unit increased by $24 million in the second quarter compared with a year ago (see table below). This was primarily due to higher sales volumes, positive effects of the stronger U.S. dollar and cost reduction efforts, which more than offset lower realized copper prices. Second quarter copper production was 15% higher than the first quarter of 2015. Copper production increased by 6,900 tonnes compared to a year ago, with higher production at all operations except for Duck Pond which ceased operating on June 30, 2015. Copper production at Highland Valley Copper was 4,700 tonnes higher than a year ago primarily due to higher grade and recoveries while our share of production from Antamina increased by 1,300 tonnes as a result of record mill throughput during the quarter. Copper production was also higher at both of our Chilean operations, although production was halted at Quebrada Blanca during the last week of June as a precautionary measure due to unanticipated ground movement. Markets LME copper prices averaged US$2.74 per pound in the second quarter of 2015, up 3.8% over the prior period. Copper prices remained volatile trading off yearly lows shortly after quarter end. Total reported exchange stocks fell 136,000 tonnes during the quarter to 464,000 million tonnes. Total reported global copper stocks are now estimated to be 23 days of global consumption, below the estimated 25 year average of 28.5 days of global consumption. Operational issues at copper mines continue to impact current and future mine production. The large copper surpluses forecast for 2015 have moved closer to balance despite moderating demand growth. Market fundamentals remain positive over the medium term to long term with supply constrained by lower grades and ongoing operational difficulties. Current low prices may exacerbate future supply limitations as more projects are delayed or deferred. Operations Highland Valley Copper Copper production was 40,100 tonnes in the second quarter or 13% higher than a year ago, due to higher copper grades and higher recoveries. Mill throughput was lower than a year ago due to harder ore in the current phase of the Valley pit. Molybdenum production declined to 0.9 million pounds from 1.3 million pounds a year ago primarily due to lower grade, partially offset by higher recovery. Operating costs increased $37 million or 31% than in the same period a year ago as a result of higher sales. Unit costs were similar to a year ago. As we continue to mine the higher grade but harder ore in the current phase of the Valley pit, throughput and grades are expected to remain similar to the first half for the remainder of 2015. A $68 million crusher relocation project for the Valley pit is progressing on schedule and is expected to be complete in the third quarter. This project provides access to over 30 million tonnes of reserves as part of our current life of mine plan. Antamina Copper production in the second quarter increased by 7% compared with a year ago primarily as a result of higher mill throughput. The mix of mill feed in the quarter was 70% copper-only ore and 30% copper-zinc ore compared to 73% and 27%, respectively, in the same period a year ago. Zinc production of 56,400 tonnes in the second quarter increased by 19% compared with a year ago due to higher mill throughput. Antamina achieved record mill throughput of 14.8 million tonnes for the quarter, an average of 163,000 tonnes per day, 16% higher than the same period last year. Recent debottlenecking projects focused primarily on the crushing and conveying system have enabled throughputs much higher than the 130,000 tonnes per day design capacity of the original expansion project. Throughput rates going forward will be dependent on ore hardness and the mix of ore feeds to the plant, but are expected to continue above original design capacity rates. Operating costs in the second quarter were 5% lower compared to a year ago. Significant progress has been made in reducing U.S. dollar unit costs, with savings offset by foreign currency translation and the effects of the weaker Canadian dollar. Quebrada Blanca Copper production in the second quarter increased by 10% compared with a year ago due to higher production from the dump leach circuit. Heap leach ore placed increased by 34%, helped by recent capital improvements to the crushing and agglomeration circuit. Higher than expected ground movement caused some deformation of the buildings and infrastructure in the SX-EW plant area, leading to a temporary shutdown of the facilities and suspension of mining in the area adjacent to the plant as a precautionary measure on June 25. Since then ground movement in the plant area has slowed considerably. Cathode production has now restarted in the south half of the electro-winning (EW) plant to recover copper from recirculating solutions. We continue to assess the full economic and production impact of the situation as we continue geotechnical and structural assessments. We are in discussions with the relevant regulators seeking approval to restart mining in the affected area, including placing a stabilization buttress towards the north end of the plant which will take approximately three months to construct. Once mining in the affected area starts, normal heap leaching activities will resume. In the meantime, mining in other areas of the pit and general maintenance activities are continuing. We expect to operate only the south end of the EW plant at a rate of approximately 40,000 tonnes per annum over the coming weeks while we continue to monitor ground movement and take remedial actions. Production in the second half of 2015 is expected to be reduced by 5,000 to 10,000 tonnes of copper cathode. Operating costs decreased by $8 million or 12% compared with the same period a year ago as a result of lower sales volumes, continued cost reduction efforts and lower supply costs, offset by foreign currency translation and the effects of the weaker Canadian dollar. Work continued to progress on updating the permits for the existing facilities for the supergene operation. The review, response and consultation processes by the relevant regulatory agencies are in progress. We expect to receive approval of the Social and Environmental Impact Assessment (SEIA) submitted in July 2014 by the end of the third quarter. Carmen de Andacollo Copper production in the second quarter increased by 4% compared with a year ago primarily as a result of higher copper grades and recovery. The mill is back to full production rates following a tailing thickener failure in the first quarter and throughput rates similar to the second quarter are anticipated for the remainder of the year. Operating costs increased by $5 million or 7% compared with a year ago due to higher sales. U.S. dollar unit costs were similar for the quarter as lower costs for operating supplies and consumables were offset by foreign currency translation and the effects of the weaker Canadian dollar. In June, Andacollo was charged in connection with alleged environmental infractions. We are in discussions with the environmental authority regarding the charges. A dust decontamination plan for the city of Andacollo was signed into law earlier this year which has specific improvement and reporting requirements over the next two years, including for our operation. We have already made substantial improvements to our dust emissions and are in compliance with all requirements in the plan. We continue working closely with the community, government and other stakeholders to further improve the quality of air in Andacollo. Duck Pond Duck Pond permanently ceased operations on June 30, 2015. Copper and zinc production in the second quarter was 3,200 and 3,900 tonnes, respectively, compared with 4,000 and 4,500 tonnes, respectively, last year. Copper and zinc production declined due to lower ore grades and lower recoveries as the mine approached closure. Cost of Sales Unit cash costs of product sold in the second quarter of 2015 as reported in U.S. dollars, before cash margins for by-products, decreased primarily due to higher sales volumes, continued cost reduction efforts and the favourable effects of a stronger U.S. dollar at our Canadian operations. Copper Development Projects Quebrada Blanca Phase 2 During the second quarter of 2015, activities to support permitting for the Quebrada Blanca Phase 2 project continued, including additional environmental baseline work to support the submission. Optimization efforts continued focused on capital reduction opportunities. Other Copper Projects Targeted studies continue at the Relincho, Galore Creek, Schaft Creek and Mesaba projects as we further explore ways to enhance the value of these projects, and the pre-feasibility study continued to progress at our 50% owned Zafranal copper-gold project located in southern Peru. Outlook Previous production guidance at Quebrada Blanca for 2015 was between 45,000 to 50,000 tonnes of copper. We now expect this to be reduced by 5,000 to 10,000 tonnes as a result of the recent ground movement issues. We expect full year production guidance for copper in the range of 340 to 350 thousand tonnes, in the bottom half of our previous guidance of 340 to 360 thousand tonnes. Performance Gross profit before depreciation and amortization from our zinc business unit increased by $3 million in the second quarter (see table below). Contributing to the increased gross profit was a 2% rise in zinc prices, the favourable effect of the stronger U.S. dollar and an 8% increase in sales volumes from Trail, partially offset by lower sales at Red Dog. Refined zinc production from our Trail Operations increased by 4% compared to last year due to improved operating efficiencies in the electrolytic plant and to the improved reliability of the new acid plant, which led to higher throughput. The table below summarizes the gross profit change, before depreciation and amortization, in our zinc business unit for the quarter. Markets LME zinc prices averaged US$0.99 per pound in the second quarter of 2015, up 5.35% over the prior quarter. Zinc prices were volatile during the quarter hitting both one year lows and highs during the quarter. Reported zinc exchange stocks fell 8,616 tonnes during the quarter to end the quarter at 644,500 tonnes. Total global reported stocks are now estimated at 33.5 days of global consumption down from the 25 year average of 42 days. Combined exchange stocks have now fallen over 900,000 tonnes since peaking in December 2012. Demand for refined zinc in our key North American markets has been moderately challenging this quarter with our customers facing headwinds from a harsh U.S. winter, port closures, reduced spending in the oil sector and a significant increase in imported galvanized sheet. Market turbulence in Asia has also impacted sentiment. Zinc stocks however continue to decline in both metal and concentrates. Zinc supply will become further constrained later in 2015 with planned mine closures taking effect. Operations Red Dog Mill throughput was higher than the second quarter of 2014. Zinc grade was similar and recoveries were higher than 2014 resulting in 9% more zinc production. Both higher lead grade and recoveries than 2014 yielded 16% more lead production. Zinc sales volumes were 14% lower than the second quarter of 2014. Lower sales volumes were due to lower market inventories in the current quarter. Higher treatment charges in the current quarter were offset by higher zinc prices. Operating costs in the current quarter decreased due to lower fuel and freight costs. Capitalized stripping costs were $16 million in the second quarter compared with $8 million a year ago. Trail Zinc production was 4% higher this quarter than in the second quarter of 2014. This was the result of the commissioning of new acid plants in the second quarter of 2014 which resulted in improved acid plant reliability and processing efficiencies. Lead production was impacted by a 15-day annual maintenance shutdown of the KIVCET smelter in June and was 29% lower than a year ago when the annual shutdown occurred in the fourth quarter. Similarly, silver production also decreased by 1.0 million ounces over the same quarter a year ago. Cost of concentrate purchases increased compared to last year due to higher refined zinc production levels combined with higher zinc prices and the Canadian to U.S. dollar exchange rate. Higher operating costs reflected timing of maintenance work performed during shutdowns. Labour costs were slightly higher as the impact of higher wages was partially offset by work force reductions through attrition and lower energy expenses were the result of less consumption during the KIVCET shutdown. Pend Oreille Mill throughput reached design capacity of 2,000 tonnes per day in June. Zinc grade has improved as ore production from more selective, secondary mining stopes increases. Zinc recovery is continuing to improve towards the target of 90% as mill feed rate and grades stabilize. The restart projected capital cost is unchanged at US$41 million compared to the plan of US$45 million. Outlook We now expect the Pend Oreille mine to reach the full production rate of 44,000 tonnes per year of zinc metal by the end of the third quarter of 2015. Additional ground support rehabilitation is required in previously mined areas than anticipated. The ground support is required to permit secondary mining/pillar recovery of higher grade ore sources. The Red Dog concentrate shipping season commenced on June 28, with the first vessel sailing. We expect sales of 170,000 tonnes of contained zinc metal in the third quarter and 200,000 tonnes in the fourth quarter reflecting the normal seasonal pattern of Red Dog sales. ENERGY BUSINESS UNIT Fort Hills Project Construction of the Fort Hills project is progressing substantially in accordance with the project schedule. In the second quarter of 2015 our capital expenditures were $204 million compared with a cash spending estimate of $213 million. Our capital expenditures in 2015 were $447 million to date compared with our cash forecast spending estimate which was $466 million. Our share of Fort Hills cash expenditures in 2015 is estimated at $850 million. Since sanction, the project has achieved and continues to track to key milestones. Engineering activity is progressing well, and is now 85% complete; construction is progressing per plan and is now 35% complete. Equipment and material deliveries are continuing and off-site modular fabrication, site civil works and process facility construction are well underway. Site construction workforce is currently approximately 3,500 and will continue to ramp-up to peak in 2016. The capital cost and schedule outlook have not changed since we announced project sanction in October 2013. First oil is still expected as early as the fourth quarter of 2017, with 90% of our planned production capacity of 180,000 barrels per day (bpd) expected within 12 months. Our share of production is expected to be 36,000 bpd (13 million barrels per year) of bitumen. We are continuing to review options to sell diluted bitumen into the North American and overseas markets which may include the use of pipelines from Hardisty or rail to access U.S. Gulf Coast refineries and tidewater ports. Frontier Energy Project The Frontier project regulatory application review continues with the provincial and federal regulators. We responded to the regulators latest information requests and provided a project update in June 2015. The project update improves the economic and social benefits and overall environmental performance of the project. The revised mine plan incorporates recently acquired adjacent leases and allows for the recovery of an additional 200 million barrels of bitumen for a total recovery of 3.0 billion barrels within a reduced overall project footprint, with lower GHG emissions intensity, lower water use intensity and improvements to our tailings management plan. The earliest anticipated first oil date for our Frontier Project is now 2026, which reflects additional time required for updates to the project in light of a land-swap transaction and revisions to the project scope. The regulatory review process is expected to continue through 2015; making late 2016 the earliest a decision report is expected. Wintering Hills Wind Power Facility During the second quarter, our share of the power generation from Wintering Hills was 33 GWhs, resulting in 21,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent offsets. Our share of expected power generation in 2015 is 135 GWhs, resulting in approximately 85,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent offsets, although actual generation will depend on weather conditions and other factors. OTHER OPERATING COST AND EXPENSES Other operating expenses, net of other income, were $21 million in the second quarter compared with $35 million a year ago. This includes negative pricing adjustments on copper of $43 million and positive pricing adjustments on zinc and lead of $6 million and $4 million, respectively. Finance expense was $78 million in the second quarter, $3 million higher than a year ago. Debt interest expense increased due to the effect of the stronger U.S. dollar, as all our debt and related interest expense is U.S. dollar denominated. We capitalized a total of $55 million in interest in the quarter. Income and resource taxes for the second quarter were $90 million, or 57% of pre-tax profits. This rate is higher than the Canadian statutory rate of 26% mainly as a result of resource taxes and higher rates in foreign jurisdictions. In this quarter, a 2% increase in the Alberta corporate tax rate and other adjustments resulted in an increase in our deferred tax balances, which contributed to the higher rate. Without the effect of these items, our combined income and resources taxes for the quarter would be $68 million and our effective tax rate would be 43%. The combined effect of resource taxes and higher rates in foreign jurisdictions tends to be magnified in periods when our operating earnings are lower relative to our head office administrative and finance charges incurred in Canada. This occurs because resource taxes and taxes in foreign jurisdictions are based on profits before these head office administrative, finance costs and certain other costs. Due to available tax pools, we are currently shielded from cash income taxes, but not resource taxes in Canada. We remain subject to cash taxes in foreign jurisdictions. Our cash position declined from $1.6 billion to $1.3 billion in the quarter. Significant outflows included $204 million on Fort Hills project expenditures. In the second quarter our share of the funding of the Fort Hills project declined from 27.5% to 20% as we completed our earn-in contribution. Our cash balance was augmented in July by US$162 million from the Carmen de Andacollo gold offtake agreement. Our cash flow in the second half of the year will be affected by the seasonality of Red Dog sales and the reduction of inventories. Based on current commodity prices and exchange rates we expect to meet our year-end target of $1.0 billion of cash at existing debt levels. In June in light of recent market conditions and a change in outlook for the industry as a whole, S&P changed the outlook on its BBB- rating of Teck from stable to negative and Moody's changed the outlook on its Baa3 rating of Teck from stable to negative. DBRS rates us BBB with a negative trend and Fitch rates us BBB- with a stable outlook. Operating Cash Flow Cash flow from operations, before changes in non-cash working capital items, was $531 million in the second quarter compared with $520 million a year ago. Changes in working capital items absorbed cash of $199 million in the second quarter. The increase in working capital in the quarter was due to higher inventory levels and lower payables in 2015. This is a matter of the timing of a number of operating items. Investing Activities Expenditures on property, plant and equipment were $204 million in the second quarter for the Fort Hills oil sands project, $83 million on sustaining capital and $11 million on major enhancement projects. The largest components of sustaining expenditures were $16 million at our coal operations and $15 million at Highland Valley Copper. Major enhancement expenditures included approximately $7 million at our coal operations. Capitalized stripping expenditures were $175 million in the second quarter compared with $199 million a year ago. The majority of this item constitutes the advancement of pits for future production at our coal mines. Financing Activities Financing activities in the second quarter consisted of capital lease repayments of $14 million (2014 - $24 million) and debt interest payments of $39 million (2014 - $33 million). We distributed $3 million to minority interests in our operations (2014 - $4 million). In addition, Antamina refinanced a loan of which our portion was $28 million. This is included in both issuance and repayment of debt on our cash flow statement. During the quarter we extended the maturity on our US$3 billion revolving credit facility by one year to July 2020. There were no other changes to the facility's principal terms. We also put in place a new US$1.2 billion revolving credit facility maturing in June 2017 in order to provide additional liquidity should circumstances require it. OUTLOOK We continue to experience challenging markets for our products and prices for some of our products have declined. Commodity markets have historically been volatile, prices can change rapidly and customers can alter shipment plans. This can have a substantial effect on our business. Demand for coal, particularly in China, has weakened substantially. Increased supply from Australian mines has also put downward pressure on coal prices. The weakness in some of these markets may persist for some time and, if of a long-term nature, could affect the fair value of our operating assets, which could require adjustments to company values. We are also significantly affected by foreign exchange rates. In the last six months, the U.S. dollar strengthened by approximately 8% against the Canadian dollar, which has had a positive effect on the profitability of our Canadian operations. It will, to a lesser extent, put upward pressure on the portion of our operating costs and capital spending that is denominated in U.S. dollars. In October 2013, we approved an estimated $2.9 billion (our share) to complete the development of the Fort Hills oil sands project, of which approximately $1.8 billion remains to be spent at the end of June 2015. We have access to cash and credit lines which are expected to be sufficient to meet our capital commitments and working capital needs over this period. We are taking further steps to manage our capital spending profile and we continuously monitor all aspects of our cost reduction program, our capital spending and key markets as conditions evolve. Previous production guidance at Quebrada Blanca for 2015 was between 45,000 to 50,000 tonnes of copper. We now expect this to be reduced by 5,000 to 10,000 tonnes as a result of the recent ground movement issues. We expect full year production guidance for copper in the range of 340 to 350 thousand tonnes, in the bottom half of our previous guidance of 340 to 360 thousand tonnes. In addition, we could be subject to labour unrest or other disturbances as a result of delays in or the failure of negotiations of new contracts, which could limit our ability to maintain coal or copper production in accordance with our plans. If this were to occur, the potential shortfall in planned production could be material. We continue to monitor market conditions for steelmaking coal and further steps to reduce production may be taken in the fourth quarter unless the supply-demand balance in the market improves. Foreign Exchange, Debt Revaluation and Interest Expense The sales of our products are denominated in U.S. dollars, while a significant portion of our expenses are incurred in local currencies, particularly the Canadian dollar and the Chilean peso. Foreign exchange fluctuations can have a significant effect on our operating margins, unless such fluctuations are offset by related changes to commodity prices. Our U.S. dollar denominated debt is subject to revaluation based on changes in the Canadian/U.S. dollar exchange rate. As at June 30, 2015, $6.2 billion of our U.S. dollar denominated debt is designated as a hedge against our foreign operations that have a U.S. dollar functional currency. As a result, any foreign exchange gains or losses arising on that amount of our U.S. dollar debt are recorded in other comprehensive income, with the remainder being charged to profit. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND DERIVATIVES We hold a number of financial instruments and derivatives which are recorded on our balance sheet at fair value with gains and losses in each period included in other comprehensive income and profit for the period as appropriate. The most significant of these instruments are marketable securities, foreign exchange forward sales contracts, metal-related forward contracts and settlements receivable and payable. Some of our gains and losses on metalrelated financial instruments are affected by smelter price participation and are taken into account in determining royalties and other expenses. All are subject to varying rates of taxation depending on their nature and jurisdiction. OUTSTANDING SHARE DATA As at July 22, 2015 there were 566.8 million Class B subordinate voting shares and 9.4 million Class A common shares outstanding. In addition, there were 16.1 million director and employee stock options outstanding with exercise prices ranging between $4.15 and $58.80 per share. More information on these instruments and the terms of their conversion is set out in Note 19 of our 2014 audited financial statements. INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Any system of internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. There have been no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2015 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS - IMPAIRMENT TESTING In preparing consolidated financial statements, management makes estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses across all reportable segments. Management makes estimates and judgments that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our estimates and judgments are based on historical experience and other factors we consider to be reasonable, including expectations of future events. Critical accounting estimates and judgments are those that could affect the consolidated financial statements materially, are highly uncertain and where changes are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Impairment testing is an area that requires significant judgment, both in assessing whether certain factors would be considered an indicator of impairment and when an indicator is present, determining the assumptions used in preparing discounted cash models. We consider both internal and external information to determine whether there is an indicator of impairment present and accordingly, when impairment testing is required. When impairment testing is required, discounted cash flow models are used to estimate the recoverable amounts of respective assets. Significant assumptions used in preparing these discounted cash flow models include commodity prices, reserves and resources, operating costs, capital expenditures, discount rates, foreign exchange rates, tax assumptions and inflation rates. These inputs are based on management's best estimates of what an independent market participant would consider appropriate and are reviewed by senior management. Changes in these inputs may alter the results of impairment testing, the amount of impairment charges recorded in the statement of income and the resulting carrying values of assets. During the second quarter we performed a detailed review of impairment indicators across all of our operations and assets. For Teck Coal, Quebrada Blanca and Carmen de Andacollo, we perform impairment testing of our goodwill annually. Our last goodwill impairment test was completed as at October 31, 2014. Since that date, we have not identified an indicator of impairment for any of our cash-generating units that would require us to perform an updated analysis of our impairment with the exception of Fort Hills, which is outlined in more detail below. Even in the absence of an indicator of impairment, we continuously assess commodity prices, discount rates, operating costs, capital expenditures and other key assumptions to determine what effect, if any, updated information could have on our most recent impairment test results. Based on this analysis, we have not identified any significant changes in our assumptions since our disclosures as at December 31, 2014. We have provided further detail below on the sensitivity of our Teck Coal mine sites to impairment since our previous disclosure considered goodwill sensitivity only. Fort Hills During the second quarter, in light of conditions in the oil market, we performed an analysis of impairment of our 20% interest in the Fort Hills project and did not identify an impairment loss. We account for our investment in Fort Hills as a joint operation and record our share of the assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and cash flows from the operation. As at June 30, 2015, our net carrying value for our 20% interest in the Fort Hills project was approximately $2.3 billion. The majority of our carrying value is classified as mineral properties and leases within property, plant and equipment. The recoverable amount of our 20% interest in Fort Hills was estimated on a fair value less cost of disposal basis. Fair value less cost of disposal was estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology taking into account assumptions likely to be made by market participants. Cash flow projections are based on the life of mine plan for Fort Hills and the cash flows cover a period of 56 years. Given the nature of expected cash flows used to estimate the recoverable amount, material changes could occur over time as the cash flows are significantly affected by the key assumptions used to estimate the fair value less cost of disposal. For the purposes of estimating the recoverable amount, we have applied an assumed long-term WTI oil price of US$82/barrel and our share of estimated remaining development capital expenditures of $1.8 billion. Based on these assumptions, the estimated recoverable amount in respect of our interest in Fort Hills exceeds the carrying value by a significant amount. The recoverable amount is sensitive to changes in key assumptions and future changes in these assumptions, individually or in combination, could result in the recoverable amount being less than the carrying value and an impairment adjustment might result. Teck Coal The recoverable amounts of our coal operations are most sensitive to the long-term commodity price and foreign exchange rate assumptions. Our last impairment test performed in 2014 used a long-term coal price of US$185/tonne. We note that at a US/CAD exchange rate of 1.25, a reduction in the long-term price of greater than 24% to below US$140 per tonne would be required before our recoverable fair market value fell below our current carrying value for the coal business unit as a whole and this is without including the benefit of the on-going cost reduction program that has been implemented in the first six months of 2015 and cost reductions that could be implemented in a lower price environment going forward. ADOPTION OF NEW AND AMENDED IFRS PRONOUNCEMENTS Accounting Developments New IFRS pronouncements that have been issued but are not yet effective are listed below. We plan to apply the new standard or interpretation in the annual period for which it is required. Revenue from Contracts with Customers In May 2014, the IASB and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) completed their joint project to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue and to develop a common revenue standard for IFRS and United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U.S. GAAP). As a result of the joint project, the IASB issued IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (IFRS 15) to replace IAS 18, Revenue and IAS 11, Construction Contracts and the related interpretations on revenue recognition. The new revenue standard introduces a single principles-based five-step model for the recognition of revenue when control of a good or service is transferred to the customer. The five steps are: identify the contract(s) with the customer, identify the performance obligations in the contract, determine transaction price, allocate the transaction price, and recognize revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied. IFRS 15 also requires enhanced disclosures about revenue to help investors better understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows from contracts with customers, and improves the comparability of revenue from contracts with customers. In May 2015, the IASB issued an exposure draft that proposes to delay the effective of IFRS 15 by one year to annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018 to align with the timing of the new U.S. GAAP revenue standard. IFRS 15 is currently effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The comment period for the exposure draft ended July 3, 2015. We are assessing the effect of this standard on our financial statements. Financial Instruments IFRS 9, Financial Instruments (IFRS 9), addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. The IASB has previously issued versions of IFRS 9 that introduced new classification and measurement requirements (in 2009 and 2010) and a new hedge accounting model (in 2013). The July 2014 publication of IFRS 9 is the completed version of the Standard, replacing earlier versions of IFRS 9 and superseding the guidance relating to the classification and measurement of financial instruments in IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement (IAS 39). IFRS 9 requires financial assets to be classified into three measurement categories on initial recognition: those measured at fair value through profit and loss, those measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, and those measured at amortized cost. Investments in equity instruments are required to be measured by default at fair value through profit or loss. However, there is an irrevocable option to present fair value changes in other comprehensive income. Measurement and classification of financial assets is dependent on the entity's business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset. For financial liabilities, the standard retains most of the IAS 39 requirements. The main change is that, in cases where the fair value option is taken for financial liabilities, the part of a fair value change relating to an entity's own credit risk is recorded in other comprehensive income rather than the income statement, unless this creates an accounting mismatch. IFRS 9 introduces a new three-stage expected credit loss model for calculating impairment for financial assets. IFRS 9 no longer requires a triggering event to have occurred before credit losses are recognized. An entity is required to recognize expected credit losses when financial instruments are initially recognized and to update the amount of expected credit losses recognized at each reporting date to reflect changes in the credit risk of the financial instruments. In addition, IFRS 9 requires additional disclosure requirements about expected credit losses and credit risk. The new hedging section of the final IFRS 9 standard remains relatively unchanged from when the new hedging accounting section of IFRS 9 was second introduced in November 2013. The new hedge accounting model aligns hedge accounting with risk management activities undertaken by an entity. Components of both financial and non-financial items will now be eligible for hedge accounting, as long as the risk component can be identified and measured. The new hedge accounting model includes eligibility criteria that must be met, but these criteria are based on an economic assessment of the strength of the hedging relationship. New disclosure requirements relating to hedge accounting will be required and are meant to simplify existing disclosure. The IASB currently has a separate project on macro hedging activities and until the project is completed, the IASB has provided a policy choice for entities to either apply the hedge accounting model in IFRS 9 or IAS 39 in full. Additionally, there is a hybrid option to use IAS 39 to account for macro hedges only and to use IFRS 9 for all other hedges. Turqoise Hill Resources Ltd. (TSE: TRQ) Turquoise Hill Resources (TRQ: TSX, NYSE & NASDAQ) is an international mining company with copper-gold and coal mines in the Asia Pacific region. Principal assets: A 66% interest in Oyu Tolgoi, one of the world's largest copper-gold-silver mines now producing and shipping concentrate to customers in China. A 22.63% interest in established Mongolian coal miner SouthGobi Resources (SGQ: TSX, 1878: HK). Turquoise Hill announces financial results and review of operations for the second quarter of 2015 VANCOUVER, CANADA - Turquoise Hill Resources today announced its financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2015. All figures are in US dollars unless otherwise stated. HIGHLIGHTS On May 18, 2015, the Oyu Tolgoi Underground Mine Development and Financing Plan were signed addressing key outstanding shareholder matters and setting out long-term funding of the project. Following signing of the Underground Mine Development and Financing Plan, Turquoise Hill and Rio Tinto are advancing project financing and updating the underground feasibility study. Oyu Tolgoi achieved a solid safety performance with an All Injury Frequency Rate of 0.22 per 200,000 hours worked for the first half of 2015. Oyu Tolgoi recorded revenue of $421.3 million in Q2'15 on sales of 189,800 tonnes of concentrate, a 1.2% reduction over Q1'15 reflecting lower gold prices partially offset by higher concentrate sales. Turquoise Hill reported income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders of $49.9 million. Turquoise Hill generated operating cash flow of $239.2 million during Q2'15, an increase of 127.2% over Q1'15. Concentrate production for Q2'15 increased 64.6% over Q1'15 due to a 20.1% increase in concentrator throughput and higher head grades. In Q2'15, Oyu Tolgoi delivered record-setting concentrate production and throughput. Copper and gold in concentrates for Q2'15 increased 64.6% and 176.7% respectively over Q1'15. Oyu Tolgoi began accessing higher-grade material in Q2'15 and mining and processing of higher-grade ore is expected to continue into the second half of 2015. Turquoise Hill continues to expect Oyu Tolgoi to produce 175,000 to 195,000 tonnes of copper and 600,000 to 700,000 ounces of gold in concentrates in 2015. On July 9, 2015, Oyu Tolgoi marked the second anniversary of its first shipment of concentrate. Turquoise Hill's cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2015 were $1.2 billion. FINANCIAL RESULTS In Q2'15, the Company recorded net income attributable to owners of Turquoise Hill of $24.9 million ($0.01 per share) compared with net income of $7.9 million ($nil per share) in Q2'14, an increase of $17.0 million. Results for Q2'15 reflect the impact of lower production costs, partly offset by one-time charges and adjustments relating to agreements made as part of the Oyu Tolgoi Underground Mine Development and Financing Plan signed on May 18, 2015, and loss on partial divestment of SouthGobi on April 23, 2015. Operating cash flows in Q2'15 were $239.2 million compared with $153.8 million in Q2'14, reflecting production and delivery cost improvements, effective working capital management, and receipts relating to sales shipments not collected from the warehouse by customers at the period end. These benefits contributed to a $133.9 million increase compared with Q1'15. Additions to property, plant and equipment were $36.4 million in Q2'15, including approximately $33.9 million for sustaining capital activities including the tailing storage facility. Turquoise Hill's cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2015 were $1.2 billion. OYU TOLGOI The Oyu Tolgoi mine is approximately 550 kilometres south of Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia's capital city, and 80 kilometres north of the Mongolia-China border. Mineralization on the property consists of porphyry-style copper, gold, silver and molybdenum contained in a linear structural trend (the Oyu Tolgoi Trend) that has a strike length extending over 26 kilometres. Mineral resources have been identified in a series of deposits throughout this trend. They include, from south to north, the Heruga Deposit, the Southern Oyu deposits (Southwest Oyu, South Oyu, Wedge and Central Oyu) and the Hugo Dummett deposits (Hugo South, Hugo North and Hugo North Extension). Mining of ore commenced in May 2012 and first concentrate was produced in January 2013. The Oyu Tolgoi mine has initially been developed as an open-pit operation. A copper concentrator plant, with related facilities and necessary infrastructure to support a nominal throughput of 100,000 tonnes of ore per day, has been constructed to process ore mined from the Southern Oyu open pit. Long term development plans for Oyu Tolgoi are based on a 95,000-tonne-per-day underground block-cave mine. In August 2013, development of the underground mine was delayed pending resolution of matters with the Government of Mongolia, which was reached on May 18, 2015. Oyu Tolgoi Underground Mine Development and Financing Plan On May 18, 2015, Turquoise Hill, the Government of Mongolia and Rio Tinto announced the signing of the Oyu Tolgoi Underground Mine Development and Financing Plan (the Underground Plan), which addressed key outstanding shareholder matters and set out an agreed basis for the funding of the project. The Underground Plan confirmed the project cost for Oyu Tolgoi's initial construction and development and reinforced the principles set out in the Investment Agreement and the Amended and Restated Shareholders Agreement (ARSHA). The agreements addressed key outstanding matters including the following specific items: tax matters, the 2% net smelter royalty, sales royalty calculation and management services payments. The agreements also addressed the sourcing of power for Oyu Tolgoi from within Mongolia. The overall value impact for the Company in connection with the agreements is less than 2% of the value of the reserve case of $7.4 billion presented in the 2014 Oyu Tolgoi Technical Report. In 2003, Turquoise Hill acquired a 2% net smelter royalty from BHP Billiton. The enforceability of the royalty was challenged by the Assistant General Prosecutor of Mongolia under Mongolian law. The Company determined, as part of the Underground Plan negotiated, that it would not contest its right to receive payment and consequently recognized a charge of $36.8 million in Q2'15 for write-off of the original royalty acquisition cost. In June 2014, Oyu Tolgoi LLC received a Tax Act (Tax Assessment) from the Mongolian Tax Authority as a result of a general tax audit for the period 2010 through 2012. Oyu Tolgoi appealed the assessment and in September 2014 received a response reducing the amount of tax, interest and penalties claimed to be payable, from approximately $127.0 million to approximately $30.0 million. In a separate agreement with the Government of Mongolia, Oyu Tolgoi agreed, without accepting liability and without creating a precedent, to pay the amount of the determination by way of settlement to resolve the tax matter. A final charge of $22.1 million has been recognized in Q2'15 for settlement of amounts not previously paid or provided for in relation to the Tax Assessment. The parties agreed that Oyu Tolgoi's 5% sales royalty paid to the Government of Mongolia will be calculated on gross revenues by not allowing deductions for the costs of processing, freight differentials, penalties or payables. Oyu Tolgoi has recalculated royalties payable accordingly since the commencement of sales and submitted an additional amount payable in Q2'15 of approximately $17.1 million to the Government, which includes approximately $14.5 million on previous years' sales. Notwithstanding the terms of the ARSHA, the parties agreed that in calculating the Management Services Payment (MSP), the rate applied to capital costs of the underground development will be 3% instead of 6%, as provided by the ARSHA. The MSP rate on operating cost and capital related to current operations remains at 6%. In accordance with the ARSHA, 50% of the MSP is payable to Turquoise Hill and 50% to Rio Tinto. Oyu Tolgoi LLC and Turquoise Hill agreed to prepare and submit working assumptions for possible support of Oyu Tolgoi LLC's obligations under a potential power purchase arrangement from the Tavan Tolgoi power plant project. Next steps toward the underground development include updating and receiving approval of the underground feasibility study and completing the approximate $4.0 billion in project financing. Turquoise Hill continues to expect signing of project financing by the end of 2015. The 2015 Oyu Tolgoi Feasibility Study, which was submitted to the Mongolian Minerals Council (the MMC) in March 2015, has been tentatively accepted pending an update of schedules and alignment with the Underground Plan. This update is due to be resubmitted to the MMC in September 2015. Ahead of final approval of the project by the Turquoise Hill, Rio Tinto and Oyu Tolgoi boards, an update to the capital estimate will be completed in parallel with other pre-start activities. The preferred engineering, procurement and construction management contractor has been engaged to complete this work along with some critical path detailed engineering. Underground development prior to August 2013 suspension Prior to the suspension in August 2013, underground lateral development at Hugo North had advanced approximately 16 kilometres off Shaft #1. Sinking of Shaft #2, the primary operations access and initial production hoisting shaft, had reached a depth of 1,168 metres below surface, 91% of its final depth of 1,284 metres. The 96 metre-high Shaft #2 concrete headframe has been constructed. Sinking of Shaft #5, a dedicated exhaust ventilation shaft, had reached a depth of 208 metres, 17% of its final depth of 1,174 metres. Surface facilities, including offices, mine dry, and workshop, are in place to support initial pre-production development and construction. Care and maintenance activities have continued for Shaft #1, facilities and mobile equipment. Ground remediation work is underway and execution readiness activities have commenced in preparation for restarting underground development. Q2'15 performance Safety continues to be a major focus throughout Oyu Tolgoi's operations and the mine's management is committed to reducing risk and injury. Oyu Tolgoi achieved a solid safety performance with an All Injury Frequency Rate of 0.22 per 200,000 hours worked for the first half of 2015. Revenue in Q2'15 decreased by 1.2% over Q1'15. Lower revenues reflect a fall in gold prices, partially offset by higher volumes of copper-gold concentrate sales. The Q2'15 mix of revenue by metals is the result of inventory with lower contained gold drawn down during the quarter from concentrate produced in Q1'15. Gross margin at 46.4% for the quarter increased from 39.5% in Q1'15, due to the combined effect of higher overall volumes sold and cost improvements as Oyu Tolgoi continued to optimize operations, which offset the impact of lower gold sales. Production and delivery costs include primarily the cash costs in inventory sold as well as allocated mine administration costs. Depreciation and depletion includes the depreciation and depletion in inventory sold as well as any depreciation of assets used in the selling and delivery process, including the depreciation of capitalized production phase stripping costs. Total additions capitalized to property, plant and equipment, on an accruals basis, for Q2'15 were $36.4 million (Q2'14: $44.8 million) and comprised approximately $33.9 million for sustaining activities, including the tailings storage facility and deferred stripping. Total cash operating costs at Oyu Tolgoi in Q2'15 were $284.6 million. Following transition to IFRS, the 5% royalty payable to the Government of Mongolia, previously deducted from revenue, is reflected as a cash operating expense, and production phase stripping costs, previously included within cash operating expense, are capitalized and depreciated. During Q2'15, Oyu Tolgoi continued to improve and optimize operations in order to reduce costs across the mine's operation. Oyu Tolgoi's C1 costs in Q2'15 were $0.73 per pound, compared with $0.09 per pound in Q1'15. The increase is driven by reduced by-product credits compared with Q1'15 as inventory with lower contained gold content was sold during the quarter, combined with the impact of certain adjustments relating to the signing of the Underground Plan on May 18, 2015. The adverse impact on C1 costs of reduced by-product revenue and Underground Plan adjustments was partly offset by the impact of higher production volumes. Oyu Tolgoi's openpit mine has a high-grade zone containing a large proportion of gold in addition to copper; Turquoise Hill anticipates quarterly fluctuation of C1 costs as the quantity of gold in concentrates sold varies after ore from this zone is fed through the mill. Income from continuing operations attributable to owners of Turquoise Hill in Q2'15 has been reduced by a charge of $36.8 million for write-off of the net smelter royalty purchased from BHP Billiton in 2003, and by owners' share of adjustments to Oyu Tolgoi segment income following signing of the Oyu Tolgoi Underground Mine Development and Financing Plan on May 18. Adjustments to the Oyu Tolgoi segment income mainly relate to: recalculation of prior periods' sales royalties to the Government of Mongolia ($17.1 million); and payment agreed for settlement of the June 2014 Tax Assessment ($22.1 million). Oyu Tolgoi began accessing higher-grade material in Q2'15. Record-setting concentrate production for Q2'15 increased 64.6% over Q1'15 due to a 20.1% increase in concentrator throughput and higher head grades. Throughput for Q2'15 also set records for Oyu Tolgoi. Copper and gold in concentrates increased 64.6% and 176.7% respectively over Q1'15. Funding of Oyu Tolgoi by Turquoise Hill In accordance with the ARSHA dated June 8, 2011, Turquoise Hill has funded Oyu Tolgoi's cash requirements beyond internally generated cash flows by a combination of equity investment and shareholder debt. For amounts funded by debt, Oyu Tolgoi must repay such amounts, including accrued interest, before it can pay common share dividends. At June 30, 2015, the aggregate outstanding balance of shareholder loans extended by subsidiaries of the Company to Oyu Tolgoi was $6.8 billion, including accrued interest of $1.4 billion. These loans bear interest at an effective annual rate of LIBOR plus 6.5%. Subsidiaries of the Company have accrued $135.8 million in deferred tax liabilities for the withholding taxes due upon payment of the accrued interest by Oyu Tolgoi. In Q2'15, Oyu Tolgoi repaid a total amount of $152.0 million with respect to these loans, including accrued interest of $47.7 million. In accordance with the ARSHA, a subsidiary of the Company has funded the common share investments in Oyu Tolgoi on behalf of Erdenes. These funded amounts earn interest at an effective annual rate of LIBOR plus 6.5% and are repayable, by Erdenes to a subsidiary of the Company, via a pledge over Erdenes' share of Oyu Tolgoi common share dividends. Erdenes also has the right to reduce the outstanding balance by making cash payments at any time. As at June 30, 2015, the cumulative amount of such funding was $751.1 million, representing approximately 34% of invested common share equity; unrecognized interest on the funding amounted to $199.1 million. Operational outlook A planned concentrator shutdown at Oyu Tolgoi was successfully completed in July 2015. Initial assessment of the improvement projects completed appears positive. Production of higher-grade ore is expected to continue into the second half of 2015. Oyu Tolgoi's metal production, especially gold, is strongly dependent on the proportion of ore treated from the high-grade zone. During the second half of the year, copper production is expected to be higher than the first half while gold production is expected to moderate as grades begin to decline in the later part of Q3'15. Turquoise Hill continues to expect Oyu Tolgoi to produce 175,000 to 195,000 tonnes of copper and 600,000 to 700,000 ounces of gold in concentrates in 2015. Sales contracts have been signed for 100% of Oyu Tolgoi's expected 2015 concentrate production. Q2'15 exploration Oyu Tolgoi's exploration strategy is focused on developing a project pipeline prioritized in areas that can impact the current development of the Oyu Tolgoi orebodies, seeking low-cost development options; in particular looking for shallower targets. Historical datasets are added to and reinterpreted to enable future discovery. SOUTHGOBI - HELD FOR SALE On April 23, 2015, the Company completed sale of 48.7 million shares in SouthGobi to Novel Sunrise Investments Limited (NSI) at a price of C$0.35 per common share payable in cash, and on June 3, 2015 a further 1.7 million shares were sold to NSI at a price of C$0.35 per share. Half of the aggregate cash proceeds, representing C$8.5 million in total, was received at closing and the balance of approximately C$8.5 million will be payable on the first anniversary of closing. A loss on divestment of $20.2 million has been recorded in Q2'15; the loss arose as a result of the price per share divested being below the quoted share price on which the carrying value was based. The carrying value of the Company's remaining interest in SouthGobi at June 30, 2015 was $33.1 million based on the quoted share price at that date. At June 30, 2015, Turquoise Hill owned 54.4 million SouthGobi common shares, representing approximately 22.6% of the issued and outstanding SouthGobi shares at that date. On May 1, 2015, Turquoise Hill announced that a previously announced share purchase agreement with National United Resources Holdings Limited (NUR), which provided for the sale to NUR of 56.1 million shares in the capital of SouthGobi, had expired on April 30, 2015 without the transaction contemplated thereunder having been completed. At June 30, 2015, SouthGobi is classified as an investment in associate in the Company's financial statements. Following completion of the sale to NSI, and consequent loss of control such that Turquoise Hill is no longer the largest single shareholder, the Company's exposures in relation to its investment in SouthGobi include, but are not wholly limited to: factors having an impact on fair value, and ability to complete divestment of its remaining interest in the future; and possible recognition of a proportionate share of losses and liabilities of SouthGobi. CORPORATE ACTIVITIES Election of directors The nominees set forth in the Company's management proxy circular dated March 20, 2015 were elected as directors of Turquoise Hill at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders, which took place on May 8, 2015. Series D Warrants expire unexercised The Company's Series D and Anti-Dilution Series D Warrants (the Warrants) expired on May 22, 2015 unexercised. The Warrants were acquired by Rio Tinto in conjunction with the 2012 Memorandum of Agreement. The Series D Warrants were exercisable to purchase 74,247,460 common shares of the Company at a price of $8.20 per common share. The Anti-Dilution Series D Warrants were exercisable to purchase 74,247,460 common shares of the Company at a price of $4.31 per common share. NON-GAAP MEASURES The Company's financial results are prepared in accordance with IFRS. In addition, the Company presents and refers to the following measures (non-GAAP measures) which are not defined in IFRS. A description and calculation of these measures is given below, and may differ in some aspects from equivalent measures provided by other issuers. Cash operating costs This measure comprises Oyu Tolgoi cash operating costs, and is presented in order to provide investors and other stakeholders in the Company with a greater understanding of performance and operations at Oyu Tolgoi. The measure of cash operating costs excludes: depreciation and depletion; exploration and evaluation; charges for asset write-down (including write-down of materials and supplies inventory), and includes management services payments to Rio Tinto, and management services payments to Turquoise Hill which are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements of the Company. C1 cash costs C1 cash costs is a metric representing the cash cost per unit of extracting and processing the Company's principal metal product to a condition in which it may be delivered to customers, net of by-product credits. It is provided in order to support peer group comparability and to provide investors and other stakeholders' useful information about the underlying cash costs of Oyu Tolgoi and the impact of by-product credits on the operations' cost structure. C1 cash costs are relevant to understanding the Company's operating profitability and ability to generate cash flow. When calculating costs associated with producing a pound of copper, the Company includes gold and silver revenue credits as the production cost is reduced as a result of selling these by-products. Turquoise Hill's principal metal product is copper, and C1 cash costs are reported for Oyu Tolgoi only. All-in sustaining costs All-in sustaining costs (AISC) is an extended cash based cost metric, providing further information on the aggregate cash, capital and overhead outlay per unit, and is intended to reflect the costs of producing the Company's principal metal product over the life-cycle of its operations. The measure seeks to reflect the full cost of copper production from current operations and as a result development project capital is not included. AISC allows Turquoise Hill to assess the ability of Oyu Tolgoi to support sustaining capital expenditures for future production from the generation of operating cash flows QUALIFIED PERSON Disclosure of a scientific or technical nature in this MD&A in respect of the Oyu Tolgoi mine was prepared under the supervision of Bernard Peters (responsibility for overall preparation and mineral reserves), B.

(luciana.magalhaes@wsj.com) 10:16 EDT - The imminent release of EIA data on weekly US oil supplies could lead to \"Which we day we go?\" talk among traders. On the one hand, a WSJ survey forecasts a 2.5M-barrel build as refiners undergo plant-stopping maintenance. As such, anything less could add fuel to the fire of WTI's recent rally toward $50. But a parallel oil-supply report released late Tuesday by the API showed a drawdown of 1.2M despite the refinery outages. So if the EIA data show any increase at all, it may stall oil's recent rally. Of course, if gasoline and distillate figures offset the crude number, this could add more uncertainty.

The development of Canada's capacity in space is one such issue. Space-based assets - satellites for communication/data/broadband, navigation, Earth observation and weather - are among the most critical infrastructure of modern economies. Space touches every Canadian every day, and is a powerful catalyst for the interplay of education, skills and training, innovation and research, hightech industrial development and highly skilled jobs. Recognizing that space-based technologies were the only way to unify and provide many critical services across a vast and remotely populated country, Canada was an early leader. With the launch of the telecommunications research satellite Alouette in 1962, we became the third country in space. In 1972, Canada launched the world's first satellite designed for coast-to-coast communications, and in 1978 was the first to digitally process a radar satellite image. The U.S. space shuttle and International Space Station program owe much to Canadian space robotics, so much so that the Canadarm has become a symbol of Canadian technological achievement. In manned exploration, we have sent more astronauts into space than any other country except the U.S. and Russia, with Chris Hadfield recently becoming the first Canadian to command the International Space Station. The importance of space continues to grow. Access to space has made possible a global communications revolution and a more profound understanding of the nature and origins of the universe. It is also essential for monitoring the Earth's surface and atmosphere, safeguarding sovereignty and security, and for enabling a vast array of earthly endeavours such as precision agriculture, resource extraction, meteorology, climatology, fisheries management, command and control of transportation systems, environmental monitoring, the delivery of education and health services, the advancement of medicine and medical devices, ice monitoring, urban planning, emergency response, border and coastal surveillance, the operation of civil and military drones and the rapid deployment of armed forces, among others. Space has also inspired generations of young students to pursue studies in sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics. And we are routinely touching space via smartphones, GPS, banking, the Internet, satellite radio and direct-to-home broadcasting services. Canada's world-leading space expertise - especially in satellite communications, Earth observation, space robotics and optics - has for decades been driving RD and innovation throughout the economy. Today, the space industry has a global footprint and employs some 8,000 people who reach into the global community through exports constituting half its sales. This extraordinary accomplishment is a product of collaborative foresight, vision and commitment to strategic investments half a century ago, when government and industry recognized the need for transformative technologies to meet domestic needs. The inseparability of space from national security, sovereignty and geopolitics, together with the lengthy time horizons and risk capital needed to develop space technologies, underscores the need for government as a lead partner in a robust space industry. The global space economy has doubled in the last decade to $330 billion per year - one of few sectors to withstand the 2008 global downturn. Yet in spite of a history of success and leadership, Canada faces serious challenges. Traditional spacefaring nations are redoubling their space-related investments, while emerging spacefaring nations see space as essential to security, sovereignty and a modern economy. Now a watershed rise of well-financed private-sector players is also driving innovation, making access to space more affordable and competition fierce. Three years ago, the federal government mandated a team of experts, including myself, to examine the space sector and make recommendations. The report, Reaching Higher: Canada's Interests and Future in Space, made it clear that, going forward, \"business as usual will not be good enough. Advancing the national interest through space-based activity and fostering a competitive Canadian space industry will require resolve, clear priorities that are set at the highest levels, and effective plans and programs to translate these priorities into practice.\" The government has since published a forward-looking Space Policy Framework. Much of the effort has focused on internal governance issues to improve decision-making. The next, most critical stage will be a concrete plan for long-term investments in space infrastructure. Such a plan would include commitments to space investment priorities reflecting the needs of Canada, the operational objectives of government departments and agencies, and Canada's industrial capabilities. Timelines for such investments are exceedingly long, requiring years of funding before commercial returns can be realized. However, an internationally competitive industry will step up where there is a durable commitment to resources and clear priorities on the part of government. We need to reclaim Canada's status as a leading spacefaring nation. A reinvigorated space program will unleash a broad channel of generational opportunity, with profound benefits for remote communities and the Far North. But the stimulus to the technology and manufacturing capacity of Canada's space sector makes it an economic sweet spot for the entire country at time when the resource cycle is running against us.

According to news reporting from Quebec City, Canada, by VerticalNews journalists, research stated, \"The rate and timing of N applications are important issues in precision agriculture because of the within-field spatial and temporal variability of soil N availability. In-season assessment of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) crop N status (CNS) is required to better match N fertilizer supply to crop N demand and improve N use efficiency.\" The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research, \"The objective of this study was to investigate the ability of hyperspectral vegetation indices (HVIs) to assess the CNS and tuber yield of irrigated 'Russet Burbank' potato at different growth stages. A 2-yr field experiment was conducted near Quebec City, QC, Canada, on plots receiving five different N rates ranging from 0 to 280 kg N ha(-1), with 40% applied at planting and 60% at hilling. Entire plant samples were collected biweekly for determination of the N nutrition index (NNI) as the N status reference method. In-field hyperspectral reflectance derived from a handheld spectroradiometer and using two fields of view (FOV; 7.5 degrees and 25 degrees) was obtained on several dates during both growing seasons. The sensitivity of the five HVIs most correlated to the NNI was evaluated by analyses of variance and least significant differences. It was found that HVIs computed from reflectance in the red-edge spectral region and using a wider FOV were the most appropriate indices to detect potato crop N stress.\" According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Among these indices, the CI1(red-edge) (red-edge chlorophyll index 1) was the most sensitive to potato N content and could explain 76% of the variability in total tuber yield at 55 d aft er planting (DAP).\" For more information on this research see: In-Season Nitrogen Status Assessment and Yield Estimation Using Hyperspectral Vegetation Indices in a Potato Crop.

Before becoming European Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, Phil Hogan was Minister of Environment, Community and Local Government of Ireland. He spoke to EurActiv's Senior Editor, Georgi Gotev. You recently said that that EU policies have a real role to play in improving global food security and feeding the planet in a sustainable way. Agriculture is indeed crucial for reducing poverty and eradicating hunger. Can you elaborate? Since becoming Commissioner, I have consistently highlighted that the Common Agricultural Policy has a real responsibility to contribute to the goal of feeding the world. Europe has a deep well of experience in shared agricultural governance. We have reformed the CAP, which operates in the 28 member states of the EU and its 500 million citizens, to be more dynamic and market-oriented, but also much more focused on our shared environmental and sustainability obligations. The evolution of the CAP has been a learning process for us all, and I certainly think that developing countries could learn from many of our successes as well as our mistakes. What should the agriculture of the 21st century look like? And what kind of agriculture is advisable for developing countries? There is no \"one size fits all\" model for 21st century agriculture. The EU experience has shown that the most effective models are those whereby collective targets are met by local areas tailoring policies to their needs and strengths. That is why such large degrees of flexibility are provided to EU member states and regions in meeting their CAP targets and obligations. Developing countries need to assess what works best for them, developing policies that allow their farmers to make a decent living from their work, while contributing to \"big picture\" targets in terms of production, sustainability, smart farming and food waste. What are the innovative techniques that could help achieve sustainable agriculture for the 21st century, especially in the developing countries? What would be the environmental constraints, should developing countries for example develop GMOs, while the EU is in general reluctant to do so? There are two areas where genuine innovation is required to drive the \"sustainable intensification\" agriculture must deliver in this century. The first is from the policy perspective: international structures for cooperation in the agri-food sector must be strengthened and deepened, and I am proud to say that the EU is very active in international debates. At the G20 agricultural ministerial meeting earlier this year, I supported the proposal to establish a common platform to share information and best practice in measuring and reducing food loss and waste. The second area is on farms and at all stages of the agricultural production process, where technology and innovation can create numerous improvements. Empowering women is a recurrent political idea when it comes to agriculture, but also to reducing food losses. Is this a slogan, or are their practical things that the EU can do in this field? In Europe we often talk about supporting \"family farms\": agricultural holdings where most or all family members, including women, will contribute in a variety of vital ways. Empowering women to play central roles in all areas of agricultural production is absolutely crucial if developing countries are to achieve their full potential in the agri-food sector. This is not just lip service: the Commission is putting its money where its mouth is, supporting sustainable farming practices in developing countries, focusing on smallholder agriculture and women farmers, the formation of farmers' organisations, the supply and marketing chain, and responsible private agribusiness investment. Targeting women has been a particular priority, given their traditionally central role in smallholdings. You have mentioned the \"Agri-tech revolution\" as a way to overcome challenges such as increasing water shortages, and a lack of sufficient arable land. Can you elaborate? The future agriculture will be an agriculture of knowledge. We must, for example, prioritise the development of functioning farm advisory services allowing for timely and efficient transfer of data and information. On farms, we are entering the era of \"precision agriculture\" - harnessing the use of technology and data to enable farmers to do their work more smartly, and more efficiently. The time is ripe to promote precision agriculture for improved land management, rotational grazing and soil conservation, pest management, nutrient management, crop diversity and water conservation. This is achieved primarily through the use of sensors on farms. New hardware and software systems will improve agriculture in a multitude of ways. New 'smart-agri' production systems will use advanced ICT at all stages in the food chain: on the farm, through to processing and retailing. Such innovations will improve the quality of crop production, the quality of livestock health but also, crucially, the quality of life for farmers. To give just one example of innovative thinking from the country I know best: the Irish \"Herdwatch\" Farming App helps Dairy & Beef Farmers keep electronic records of their cattle, ensuring easy compliance with EU rules and valuable hours saved. What assistance can the EU provide to the developing countries in the field of agriculture, what can EU research help do together with these countries, what are the chances of their researchers to benefit from the EU programs? EU programmes are already targeting small farmers, who represent the majority of the agricultural sector in developing countries, for vocational training to improve their knowledge base and farming techniques. The EU also promotes scientific research in areas of particular importance to developing countries, strengthening these countries' capacity to design and implement collective research programmes, as pioneered by the EU's successive framework programmes for research. The EU is also providing assistance in a number of other strategic and intelligent ways. For example, the European Investment Bank is doing excellent work developing targeted and effective financial instruments for projects in developing countries. Many of these are proceeding in a highly impressive fashion and are already yielding positive results. How about the value chains. Will the developing countries be able to get their fair share in global trade? How can the EU make sure that its trade policies don't harm development? There is a delicate balance to be struck between finding new markets for our high-quality, safe and sustainable EU products on the one hand, and providing a fair share of global markets to developing countries on the other hand. This will be achieved through compromise and negotiation, leading to smart and sustainable trade agreements. In the last number of years, the EU has negotiated a number of free trade agreements, including with the Central American countries, South Korea, Morocco, Peru, Colombia, and most recently, Canada and Vietnam. There is also a pressing need for more joined-up thinking internationally. To give just one example, we can continue to strengthen the Agriculture Market Information System and enhance the contribution of the annual Meeting of the Agriculture Chief Scientists. Will the Commission encourage the EU agri-business to invest in developing countries? Yes. Incentivising EU agri-business to see the potential of investing in developing countries is an absolute win-win. Investment in the wealth-creating potential of developing country agriculture is the most direct way to lift farmers out of poverty, thus generating the economic growth which in turn will create a new generation of consumers for European agri-food exports. Improving agricultural governance, as well as agricultural practices in developing countries, has to be assisted by investment - notably from the private sector. I am working with my colleagues Commissioner Mimica and Commissioner Bienkowska to encourage EU agri-businesses to invest in agriculture in developing countries, given the potential for production growth and the opportunities for research and innovation. I believe such a strategic approach to trade can be a driver for our shared future prosperity."}, {"title": "Hoping to bring Ontario title to C-K", "article": "Chatham-Kent's Queen of the Furrow, Stephanie Campbell, will be heading off to a provincial event later this month to proudly represent her home county in the Ontario Queen of the Furrow competition.

The AGRIS Co-op, at 17 Centre Side Rd., Tupperville, is also showcasing precision ag with a display of various applicators and a demonstration of an unmanned aerial vehicle for crop scouting. While the Thompsons and AGRIS sites provide a glimpse at the present and the future, people can walk back in time to experience how agriculture has progressed in the last century during a visit to Paul and Lorna Graham's vintage equipment display at 11680 Croton Line. The site features side-by-side comparisons of old and new tractors and equipment, antique gasoline engines, various tools and unique items such as an 1874 Champion threshing machine and a 1918 John Deere power-press baler.

The Ottawa Rural Clean Water Grants program began in 2000 to help rural landowners protect the surface water and water courses on their properties. To date the city has granted $1.8 million to farmers, villagers and other property owners to help pay for things like erosion control, precision farming systems, well decommissioning and other water-friendly activities. In turn, that grant money has leveraged another $8.4 million in private investments, according to environmental services manager Dixon Weir. But one thing for which property owners haven't had help in the past five years is inspecting, repairing or replacing their septic systems. That's because in the program's earlier phases that category took up more than two-thirds of the program's $200,000 annual budget. City staff are now recommending septic repair be put back on the eligibility list, but with a limit of $1,000 per applicant up to a total of $20,000 in grants per year. Successful applicants would also have to have septic systems 50 metres or less from a water course or a wellhead protection area in order to qualify. \"We would target support to (these) projects ... to really address the threat to water quality,\" said environmental programs manager Julia Robinson, who noted the program is meant to focus on projects with the \"highest environmental benefit.\" Other newly eligible activities for the next five years include erosion-fighting cover crops, forest or conservation management plans and other \"innovative projects\" - a catch-all term to allow staff to respond to unforeseen innovations that might protect water quality in new ways. And it certainly needs protecting. Robinson told the agriculture and rural affairs committee on Sept. 3 that Ottawa's smaller water courses, in many cases, are not yet testing within provincial guidelines for healthy phosphorous levels. \"Water quality in the Ottawa River and the main tributaries is really good to excellent, and we're finding that for the smaller water courses we're seeing improvement over time,\" she said. But she pulled up a chart of the city that was bright with red dots, indicating areas where phosphorous levels are too high. \"Clearly phosphorous remains a concern and in many locations we're exceeding provincial targets.\" She said vegetation levels along many smaller water ways, another indicator of water health, also don't meet federal guidelines. KEEP IT CLEAN In the past five years, the city has supported 207 projects with $636,000 in grant money, for a total of $1.2 million in agriculture and environmental investments across the city. Grants range from $1,000 to $15,000 per applicant, covering anywhere between 50 and 90 per cent of a given project. The projects have ranged from simple well decommissioning tasks to installing a state-of-the-art bio-digester at a local dairy farm. The machine treats cattle manure on site while producing energy at the same time. Other farmers have installed GPS systems that help them more accurately apply the fertilizer and nutrients that can add phosphorous to nearby streams - saving money and the environment. \"The farmer benefits by being able to reduce their inputs, both nutrient application as well as spraying, and then of course there's reduced runoff to any adjacent water courses,\" Robinson said. A commercial greenhouse near Manotick installed a new bio-filter, which treats its nutrient-rich wash water to make sure it's not dumping too much phosphorous into the water system. Grants are available for all rural landowners, including those in villages, all farms across the city and anyone who needs to have a well decommissioned. The annual budget for the next five years remains at $200,000 a year, and the program is administered by the South Nation Conservation Authority."}, {"title": "Press Release: Marianne Harris Steps Down From Agrium's Board of Directors", "article": " (END) Dow Jones Newswires September 03, 2015 07:31 ET (11:31 GMT)"}, {"title": "Press Release: AgJunction completes the California Department of Business Oversight Fairness Hearing", "article": "AgJunction completes the California Department of Business Oversight Fairness Hearing Canada NewsWire HIAWATHA, KS, Aug. 28, 2015 HIAWATHA, KS, Aug. 28, 2015 /CNW/ - (TSX: AJX) -- On August 27, 2015, the California Department of Business Oversight (the \"DBO\") convened a fairness hearing to review the proposed merger between AgJunction Inc.

They come here to sell their corn, wheat and soybean crops.\" Established in 1924, Thompsons Limited is a regional leader in the agribusiness industry. It is an integrated supplier of value-added agricultural products and services to growers in Ontario, Minnesota and North Dakota and food processing customers worldwide. The company owns and operates 12 elevators, 11 retail farm centres, two seed processing plants, five bean processing plans and a wheat processing plant. It is active in the importing and exporting of grain, organic and specialty crops around the world and currently conducts business in more than 34 countries. \"Technological advances are vital to our business, particularly in the field end of the industry,\" said MacKinnon. \"Our employees are highly skilled, whether they're dealing with preventive maintenance, the running of grain systems and much more. \"One area in which technology has played a major role, in terms of both efficiency and safety, is with respect to sweep augers being used in the bins. The operation is robotic so that means workers do not need to enter. This means providing an accident free process.\" With farming becoming more detailed with new technologies emerging almost daily, the local operation offers producers assistance in such areas as crop planning, helping customers sort through much of the technical data, and thereby streamlining the process. He pointed to the goal of precision farming -simply to collect and monitor information about soil variability and environment conditions to maximize the efficiency of crop input within certain areas of the farm field and not waste time on less productive sections. \"With these changes in agriculture and the necessity to understand and successfully apply these technological advances in the business, we discuss subjects like yield data, zone development, zone sampling and variable soil attributes,\" he said. \"There's no question this is a cutting edge company that uses state-of-the-art technology. We're progressive, ahead of the pack and not afraid to invest in new tools that assist in providing solutions for those in the agricultural industry. For example we are looking into the usage of drones in special cases. \"Reasonably inexpensive drones that use advanced sensors and imaging capabilities help farmers increase their yields while reducing crop damage. We see changes on a daily basis so you have to be on top of what is new, which requires upgrading skills. Information technology (IT), along with courses and seminars, is another important aspect of our business.\""}, {"title": "Technology an integral beneficial part of agriculture industry \\ NORWICH PROGRESS 2015", "article": "When Gary Klyn, his wife Corrie and family established GJ's Farm Equipment Inc. in 2000 he wondered exactly who would buy all the technologically advanced instruments, apparatus and vehicles fast becoming essentials of the industry. Fifteen years later he offers up a simple answer -everyone. \"Farming has changed dramatically over those years,\" he said. \"When you look at the electrical end of it for example, everything these days is computerized, whether it's a lawnmower, a tractor or a baler. Get ready for a full day's work on the field and the controls are all right there, in the cab. \"What this means for the buyer is ease of use, more control and less tiring labour. For the dealer, it means our customers are much more likely to come back to us for regular maintenance, upkeep and, when the time comes, a replacement or upgrade. It's fascinating and pretty exciting to watch as equipment improves on an almost daily basis.\" He will be showing off his latest purchase -the CLAAS XERION 5000 -to a wide audience at Canada's Home Farm Show September 15-17 in Woodstock. A tractor that is attracting global attention, it's being described in the three-word catchphrase -productivity meets efficiency. Some of the technology involved includes: * Continuously variable transmission that delivers more than 500 HP * Four equal-sized wheels with a diameter up to 2.16 m for improved traction * Options like a rotating cab, providing optimum match for customer requirements * A new ergonomic control concept with innovative multifunction control lever * Maximum performance at low revs to optimize fuel consumption * Telematics for operational and service monitoring \"These are remarkable improvements and just shows how far and fast we have come in terms of tractor technology,\" said Klyn. \"For us there is a great range of products out there to choose, machines the MCCORMICK X7.440 The family-owned and operated company is a full agricultural parts, service and sales dealership with more than 10 employees. \"Basically our customers are within a 75 kilometre radius,\" he said. \"In general, the majority of farmers who deal with us are dairy, chicken and pig producers. With the way the industry is expanding so rapidly, that would change for us in the very near future. \"Agriculture is very much about diversification, so that is how we approach our business, ensuring we have the latest state-of-the-art products for our customers. Technology has meant changes with respect to pick-ups, which is a nice part of our operation. And there are shifting mechanisms and variable transmissions. Precision farming includes yield mapping and variable rate fertilizer application. Technologies involved like Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Global Positioning System(GPS) effect the entire production and management function of the farm. So that is very important to our business. \"Precision farming is very data related in terms of variable rates, seeding, essentially all aspects of the farming process. It requires up-to-date technological equipment and these changes are occurring rapidly. Now drones are being used in agriculture, helping farmers increase yields and reduce crop damage.\" Klyn then points to the CLASS ROLLANT 455 UNIWRAP which completely integrates baling and wrapping in one operation. Its wrapping unit is structurally reinforced and incorporates a new hydraulic motor for a higher orbital arm speed. It takes less time to wrap each bale and ensures that the bale has finished wrapping before the next bale is ready to leave the chamber. Large guide rollers are fitted to ensure the bale is placed centrally on the table when working on hillsides. It incorporates new heavy duty knives for greater reliability and a consistent, clean cut. The higher arm speed combined with a quicker transfer time from baler to wrapper means the whole wrapping cycle is up to 30 percent faster. All the main functions are controlled from the cab using the CLAAS Communicator. \"Like I said, 15 years ago I had questions about all these technological advances and who would want them,\" he said. \"I don't ask anymore because we're all effected -manufacturers, dealers, producers, the entire agricultural industry. They provide great benefits.\""}, {"title": "Agrium Obtains Issuer Bid Exemption Order to Permit Purchases by Way of Private Agreement", "article": "Release date - 24082015 CALGARY, AB - Agrium Inc.

NASA's funding of $125,000 will enable the development of ModelLab, an online tool to build, store, and execute complex geospatial models. Why is this important? Advances in small satellite, drone, and sensor technology are revolutionizing the Earth observation industry. As a result, high-resolution raster imagery is being generated in greater amounts and at higher resolutions, providing the potential for real-time monitoring of both global and local change. Many contemporary human challenges, including climate change, water quality and availability, watershed management, biodiversity loss, urban sprawl, energy needs, and human health, cannot be effectively understood or resolved without the kind of ongoing global monitoring these instruments can provide. But the development of tools for storing and processing and burgeoning volumes of imagery, elevation, and other raster data presents significant technical challenges. The Raster Foundry will address these challenges by combining advanced user interface design and distributed computing techniques in an affordable, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution that can rapidly process imagery data sets and help users derive the intelligence necessary to support an array of decision-making activities. An intuitive user workflow will walk them through the process of uploading, mosaicking, merging, re-projecting, displaying, and storing Earth observation data from both satellite and aerial cameras. They will also have the option of exporting their data for use in other applications. Leveraging NASA and other Earth observation data sources, ModelLab will enable the design, storage, and execution of geospatial models and algorithms. These geospatial models can, for instance, be used for precision agriculture, to simulate flow patterns of tsunamis and floods, to forecast crime or seismic risk, to determine lines-of-sight for cell tower siting, to interpolate among field observations, to compare coastal erosion patterns over time, and to monitor the impact of forest fragmentation, among countless other applications. These types of geospatial modeling capabilities have been accessible to trained geospatial analysis professionals for many years, but ModelLab aims to make them available to non-technical users in a broad range of public and private sector positions. A Model Gallery will be initially populated with geospatial models prepared by members of Azavea's research team. In particular, it will include modeling \"recipes\" prepared by Dr. C. Dana Tomlin, originator of Map Algebra. Public models in this initial prototype will be freely available for download and use in external applications through a Creative Commons or similar open license and will be searchable by keyword and topic. At the core of both applications, is GeoTrellis, Azavea's open source high performance geoprocessing engine. Based on the Scala language and the Spark framework, GeoTrellis provides the ability to rapidly process geospatial data by distributing the processing across computing clusters. The goal of the framework is to transform user interaction with geospatial data by bringing the power of geospatial analysis to real-time, interactive web and mobile applications. \"We expect micro-satellite constellations and drones to both drive down the cost and dramatically increase the amount visible and multispectral imagery. This pair of prototyping grants from NASA and the Department of Energy will leverage our ongoing investment in GeoTrellis and position Azavea to contribute to a revolution in Earth observation data that we believe will benefit communities around the world\" said Robert Cheetham, Azavea President and CEO. The development of the ModelLab project is supported by the NASA Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, Award Number NNX15CS06P.

(TSX:AGU) (NYSE:AGU) announced today 2015 second quarter net earnings from continuing operations of $675-million ($4.71 diluted earnings per share), compared to $625-million ($4.34 diluted earnings per share) in the second quarter of 2014. The increase in earnings was supported by higher Wholesale volumes and lower production costs for most products. Retail results were impacted by lower crop prices, drought in Western Canada and wet conditions in the U.S. Corn Belt, which affected growers' decisions and limited the opportunities for use of certain crop inputs and services. Highlights: Second quarter adjusted net earnings of $701-million or $4.90 per share and $5.01 per share in the first half of 2015 on the same basis (see page 2 for adjusted net earnings reconciliation)(1). Strong nitrogen operational performance contributed to Wholesale gross profit of $409-million compared to $227-million in the second quarter of 2014. Our total ammonia production for the first half of 2015 was the highest since 2000. The Vanscoy potash facility continues to ramp-up production after completion of the expansion project and is hitting new daily production targets. Retail gross profit of $1.3-billion was 6 percent lower than the second quarter of 2014. Results were primarily impacted by lower earnings in Canadian retail and the lower Canadian dollar, as well as compression of seed margins across all regions. Repurchased $100-million or 952,053 shares since the beginning of April. 2015 annual guidance range narrowed to $7.00 to $7.50 diluted earnings per share (see page 3 for further detail). Revision to timeline and scope of Borger nitrogen expansion project. Agrium has exceeded its 2017 Operational Excellence targets of $350-million of one-time savings and $125-million of recurring EBITDA value through primarily our portfolio review, utilization rates, distribution network synergies, and cost reductions. \"Agrium's solid second quarter earnings were supported by the strong competitive advantages across our product portfolio, the diversity of our product and geographic mix and our continued focus on operational excellence. Wholesale delivered impressive results across all products, supported by lower costs and higher volumes. Retail earnings held up well despite approximately a 5 percent decline in crop input expenditures across the North America market and the impact of the severe weather conditions across this region. We believe we outperformed against our U.S. retail peers achieving an increase in U.S. normalized comparable store sales in a down market, a demonstration of the strength of our business model and market position,\" commented Chuck Magro, Agrium's President and CEO. \"Agrium is committed to delivering on our capital allocation vision as we execute our Operational Excellence initiatives, optimize our portfolio and continue to return capital to shareholders through future dividend growth and share repurchases,\" added Mr. Magro. Forecasted annual effective tax rate of 28 percent used for adjusted net earnings and per share calculations. These are non-IFRS measures which represent net earnings adjusted for certain income (expenses) that are considered to be non-operational in nature. We believe these measures provide meaningful comparison to the earnings of other companies by eliminating share-based payments expense (recovery), gains (losses) on foreign exchange, gains (losses) on non-qualifying derivative hedges and other one-time adjustments. These should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS and may not be directly comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. UPDATED ANNUAL 2015 GUIDANCE Based on our Market Outlook, Agrium expects to achieve annual diluted earnings per share of $7.00 to $7.50 in 2015 compared to our previous estimate of $7.00 to $8.25 per share. We have narrowed the guidance range due primarily to the impact of low crop prices on grower decisions and lower expected potash and phosphate pricing in the second half of the year relative to our previous guidance. We are assuming a normal fall season, recognizing there is risk to fall nutrient applications in regions impacted by drought or a delay in the North American harvest. As a result, our Retail EBITDA(4) for 2015 is now expected to be from $1.00-billion to $1.05-billion. This incorporates challenges that our Canadian retail operations face in 2015 due to the drought and lower crop prices, while our U.S. Retail operations is expected to achieve earnings in-line with 2014 levels. Our annual nitrogen and potash production targets remain unchanged. However, strong sales in the second quarter resulted in low beginning inventories to start the third quarter, which will impact sales volumes in this period. We have updated our finance costs range for 2015 to $240-million to $255-million to reflect a higher than anticipated cost of financing for our customer pre-payment programs. Our estimates of the Canada and U.S. foreign exchange rates and NYMEX for 2015 have been narrowed from our previous estimates based on current market conditions. We have also updated the range for our annual effective tax rate for 2015 to 28 percent to 29 percent to reflect the impact of the recently announced increase to the Alberta corporate income tax rate effective July 1, 2015, increasing from 10 percent to 12 percent. As a result, we had a one-time deferred tax liability charge in the second quarter, which contributed to the increase in our annual effective tax rate for 2015. This guidance and updated additional measures and related assumptions are summarized in the table on page 3. Guidance excludes the impact of share-based payments expense (recovery), gains (losses) on foreign exchange and non-qualifying derivative hedges. Represents diluted per share information attributable to equity holders of Agrium. One-time adjustment mainly relates to the increase in current and deferred taxes due to an increase in the Alberta corporate income tax rate. Forecasted annual effective tax rate of 28 percent used for adjusted net earnings and per share calculations. Earnings (loss) from continuing operations before finance costs, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. This is a non-IFRS measure.

Sales and gross profit Retail sales and gross profit decreased for the second quarter and first half of 2015 compared to the same periods last year primarily due to unfavorable weather conditions and competitive pricing pressure as a result of lower crop prices and reduced U.S. corn acreage which impacted our crop nutrients and seed sales and margins. Wholesale's nitrogen and phosphate sales and gross profit increased for the second quarter and first half of 2015 compared to the same periods last year as a result of higher nitrogen volumes, higher ammonia and phosphate realized selling prices, lower natural gas costs and manufacturing cost efficiencies. Product purchased for resale had lower sales and gross profit as a result of the 2014 strategic review that led to Agrium exiting portions of this business. Overall, Wholesale had higher gross profit for the second quarter and first half of 2015 compared to the same periods last year. Expenses General and administrative expense decreased by $16-million for the second quarter and $18-million for the first half of 2015 compared to the same periods last year as a result of reduced payroll and office expense costs as we began to realize reductions related to our Operational Excellence program. Share-based payments Due primarily to Agrium's share price increases in 2015, our share-based payments expense increased by $22-million for the second quarter and $36-million for the first half of 2015 compared to the same periods last year. Other Expenses (Income) We began to designate all of our natural gas derivatives as qualifying hedges for accounting purposes beginning January 1, 2015 and, accordingly, we no longer have natural gas derivatives not designated as hedges. The related gains or losses are recorded as part of cost of product sold when we sell the related product and unrealized gains or losses are recorded in equity. Previously, we recorded these natural gas derivative gains and losses directly to other expenses, resulting in natural gas derivative gains of $32-million in the first half of 2014. We completed the sale of our Niota and Meredosia storage and distribution facilities in the first quarter of 2015 resulting in a gain on sale of assets of $38-million. Environmental remediation and asset retirement obligations expense decreased for the second quarter and first half of 2015 compared to the same periods last year as higher provisions were recorded for our plant and mine sites in 2014. Effective Tax Rate The effective tax rates on continuing operations were 30 percent for the second quarter and 29 percent for the first half of 2015 and are higher than the effective tax rate of 28 percent for both the second quarter and first half of last year due to an increase in deferred taxes relating to the increase in the Alberta corporate income tax rate. BUSINESS SEGMENT PERFORMANCE Retail sales and gross profit were lower than the same period last year due to lower prices for all crops this spring and reduced corn acreage in the U.S. North American operations were also impacted by the drought in Western Canada and California and excessive moisture across the U.S. Corn Belt and the southern and northeastern states during June. The wet conditions in the U.S. Corn Belt impacted total seeded acreage and the ability of growers to apply nutrients and crop protection products in late spring. Regionally, the U.S. EBITDA contribution was lower by $12-million over the same period last year, while South America was also lower. Canadian results accounted for the majority of the variance in EBITDA compared to the second quarter of 2014, while Australia was the only region to report an increase in EBITDA this quarter. Retail selling expenses as a percentage of sales were unchanged year-over-year on realization of Operational Excellence initiatives. Total nutrient sales were 4 percent lower compared to the same period last year, primarily due to lower average nutrient selling prices. Total nutrient volumes were 1 percent lower this quarter across our Retail operations compared to the same period last year. Virtually all of the reduction was due to lower demand in Canada related to drought conditions and lower crop prices. Nutrient sales volumes in the U.S. were up 2 percent this quarter, despite lower corn and total seeded acreage this year. Nutrient sales volumes were marginally lower in our international markets due to dry conditions and lower planted wheat acreage in both our South American and Australian markets. Nutrient margins on a per tonne basis were lower across all regions, with the largest decline in Canada, but only a 4 percent reduction in the U.S. and Australia compared to the same quarter last year. The significant weakening in the Canadian dollar in 2015 had an estimated $10/tonne negative impact on nutrient margins in our Canadian operations. Crop protection products Total crop protection sales were down 1 percent year-over-year, mostly as a result of dry conditions in Australia and South America and foreign exchange differences in the businesses outside of the U.S. North American crop protection sales increased slightly compared to last year, despite significant industry headwinds this spring. The increase was a result of higher herbicide and insecticide sales in our U.S. operations despite the wet conditions during June across the U.S. Corn Belt. Crop protection margins as a percentage of sales increased year-over-year, largely due to the strength of the performance from our Loveland proprietary product line, which registered over a 10 percent increase in sales this quarter and gained a further 2 percentage points increase in the proportion of Loveland's sales out of our total crop protection sales. Seed The lower crop price environment this spring had the largest impact on the seed business. Seed sales and margins were negatively impacted by competitive pressures between suppliers and some trading down by growers in terms of seed genetics. The reduction was also due to a shift in crop mix from corn and cotton to soybeans, as well as significant unseeded soybean acreage in the U.S. due to the wet weather later this spring. Seed margins as a percentage of sales decreased by 2 percent from the second quarter of 2014; however, higher margin Dyna-Gro seed sales showed a year-over-year increase in sales which helped mitigate some of the impact on seed results. Merchandise Merchandise sales decreased compared to the same period last year as a result of lower fuel prices and lower equipment sales in Canadian retail and lower merchandise sales in Australia as part of our stock keeping unit (\"SKU\") rationalization, which has had a positive impact on Australian working capital leverage. Gross profit and gross margin as a percentage of sales were higher this quarter due to a decrease in lower margin Canadian fuel sales and higher overall product prices in the Australian business which consistently has higher margin products. Services and other Sales and gross profit for application services and other were both down 3 percent compared to the same period last year. The decline was due to reduction in the Canadian and Australian markets related to dry weather conditions. Nitrogen gross profit increased 167 percent compared to the same period last year due to higher sales volumes and lower cost of product sold. This was partially offset by lower urea and UAN prices in the current quarter. Sales volumes increased by 35 percent over the same period last year due to stronger operating rates and a greater draw-down in inventories this year. Cost of product sold for nitrogen decreased from the second quarter of 2014. The reduction in per tonne costs was primarily due to significantly lower natural gas prices, stronger operating rates and the weaker Canadian dollar. Nitrogen margins reached $220 per tonne this quarter, almost double last year's level. Potash Potash gross profit decreased in the current quarter due to lower total sales tonnes than the same period last year, partially offset by higher realized sales prices. Sales volumes were 10 percent lower this quarter due to low opening inventories as the Vanscoy facility gradually ramps up to full production after the completion of the expansion project at the end of 2014. Vanscoy's production this quarter was 460,000 tonnes, in line with the targeted level. Realized sales prices were higher than the same period last year. Overall potash prices rose in both domestic and international markets, but with a stronger increase in international markets. Cost of product sold was higher than the same period last year due to lower production volumes and higher maintenance costs associated with the planned turnaround at Vanscoy in June this quarter. As a result, cash cost of product manufactured was $110 per tonne this quarter compared to last year at $92 per tonne. Phosphate Phosphate gross profit increased due to a combination of higher volumes, lower costs and an improvement in sales price relative to the previous year. Sales volumes increased by 8 percent due to higher product availability and sales prices were $67 per tonne higher than the same quarter last year as a result of tight regional supply and demand fundamentals. Overall phosphate margins were $102 per tonne this quarter, an $80 per tonne increase over the same period last year. Wholesale Other Gross profit for Wholesale's Other product category decreased this quarter primarily due to lower sales volumes and margins in the product purchased for resale business as these operations were significantly scaled back as part of our portfolio review. ESN(r) gross profit increased this quarter due to higher sales volumes and lower cost of product sold. Other EBITDA for our other non-operating business unit for the second quarter of 2015 had net earnings of $3-million, compared to a net expense of $6-million for the second quarter of 2014. The variance was due to the following: A $12-million higher gross profit recovery for the second quarter of 2015 compared to the second quarter of 2014. This is a result of lower inter-segment inventory held at the end of the second quarter; A $12-million decrease in environmental remediation liability expense as higher provisions were recorded for our plant and mine sites in 2014; and, A $22-million increase in share-based payments expense related to a strengthening in the fair value of our share-based payment plans against our peer group. Summary of Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Our investing capital expenditures decreased in the first half of 2015 compared to the first half of 2014 due to the completion of the tie-in of our Vanscoy potash facility expansion in the fourth quarter of 2014, partially offset by increased expenditures relating to the Borger nitrogen expansion project. We incurred investing capital expenditures amounting to $192-million for the expansion of the Borger nitrogen facility. The timeline and scope of the Borger nitrogen expansion project have been revised. The refresh of the existing ammonia facility and the new 610,000 tonne urea facility will be completed as planned; however, the completion date has been extended to the end of 2016 in order to manage costs, and the 145,000 tonne ammonia expansion portion of the project has been cancelled to minimize project risk. The total capital expenditure for the revised scope is expected to be within 5 percent of the $720-million estimate. We expect Agrium's remaining capital spending to approximate $500-million to $600-million in 2015. We anticipate that we will be able to finance the announced projects through a combination of cash provided from operating activities and existing credit facilities. Short-term Debt Our short-term debt of $681-million at June 30, 2015 is outlined in note 5 of our Summarized Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our short-term debt increased by $416-million during the three months ended June 30, 2015, which in turn contributed to a decrease in our unutilized short-term financing capacity to $2.2-billion as at June 30, 2015. Capital Management Our revolving credit facilities require that we maintain specific interest coverage and debt-to-capital ratios, as well as other non-financial covenants as defined in our credit agreements. We were in compliance with all covenants at June 30, 2015. NORMAL COURSE ISSUER BID In January 2015, the Toronto Stock Exchange (\"TSX\") accepted Agrium's notice of intention to make a normal course issuer bid (\"NCIB\") whereby Agrium may purchase up to 7,185,866 common shares on the TSX and New York Stock Exchange during the period from January 26, 2015 to January 25, 2016. During the six months ended June 30, 2015, we purchased 952,053 shares at an average share price of $104.99 for total consideration of $100-million. There were no share repurchases subsequent to June 30, 2015. Shareholders can obtain a copy of the NCIB notice submitted to the TSX from Agrium without charge upon request. OUTSTANDING SHARE DATA Agrium had 142,791,278 outstanding shares at July 31, 2015. At that date, under our stock option plans, shares expected to be issued for options outstanding were negligible. The agricultural products business is seasonal in nature. Consequently, comparisons made on a year-over-year basis are more appropriate than quarter-over-quarter comparisons. Crop input sales are primarily concentrated in the spring and fall crop input application seasons. Crop nutrient inventories are normally accumulated leading up to each application season. Our cash collections from accounts receivables generally occur after the application season is complete and our customer prepayments are mostly concentrated in December and January. ADDITIONAL IFRS AND NON-IFRS FINANCIAL MEASURES Certain financial measures in this MD&A are not prescribed by IFRS. We consider these financial measures discussed herein to provide useful information to both management and investors in measuring our financial performance and financial condition. In general, an additional IFRS financial measure is a measure relevant to understanding a company's financial performance that is not a minimum financial statement measure mandated by IFRS. A non-IFRS financial measure generally either excludes or includes amounts not excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS. Non-IFRS financial measures are not recognized measures under IFRS and our method of calculation is unlikely to be directly comparable to that of other companies. These non-IFRS measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES We prepare our financial statements in accordance with IFRS, which requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates in applying accounting policies. For further information on the Company's critical accounting estimates, refer to the section \"Critical Accounting Estimates\" in our 2014 annual MD&A, which is contained in our 2014 Annual Report. Since the date of our 2014 annual MD&A, there have not been any material changes to our critical accounting estimates. BUSINESS RISKS The information presented in the \"Enterprise Risk Management\" section on pages 64 - 68 in our 2014 Annual Report and under the heading \"Risk Factors\" on pages 22 - 31 in our 2014 Annual Information Form has not changed materially since December 31, 2014. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2015 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PUBLIC SECURITIES FILINGS MARKET OUTLOOK Prospects for global crop prices have improved since June due to less than ideal weather conditions across a number of geographies. Excessive moisture in the U.S. Corn Belt has led to the deterioration in crops and led to lower than anticipated planted acreage in some areas. Severe drought across much of Western Canada has also reduced yield expectations. While new crop futures prices have recently declined, the rally in crop prices in late June and early July is evidence of how sensitive global crop supply and demand is to relatively small changes in yield expectations. In areas with excessive moisture, it has been difficult to get equipment into the fields to apply crop nutrients and crop protection products, which in some cases has led to missed applications. In drought areas growers have in some cases sought to reduce crop nutrient and crop protection applications on struggling crops. The prospects outside of drought impacted areas are more positive for the remainder of 2015 as stronger prices in early July offered growers higher priced selling opportunities and improved grower sentiment. Furthermore, in areas with excess moisture, the wet conditions tend to lead to increased disease pressure, supporting fungicide demand. Following the end of the northern hemisphere's spring application season, crop nutrient prices have generally weakened, driven by the seasonal slow-down in demand. Tightened Chinese urea export supplies and seasonal demand fuelled an increase in urea prices in-season. However, the expectation of a return of increased Chinese supply to the export market, combined with new exportable supply in Algeria, Saudi Arabia and the U.S. in the second half of the year have pressured global prices. We expect Chinese anthracite-based urea costs to continue to provide a floor to the urea market in the second half of 2015, and that Indian import demand will be strong, particularly in light of the strong start to the monsoon season. Potash shipments to China and India have been robust in recent months and are expected to provide a solid base to global demand in the second half of 2015. In contrast, Brazilian demand has been relatively slow, down 21 percent year-over-year in the first half of 2015. However, we expect the pace of demand to improve in the third quarter, in advance of the domestic planting season. Following the spring season, North American potash prices declined, significantly narrowing the premium relative to other major global markets. The phosphate market has been relatively stable, with robust Indian demand offset by relatively weak Brazilian import demand and record Chinese DAP/MAP exports.

THE INDUSTRY Mining Facts Minerals and metals are the building blocks of the computers and smartphones we rely on, of the vehicles and public transit that get us places, of the buildings where we live and work, and of green technologies that help make the world a more sustainable place. Just as we as individuals depend on mining to support our daily lives, Canada relies on the industry to keep the economy humming. Mining is one of Canada's most important economic sectors and a major job creator. A major employer: Approximately 380,000 people across Canada work in the mining and mineral processing industries. Mining is the largest private sector employer of Aboriginal peoples in Canada on a proportional basis, and employment is poised to increase. Canada has one of the largest mining supply sectors globally with more than 3,400 companies supplying engineering, geotechnical, environmental, financial and other services to mining operations. Those who work in mining enjoy the highest wages and salaries of all industrial sectors in Canada with an average annual pay exceeding $110,000, which surpassed the average earnings of workers in forestry, manufacturing, finance and construction by a range of $31,000 to $46,000 for those sectors. An economic engine: Mining contributed $54 billion to Canada's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2013. The industry accounted for 19.6% of the value of Canadian goods exports in 2013. Canada's value of mineral production was nearly $43.6 billion in 2013. The mining industry's payments to Canadian federal and provincial governments total $71 billion in taxes and royalties over the last decade (2003-2012). A global leader: Thanks to its rich geology, Canada is one of the largest mining nations in the world producing more than 60 minerals and metals. Canada ranks in the top five countries in the global production of 11 major minerals and metals: First in potash Second in uranium and cobalt Third in aluminum and tungsten Fourth in platinum group metals, sulphur and titanium Fifth in nickel and diamonds 57% of the world's public mining companies are listed on the TSX and TSX-Venture Exchanges. Together, the two exchanges handled 48% of global mining equity transactions in 2013, and accounted for 46% of global mining equity capital for that year. Globally, Canada is recognized for its leadership in safety and sustainability. Mining companies in Canada were the first in the world to develop an externally-verified performance system for sustainable mining practices with the creation of MAC's Towards Sustainable Mining initiative in 2004."}, {"title": "AJX AgJunction earns $1-million (U.S.) in Q2", "article": "AgJunction Inc (TSX:AJX) Shares Issued 72,322,063 Last Close 8/14/2015 $0.47 Monday August 17 2015 - News Release Mr. Michael Manning reports AGJUNCTION REPORTS 2015 Q2 RESULTS On Aug. 14, 2015, AgJunction filed to SEDAR financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2015. All currency amounts are expressed in United States dollars. Novariant merger In a press release dated March 16, 2015, AgJunction and Novariant Inc. announced that they had entered into an agreement under which AgJunction would acquire Novariant through a merger transaction. Complete details of the terms of the transaction are set out in the agreement filed by AgJunction under its profile on SEDAR on March 26, 2015. Novariant is a premiere provider of advanced steering solutions for precision agriculture. Based in Silicon Valley, Novariant's steering solutions are used today in over 60 countries. With approximately 55 employees worldwide, Novariant generated revenues of approximately $30-million in 2014. Combined, the two companies establish a pre-eminent position in automated steering and machine control technologies worldwide, combining product portfolios, OEM customers and leveraging industry-leading intellectual property. As global machine manufacturers increasingly target the integration of autosteer technologies at the factory level, the combined company will bring advanced levels of machine automation to both current and future OEM clients faster and at lower cost. Upon closing of the transaction, the combined company will have approximately 200 employees worldwide. The combined company plans to maintain offices in California, Kansas, Arizona, Canada and Australia. The transaction also brings changes at the board and management level as outlined in the March 16, 2015, announcement. Fairness hearing date and approvals The transaction has been progressing and the California Department of Business Oversight has set a date of Aug. 27, 2015, to hold the fairness hearing to determine whether to grant AgJunction a permit in connection with the transaction. If the permit is granted, and the other required conditions are met, including approval by the shareholders of Novariant, the company intends to hold a shareholder meeting to approve certain matters in connection with the transaction on or about Sept. 30, 2015. Further to AgJunction's press release on April 29, 2015, AgJunction has received the approval of the Toronto Stock Exchange to further extend the deadline to hold its annual meeting of shareholders from Aug. 31, 2015, to Sept. 30, 2015, and has received an order from the Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta to extend the deadline to hold the meeting of shareholders under the Business Corporations Act (Alberta). With a view to reducing the expense and inconvenience to shareholders associated with holding two separate meetings, the company sought the further extension from the TSX and the order from the court to allow shareholders to consider annual matters and certain matters related to the transaction at one meeting. A press release will be issued when the record date and meeting date have been determined. Completion of the transaction is anticipated in October, 2015, subject to a number of conditions, including receipt of the permit from the California Department of Business Oversight, approval of the shareholders of Novariant, approval of the shareholders of AgJunction and receipt of customary regulatory approvals, including the approval of the TSX. In connection with the above, the company and Novariant have agreed to extend the outside date in the merger agreement for the transaction to Oct. 31, 2015. At closing of the transaction, AgJunction shares will be issued to shareholders of Novariant in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of Novariant. After giving effect to the issuance of such AgJunction shares, AgJunction will have approximately 123.7 million fully diluted shares outstanding, of which approximately 49.5 million shares will be held by the former shareholders of Novariant, representing approximately 40.0 per cent of the combined company. Posttransaction, directors, officers and other insiders will hold approximately 30.6 per cent of the combined company. Additional information in respect of the transaction will be forthcoming in the information circular which will be provided to AgJunction shareholders in connection with the meeting to approve certain matters in connection with the transaction. Second quarter financial review For the six months ended June 30, 2015, the company reported revenue of $7.7-million, a 25-per-cent decrease from $10.3-million in the second quarter of 2014. Lower revenue for the quarter is related to continuing softness in the aftermarket agricultural retail space, and lower food commodity prices, causing farmers to delay investment and purchasing decisions. These conditions drove the drop in the air ($1.1-million) and outback ($1.0-million) business units. The agronomy services business, which had sales of $600,000 in the second quarter of 2014, was sold April 1, 2015, so it did not generate any second quarter 2015 sales. United States and Canadian combined revenues were down by 51 per cent from the second quarter of 2014, driven largely by the company's air product line which was down by 51 per cent year over year in the U.S. In the U.S., net farm income has been declining since 2013, and according to the February, 2015, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) report, a further decline of 32 per cent is forecasted for 2015. Lower crop and livestock receipts are the main drivers of the 2015 decrease in net farm income. The rate of growth in U.S. farm assets is also forecasted to slow in 2015 compared with recent years as a result of lower net income, leading to less capital investment and a slight decline in farmland values. \"In considering how long this down cycle may last, we watch new and used inventory at the dealer level charted through time,\" said Rick Heiniger, president and chief executive officer. \"Factory output is lower now so the correction is under way. Dealer inventories, while still high, have been slowly declining since April, 2014. I believe normality will be achieved on a gradual basis.\" On April 1, 2015, AgJunction sold its agronomy services operations for $2.4-million in cash. Divesting the agronomy services division was aligned with AgJunction's strategy to focus all of its resources on delivering the most accurate, innovative and reliable steering solutions. The proposed merger transaction with Novariant aligns to this strategy. United States and Canadian combined revenues were down by 51 per cent from the second quarter of 2014 generally characterized with continuing softness in the aftermarket agricultural retail space. European revenues increased 56 per cent due to increased demand from OEM customers. Sales to Australia and other markets, including South America and Asia, declined 5 per cent and 9 per cent, respectively. Consolidated second quarter 2015 gross margin was $3.2-million, or 42 per cent of revenue, versus $5.4-million, or 53 per cent of revenue, in the second quarter of 2014. Lower gross margin for the quarter was due to a higher percentage of OEM revenue in the sales mix along with a 2014 decrease in the estimated warranty reserve for the outback and air product lines. Total operating expenses fell by 36 per cent to $3.8-million, as compared with $6.0-million in the second quarter of 2014. Research and development expenditures of $900,000, declined by $700,000, or 45 per cent, compared with $1.6-million during the second quarter of 2014, which decreased $800,000 due to the sale of agronomy services. Sales and marketing expenses of $1.2-million, declined by $300,000, or 20 per cent, compared with $1.5-million during the second quarter of 2014, due to several cost-saving initiatives and efficiencies realized through restructuring. General and administrative expenses were $1.7-million for the quarter, decreasing from $2.8-million, or 39 per cent, in 2014, due to the company incurring litigation costs in 2014 of $1.4-million relating to a lawsuit brought against a competitor believed to be infringing on the company's propriety software and intellectual property rights. The infringement did not involve the company's steering patent portfolio. On April 1, 2015, the company sold the business assets associated with its agronomy services operations to EFC Systems for cash of $2.4-million. The sale of these operations resulted in a $1.6-million gain for the quarter. For the second quarter ended June 30, 2015, the company reported net income of $1.0-million, or one cent per share (basic and diluted), compared with a net loss of $600,000, or one cent per share (basic and diluted), in the second quarter of 2014. Six-month financial review For the six months ended June 30, 2015, AgJunction reported revenues of $19.8-million compared with $25.2-million for the same period in 2014. Gross margin for the first six months of 2014 was $8.8-million, or 44 per cent, versus $12.3-million, or 49 per cent, in the comparable period.

All currency amounts are expressed in U.S. dollars. Novariant Merger In a press release dated March 16, 2015, AgJunction Inc. (\"AgJunction\" or the \"Company\") and Novariant, Inc. (\"Novariant\") announced that they had entered into an agreement under which AgJunction would acquire Novariant through a merger transaction. Complete details of the terms of the transaction are set out in the agreement filed by AgJunction under its profile on SEDAR on March 26, 2015. Novariant is a premier provider of advanced steering solutions for precision agriculture. Based in Silicon Valley, Novariant's steering solutions are used today in over 60 countries. With approximately 55 employees worldwide, Novariant generated revenues of approximately $30 million in 2014. Combined, the two companies establish a pre-eminent position in automated steering and machine control technologies worldwide, combining product portfolios, OEM customers, and leveraging industry-leading intellectual property. As global machine manufacturers increasingly target the integration of auto-steer technologies at the factory level, the combined company will bring advanced levels of machine automation to both current and future OEM clients faster and at lower cost. Upon closing of the transaction, the combined company will have approximately 200 employees worldwide. The combined company plans to maintain offices in California, Kansas, Arizona, Canada and Australia. The transaction also brings changes at the board and management level as outlined in the March 16, 2015 announcement. Fairness Hearing Date and Approvals The transaction has been progressing and the California Department of Business Oversight has set a date of August 27, 2015 to hold the Fairness Hearing to determine whether to grant AgJunction a permit in connection with the transaction. If the permit is granted, and the other required conditions are met, including approval by the shareholders of Novariant, the Company intends to hold a shareholders meeting to approve certain matters in connection with the transaction on or about September 30, 2015. Further to AgJunction's press release on April 29, 2015, AgJunction has received the approval of the Toronto Stock Exchange (the \"TSX\") to further extend the deadline to hold its annual meeting of shareholders from August 31, 2015 to September 30, 2015 and has received an order from the Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta to extend the deadline to hold the meeting of shareholders under the Business Corporations Act (Alberta). With a view to reducing the expense and inconvenience to shareholders associated with holding two separate meetings, the Company sought the further extension from the TSX and the order from the Court to allow shareholders to consider annual matters and certain matters related to the transaction at one meeting. A press release will be issued when the record date and meeting date have been determined. Completion of the transaction is anticipated in October 2015, subject to a number of conditions, including receipt of the permit from the California Department of Business Oversight, approval of the shareholders of Novariant, approval of the shareholders of AgJunction, and receipt of customary regulatory approvals, including the approval of the TSX. In connection with the above, the Company and Novariant have agreed to extend the outside date in the merger agreement for the transaction to October 31, 2015. At closing of the transaction, AgJunction shares will be issued to shareholders of Novariant in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of Novariant. After giving effect to the issuance of such AgJunction shares, AgJunction will have approximately 123.7 million fully diluted shares outstanding, of which approximately 49.5 million shares will be held by the former shareholders of Novariant, representing approximately 40.0 % of the combined company. Post transaction, directors, officers and other insiders will hold approximately 30.6 % of the combined company. Additional information in respect of the transaction will be forthcoming in the information circular which will be provided to AgJunction shareholders in connection with the meeting to approve certain matters in connection with the transaction. Second Quarter Financial Review For the six months ended June 30, 2015, the Company reported revenue of $7.7 million, a 25% decrease from $10.3 million in the second quarter of 2014. Lower revenue for the quarter is related to ongoing softness in the aftermarket agricultural retail space, and lower food commodity prices, causing farmers to delay investment and purchasing decisions. These conditions drove the drop in the Air ($1.1M) and Outback ($1.0M) business units. The Agronomy Services business, which had sales of $0.6M in Q2 of 2014, was sold April 1 2015, so it did not generate any Q2 2015 sales. United States and Canadian combined revenues were down by 51% from the second quarter of 2014, driven largely by the Company's Air product line which was down by 51% year-over-year in the US. In the US, net farm income has been declining since 2013, and according to the February 2015 US Department of Agriculture (\"USDA\") report, a further decline of 32% is forecasted for 2015. Lower crop and livestock receipts are the main drivers of the 2015 decrease in net farm income. The rate of growth in US farm assets is also forecasted to slow in 2015 compared to recent years as a result of lower net income, leading to less capital investment and a slight decline in farmland values. \"In considering how long this down cycle may last, we watch new and used inventory at the dealer level charted through time,\" said Rick Heiniger, President and CEO. \"Factory output is lower now so the correction is underway. Dealer inventories, while still high, have been slowly declining since April, 2014. I believe normality will be achieved on a gradual basis.\" Sales by business unit for the second quarter of June 30, 2015 and 2014 are as follows:  On April 1, 2015, AgJunction sold its Agronomy Services operations for $2.4 million in cash. Divesting the Agronomy Services division was aligned with AgJunction's strategy to focus all of its resources on delivering the most accurate, innovative and reliable steering solutions. The proposed merger transaction with Novariant aligns to this strategy. Sales by geographic region for the second quarter of June 30, 2015 and 2014 are as follows:  United States and Canadian combined revenues were down by 51% from the second quarter of 2014 generally characterized with ongoing softness in the aftermarket agricultural retail space. European revenues increased 56% due to increased demand from OEM customers. Sales to Australia and other markets, including South America and Asia, declined 5% and 9%, respectively. Consolidated Q2 2015 gross margin was $3.2 million, or 42% of revenue, versus $5.4 million, or 53% of revenue, in Q2 2014. Lower gross margin for the quarter was due to a higher percentage of OEM revenue in the sales mix along with a 2014 decrease in the estimated warranty reserve for the Outback and Air product lines. Total operating expenses fell by 36% to $3.8 million, as compared to $6.0 million in the second quarter of 2014. Research and development expenditures of $0.9 million, declined by $0.7 million, or 45%, compared to $1.6 million during the second quarter of 2014, which decreased $0.8M due to the sale of agronomy services. Sales and marketing expenses of $1.2 million, declined by $0.3 million, or 20%, compared to $1.5 million during the second quarter of 2014, due to several cost saving initiatives and efficiencies realized through restructuring. General and administrative expenses were $1.7 million for the quarter, decreasing from $2.8 million, or 39%, in 2014, due to the Company incurring litigation costs in 2014 of $1.4M relating to a lawsuit brought against a competitor believed to be infringing on the Company's propriety software and intellectual property rights. The infringement did not involve the Company's steering patent portfolio. On April 1, 2015, the Company sold the business assets associated with its Agronomy Services operations to EFC Systems for cash of $2.4 million. The sale of these operations resulted in a $1.6 million gain for the quarter. For the second quarter ended June 30, 2015, the Company reported net income of $1.0 million, or $0.01 per share (basic and diluted), compared to a net loss of $0.6 million, or ($0.01) per share (basic and diluted), in the second quarter of 2014. Six Month Financial Review For the six months ended June 30, 2015, AgJunction reported revenues of $19.8 million compared to $25.2 million for the same period in 2014. Gross margin for the first six months of 2014 was $8.8 million, or 44%, versus $12.3 million, or 49%, in the comparable period. Operating expenses, excluding restructuring, have declined $2.8 million, or 24%, on a year-over-year basis primarily due to cost reductions within research and development, sales and marketing, and in general and administrative expenses. 17 Aug 2015 05:00 ET Press Release: AgJunction Reports 2015 Q2 Results -2- For the six months ended June 30, 2014, the Company generated net income from continuing operations of $1.5 million, or $0.02 per share, (basic and diluted), compared to a net income from continuing operations of $0.7 million, or $0.01 per share, the first half of 2014. At the end of the second quarter of 2015, the Company held cash of $12.6 million compared to $11.2 million at the end of 2014.

Barrick Announces Streaming Agreement With Royal Gold - 5/8/2015 TORONTO, August 5, 2015 -- Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:ABX) (TSX:ABX) (Barrick or the \"company\") announced today that it has entered into a gold and silver streaming agreement with RGLD Gold AG, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Royal Gold, Inc. (\"Royal Gold\") for production linked to Barrick's 60 percent interest in the Pueblo Viejo mine. In return, Royal Gold has agreed to make an upfront cash payment of $610 million plus continuing cash payments for gold and silver delivered under the agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, Barrick will sell gold and silver to Royal Gold equivalent to: 7.5 percent of Barrick's interest in the gold produced at Pueblo Viejo until 990,000 ounces of gold have been delivered, and 3.75 percent thereafter. 75 percent of Barrick's interest in the silver produced at Pueblo Viejo until 50 million ounces have been delivered, and 37.5 percent thereafter. Silver will be delivered based on a fixed recovery rate of 70 percent. Silver above this recovery rate is not subject to the stream. Ongoing cash payments to Barrick are tied to prevailing spot prices rather than fixed in advance, maintaining material exposure to higher gold and silver prices in the future. Barrick will receive ongoing cash payments from Royal Gold equivalent to 30 percent of the prevailing spot prices for the first 550,000 ounces of gold and 23.1 million ounces of silver delivered. Thereafter payments will double to 60 percent of prevailing spot prices for each subsequent ounce of gold and silver delivered. \"The innovative structure of this streaming agreement will allow us to crystalize significant value from Pueblo Viejo in a volatile metal price environment, strengthening our balance sheet in the short term while preserving material exposure to higher gold and silver prices in the future,\" said Barrick Co-President Jim Gowans. \"We have made substantial progress on our $3 billion debt reduction target, with $250 million in debt retired so far this year, in addition to $2.45 billion raised through asset sales, joint ventures and streaming. Collectively, these actions represent $2.7 billion, or 90 percent of our target.\" Barrick will maintain its 60 percent equity ownership interest in Pueblo Viejo and its associated rights under the joint venture agreement with Goldcorp Inc., including operatorship of Pueblo Viejo. The transaction will be accounted for as a deferred sales contract and will not have any impact on our reported production or all-in sustaining cost metrics. The obligation of Barrick to sell gold and silver under the agreement is serviced using after tax cash flow being remitted from the Dominican Republic. The agreement is unsecured and is not subject to a Barrick guarantee. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to be completed early in the fourth quarter. Rothschild Inc. is acting as financial advisor to Barrick. Davies Ward Phillips & Vineberg LLP is acting as legal counsel to Barrick. About Pueblo Viejo The Pueblo Viejo mine is located in the Dominican Republic, approximately 100 kilometers northwest of the capital city of Santo Domingo and is operated by Pueblo Viejo Dominicana Corporation (\"PVDC\") -- a joint venture between Barrick (60 percent) and Goldcorp Inc. (40 percent). Pueblo Viejo is the only mine in the world with annual production of more than one million ounces of gold (100 percent basis), at all-in sustaining costs below $700 per ounce. Barrick's share of gold production in 2014 was 665,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $588 per ounce. Gold production in 2015 is forecast to be 625,000-675,000 ounces (Barrick's share) at all-in sustaining costs of $540-$590 per ounce. As at December 31, 2014, Pueblo Viejo had proven and probable gold reserves of 9.3 million ounces Latest Research Comprehensive waste characterization and organic pollution co-occurrence in a Hg and As mining and metallurgy brownfield J.R. Gallegoa, N. Esquinasa, E. Rodriguez-Valdesa, J.M. Menendez-Aguadoa, C. Sierraa, b Abstract The abandonment of Hg-As mining and metallurgy sites, together with long-term weathering, can dramatically degrade the environment. In this work it is exemplified the complex legacy of contamination that afflicts Hg-As brownfields through the detailed study of a paradigmatic site. Firstly, an in-depth study of the former industrial process was performed to identify sources of different types of waste. Subsequently, the composition and reactivity of As- and Hg-rich wastes (calcines, As-rich soot, stupp, and flue dust) was analyzed by means of multielemental analysis, mineralogical characterization (X-ray diffraction, electronic, and optical microscopy, microbrobe), chemical speciation, and sequential extractions. As-rich soot in the form of arsenolite, a relatively mobile by-product of the pyrometallurgical process, and stupp, a residue originated in the former condensing system, were determined to be the main risk at the site. In addition, the screening of organic pollution was also aimed, as shown by the outcome of benzo(a) pyrene and other PAHs, and by the identification of unexpected Hg organo-compounds (phenylmercury propionate). The approach followed unravels evidence from waste from the mining and metallurgy industry that may be present in other similar sites, and identifies unexpected contaminants overlooked by conventional analyses. The Industry Mining Facts Minerals and metals are the building blocks of the computers and smartphones we rely on, of the vehicles and public transit that get us places, of the buildings where we live and work, and of green technologies that help make the world a more sustainable place. Just as we as individuals depend on mining to support our daily lives, Canada relies on the industry to keep the economy humming. Mining is one of Canada's most important economic sectors and a major job creator. A major employer: Approximately 380,000 people across Canada work in the mining and mineral processing industries. Mining is the largest private sector employer of Aboriginal peoples in Canada on a proportional basis, and employment is poised to increase. Canada has one of the largest mining supply sectors globally with more than 3,400 companies supplying engineering, geotechnical, environmental, financial and other services to mining operations. Those who work in mining enjoy the highest wages and salaries of all industrial sectors in Canada with an average annual pay exceeding $110,000, which surpassed the average earnings of workers in forestry, manufacturing, finance and construction by a range of $31,000 to $46,000 for those sectors. An economic engine: Mining contributed $54 billion to Canada's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2013. The industry accounted for 19.6% of the value of Canadian goods exports in 2013. Canada's value of mineral production was nearly $43.6 billion in 2013. The mining industry's payments to Canadian federal and provincial governments total $71 billion in taxes and royalties over the last decade (2003-2012). A global leader: Thanks to its rich geology, Canada is one of the largest mining nations in the world producing more than 60 minerals and metals. Canada ranks in the top five countries in the global production of 11 major minerals and metals: First in potash Second in uranium and cobalt Third in aluminum and tungsten Fourth in platinum group metals, sulphur and titanium Fifth in nickel and diamonds 57% of the world's public mining companies are listed on the TSX and TSX-Venture Exchanges. Together, the two exchanges handled 48% of global mining equity transactions in 2013, and accounted for 46% of global mining equity capital for that year. Globally, Canada is recognized for its leadership in safety and sustainability. Mining companies in Canada were the first in the world to develop an externally-verified performance system for sustainable mining practices with the creation of MAC's Towards Sustainable Mining initiative in 2004. Leading Companies Agnico Eagle Mines Limited Agnico Eagle's mission is to run a high quality, easy to understand business, that generates superior long-term per share returns for our shareholders, creates a great place to work for our employees, and that is a leading contributor to the well-being of the communities in which we operate. Agnico Eagle Reports Second Quarter 2015 Results TORONTO, July 29, 2015 /PRNewswire/ - Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (NYSE:AEM, TSX:AEM) (\"Agnico Eagle\" or the \"Company\") today reported quarterly net income of $10.1 million, or net income of $0.05 per share for the second quarter of 2015. This result includes non-recurring losses of $12.9 million ($0.06 per share), unrealized gains on financial instruments of $9.4 million ($0.04 per share), non-cash foreign currency translation losses of $4.8 million ($0.02 per share), non-cash stock option expense of $4.1 million ($0.02 per share), a non-cash foreign currency translation gain on deferred tax liabilities of$3.2 million ($0.01 per share) and various mark-to-market and other adjustment gains of $0.8 million ($0.01 per share). Excluding these items would result in adjusted net income of $18.5 million or adjusted net income of $0.09 per share for the second quarter of 2015. In the second quarter of 2014, the Company reported net income of $22.2 million or net income of $0.12 per share. For the first six months of 2015, the Company reported net income of $38.8 million, or $0.18 per share. This compares with the first six months of 2014 when net income was $119.3 million, or $0.66 per share. Financial results in the 2015 period were negatively impacted by lower gold prices (approximately 8% lower) and lower by-product metals revenues. Second quarter 2015 cash provided by operating activities was $188.3 million ($152.8 million before changes in non-cash components of working capital). This compares to cash provided by operating activities of $182.7 million in the second quarter of 2014 ($136.5 million before changes in non-cash components of working capital). The increase in cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital during the current period was mainly due to an increase of 24% in gold production. For the first six months of 2015, cash provided by operating activities was $331.8 million ($329.6 million before changes in non-cash components of working capital), as compared with the first half of 2014 when cash provided by operating activities was $433.1 million ($343.6 million before changes in non-cash components of working capital). The decrease in cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital during the period was mainly due to a decrease of 8% in gold prices compared to the 2014 period, which more than offset a 17% increase in gold production. \"With continued strong operating performance, favourable local currency foreign exchange rates, and near-term opportunities to increase production at several of our mines, we remain well-positioned to manage the current price volatility in the gold market\", said Sean Boyd, Agnico Eagle's Chief Executive Officer. \"In these challenging times, we will continue to focus on reducing costs and we will remain measured in our approach to managing and growing our business\", added Mr. Boyd. Second Quarter 2015 highlights include: Quarterly gold production - Payable gold production1 in Q2 2015 was 403,678 ounces of gold at total cash costs2 per ounce on a by-product basis of $601 and all-in sustaining costs3 (\"AISC\") on a by-product basis of $864 per ounce Second consecutive record quarter of precious metal production from Mexican operations - In the second quarter of 2015, payable gold and silver production from Mexican operations was 92,056 ounces and 685,869 ounces, respectively. Total cash costs per ounce of gold on a by-product basis averaged $394 2015 production guidance maintained and cost forecasts reduced - Expected gold production for 2015 is maintained at approximately 1.6 million ounces with total cash costs on a by-product basis of $600 to $620 per ounce (previously $610 to $630) and AISC of approximately $870 to $890 per ounce (previously $880 to $900) Vault Extension and Goldex Deep 1 approved for mining; 2015 capital for both projects increased by a total of approximately $36 million - The Vault extension is expected to reduce the potential production gap between the end of production at Meadowbank and the start of production at Amaruq (not yet approved for construction) by approximately one year. Goldex Deep 1 adds approximately seven years of production at approximately 100,000 ounces of gold per year Drilling at Amaruq's Whale Tail deposit confirms grades and thicknesses; mineralization extended to depth - Highlights include: 13.2 grams per tonne (\"g/t\") gold over 14.3 metres at 133 metres depth, and 13.9 g/t gold over 11.0 metres at 194 metres depth. The deepest intercept to date on the property yielded 8.8 g/t gold over 6.0 metres at 568 metres depth, almost 200 metres deeper than previous intercepts Continued focus on debt reduction - In Q2 2015, $25 million was repaid under the Company's credit facility, C$20 million (reflecting the Company's 50% interest) was repaid under the Canadian Malartic General Partnership (the \"Partnership\") secured loan facility, and the Canadian Malartic senior unsecured convertible debentures (C$37.5 million, reflecting the Company's 50% interest) were fully converted by the holders. As a result, the Company's indebtedness was reduced by approximately $70 million A quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share was declared Second Quarter Financial and Production Highlights In the second quarter of 2015, strong operational performance continued at the Company's mines. Payable gold production in the second quarter of 2015 was 403,678 ounces compared to 326,059 ounces in the second quarter of 2014. The higher level of production in the 2015 period was primarily due to the inclusion of a full quarter of production from Canadian Malartic, increased throughput levels at Goldex, increased mill capacity at Kittila, higher grades at LaRonde and Pinos Altos and increased heap leach stacking at La India and Creston Mascota. A detailed description of the production and cost performance of each mine is set out below. Total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis for the second quarter of 2015 were lower at $601 versus $631 per ounce for the second quarter 2014. The reduction in total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis in the second quarter of 2015 was a result of higher silver production, higher gold production at most of the Company's mines and weaker local currencies compared to the second quarter of 2014. In the second quarter of 2015 the value of the Canadian dollar, Euro and Mexican Peso were 1%, 2%, and 17% lower, respectively than the Company's 2015 currency price assumptions (see February 11, 2015 news release). Payable gold production for the first half of 2015 was 807,888 ounces, compared to payable gold production of 692,480 ounces in the comparable 2014 period (which included only 11,878 ounces from Canadian Malartic for production from June 16 to June 30, 2014). For the first half of 2015, total cash costs on a by-product basis were $595 per ounce. This compares with $582 per ounce on a by-product basis in the first half of 2014. The higher costs in the 2015 period are due to the increased costs at Meadowbank when compared to the 2014 period. In 2014, Meadowbank had record production and lower costs as a result of processing higher grade ore from the Goose and reserve grade ore from the Portage deposits. AISC for the second quarter of 2015 was lower at $864 versus $1,003 per ounce for the second quarter 2014. The lower AISC is primarily due to higher production, lower than forecast total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis, lower G&A expenditures and timing of capital expenditures. For the first half of 2015, AISC was $835 versus $890 per ounce for the 2014 period. The lower AISC in the 2015 period are due to the same reasons set out above. Cash Position Remains Strong; Debt Levels Reduced; and Capex Increased to Fund Near-term Production Opportunities Cash and cash equivalents and short term investments increased to $183.9 million at June 30, 2015, from the March 31, 2015 balance of $172.1 million. The outstanding balance on the Company's $1.2 billion credit facility was reduced from $400 million at March 31, 2015 to $375 million at June 30, 2015. This result in available credit lines of approximately $825 million, as well as the $300 million accordion feature. As of June 30, 2015, C$20 million (reflecting the Company's 50% interest) was repaid under the Canadian Malartic General Partnership secured loan facility. Also, the Canadian Malartic convertible debentures with principal outstanding of C$37.5 million (reflecting the Company's 50% interest), assumed with the joint acquisition of Osisko Mining Corporation (\"Osisko\") on June 16, 2014, was fully converted by the holders. Total capital expenditures made by the Company in the second quarter of 2015 were $111.5 million, including $18.9 million at LaRonde, $18.2 million at Meadowbank, $17.2 million at Pinos Altos, $13.9 million at Kittila, $12.0 million at Goldex, $11.4 million at Meliadine, $10.7 million at Canadian Malartic (50% basis), $6.2 million at La India, $1.7 million at Lapa and $0.2 million at Creston Mascota. Total capital expenditures for the first six months of 2015 were $194.4 million including $35.5 million at LaRonde, $29.3 million at Pinos Altos, $27.7 million at Meadowbank, $24.3 million at Kittila, $21.9 million at Goldex, $21.4 million at Canadian Malartic (50% basis), $19.8 million at Meliadine, $8.5 million at La India, $4.4 million at Lapa and $0.5 million at Creston Mascota. Total sustaining capital expenditures made by the Company in the second quarter were $81.9 million, including $18.9 million at LaRonde, $18.2 million at Meadowbank, $11.1 million at Kittila, $10.6 million at Canadian Malartic (50% basis), $10.3 million at Pinos Altos, $6.2 million at La India, $4.7 million at Goldex, $1.7 million at Lapa, and $0.2 million at Creston Mascota. Total sustaining capital expenditures for the first six months of 2015 were $142.8 million including $35.5 million at LaRonde, $27.7 million at Meadowbank, $20.1 million at Kittila, $19.8 million at Canadian Malartic (50% basis), $17.3 million at Pinos Altos, $9.0 million at Goldex, $8.5 million at La India, $4.4 million at Lapa, and $0.5 million at Creston Mascota. For 2015, capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $539 million, representing a $58 million increase from the previously announced figure. The increase is primarily due to additional expenditures for the development of Goldex Deep 1, the Vault pit extension, expansion of the existing Meliadine surface and underground infrastructure, and the sealift of additional equipment for the 2016 Meliadine work program. Based on the exploration success in the first six months of the year, the 2015 expensed exploration budget has been increased by approximately $20 million to $114 million. The additional expenditure includes a phase two exploration program at the Amaruq project; an initial exploration program at the Barsele project in Sweden; a slight increase in exploration spending at the Pandora property and the Odyssey deposits; and additional drilling on the new parallel zone at Kittila. Expenditures at Amaruq and El Barqueno could potentially increase further, based on exploration results. Revised 2015 Guidance - Production Maintained, Costs Lowered, Depreciation Increased Production guidance for 2015 is maintained at approximately 1.6 million ounces of gold with total cash costs on a by-product basis of $600 to $620 per ounce (previously $610 to $630) and AISC of approximately $870 to $890 per ounce (previously $880 to $900). The Company expects depreciation and amortization expense to be in the range of $575 to $600 million. Previous guidance was $550 to $575 million. The increase is primarily due to the finalization of the purchase price allocation associated with the Canadian Malartic acquisition. NORTHERN BUSINESS OPERATING REVIEW ABITIBI REGION, QUEBEC Agnico Eagle is currently Quebec's largest gold producer with a 100% interest in three mines (LaRonde, Goldex and Lapa) and a 50% interest in the Canadian Malartic mine. These mines are located within 50 kilometres of each other, which provides operating synergies and allows for the sharing of technical expertise. LaRonde Mine - Gold Production Steadily Increasing, Commissioning of Coarse Ore Conveyor on Track for Late Q3 2015 The 100% owned LaRonde mine in northwestern Quebec achieved commercial production in 1988. The LaRonde mill processed an average of 6,242 tonnes per day (\"tpd\") in the second quarter of 2015, compared with an average of 6,197 tpd in the corresponding period of 2014. Minesite costs per tonne4 were approximately C$99 in the second quarter of 2015, higher than the C$96 per tonne experienced in the second quarter of 2014. The increased costs in the 2015 period were primarily due to higher underground development, mill maintenance and site administration costs compared to the prior-year period. For the first six months of 2015, the LaRonde mill processed an average of 6,223 tpd, compared to 6,194 tpd in the first six months of 2014. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$101, compared to C$96 per tonne in the first six months of 2014. Costs were higher due to the reasons described above in spite of the higher throughput. LaRonde's total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis were $613 in the second quarter of 2015 on payable production of 64,007 ounces of gold. This compares with the second quarter of 2014 when total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis were $732 on production of 48,494 ounces of gold. Costs in the 2015 period were positively impacted by higher gold grades and favourable foreign exchange rates. In the first six months of 2015, LaRonde produced 122,900 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $656 on a by-product basis. This is in contrast with the first six months of 2014 when the mine produced 107,846 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $645 on a by-product basis. Production in the 2015 period was positively impacted by higher grades. Costs were lower in the 2014 period due to higher by-product production and revenues. During the quarter, work continued on the installation of the coarse ore conveyor system that will extend from the 293 level to the crusher on the 280 level. Installation of the new conveyor and the connection of an internal ramp at the 281 level are expected to be completed by the end of the third quarter of 2015. These two infrastructure components should help to improve mining flexibility and reduce congestion in the deeper portions of the mine. Studies are continuing to assess the potential to extend the mineral reserve base and carry out mining activities between the 311 and 371 levels at LaRonde. At present, the mineral reserve base extends to the 311 level, which is 3.1 kilometres below the surface. In 2014, conversion drilling added approximately 444,000 ounces of gold (2.6 million tonnes at 5.33 g/t gold) to the indicated mineral resources between the 311 and 341 levels. Drilling is ongoing to further expand the known mineral resource between the 311 and 341 levels. Additional holes are also being drilled to evaluate the extent of the mineralization down to the 371 level (a depth of 3.7 km below the surface). Canadian Malartic Mine - Mining Productivity Improves, North Zone Mining Rate Increases in Q2 2015 In June 2014, Agnico Eagle and Yamana Gold Inc. (\"Yamana\") acquired all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Osisko and created the Canadian Malartic General Partnership (the \"Partnership\") that owns and operates the Canadian Malartic mine in northwestern Quebec through a joint management committee. Each of Agnico Eagle and Yamana has an indirect 50% ownership interest in the Partnership. During the second quarter of 2015, the Canadian Malartic mill processed an average of 50,705 tpd (on a 100% basis). This period included a five day planned shutdown for maintenance to the crushing and grinding circuit, and two days of unplanned maintenance on the conveying system, which reduced mill availability. Comparisons with the 2014 period are not relevant given that the Partnership only took control of the operations on June 16, 2014. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$20 (C$23 including royalties), which was in line with guidance. The average stripping ratio in the second quarter of 2015 was 2.64 to 1.0. For the first six months of 2015, the Canadian Malartic mill processed an average of 51,343 tpd. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$20 (C$23 including royalties). For the second quarter of 2015, Agnico Eagle's share of production at the Canadian Malartic mine was 68,441 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $609 on a by-product basis. In the first six months of 2015, Agnico Eagle's share of production at the Canadian Malartic mine was 136,334 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $621 on a by-product basis. Since acquiring the mine in June 2014, the Partnership has been working on several initiatives to optimize the operations. Current opportunities include: Improving SAG mill liners in an attempt to reduce the number of planned shutdowns to three per year (currently four per year) Increasing gyratory crusher availability by redirecting ore containing scrap steel to a separate crusher Maintaining mining throughput levels at two million tonnes per month in the North zone (which contains higher grades) Waste rock backfilling of the Gouldie pit, to reduce haulage distances and noise In the first quarter of 2015, the Partnership reported that discussions were ongoing with permitting authorities regarding pre-crushing activities at Canadian Malartic. In the second quarter of 2015, discussions about improving the efficiency and environmental performance of the existing mobile crusher took place with the Quebec Ministry of Sustainable Development, Environment, Wildlife and Parks. The Ministry is reviewing this concept and an application for a Certificate of Authorization is being prepared for possible submission later this year. At this point, milling levels are expected to be approximately 53,000 tpd through 2016. For the full year 2015, Agnico Eagle's estimated share of gold production from Canadian Malartic remains unchanged at 280,000 ounces. Permitting activities for the Barnat Extension and deviation of Highway 117 are continuing. An Environmental Impact Assessment (\"EIA\") was submitted in February 2015, and questions were received from permitting authorities in April and May 2015. Answers to the first round of questions are expected to be submitted by the end of August 2015. The process remains on schedule for receipt of the necessary permits in November 2016. In March 2015, the Partnership increased its interest in the Malartic CHL property to 100% by acquiring the remaining 30% interest from Abitibi Royalties Inc. (RZZ:TSX-V). The Malartic CHL property adjoins the Canadian Malartic mine to the east and hosts part of the Odyssey North discovery. Drilling continues on the Odyssey North and Odyssey South zones with data currently being compiled and interpreted. Exploration Update on Pandora and Kirkland Lake Projects Canadian Malartic Corporation, a company in which each of Agnico Eagle and Yamana has an indirect 50% interest, is exploring, among other things, a portfolio of properties in the Kirkland Lake area of Ontario and the Pandora property in the Abitibi region of Quebec. At the Upper Beaver property in Kirkland Lake, a mineral resource update is underway and the Partnership will decide the best alternative to develop the property. At Pandora, underground development on the 101-W exploration drift from the adjacent Lapa mine commenced in February 2015 and approximately 285 metres of drifting was completed during the second quarter of 2015. Approximately 433 metres of development has been completed year to date, and for the full year, approximately 940 metres of development is planned. In mid-June 2015, exploration drilling resumed from the 101-W drift and approximately 7,400 metres of underground drilling is planned in 2015 to test for extensions to the Branch zone and C zone on the Pandora property. Lapa - Zulapa Z7 Zone Continues to Yield Higher Grades and Recoveries The 100% owned Lapa mine in northwestern Quebec achieved commercial production in May 2009. The Lapa circuit, located at the LaRonde mill, processed an average of 1,387 tpd in the second quarter of 2015. This compares with an average of 1,789 tpd in the second quarter of 2014. Throughput in the 2015 period was lower because of downtime related to the discovery of fatigue cracks in the feed head of the Lapa ball mill. This component is being repaired and ore is currently being processed through the old LaRonde copper regrind circuit. As a result, throughput levels are expected to be lower than normal through at least the middle of the third quarter of 2015. Excess ore is currently being stockpiled and there is sufficient mill capacity that should allow the Company to meet its annual throughput rate (tonnes and ounces) over the balance of 2015. Minesite costs per tonne were C$126 in the second quarter of 2015, compared to the C$105 in the second quarter of 2014. Costs in the 2015 period were higher due to lower throughput compared to the same period in 2014. For the first six months of 2015, the Lapa mill processed an average of 1,538 tpd, compared to 1,769 tpd in the first six months of 2014. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$122, above the C$107 per tonne in the first six months of 2014 due to reasons explained above. Payable production in the second quarter of 2015 was 19,450 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $678. This compares with the second quarter of 2014, when production was 18,821 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $832. In the 2015 period, production was higher and costs were lower due to higher gold grades, better recoveries and favourable foreign exchange rates. In the first six months of 2015, Lapa produced 45,370 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $615 on a by-product basis. This compares to the first six months of 2014 when the mine produced 42,230 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $738 on a by-product basis. The higher production and lower costs in the 2015 period are due to the reasons outlined above. At Lapa, 2015 is the last full year of production based on the current life of mine plan. In 2016, production is expected to exhibit a decline from the current level. Additional exploration drilling is ongoing in the Zulapa Z7 zone at depth and, if successful, could extend Lapa's mine life. Goldex - Deep 1 Project Approved for Mining; Production Expected to Extend Through 2024 The 100% owned Goldex mine in northwestern Quebec began operation in 2008 but mining operations in the original orebody, the Goldex Extension Zone (\"GEZ\") were suspended in October 2011 (see October 19, 2011 news release). In July 2012, the M and E satellite zones were approved for development. Mining operations resumed on the M and E satellite zones in September 2013. Mining operations at GEZ remain suspended. The Goldex mill processed an average of 6,640 tpd in the second quarter of 2015. This compares with an average of 5,692 tpd in the second quarter of 2014. The higher throughput in the 2015 period was due to more mature mining fronts and productivity improvements compared to the 2014 period. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$34 in the second quarter of 2015, which was essentially unchanged from the C$34 per tonne experienced in the second quarter of 2014. For the first six months of 2015, the Goldex mill processed an average of 6,468 tpd, compared to 5,544 tpd in the first six months of 2014. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$34, the same as the first six months of 2014. Payable gold production in the second quarter of 2015 was 26,462 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $633. This compares with the second quarter of 2014, when production was 23,929 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $670. The decrease in total cash costs in the 2015 period was largely a result of increased production due to higher tonnage and favourable foreign exchange rates compared to the 2014 period. In the first six months of 2015, Goldex produced 55,712 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $585 on a by-product basis. This compares to the first six months of 2014 when the mine produced 43,359 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $711 on a by-product basis. The higher production and lower costs in the 2015 period are due to the same reasons as outlined above. Following the completion of a positive internal technical study, the Goldex Deep 1 Project was approved for production by Agnico Eagle's Board of Directors. The study focused on mining the lower part of the Dx zone and the top of D zone (see Goldex composite longitudinal section below) from a depth of 850 metres to 1,200 metres (Level 120). The Company plans to undertake development from the current Goldex infrastructure, with existing equipment and personnel. The planned mining method is long-hole stoping with cemented paste backfill, which is the same method currently used at Goldex. Mineralogy in the D and Dx zones is very similar to what is currently being mined in M, M2, M5, E and E2 zones. Metallurgical testing of both the D and Dx zones has indicated that recoveries for the Deep 1 project are expected to be approximately 91.5%, which is in line with current recoveries at Goldex. No changes to the processing plant are anticipated. Tailings deposition at the Manitou site is expected to continue, as the site has ample capacity. The mining rate for Deep 1 is expected to be approximately 6,000 tpd, which would allow for the potential processing of up to 2,000 tpd of ore from other sources such as the Akasaba West Project. The average grade milled is expected to be approximately 1.69 g/t gold and the minesite costs per tonne are estimated to be approximately C$35 to C$40. Gold production is expected to average in excess of 100,000 oz per year from 2018 through 2024 at an average total cash cost per ounce on a by-product basis of between $610 and $630. Development capital is forecast to be approximately $135 to $140 million, and sustaining capital is estimated at approximately $60 to $70 million per year. The development capital includes the cost of the installation of an automated conveyor system. The Dx zone contains approximately 51,000 ounces of gold in indicated mineral resources (0.7 million tonnes at 2.12 g/t gold) and approximately 172,000 ounces of gold in inferred mineral resources (3.7 million tonnes at 1.46 g/t gold). The D zone contains approximately 727,000 ounces of gold in indicated mineral resources (10.2 million tonnes at 2.21 g/t gold) and approximately 709,000 ounces of gold in inferred mineral resources (12.9 million tonnes at 1.70 g/t gold). The internal technical study was carried out using a gold price assumption of $1,200 per ounce and an US$/C$ exchange rate of 1.20. The advancement of the Deep 1 project at Goldex also unlocks significant upside potential through: Potential for additional mineral resource conversion in Deep 1 Potential for mining at Deep 2 (below Level 120) Potential to develop the South Zone (a narrow high-grade zone accessible via Deep 1 infrastructure) Potential development of the Akasaba West deposit An Environmental Impact Assessment (\"EIA\") on the Akasaba West deposit is expected to be submitted later in the third quarter of 2015, which will allow the environmental review process to commence. The Company anticipates the EIA approval in the fall of 2017. Based on an internal technical study, the Akasaba West deposit has the potential to produce approximately 20,000 to 25,000 ounces of gold and 8.5 to 10.0 million pounds of copper per year for four to five years. The average total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis is estimated to be approximately $400. Capital costs (including closure costs) are estimated at approximately C$50 million. At Goldex, 2015 capital spending guidance has been increased by $9 million. The higher planned capital expenditure is due to: Use of a contractor to complete the near surface ramp access to the M3 and M4 zones Acceleration of the Deep 1 underground development program Accelerated mineral resource conversion drilling at Deep 1 FINLAND AND SWEDEN Agnico Eagle's Kittila mine in Finland is the largest primary gold producer in Europe, and hosts the Company's largest mineral reserve base. Exploration activities continue to expand the mineral resource base and studies are underway to evaluate the potential to cost-effectively increase production. Kittila - Gold Production Increases, Unit Costs Decline, Drilling Encounters New Parallel Zone in Close Proximity to Main Rimpi Ramp The 100% owned Kittila mine in northern Finland achieved commercial production in 2009. The Kittila mill processed an average of 4,170 tpd in the second quarter of 2015 compared to the 2,720 tpd in the second quarter of 2014. The higher throughput in the 2015 period is a result of the mill expansion completed in the fourth quarter of 2014. Minesite costs per tonne at Kittila were approximately EUR75 in the second quarter of 2015, compared to EUR81 in the second quarter of 2014. Costs decreased in the second quarter of 2015 due to the increased throughput when compared with the 2014 period. For the first six months of 2015, the Kittila mill processed an average of 4,004 tpd, compared to 3,065 tpd in the first six months of 2014. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately EUR76 in the first six months of 2015, the same as the EUR76 per tonne in the comparable 2014 period. Since the expansion, the mill has shown potential to operate in excess of 4,000 tpd and efforts are ongoing to optimize throughput and recovery rates; in conjunction, the Company is also working to optimize underground mining rates and evaluate the potential to develop new mining areas. Unit costs are expected to improve once steady state operations are achieved. Second quarter 2015 payable gold production at Kittila was 41,986 ounces with a total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $776. In the second quarter of 2014, the mine produced 31,830 ounces at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $862. The higher production in the 2015 period is a result of the increased mill capacity compared to the 2014 period. Costs decreased in the second quarter of 2015 primarily due to increased production, lower energy costs and a favourable foreign exchange rate. In the first six months of 2015, Kittila produced 86,640 ounces of gold at a total cash cost per ounce of $727 on a by-product basis. This is in contrast to the first six months of 2014, when the mine produced 70,382 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $825 on a by-product basis. The lower cash costs in 2015 are mainly due to reasons described above. Previous drilling from the surface at Kittila has outlined a significant zone of mineralization at Rimpi with potentially wider widths and better grades than those currently being mined. The main underground ramp at Kittila is being extended to reach the Rimpi Zone and a new surface ramp is also being developed to access the shallower portions of the Rimpi deposit. The surface ramp had advanced 715 metres to 119 metres depth by the end of June. In April, the Company announced that drilling had encountered a new parallel lens of mineralization approximately 1.3 kilometres below surface and 150 metres east of the main Kittila ore zone, within the sheared and altered structure that hosts the known Kittila deposits (see April 30, 2015 press release). A recent hole in this area (ROU15-603) yielded 5.2 g/t gold (uncapped) over 13.3 metres (estimated true width) at approximately 975 metres below surface. Further details on this intercept and the drill hole coordinates are set out in the tables below. This latest intersection is located approximately 150 metres below the main exploration ramp being driven towards Rimpi and opens up the possibility that the up-dip extension of the new mineralized zone may be present at a similar elevation east of the ramp. This new lens could provide additional tonnage should further drilling confirm the continuity of the mineralization. Additional drilling is underway, and a second underground deep drill rig is expected to start operating in the fourth quarter 2015 to test for extensions of the new parallel zone. At the Kuotko deposit, located approximately 15 kilometres north of Kittila, drilling is ongoing to infill and expand the existing approximately 170,000 ounce inferred resource (1.8 million tonnes at 2.9 g/t gold). Metallurgical testing is underway, and on completion of the drilling, studies will be carried out to assess the viability of mining the deposit as an open pit. If the studies are positive, permit applications would then be expected to be submitted by the end of 2015. Barsele Project - Joint Venture Transaction Completed Late Q2 2015 On June 11, 2015, Agnico Eagle acquired a 55% interest in Orex Minerals Inc's (REX: TSX-V) Barsele project in Sweden. The Company can earn an additional 15% interest in the project through the completion of a pre-feasibility study. The Barsele property is known to contain intrusive-hosted gold mineralization and gold-rich volcanogenic massive sulphide mineralization. In 2015, the Company plans to spend approximately $3.25 million on exploration to further evaluate the mineral potential of the property. NUNAVUT REGION With the Company's largest producing mine (Meadowbank) and two significant development assets and exploration projects (Meliadine and Amaruq) located in Nunavut, Agnico Eagle has the potential to build an operating platform that could have the ability to generate strong production and cash flows over several decades. Meadowbank - Mine Life Extended as Vault Pit Extension Approved The 100% owned Meadowbank mine in Nunavut, northern Canada, achieved commercial production in March 2010. The Meadowbank mill processed an average of 11,199 tpd in the second quarter of 2015, compared to the 11,549 tpd achieved in the second quarter of 2014. Year-over-year mill throughput levels were lower due to a higher percentage of Vault ore processed which has a higher hardness factor. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$74 in the second quarter of 2015. These costs were higher than the C$70 per tonne in the second quarter of 2014. The higher costs per tonne were primarily due to lower throughput compared to the respective 2014 period. For the first six months of 2015, the Meadowbank mill processed an average of 11,103 tpd, compared to 11,299 tpd in the first six months of 2014. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$73 in the first six months of 2015, which was the same as the C$73 per tonne in the comparable 2014 period. Payable production in the second quarter of 2015 was 91,276 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $688. This compares with the second quarter of 2014 when 118,161 ounces were produced at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $563. The lower production and higher costs in the 2015 period compared to the 2014 period are primarily due to the processing of lower grade ore (down 18%) and lower recoveries (down 2.5%). In the first six months of 2015, Meadowbank produced 179,799 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $672 on a by-product basis. In the first six months of 2014 the mine produced 274,605 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $489 on a by-product basis. The lower production and higher costs in the 2015 period compared to the previous period was a result of the final high grade ore from the Goose and Portage pits that was mined in the first quarter 2014. In 2013, approximately 246,000 ounces were removed from mineral reserves at the Vault deposit due to a change in the gold price assumption used to calculate mineral reserves at December 31, 2013. Given the current US dollar to Canadian dollar foreign exchange rate (which yields favourable revenues and costs in Canadian dollar terms), lower fuel costs, and the growing significance of the Amaruq Project, the Company has decided to proceed with the expansion of the Vault pit. With the expansion, the Meadowbank mine is now expected to be in production until the third quarter of 2018 (approximately one year longer than originally forecast). The extension of the Meadowbank mine life is expected to help bridge the production gap between the end of production at Meadowbank and the potential start of production at a satellite operation at Amaruq (not yet approved for construction). The Meadowbank 2015 guidance for total cash costs per ounce of gold on a by-product basis is unchanged at $656. Meadowbank's average annual total cash costs per ounce of gold on a by-product basis for 2016 through 2018 are expected to be approximately $750 to $800. Including the revised Meadowbank production profile, the Company's average annual production for 2015 to 2017 is still expected to be approximately 1.6 million ounces. The 2015 capital budget at Meadowbank has been increased by $27 million to reflect additional costs associated with developing the Vault extension (higher deferred stripping and the purchase of additional mining trucks). Amaruq Project - Drilling Continues to Infill Whale Tail Zone; Positive Results at Mammoth Lake; Phase Two Exploration Program Underway Agnico Eagle has a 100% interest in the Amaruq project in Nunavut, northern Canada. The large property consists of 114,761 hectares of Inuit-owned and federal Crown land, located approximately 50 kilometres northwest of the Meadowbank mine. The purpose of the 2015 winter and spring exploration program was to infill the Whale Tail zone from surface to 200 metres depth in order to convert inferred to indicated mineral resources at open pit depths, with some additional exploration drill holes as deep as 350 metres and drilling into geophysical (magnetic and electromagnetic) targets in the Mammoth Lake area. The Company last reported exploration results from this project on June 9, 2015. As of June 30, the $16-million phase one 2015 drill program was complete with a total of 162 holes (48,081 metres). Drilling Confirms and Expands Whale Tail Mineralized Zone To date, the Whale Tail deposit has been defined over at least 1.2 kilometres of strike length between surface and 450 metres depth, suggesting potential for both open pit and underground mining. The deposit remains open at depth and along strike. Recent work confirms that Whale Tail consists of multiple lenses of mineralization with a high-grade wide core. Some of the most significant results include 10.2 g/t gold over 6.8 metres at 109 metres depth and 13.2 g/t gold over 14.3 metres at 133 metres depth (hole AMQ15-249). Hole AMQ15-236 intersected three lenses between 226 and 276 metres depth including 13.0 g/t gold over 7.1 metres at 276 metres depth. Hole AMQ15-250 intersected three lenses: 13.9 g/t gold over 11.0 metres at 194 metres depth, 4.8 g/t gold over 6.5 metres at 219 metres depth, and 10.2 g/t gold over 9.8 metres at 279 metres depth. Hole AMQ15-221 intersected two lenses below 300 metres depth including 7.3 g/t gold over 5.4 metres at 336 metres depth. The deepest intercept to date on the property is in a structure north of Whale Tail (first described in the June 9, 2015 news release): hole AMQ15-234 intersected 8.8 g/t gold over 6.0 metres at 568 metres depth, almost 200 metres deeper than any previous intercept. Another intercept that may be associated with the same structure is between the east end of the Whale Tail zone and the R zone, where hole AMQ15-225 intersected 4.9 g/t gold over 3.9 metres at 164 metres depth. This opens up a new exploration area that could potentially connect the Whale Tail deposit with the IVR deposit. Positive Results from Initial Drill Holes at Mammoth Lake The first drill results in the east part of Mammoth Lake area (located west of the Whale Tail zone) show mineralization between 50 and 300 metres depth that appears to connect with the Whale Tail deposit, possibly extending the strike length of the combined mineralization to approximately 2.0 kilometres. In the extreme east part of Mammoth Lake, 600 metres west of the known Whale Tail zone, hole AMQ15-261 intersected 6.2 g/t gold over 11.3 metres at 74 metres depth. Two hundred metres farther west, hole AMQ15-246 yielded two intercepts: 2.0 g/t gold over 8.8 metres at 248 metres depth and 6.8 g/t gold over 12.9 metres at 277 metres depth. As well, hole AMQ15-264 yielded 8.0 g/t gold over 8.4 metres at 195 metres depth. Another 1,400 metres farther southwest on the west side of Mammoth Lake, hole AMQ15-226 intersected 13.3 g/t gold over 3.0 metres at 162 metres depth. Recent drill intercepts from the Whale Tail zone and Mammoth Lake area are set out in the table below and the drill hole collars are located on the Amaruq project local geology map. Pierce points are shown on the Whale Tail composite longitudinal section; the Mammoth Lake collar coordinates are given in a second table. All intercepts reported for the Amaruq project show capped grades over estimated true widths, based on a preliminary geological interpretation that will be updated as new information becomes available with further drilling. Amaruq project local geology map Amaruq project - Whale Tail composite longitudinal section In February 2015, the Company announced an initial inferred mineral resource containing 1.5 million ounces of gold (6.6 million tonnes at 7.07 g/t gold) at the Amaruq project, based on drilling from 2013 through October 2014. An updated Amaruq mineral resource including initial indicated mineral resources is expected later this summer based on the drilling completed through the end of June. The phase two exploration program, budgeted at approximately $15 million, is now underway. This program, which is planned to include approximately 50,000 metres of drilling, prospecting, and geochemical sampling (soil, till, and rock), is expected to continue through August 2015. The main objectives of the phase two program are: Step out drilling between the Mammoth Lake and Whale Tail areas to try and link the two zones together Continue drilling in the western part of Mammoth Lake with the objective of defining the extent (size) of this new discovery Drilling at IVR to test for a potential link with the Whale Tail zone and investigate continuity of mineralization at depth and long strike to the east where field work has identified coincident geophysical and geochemical anomalies Additional deep drilling at Whale Tail (at a depth of approximately 500 metres below surface) The Company has also expanded the airborne geophysical (VTEM) coverage on the Amaruq project. This year an additional 68,044 hectares were surveyed resulting in total coverage of approximately 81,000 hectares (approximately 71% of the Amaruq property). Data from the VTEM survey is currently being reviewed with the intent of developing additional targets for evaluation. Studies are ongoing to evaluate the potential to develop the Amaruq deposit as a satellite operation to Meadowbank. Meliadine Project - Inuit Impact Benefit Agreement Signed and 2015 Budget Increased The Meliadine gold project was acquired in July 2010 and is the Company's largest development project based on mineral reserves and mineral resources. The Company has a 100% interest in the 111,757 hectare property, which is linked to the town of Rankin Inlet in Nunavut by a 25 kilometre all-weather access road. On July 13, 2015, the Kivalliq Inuit Association (KIA) and Agnico Eagle signed the Inuit Impact Benefit Agreement (IIBA) for the Meliadine gold project. Through the IIBA both Agnico Eagle and the KIA are intent on ensuring that business opportunities, employment and training opportunities arising from this potential mine will benefit the Inuit of the Kivalliq Region. The IIBA addresses protection of Inuit values, culture and language, protection of the land, water and wildlife and provides financial compensation to Inuit over the mine life. In moving forward, Agnico Eagle and the KIA will work toward a rate of 50% Inuit employment. With the signing of the Meliadine IIBA, the first financial payment from Agnico Eagle to KIA totaling C$1.5 million has been made. On March 12, 2015, the Company completed and filed with Canadian securities regulators an updated National Instrument 43-101 (\"NI 43-101\") technical report on the Meliadine gold project. The updated technical study was based on extracting only the 3.3 million ounces of gold in proven and probable mineral reserves (13.9 million tonnes of ore at 7.44 g/t gold), which is all contained in the Tiriganiaq and Wesmeg deposits. The Meliadine property also hosts 3.3 million ounces of measured and indicated mineral resources (20.2 million tonnes at 5.06 g/t gold), and 3.5 million ounces of inferred mineral resources (14.1 million tonnes at 7.65 g/t gold). In addition, there are numerous other known gold occurrences in the 80 km long greenstone belt that require further evaluation. Internal studies suggest that if the mine were to be developed there could be considerably more gold available to be added to the mine plan from the Tiriganiaq and Wesmeg/Normeg deposits, which could potentially extend the mine life, improve the project economics, and increase the after-tax internal rate of return (\"IRR\"). The Company is currently evaluating potential expanded production scenarios at Meliadine. At the end of the second quarter 2015, the underground ramp had been advanced by 867 metres, and is now at a depth of approximately 275 metres below surface. This year's plan calls for total underground development of approximately 2,500 metres. This development will allow for more cost-effective exploration and conversion drilling of the deeper parts of the Tiriganiaq and Wesmeg/Normeg deposits and help to optimize potential mining plans. The Company is currently studying options and alternatives in Nunavut to capitalize on the large and growing mineral resource base in the region and to maximize value. In order to keep the Meliadine project on track for a potential late 2019 startup, the 2015 capital budget has been increased by $22 million. The increased budget will be used to expand the existing surface and underground infrastructure and sealift additional equipment for the 2016 work program. The timing of future capital expenditures on the Meliadine project beyond 2015 and the determination of whether to build a mine at Meliadine are subject to approval by Agnico Eagle's Board of Directors, prevailing market conditions and outcomes of the various potential scenarios being evaluated. SOUTHERN BUSINESS OPERATING REVIEW At present, Agnico Eagle's southern business operations are focused in Mexico. These operations have been the source of growing precious metals production (gold and silver) with stable operating costs since 2009. Pinos Altos - Strong Performance Driven by Lower Costs and Higher Throughput The 100% owned Pinos Altos mine in northern Mexico achieved commercial production in November 2009. The Pinos Altos mill processed 5,854 tpd in the second quarter of 2015, compared to 5,513 tpd processed in the second quarter of 2014. During the second quarter of 2015, approximately 114,800 tonnes of ore were stacked on the leach pad at Pinos Altos, compared to 154,200 tonnes in the comparable 2014 period. Minesite costs per tonne at Pinos Altos were $43 in the second quarter of 2015, slightly lower than the $46 in the second quarter of 2014. The difference in minesite costs per tonne was largely attributable to variations in the proportion of heap leach ore to milled ore and open pit ore to underground ore, currency variations and routine fluctuations in the waste to ore stripping ratio in the open pit mines. For the first six months of 2015, the Pinos Altos mill processed an average of 5,758 tpd, compared to 5,448 tpd processed in the first six months of 2014. Approximately 189,200 tonnes of ore were stacked on the Pinos Altos leach pad during the first six months of 2015, compared to 293,300 tonnes in the prior year period. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately $45 compared to $48 per tonne in the first six months of 2014 with variance due to the proportion of heap leach to mill ore and the proportion of underground ore to open pit, and variations in the proportion of waste to ore mined, and variations in the currency exchange rate. Payable production in the second quarter of 2015 was 50,647 ounces of gold at a total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $384. This compares with production of 43,978 ounces at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $516 in the second quarter of 2014. Higher production in 2015 is largely due to higher throughput and higher grades processed over the comparable prior year period. The decrease in the year over year total cash costs per ounce is largely due to higher silver production (offset, in part by a decline in realized silver prices) and favourable foreign exchange rates compared to the prior year period. In the first six months of 2015, Pinos Altos produced 100,753 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $371 on a by-product basis. This is in contrast to the first six months of 2014 when the mine produced 89,195 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $498 on a by-product basis. The lower cash costs in the first six months of 2015 are primarily due to favourable foreign exchange rates and higher silver production compared to the prior year period of 2014. Site clearing and geotechnical studies have been completed for the Phase IV heap leach pad at Pinos Altos. Engineering design work is in progress with completion expected by year-end 2015. The Pinos Altos shaft sinking project remains on schedule for completion in 2016. At the end of the second quarter of 2015, the shaft had reached a depth of approximately 573 metres, and development activities had commenced on level 28. When the shaft is completed, it will allow better matching of the mill capacity with the future mining capacity at Pinos Altos once the open pit mining operation begins to wind down as planned over the next several years. The Company continues to evaluate a number of regional satellite opportunities. A 6,000 metre in-fill and conversion drill program on the Sinter deposit is 50% complete with the expectation to add this deposit to the Pinos Altos mine plan beginning in 2020. Creston Mascota Deposit at Pinos Altos - Improved Ore Stacking in Q2 2015 The Creston Mascota deposit at Pinos Altos has been operating as a satellite operation to the Pinos Altos mine since late 2010. Approximately 608,500 tonnes of ore were stacked on the Creston Mascota leach pad during the second quarter of 2015, compared to approximately 394,800 tonnes stacked in the second quarter of 2014. In the 2015 period, additional ore was encountered outside the block model, which resulted in more tonnes at lower grades being stacked compared to the 2014 period. Minesite costs per tonne at Creston Mascota were $11 in the second quarter of 2015, compared to $18 in the second quarter of 2014. Costs in the 2015 period were lower due to currency fluctuations, a reduced stripping ratio, lower fuel consumption and reduced power requirements compared to the 2014 period. For the first six months of 2015, approximately 1,135,500 tonnes of ore were stacked on the Creston Mascota leach pad, compared to 773,700 tonnes in the prior year period. For the first six months of 2015, mine site costs per tonne at Creston Mascota were $11, compared to $18 per tonne in the first six months of 2014. Costs were lower in the 2015 period due to the reasons outlined above. Payable gold production at Creston Mascota in the second quarter of 2015 was 15,606 ounces at a total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $402. This compares to 11,159 ounces at a total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $613 during the second quarter of 2014. Production was higher in the 2015 period due to more tonnes stacked, compared to the 2014 period. Cash costs were lower in the 2015 period based on lower minesite costs per tonne (see above), increased production and a favourable foreign exchange rate compared to the 2014 period. Payable gold production for the first six months of 2015 was 28,054 ounces at a total cash costs per ounce of $421 on a by-product basis. This compares to 21,476 ounces at a total cash costs per ounce of $606 on a by-product basis in the first six months of 2014. The higher production and lower costs in the 2015 period are due to the reasons outlined above. In April 2015, higher grade mineralization was encountered at the bottom of the pit and outside the Creston Mascota block model. Additional drilling is in progress to test for continuity of this mineralization, and results are currently being compiled. In the second half of 2015, a 3,500 metre infill and conversion drill program is planned on the Bravo satellite zone which would offer the potential to extend the Creston Mascota mine life. La India - Gold Production Exceeds Design Expectation as Growth Studies Continue The La India mine property in Sonora, Mexico, located approximately 70 kilometres from the Company's Pinos Altos mine, was acquired in November 2011 through the purchase of Grayd Resources, which held a 56,000 hectare land position in the Mulatos Gold belt. Commissioning of the mine commenced ahead of schedule in the third quarter of 2013 and commercial production was declared as of February 1, 2014. Approximately 1,359,500 tonnes of ore were stacked on the La India leach pad during the second quarter of 2015, compared to approximately 1,137,500 tonnes stacked in the second quarter of 2014. Minesite costs per tonne at La India were $9 in the second quarter of 2015, compared to the $8 in the second quarter of 2014. Tonnage variation reflects the ramp up to design capacity and the increased minesite costs reflect normal variations in waste/ore stripping ratio. In the first six months of 2015, approximately 2,738,000 tonnes of ore were stacked on the La India leach pad, compared to approximately 2,156,400 stacked in the first six months of 2014. Minesite costs per tonne at La India were $9 in the first six months of 2015, compared to the $7 in the first six months of 2014. The higher production and costs in the 2015 period are due to the reasons outlined above. Payable gold production at La India in the second quarter of 2015 was 25,803 ounces at total cash costs per ounce of $410 on a by-product basis were. Production in the second quarter of 2014 was 17,809 ounces at a total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $443. Total cash costs in the 2015 period were favourably impacted by higher production volumes and favourable foreign exchange rates. For the first six months of 2015, La India produced 52,326 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $414 on a by-product basis. This compares to 28,017 ounces at a total cash costs per ounce of $437 on a by-product basis in the first six months of 2014. During the quarter, approximately 40% of the earthworks had been completed on the second phase leach pad. An additional contractor is being used to expedite the process. This leach pad expansion will provide the capacity for the current planned life-of-mine production at La India and approximately 5.0 million tonnes of additional stacking. Construction of the Main Zone haul road is 65% complete, with work expected to be finished late in the third quarter of 2015. Block model reconciliation remains favourable. Infill drilling and technical evaluations are underway to develop a more predictive model. Drilling is expected to be completed later this fall, and the information is expected to be incorporated into the year-end 2015 mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates. A re-logging program has been completed on holes drilled between 2004 and 2011 on the Main Zone and the La India Zone. This resulted in the delineation of new geological domains containing gold bearing sulphide mineralization. Preliminary metallurgical testing of this material indicates that some transition and sulphide mineralization at La India may be heap leachable. Follow-up work is in progress with the potential to reassign some of the sulphide mineral inventory back into the mineral resource category. El Barqueno - Soltoro Acquisition Further Consolidates Land Position, Drilling Continues with a Focus on Resource Delineation The El Barqueno property in Jalisco State, Mexico now covers a land position of 41,112 hectares. Exploration by previous operators outlined several mineralized zones through surface exploration and diamond drilling, which in comparison is larger than the strike length of the mineralized systems at both the La India and Pinos Altos properties combined. In early June 2015, Agnico Eagle completed the acquisition of Soltoro Ltd., which added more than 30,000 hectares of property in the Barqueno district in Jalisco state, including the El Rayo silver-gold project and the El Tecolote property that are contiguous with and to the east of Agnico Eagle's El Barqueno property. The Company believes that the El Barqueno and surrounding properties have the potential to host significant gold-silver mineralization that could be developed as a combination open pit and underground mine with heap leach and/or mill processing facilities. In the second quarter of 2015, 60 holes totaling approximately 12,714 metres were drilled at El Barqueno. Work primarily focused on the Pena de Oro, Azteca-Zapoteca and Angostura zones. At Pena de Oro, drilling has been on 80 metre by 80 metre centres along a one kilometre strike length. The mineralization shows good continuity and remains open along strike and at depth. At Azteca-Zapoteca, mineralization extends for over one kilometre along strike and is also open at depth and along strike. The Company last reported results from these target areas on June 9, 2015, and additional results from these zones are expected to be released in the third quarter of 2015. The initial 2015 drill program was completed in June and a supplemental program has been approved to infill the mineralized areas as well as to test extensions to the known mineralization. Metallurgical and mineralogical studies have been commissioned to further increase the understanding of the mineral resource potential. An inferred/indicated mineral resource is expected to be completed by the end of the year for the Pena de Oro and Azteca-Zapoteca areas to open-pit mineable depths (surface to 200 metres depth). The Angostura prospect is also being studied for a potential inferred mineral resource estimate by year-end. An additional 10,000-metre reconnaissance drill program is being proposed to commence in the third quarter of the year. The program will be designed to test other new high-priority targets outside the main deposits such as the Zapote, Poncho East and West, Esperanza and Falco areas defined last year and earlier this year using prospecting, geological mapping and sampling, and geochemical (stream sediment and soil surveys) and geophysical (magnetic, radiometrics, and electromagnetic) surveys.

(TSE: AGU) Our vision to help feed the world responsibly means not only helping farmers grow more food, but doing it in ways that protect the environment, support economic vitality and enhance communities. One of the greatest challenges the global community has ever faced is how to sustainably feed a rapidly growing population. This challenge is complex and won't be solved quickly, but we believe we're stronger working together. By collaborating with multiple groups, we build long-term, impactful programs and solutions that we continually learn from and build upon. So that, together, we can feed the world responsibly and improve the lives of future generations. Agrium Reports Strong Results despite Challenging Market Conditions ALL AMOUNTS ARE STATED IN U.S.$ Agrium Inc. (TSX:AGU) (NYSE:AGU) announced today 2015 second quarter net earnings from continuing operations of $675-million ($4.71 diluted earnings per share), compared to $625-million ($4.34 diluted earnings per share) in the second quarter of 2014. The increase in earnings was supported by higher Wholesale volumes and lower production costs for most products. Retail results were impacted by lower crop prices, drought in Western Canada and wet conditions in the U.S. Corn Belt, which affected growers' decisions and limited the opportunities for use of certain crop inputs and services. Highlights: Second quarter adjusted net earnings of $701-million or $4.90 per share and $5.01 per share in the first half of 2015 on the same basis (see page 2 for adjusted net earnings reconciliation)(1). Strong nitrogen operational performance contributed to Wholesale gross profit of $409-million compared to $227-million in the second quarter of 2014. Our total ammonia production for the first half of 2015 was the highest since 2000. The Vanscoy potash facility continues to ramp-up production after completion of the expansion project and is hitting new daily production targets. Retail gross profit of $1.3-billion was 6 percent lower than the second quarter of 2014. Results were primarily impacted by lower earnings in Canadian retail and the lower Canadian dollar, as well as compression of seed margins across all regions. Repurchased $100-million or 952,053 shares since the beginning of April. 2015 annual guidance range narrowed to $7.00 to $7.50 diluted earnings per share (see page 3 for further detail). Revision to timeline and scope of Borger nitrogen expansion project. Agrium has exceeded its 2017 Operational Excellence targets of $350-million of one-time savings and $125-million of recurring EBITDA value through primarily our portfolio review, utilization rates, distribution network synergies, and cost reductions. \"Agrium's solid second quarter earnings were supported by the strong competitive advantages across our product portfolio, the diversity of our product and geographic mix and our continued focus on operational excellence. Wholesale delivered impressive results across all products, supported by lower costs and higher volumes. Retail earnings held up well despite approximately a 5 percent decline in crop input expenditures across the North America market and the impact of the severe weather conditions across this region. We believe we outperformed against our U.S. retail peers achieving an increase in U.S. normalized comparable store sales in a down market, a demonstration of the strength of our business model and market position,\" commented Chuck Magro, Agrium's President and CEO. \"Agrium is committed to delivering on our capital allocation vision as we execute our Operational Excellence initiatives, optimize our portfolio and continue to return capital to shareholders through future dividend growth and share repurchases,\" added Mr. Magro. Forecasted annual effective tax rate of 28 percent used for adjusted net earnings and per share calculations. These are non-IFRS measures which represent net earnings adjusted for certain income (expenses) that are considered to be non-operational in nature. We believe these measures provide meaningful comparison to the earnings of other companies by eliminating share-based payments expense (recovery), gains (losses) on foreign exchange, gains (losses) on non-qualifying derivative hedges and other one-time adjustments. These should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS and may not be directly comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. UPDATED ANNUAL 2015 GUIDANCE Based on our Market Outlook, Agrium expects to achieve annual diluted earnings per share of $7.00 to $7.50 in 2015 compared to our previous estimate of $7.00 to $8.25 per share. We have narrowed the guidance range due primarily to the impact of low crop prices on grower decisions and lower expected potash and phosphate pricing in the second half of the year relative to our previous guidance. We are assuming a normal fall season, recognizing there is risk to fall nutrient applications in regions impacted by drought or a delay in the North American harvest. As a result, our Retail EBITDA(4) for 2015 is now expected to be from $1.00-billion to $1.05-billion. This incorporates challenges that our Canadian retail operations face in 2015 due to the drought and lower crop prices, while our U.S. Retail operations is expected to achieve earnings in-line with 2014 levels. Our annual nitrogen and potash production targets remain unchanged. However, strong sales in the second quarter resulted in low beginning inventories to start the third quarter, which will impact sales volumes in this period. We have updated our finance costs range for 2015 to $240-million to $255-million to reflect a higher than anticipated cost of financing for our customer pre-payment programs. Our estimates of the Canada and U.S. foreign exchange rates and NYMEX for 2015 have been narrowed from our previous estimates based on current market conditions. We have also updated the range for our annual effective tax rate for 2015 to 28 percent to 29 percent to reflect the impact of the recently announced increase to the Alberta corporate income tax rate effective July 1, 2015, increasing from 10 percent to 12 percent. As a result, we had a one-time deferred tax liability charge in the second quarter, which contributed to the increase in our annual effective tax rate for 2015. This guidance and updated additional measures and related assumptions are summarized in the table on page 3. Guidance excludes the impact of share-based payments expense (recovery), gains (losses) on foreign exchange and non-qualifying derivative hedges. Represents diluted per share information attributable to equity holders of Agrium. One-time adjustment mainly relates to the increase in current and deferred taxes due to an increase in the Alberta corporate income tax rate. Forecasted annual effective tax rate of 28 percent used for adjusted net earnings and per share calculations. Earnings (loss) from continuing operations before finance costs, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. This is a non-IFRS measure.

Sales and gross profit Retail sales and gross profit decreased for the second quarter and first half of 2015 compared to the same periods last year primarily due to unfavorable weather conditions and competitive pricing pressure as a result of lower crop prices and reduced U.S. corn acreage which impacted our crop nutrients and seed sales and margins. Wholesale's nitrogen and phosphate sales and gross profit increased for the second quarter and first half of 2015 compared to the same periods last year as a result of higher nitrogen volumes, higher ammonia and phosphate realized selling prices, lower natural gas costs and manufacturing cost efficiencies. Product purchased for resale had lower sales and gross profit as a result of the 2014 strategic review that led to Agrium exiting portions of this business. Overall, Wholesale had higher gross profit for the second quarter and first half of 2015 compared to the same periods last year. Expenses General and administrative expense decreased by $16-million for the second quarter and $18-million for the first half of 2015 compared to the same periods last year as a result of reduced payroll and office expense costs as we began to realize reductions related to our Operational Excellence program. Share-based payments Due primarily to Agrium's share price increases in 2015, our share-based payments expense increased by $22-million for the second quarter and $36-million for the first half of 2015 compared to the same periods last year. Other Expenses (Income) We began to designate all of our natural gas derivatives as qualifying hedges for accounting purposes beginning January 1, 2015 and, accordingly, we no longer have natural gas derivatives not designated as hedges. The related gains or losses are recorded as part of cost of product sold when we sell the related product and unrealized gains or losses are recorded in equity. Previously, we recorded these natural gas derivative gains and losses directly to other expenses, resulting in natural gas derivative gains of $32-million in the first half of 2014. We completed the sale of our Niota and Meredosia storage and distribution facilities in the first quarter of 2015 resulting in a gain on sale of assets of $38-million. Environmental remediation and asset retirement obligations expense decreased for the second quarter and first half of 2015 compared to the same periods last year as higher provisions were recorded for our plant and mine sites in 2014. Effective Tax Rate The effective tax rates on continuing operations were 30 percent for the second quarter and 29 percent for the first half of 2015 and are higher than the effective tax rate of 28 percent for both the second quarter and first half of last year due to an increase in deferred taxes relating to the increase in the Alberta corporate income tax rate. BUSINESS SEGMENT PERFORMANCE Retail sales and gross profit were lower than the same period last year due to lower prices for all crops this spring and reduced corn acreage in the U.S. North American operations were also impacted by the drought in Western Canada and California and excessive moisture across the U.S. Corn Belt and the southern and northeastern states during June. The wet conditions in the U.S. Corn Belt impacted total seeded acreage and the ability of growers to apply nutrients and crop protection products in late spring. Regionally, the U.S. EBITDA contribution was lower by $12-million over the same period last year, while South America was also lower. Canadian results accounted for the majority of the variance in EBITDA compared to the second quarter of 2014, while Australia was the only region to report an increase in EBITDA this quarter. Retail selling expenses as a percentage of sales were unchanged year-over-year on realization of Operational Excellence initiatives. Total nutrient sales were 4 percent lower compared to the same period last year, primarily due to lower average nutrient selling prices. Total nutrient volumes were 1 percent lower this quarter across our Retail operations compared to the same period last year. Virtually all of the reduction was due to lower demand in Canada related to drought conditions and lower crop prices. Nutrient sales volumes in the U.S. were up 2 percent this quarter, despite lower corn and total seeded acreage this year. Nutrient sales volumes were marginally lower in our international markets due to dry conditions and lower planted wheat acreage in both our South American and Australian markets. Nutrient margins on a per tonne basis were lower across all regions, with the largest decline in Canada, but only a 4 percent reduction in the U.S. and Australia compared to the same quarter last year. The significant weakening in the Canadian dollar in 2015 had an estimated $10/tonne negative impact on nutrient margins in our Canadian operations. Crop protection products Total crop protection sales were down 1 percent year-over-year, mostly as a result of dry conditions in Australia and South America and foreign exchange differences in the businesses outside of the U.S. North American crop protection sales increased slightly compared to last year, despite significant industry headwinds this spring. The increase was a result of higher herbicide and insecticide sales in our U.S. operations despite the wet conditions during June across the U.S. Corn Belt. Crop protection margins as a percentage of sales increased year-over-year, largely due to the strength of the performance from our Loveland proprietary product line, which registered over a 10 percent increase in sales this quarter and gained a further 2 percentage points increase in the proportion of Loveland's sales out of our total crop protection sales. Seed The lower crop price environment this spring had the largest impact on the seed business. Seed sales and margins were negatively impacted by competitive pressures between suppliers and some trading down by growers in terms of seed genetics. The reduction was also due to a shift in crop mix from corn and cotton to soybeans, as well as significant unseeded soybean acreage in the U.S. due to the wet weather later this spring. Seed margins as a percentage of sales decreased by 2 percent from the second quarter of 2014; however, higher margin Dyna-Gro seed sales showed a year-over-year increase in sales which helped mitigate some of the impact on seed results. Merchandise Merchandise sales decreased compared to the same period last year as a result of lower fuel prices and lower equipment sales in Canadian retail and lower merchandise sales in Australia as part of our stock keeping unit (\"SKU\") rationalization, which has had a positive impact on Australian working capital leverage. Gross profit and gross margin as a percentage of sales were higher this quarter due to a decrease in lower margin Canadian fuel sales and higher overall product prices in the Australian business which consistently has higher margin products. Services and other Sales and gross profit for application services and other were both down 3 percent compared to the same period last year. The decline was due to reduction in the Canadian and Australian markets related to dry weather conditions. Nitrogen gross profit increased 167 percent compared to the same period last year due to higher sales volumes and lower cost of product sold. This was partially offset by lower urea and UAN prices in the current quarter. Sales volumes increased by 35 percent over the same period last year due to stronger operating rates and a greater draw-down in inventories this year. Cost of product sold for nitrogen decreased from the second quarter of 2014. The reduction in per tonne costs was primarily due to significantly lower natural gas prices, stronger operating rates and the weaker Canadian dollar. Nitrogen margins reached $220 per tonne this quarter, almost double last year's level. Potash Potash gross profit decreased in the current quarter due to lower total sales tonnes than the same period last year, partially offset by higher realized sales prices. Sales volumes were 10 percent lower this quarter due to low opening inventories as the Vanscoy facility gradually ramps up to full production after the completion of the expansion project at the end of 2014. Vanscoy's production this quarter was 460,000 tonnes, in line with the targeted level. Realized sales prices were higher than the same period last year. Overall potash prices rose in both domestic and international markets, but with a stronger increase in international markets. Cost of product sold was higher than the same period last year due to lower production volumes and higher maintenance costs associated with the planned turnaround at Vanscoy in June this quarter. As a result, cash cost of product manufactured was $110 per tonne this quarter compared to last year at $92 per tonne. Phosphate Phosphate gross profit increased due to a combination of higher volumes, lower costs and an improvement in sales price relative to the previous year. Sales volumes increased by 8 percent due to higher product availability and sales prices were $67 per tonne higher than the same quarter last year as a result of tight regional supply and demand fundamentals. Overall phosphate margins were $102 per tonne this quarter, an $80 per tonne increase over the same period last year. Wholesale Other Gross profit for Wholesale's Other product category decreased this quarter primarily due to lower sales volumes and margins in the product purchased for resale business as these operations were significantly scaled back as part of our portfolio review. ESN(r) gross profit increased this quarter due to higher sales volumes and lower cost of product sold. Other EBITDA for our other non-operating business unit for the second quarter of 2015 had net earnings of $3-million, compared to a net expense of $6-million for the second quarter of 2014. The variance was due to the following: A $12-million higher gross profit recovery for the second quarter of 2015 compared to the second quarter of 2014. This is a result of lower inter-segment inventory held at the end of the second quarter; A $12-million decrease in environmental remediation liability expense as higher provisions were recorded for our plant and mine sites in 2014; and, A $22-million increase in share-based payments expense related to a strengthening in the fair value of our share-based payment plans against our peer group. Summary of Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Our investing capital expenditures decreased in the first half of 2015 compared to the first half of 2014 due to the completion of the tie-in of our Vanscoy potash facility expansion in the fourth quarter of 2014, partially offset by increased expenditures relating to the Borger nitrogen expansion project. We incurred investing capital expenditures amounting to $192-million for the expansion of the Borger nitrogen facility. The timeline and scope of the Borger nitrogen expansion project have been revised. The refresh of the existing ammonia facility and the new 610,000 tonne urea facility will be completed as planned; however, the completion date has been extended to the end of 2016 in order to manage costs, and the 145,000 tonne ammonia expansion portion of the project has been cancelled to minimize project risk. The total capital expenditure for the revised scope is expected to be within 5 percent of the $720-million estimate. We expect Agrium's remaining capital spending to approximate $500-million to $600-million in 2015. We anticipate that we will be able to finance the announced projects through a combination of cash provided from operating activities and existing credit facilities. Short-term Debt Our short-term debt of $681-million at June 30, 2015 is outlined in note 5 of our Summarized Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our short-term debt increased by $416-million during the three months ended June 30, 2015, which in turn contributed to a decrease in our unutilized short-term financing capacity to $2.2-billion as at June 30, 2015. Capital Management Our revolving credit facilities require that we maintain specific interest coverage and debt-to-capital ratios, as well as other non-financial covenants as defined in our credit agreements. We were in compliance with all covenants at June 30, 2015. NORMAL COURSE ISSUER BID In January 2015, the Toronto Stock Exchange (\"TSX\") accepted Agrium's notice of intention to make a normal course issuer bid (\"NCIB\") whereby Agrium may purchase up to 7,185,866 common shares on the TSX and New York Stock Exchange during the period from January 26, 2015 to January 25, 2016. During the six months ended June 30, 2015, we purchased 952,053 shares at an average share price of $104.99 for total consideration of $100-million. There were no share repurchases subsequent to June 30, 2015. Shareholders can obtain a copy of the NCIB notice submitted to the TSX from Agrium without charge upon request. OUTSTANDING SHARE DATA Agrium had 142,791,278 outstanding shares at July 31, 2015. At that date, under our stock option plans, shares expected to be issued for options outstanding were negligible. The agricultural products business is seasonal in nature. Consequently, comparisons made on a year-over-year basis are more appropriate than quarter-over-quarter comparisons. Crop input sales are primarily concentrated in the spring and fall crop input application seasons. Crop nutrient inventories are normally accumulated leading up to each application season. Our cash collections from accounts receivables generally occur after the application season is complete and our customer prepayments are mostly concentrated in December and January. ADDITIONAL IFRS AND NON-IFRS FINANCIAL MEASURES Certain financial measures in this MD&A are not prescribed by IFRS. We consider these financial measures discussed herein to provide useful information to both management and investors in measuring our financial performance and financial condition. In general, an additional IFRS financial measure is a measure relevant to understanding a company's financial performance that is not a minimum financial statement measure mandated by IFRS. A non-IFRS financial measure generally either excludes or includes amounts not excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS. Non-IFRS financial measures are not recognized measures under IFRS and our method of calculation is unlikely to be directly comparable to that of other companies. These non-IFRS measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES We prepare our financial statements in accordance with IFRS, which requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates in applying accounting policies. For further information on the Company's critical accounting estimates, refer to the section \"Critical Accounting Estimates\" in our 2014 annual MD&A, which is contained in our 2014 Annual Report. Since the date of our 2014 annual MD&A, there have not been any material changes to our critical accounting estimates. BUSINESS RISKS The information presented in the \"Enterprise Risk Management\" section on pages 64 - 68 in our 2014 Annual Report and under the heading \"Risk Factors\" on pages 22 - 31 in our 2014 Annual Information Form has not changed materially since December 31, 2014. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2015 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PUBLIC SECURITIES FILINGS MARKET OUTLOOK Prospects for global crop prices have improved since June due to less than ideal weather conditions across a number of geographies. Excessive moisture in the U.S. Corn Belt has led to the deterioration in crops and led to lower than anticipated planted acreage in some areas. Severe drought across much of Western Canada has also reduced yield expectations. While new crop futures prices have recently declined, the rally in crop prices in late June and early July is evidence of how sensitive global crop supply and demand is to relatively small changes in yield expectations. In areas with excessive moisture, it has been difficult to get equipment into the fields to apply crop nutrients and crop protection products, which in some cases has led to missed applications. In drought areas growers have in some cases sought to reduce crop nutrient and crop protection applications on struggling crops. The prospects outside of drought impacted areas are more positive for the remainder of 2015 as stronger prices in early July offered growers higher priced selling opportunities and improved grower sentiment. Furthermore, in areas with excess moisture, the wet conditions tend to lead to increased disease pressure, supporting fungicide demand. Following the end of the northern hemisphere's spring application season, crop nutrient prices have generally weakened, driven by the seasonal slow-down in demand. Tightened Chinese urea export supplies and seasonal demand fuelled an increase in urea prices in-season. However, the expectation of a return of increased Chinese supply to the export market, combined with new exportable supply in Algeria, Saudi Arabia and the U.S. in the second half of the year have pressured global prices. We expect Chinese anthracite-based urea costs to continue to provide a floor to the urea market in the second half of 2015, and that Indian import demand will be strong, particularly in light of the strong start to the monsoon season. Potash shipments to China and India have been robust in recent months and are expected to provide a solid base to global demand in the second half of 2015. In contrast, Brazilian demand has been relatively slow, down 21 percent year-over-year in the first half of 2015. However, we expect the pace of demand to improve in the third quarter, in advance of the domestic planting season. Following the spring season, North American potash prices declined, significantly narrowing the premium relative to other major global markets. The phosphate market has been relatively stable, with robust Indian demand offset by relatively weak Brazilian import demand and record Chinese DAP/MAP exports.

Barrick Gold Corporation (TSX: ABX) Our vision is the generation of wealth through responsible mining wealth for our owners, our people, and the countries and communities with which we partner. We aim to be the leading mining company focused on gold, growing our cash flow per share by developing and operating high quality assets through disciplined allocation of human and financial capital and operational excellence. Those who founded and first led the company were committed to a culture of partnership and the values underpinning such a culture: trust, transparency, shared responsibility and accountability, and a sense of emotional and financial ownership. The company is returning to its roots as a lean and nimble organization, with minimal bureaucracy. A small head office manages the company with a balance of entrepreneurialism and prudence, focusing on only a few core activities: defining and implementing strategy, allocating human and financial capital, and fulfilling the obligations required of a public company. Leaders at the operational level have greater autonomy, responsibility, and accountability, functioning as business owners. Free from bureaucracy and middle management, they are focused on maximizing free cash flow, and the head office is focused on allocating that cash flow to maximize shareholder returns. Barrick has mining operations in Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile, Dominican Republic, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Saudi Arabia, United States and Zambia. More than 75 percent of the company's gold production comes from the Americas region. Barrick Reports Second Quarter 2015 Results Company reported a net loss of $9 million ($0.01 per share) in the second quarter; adjusted net earnings were $60 million ($0.05 per share)1. Free cash flow was $26 million1 and operating cash flow was $525 million. Production in the second quarter was 1.45 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs (AISC) of $895 per ounce1. Full-year gold production is now expected to be 6.1-6.4 million ounces, reflecting the impact of asset sales. All-in sustaining cost guidance for 2015 has been reduced to $840-$880 per ounce. Total debt reduced by approximately $250 million in first half. $2.45 billion in asset sales and joint ventures announced to date. Targeting $2 billion in reduced expenditures across the company by the end of 2016. Capital and other expenditures reduced by $240 million in the second quarter. Lowered quarterly dividend to two cents per share. Scenario planning completed for gold prices down to $900 per ounce. On track to achieve approximately $50 million in G&A cost savings in 2015, exceeding original $30 million target for the year. Targeting $90 million in annualized savings in 2016, up from original target of $70 million. Completed Preliminary Economic Assessments on projects with the potential to significantly extend mine life at Lagunas Norte and Pueblo Viejo. TORONTO, August 5, 2015 -- Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:ABX)(TSX:ABX) (Barrick or the \"company\") reported a net loss of $9 million ($0.01 per share) for the second quarter, with adjusted net earnings of $60 million ($0.05 per share). Free cash flow was $26 million, compared to negative free cash flow of $128 million in the prior year period. Operating cash flow in the second quarter was $525 million. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $725 million1. On an unadjusted basis, EBITDA was $690 million. Gold production guidance for 2015 has been adjusted to 6.1-6.4 million ounces to reflect the impact of divestments, with production 55 percent weighted to the second half of the year. Costs are expected to be 10 percent lower in the second half of 2015. Full-year all-in sustaining cost guidance is $840-$880 per ounce, down from $860-$895 per ounce. The implementation of a lean, decentralized operating model designed to maximize free cash flow and take costs out of the business has helped to mitigate the impact of recent gold price declines. We have cut $300 million in capital spending so far this year and are on track to achieve $90 million in reduced general and administrative (G&A) expenditures by 2016. We have also made significant progress on our debt reduction target. Our current focus is on improving productivity and reducing operating costs to ensure our business is robust enough to generate a 10-15 percent return on invested capital through the metal price cycle. STRENGTHENING THE BALANCE SHEET Earlier this year, we set a debt reduction target of $3 billion for 2015. Thus far, we have announced agreements representing$2.45 billion from asset sales, joint ventures and streaming. In addition, we have also retired approximately $250 million in debt using cash on hand in the first half of this year. Collectively, these actions represent $2.7 billion, or 90 percent of our target. Transactions announced to date include: Sale of 100 percent of the Cowal mine for $550 million in cash, further focusing the geographic footprint of our portfolio by divesting the last Barrick-operated mine in Australia. Sale of a 50 percent interest in Barrick (Niugini) Ltd. for $298 million in cash2, establishing a long-term strategic partnership with China's Zijin Mining. Sale of a 50 percent interest in the Zaldivar copper mine for $1.005 billion in cash2, realizing significant value from a non-core operation while maintaining a sizeable stake in this cash-generating asset. This transaction has also resulted in a new partnership with Antofagasta Plc, one of the world's leading copper companies, with significant opportunities to collaborate on potential projects in the future. Streaming agreement on a portion of Barrick's share of gold and silver production from Pueblo Viejo for $610 million in cash2, structured to maintain significant exposure to higher metal prices. With a $4 billion undrawn credit facility and $2.1 billion in cash on hand at the end of the second quarter, we will continue to pursue our debt reduction target in a disciplined manner and will take only those actions that make sense for the business, on terms we consider favorable to our shareholders. Additional asset divestments Over the last several months, Barrick has received a number of proposals and expressions of interest relating to the proposed acquisition of various non-core assets in Nevada and Montana. Over the next several weeks, we intend to commence a formal process to sell Bald Mountain, Round Mountain (50 percent interest), Spring Valley (70 percent interest), Ruby Hill, Hilltop and Golden Sunlight. These assets represent an attractive portfolio of producing and development-stage assets in a politically stable and highly prospective region. OPERATIONAL FOCUS Our strategy is focused on maximizing free cash flow per share from a portfolio of high-quality gold assets in our core regions, underpinned by disciplined capital allocation and operational excellence. In the past six months, we have taken significant actions to improve our business plans, resulting in positive free cash flow in the second quarter. We remain focused on improving productivity and driving down costs to ensure we can continue to generate free cash flow in the current gold price environment. Anticipating the potential for weaker gold prices in the second half of 2015, we challenged our leaders to cut spending by $1 billion. We have now increased this target. By the end of 2016, we are targeting $2 billion in reduced expenditures across the company. These reductions will come from operating expenses, capital spending and corporate overhead. We have identified$1.4 billion in potential opportunities to date. This will strengthen the resilience of our portfolio in a lower gold price environment, while positioning us to deliver stronger margins when gold prices recover. These efforts are benefiting from the outcomes of our Value Realization reviews, which have now been completed for all operations. This process has identified concrete projects to maximize free cash flow, extend mine lives and lower costs. The reviews also support non-core asset sales by ensuring we understand the full value of every mine before proceeding with any divestiture. For details on key Value Realization opportunities identified at Lagunas Norte and Pueblo Viejo, please see Appendix 1 on page 9. For certain related risk factors please see the cautionary statement on forward-looking information at the end of this press release. We have also carried out a series of scenario planning exercises that detail actions we can take to optimize mine plans and increase flexibility in a lower gold price environment. These actions include: Adjust life-of-mine plans to maximize short-term free cash flow Place higher-cost operations on temporary care and maintenance Defer stripping activities Close or divest mines that do not meet capital allocation objectives Increase cut-off grades Reduce mining/processing rates Further reduce G&A and exploration Further reduce sustaining capital Process higher-grade stockpiles Capital Costs As we continue to review all expenditures for 2015 and 2016, we are cancelling or deferring spending that does not meet our capital allocation objectives, which include, first and foremost, the ability to meet a hurdle rate of 15 percent. In the second quarter, we identified $240 million in reductions that have now been removed from our plans. Total capital expenditures for 2015 are now expected to be $1.6-$1.9 billion , 20 percent lower than in 2014. Exploration expenditures are now expected to be $180-$220 million, a reduction of 17 percent from our original 2015 guidance. Sixty-five percent of our exploration budget is allocated to mine site exploration, with 35 percent directed at greenfield projects, primarily on our newest discovery Alturas and the El Indio belt. Reductions identified in the second quarter include: Sustaining capital reduced by $100 million to $1.4-$1.6 billion; Expansion capital reduced by $50 million to $100-$150 million, driven by efficiencies and reductions at Turquoise Ridge,Cortez and Ruby Hill; Project capital reduced by $50 million to $100-$150 million, primarily reflecting reductions at Pascua-Lama and Spring Valley; and Exploration budget reduced by $40 million to $180-$220 million, focusing expenditures on our most promising opportunities where we see the highest potential returns. G&A Expenses We are focused on reducing costs and improving productivity across the entire business. Excluding severance and one-time costs, the company is on track to capture approximately $50 million in savings from reduced G&A expenditures and overhead costs in 2015, exceeding our original target of $30 million for the year. We expect to reach $90 million in annualized G&A savings by 2016. FINANCIAL DISCUSSION Second quarter 2015 adjusted net earnings were $60 million ($0.05 per share) compared to $159 million ($0.14 per share) in the prior year period. The net loss for the quarter was $9 million ($0.01 per share) compared to a net loss of $269 million ($0.23 per share) in the prior year quarter. Lower adjusted net earnings reflect lower gold sales and lower realized gold and copper prices compared to the prior year period. Significant adjusting items for the quarter (net of tax and non-controlling interest effects) include: $22 million in impairment charges primarily related to power assets at Pueblo Viejo; $30 million in unrealized foreign currency translation losses; $17 million in costs related to the closure of our Perth office; and A $15 million positive adjustment reflecting the impact of the increase in the discount rate used to calculate the provision for environmental remediation at closed mines. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $725 million compared to $990 million in the prior year period. On an unadjusted basis, EBITDA was $690 million for the second quarter compared to $478 million in the prior year period. Operating cash flow was $525 million compared to $488 million in the prior year period. The company generated positive free cash flow of $26 million in the second quarter compared to an outflow of $128 million in the prior year period, reflecting higher operating cash flow and lower capital expenditures as a result of the company's continued emphasis on rigorous capital discipline. The Board of Directors has decided to reduce the company's quarterly dividend by 60 percent, from five cents per share to two cents per share. The Board believes this reduction is a prudent measure to increase financial flexibility in light of current market conditions. The dividend will be paid on September 15, 2015 to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 31, 20153. The Board has approved a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the \"DRIP\"), which we intend to make available to eligible shareholders for the first time with payment of the above-mentioned dividend on September 15, 2015 to shareholders of record on August 31, 2015. The DRIP will allow registered or beneficial holders of Barrick's common shares who reside in Canada or the United Statesto reinvest cash dividends paid on their common shares in additional common shares at a discount to the average market price (as defined in the DRIP), currently set at three percent and subject to change at the discretion of the Board. Additional details about the DRIP and enrollment instructions will be provided at a later date. OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS AND GUIDANCE Reflecting the divestiture of Cowal and 50 percent of Barrick (Niugini) Ltd., 2015 gold production is now anticipated to be 6.1-6.4 million ounces at reduced AISC of $840-$880 per ounce. Production is 55 percent weighted to the second half of the year, primarily due to higher planned production at Goldstrike, Cortez and Pueblo Viejo. Third quarter AISC are expected to be lower than our AISC in the first half of the year, and fourth quarter AISC are expected to be significantly lower than the third quarter, driven largely by higher production at Goldstrike, Pueblo Viejo and Cortez in the second half of the year. Cortez The Cortez mine produced 193,000 ounces at AISC of $811 per ounce in the second quarter. Production benefited from positive grade reconciliations in the Cortez Hills open pit and improved underground productivity, as well as from some initial treatment of refractory ore through Goldstrike's thiosulfate (TCM) process. AISC were positively impacted by higher production, lower operating costs and lower sustaining capital. Production in 2015 is forecast to be 825,000-900,000 ounces at AISC of $760-$835 per ounce. Production in the second half is fourth-quarter weighted as the open pit transitions into higher-grade ore and as the ramp-up of the TCM circuit at Goldstrike allows for additional processing of refractory ore from Cortez. Goldstrike The Goldstrike mine contributed 206,000 ounces in the second quarter, in line with plan. AISC of $732 per ounce were better than expected on higher tonnes and grades from the underground operation, as well as lower sustaining capital. Grades and recoveries from the TCM circuit continue to be consistent with feasibility results. Several adjustments were implemented to improve the throughput of the circuit during the commissioning phase and the process is expected to ramp up on schedule this year. Production and AISC guidance for 2015 is 1.00-1.15 million ounces and $700-$800 per ounce. The third quarter is expected to be the stronger of the two remaining quarters on higher anticipated open pit grades. Pueblo Viejo Barrick's 60 percent share of production from Pueblo Viejo for the second quarter was 131,000 ounces at AISC of $682 per ounce. Production in the quarter was lower than planned due to lower gold recoveries, largely related to a higher proportion of carbonaceous ore. AISC were also impacted by lower silver recoveries associated with a temporary shutdown of the lime boil process during scheduled autoclave maintenance. Recent modifications to the lime boil are showing significantly improved silver recoveries and the first copper concentrate was shipped in the second quarter. Attributable production in 2015 is forecast to be 625,000-675,000 ounces at AISC of $540-$590 per ounce. Production is expected to be higher and costs lower in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter on higher-expected grades, improved recoveries and better autoclave availability, as maintenance shutdowns were weighted to the first half of 2015. Lagunas Norte The Lagunas Norte mine contributed 155,000 ounces at AISC of $509 per ounce in the second quarter. Production was in line with expectations while AISC were better than plan on lower sustaining capital. Production in 2015 is anticipated to be 600,000-650,000 ounces at AISC of $600-$650 per ounce. Veladero The Veladero mine produced 151,000 ounces of gold in the second quarter, in line with plan. AISC of $961 per ounce benefited from higher than expected sales and lower sustaining capital. Production guidance for 2015 is 575,000-625,000 ounces at AISC of $950-$1,035 per ounce, with second half costs expected to be highest in the third quarter related to capitalize stripping and sustaining capital, as well as lower byproduct credits. Turquoise Ridge The Turquoise Ridge mine contributed 52,000 ounces (75 percent basis), in line with expectations. AISC of $780 per ounce reflect higher sustaining capital associated with the focus on growing production and improving ventilation. Costs are expected to be highest in the third quarter related to these efforts as well as to feasibility and detailed engineering work for the second shaft project. The mine is forecast to produce 175,000-200,000 ounces (75 percent basis) in 2015 at AISC of $775-$825 per ounce. Porgera The Porgera mine produced 118,000 ounces (95 percent basis), slightly below plan on lower open pit grades. AISC of $1,128 per ounce were lower than expected as a result of lower capitalized stripping costs due to fewer waste tonnes mined and lower sustaining capital. Reflecting the partial divestiture, attributable production in 2015 is now expected to be 400,000-450,000 ounces at AISC of $1,025-$1,125 per ounce. Other Mines Barrick's other mines -- consisting of Bald Mountain, Round Mountain, Golden Sunlight, Ruby Hill, Hemlo , Cowal, KCGM and Pierina -- contributed 320,000 ounces at AISC of $895 per ounce in the second quarter. An improved closure plan at Pierina is expected to contribute approximately 270,000 ounces over the next three-and-a-half years for minimal capital. Acacia Mining Barrick's share of second quarter production was 119,000 ounces at AISC of $1,149 per ounce. Attributable 2015 production from Acacia is anticipated to be 480,000-510,000 ounces at AISC of $1,050-$1,100 per ounce. Production will be weighted to the second half of 2015, driven by operational improvements and a planned ramp-up at Bulyanhulu. Global Copper Copper production in the second quarter was 115 million pounds at C1 cash costs of $1.94 per pound. For 2015, copper production is anticipated to be 480-520 million pounds at C1 cash costs of $1.75-$2.00 per pound. Lumwana contributed 63 million pounds at C1 cash costs of $2.01 per pound in the second quarter, in line with expectations. The Zambian government has ratified amendments to the country's mining tax regime that replaced the recently-adopted 20 percent gross royalty on open pit mines with a nine percent royalty, and reintroduced a 30 percent corporate income tax and a 15 percent variable profits tax. Production is anticipated to be 250-270 million pounds at C1 cash costs of $1.90-$2.15 per pound in 2015. Production of 52 million pounds at Zaldivar at C1 cash costs of $1.85 per pound in the second quarter was in line with plan. Production for 2015 is anticipated to be 230-250 million pounds at C1 cash costs of $1.65-$1.95 per pound. At Jabal Sayid, first shipments of low-cost copper-in-concentrate are anticipated in early 2016. Once the mine reaches full production, the average annual output is expected to be 100 million pounds per year with the potential to increase to 130 million pounds. Lagunas Norte Refractory Material Mine Life Extension Project: Since it began operations in 2005, Lagunas Norte has outperformed production expectations and become one of our most profitable mines. In 2014, the mine produced 582,000 ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of $543 per ounce. In its early years, production peaked at more than one million ounces per year. To date, Lagunas Norte has operated as an oxide heap leach mine. The mine will transition from oxide ore into mixed oxide/refractory material as it approaches the end of its current mine life in 2018. We have now completed a Preliminary Economic Assessment (\"PEA\") on a plan to extend the life of Lagunas Norte by approximately 12 years by mining the refractory material below the oxide ore body in the current pit. The refractory material cannot be economically processed using heap leaching due to low recoveries. The plan contemplates the installation of a new grinding-flotation-autoclave processing circuit to treat the refractory material. Work has begun on a Pre-Feasibility Study (\"PFS\") to further assess the technical and financial viability of, and risks associated with, the project, which has the potential to add nearly two million ounces of measured and indicated gold resources that are not currently included in the mine's existing mineral reserves and resources. Based on the preliminary analysis completed to date, Barrick expects that approximately $500 million would be required to build the facilities necessary to treat the refractory material. The PEA for this initiative will be incorporated in an updated technical report prepared by Barrick's independent technical advisor, Roscoe Postle Associates Inc. (\"RPA\"), which Barrick intends to file within 45 days. We expect to complete the PFS on this opportunity by the end of 2015. The table below summarizes the mineral resources associated with the Refractory Material Mine Life Extension Project that, except as otherwise noted, are not included in the mine's mineral resource statement as at December 31, 2014. Gold Mineral Resources Associated with the Refractory Material Mine Life Extension Project Notes: Mineral resources have been estimated as at December 31, 2014 based on a gold price of $1,400 per ounce. All estimates have been made in accordance with the standards of the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum in National Instrument 43-101. Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. Gold cut-off grades ranged from 0.48 g/t to 1.00 g/t depending on the material type. Gold recovery as a result of this initiative is expected to reach an average of 90 percent. Numbers may not add due to rounding. Includes 2.013 million tonnes of measured and indicated resources grading 1.15 g/t gold (74 thousand contained ounces of gold) that were previously reported in the mine's resource statement as at December 31, 2014. This material is expected to be reclaimed from the existing leach facility and reprocessed through the new facility for this initiative. The PEA for the Refractory Material Mine Life Extension Project is preliminary in nature and is based in part on inferred resources which are considered too speculative geologically to have economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and there is no certainty that the PEA will be realized. Pueblo Viejo Expansion of Tailings Storage Capacity: Pueblo Viejo is one of the world's largest, lowest-cost gold mines. In 2014, Barrick's 60 percent share of production from the Pueblo Viejo mine was approximately 665,000 ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of$588 per ounce. As reported in the mine's resource statement as at December 31, 2014, in addition to existing reserves, Pueblo Viejo has approximately six million ounces of gold and 37 million ounces of silver in the measured and indicated resource category (Barrick's 60 percent share). A significant portion of these resources are not currently included in reserves due to tailings storage constraints. We have completed a PEA evaluating a plan to remove these constraints to tailings capacity, which if implemented could allow Barrick to significantly extend the life of the mine. Barrick expects to complete further engineering work and commission a PFS in the second half of 2016 to refine the technical and financial analysis for the increase in tailings storage capacity and confirm whether the measured and indicated resources described above can be brought into reserves. Conversion of Power Plant and Lime Kilns to Natural Gas Fuel: Energy is one of the biggest cost drivers at any mining operation. We have completed a PFS on an initiative to reduce energy costs at Pueblo Viejo by converting the fuel supply for the Quisqueya I power plant that supplies electricity to the mine to natural gas from more expensive heavy fuel oil, and retrofitting the lime kilns to burn natural gas instead of diesel. The power plant was originally designed to operate on multiple fuel types, including natural gas. The PFS evaluated the delivery and use of liquid or compressed natural gas to the mine and power plant. Barrick is currently engaged in negotiations regarding the supply of natural gas to the Quisqueya I power plant and the Pueblo Viejo mine. If a supply agreement is successfully negotiated, this initiative to transition to natural gas could be implemented as early as 2017. Barrick anticipates that the conversion of the power plant and lime kilns at the mine site will require only minimal capital investment by Pueblo Viejo and that all capital costs associated with the construction of the natural gas infrastructure including the necessary natural gas pipeline to the power plant would be borne by the natural gas supplier.

Cameco Corporation (TSE: CCJ) Cameco is one of the world's largest uranium producers accounting for about 16% of the global production from its mines in Canada, the US and Kazakhstan. Our leading position is backed by about 429 million pounds of proven and probable reserves and extensive resources. Cameco reports second quarter financial results SASKATOON, SASKATCHEWAN--(July 30, 2015) ALL AMOUNTS ARE STATED IN CDN $ (UNLESS NOTED) higher revenue and gross profit for the quarter and first six months average realized uranium price outperforming spot and long-term market prices strong uranium production for the quarter, maintaining annual production and sales targets Cameco (TSX:CCO)(NYSE:CCJ) today reported its consolidated financial and operating results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2015 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). \"The company continues to perform well,\" said Tim Gitzel, president and CEO, \"despite the tough market conditions. \"Despite some supply disruptions in the first half of the year, prices and demand remained 'flat' due to the current oversupply in the market. However, the long-term outlook for nuclear energy, underpinned by strong fundamentals, remains positive. With the long-term view in mind, we remain focused on keeping costs down and running our operations safely and efficiently to ensure we maintain the flexibility to respond to market conditions as they evolve.\" SECOND QUARTER Net earnings attributed to equity holders this quarter were $88 million ($0.22 per share diluted) compared to net earnings of $127 million ($0.32 per share diluted) in the second quarter of 2014. In addition to the items noted below, our net earnings were affected by mark-to-market gains on foreign exchange derivatives. On an adjusted basis, our earnings this quarter were $46 million ($0.12 per share diluted) compared to $79 million ($0.20 per share diluted) (non-IFRS measure, see section) in the second quarter of 2014. The change was mainly due to: higher administrative costs a favourable settlement of $28 million with respect to a dispute regarding a long-term supply contract with a utility customer recorded in the second quarter of 2014 Partially offset by: higher gross profit from uranium and fuel services segments settlement costs of $12 million with respect to the early redemption our Series C debentures recorded during the second quarter of 2014 See Financial results by segment below for more detailed discussion. FIRST SIX MONTHS Net earnings in the first six months of the year were $79 million ($0.20 per share diluted) compared to $259 million ($0.65 per share diluted) in the first six months of 2014. In addition to the items noted below, our net earnings were affected by mark-to-market losses on foreign exchange derivatives. Our 2014 earnings also included a gain on the sale of our interest in BPLP of $127 million. On an adjusted basis, our earnings for the first six months of this year were $115 million ($0.29 per share diluted) (non-IFRS measure, see section) unchanged from the first six months of 2014. Key variances include: higher administration costs a favourable settlement of $28 million with respect to a dispute regarding a long-term supply contract with a utility customer recorded in the second quarter of 2014 lower tax recovery Partially offset by: higher gross profit from our uranium, fuel services and NUKEM segments lower losses from equity accounted investments Our 2014 adjusted net earnings were also impacted by: an early termination fee of $18 million incurred in 2014 as a result of the cancellation of our toll conversion agreement with Springfields Fuels Ltd. (SFL), which was to expire in 2016 settlement costs of $12 million with respect to the early redemption our Series C debentures recorded in 2014 See financial results by segment below for more detailed discussion. Also of note: Ken Seitz, our senior vice-president and chief commercial officer is resigning effective August 15, 2015, to take a chief executive officer position with a company outside the nuclear industry. Mr. Seitz had oversight for our marketing, corporate development, and exploration activities. At this time, the plan is to reallocate these activities, and his other responsibilities, among members of our officer team. This re-allocation will be finalized in September 2015. Uranium market update The market continued to be flat in the second quarter, with spot prices remaining in the mid-$30s (US). The quantity transacted in the spot market was at normal levels, though no significant price trends emerged. We believe this flat environment is simply a function of the currently over-supplied market, where we believe participants' uncovered requirements start to open up in the next two to three years. There were supply disruptions in the first half of 2015 that reduced the over-supply situation, but the reductions did not result in any notable change in spot or term demand from utilities. Japan restarts remain the most important driver of market sentiment in the short term. While the market has been disappointed with ongoing delays, the first reactor restarts appear to be imminent with Kyushu having loaded fuel into Sendai unit 1 for anticipated restart in August, while preparing Sendai unit 2 for restart this fall. We remain confident that a significant number of units will be restarted in Japan over time, though the regulatory approval process and restart schedules are clearly hard to predict. Beyond these short-term challenges in the market, longer term, strong fundamentals underpin a positive outlook for the industry. Globally, there are 64 reactors currently under construction, with a net increase of 82 reactors expected over the next 10 years. China continues to execute on its remarkable nuclear growth plan, with 26 reactors operating and 24 under construction. India continues to demonstrate confidence in its nuclear growth strategy, evidenced by the signing of new long-term uranium supply agreements with major producers, including Cameco. On the supply side, we continue to see depressed market conditions having a negative impact on future supply potential, as suppliers struggle to justify the underlying economics. The cancellation of a planned mine expansion in Australia further supports our view that current price levels do not justify the development of new uranium supply projects. Demand growth combined with the timing, development and execution of new supply projects and the continued performance of existing supply, will determine the pace of market recovery. Caution about forward-looking information relating to our uranium market update This discussion of our expectations for the nuclear industry, including its growth profile, future global uranium supply and demand, and net increase in reactors, is forward-looking information that is based upon the assumptions and subject to the material risks discussed under the heading Caution about forward-looking information below. Outlook for 2015 Our strategy is to profitably produce at a pace aligned with market signals, while maintaining the ability to respond to conditions as they evolve. Our outlook for 2015 reflects the expenditures necessary to help us achieve our strategy. Our outlook for NUKEM revenue and unit cost, as well as consolidated revenue, administration costs and tax rate has changed. To provide additional insight following our acquisition of NUKEM in 2013, we provided an outlook for NUKEM's direct administration costs and tax rate. However, NUKEM's direct administration costs and tax rate are immaterial in the context of our consolidated results. We provide outlook for consolidated direct administration costs and for our consolidated tax rate based on taxes incurred in Canada and in foreign jurisdictions; we do not provide any further breakdown for our other segments. As a result, we will no longer provide an outlook for direct administration costs or tax rate specific to the NUKEM segment. We do not provide an outlook for the items in the table that are marked with a dash. 2015 FINANCIAL OUTLOOK Our 2015 outlook for sales volume does not include sales between our uranium, fuel services and NUKEM segments. For comparison of our 2015 outlook and 2014 results for revenue, we do not include sales between our uranium, fuel services and NUKEM segments. Based on a uranium spot price of $36.00 (US) per pound (the Ux spot price as of July 27, 2015), a long-term price indicator of $44.00 (US) per pound (the Ux long-term indicator on July 27, 2015) and an exchange rate of $1.00 (US) for $1.22 (Cdn). This increase is based on the unit cost of sale for produced material and committed long-term purchases. If we make discretionary purchases in 2015, then we expect the overall unit cost of sales to increase further. Direct administration costs do not include stock-based compensation expenses. Our outlook for NUKEM revenue has changed to an increase of 20% to 25% (previously increase of 5% to 10%) due to our expectation that NUKEM sales volumes will be higher in the range, and the effect of foreign exchange. Consolidated revenue is now expected to increase by 5% to 10% (previously an increase of up to 5%) due to our expectation that sales volumes for the uranium and NUKEM segments will be higher in the range. We have also adjusted our outlook for NUKEM cost of sales. Unit cost of sales is now expected to increase 5% to 10% (previously increase up to 5%) due to the effect of foreign exchange. Consolidated administration costs are now expected to increase 5% to 10% (previously an increase of up to 5%) due to increased costs under our collaboration agreements and the effect of foreign exchange. We have adjusted our outlook for the consolidated tax rate to a recovery of 40% to 45% (previously 45% to 50%) due to the expected impact of the changes to the consolidated outlook noted above, and a change in the distribution of earnings between jurisdictions. In our uranium and fuel services segments, our customers choose when in the year to receive deliveries, so our quarterly delivery patterns, sales volumes and revenue can vary significantly however, the majority of delivery notices have been received for 2015, reducing variability for the remainder of the year. We expect uranium deliveries in the third quarter to be similar to the first two quarters, and fourth quarter deliveries to be higher. REVENUE AND EARNINGS SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS For the rest of 2015: An increase of $5 (US) per pound in both the Ux spot price ($36.00 (US) per pound on July 27, 2015) and the Ux long-term price indicator ($44.00 (US) per pound on July 27, 2015) would increase revenue by $48 million and net earnings by $27 million. Conversely, a decrease of $5 (US) per pound would decrease revenue by $45 million and net earnings by $24 million. a one-cent change in the value of the Canadian dollar versus the US dollar would change adjusted net earnings by $5 million, with a decrease in the value of the Canadian dollar versus the US dollar having a positive impact ADJUSTED NET EARNINGS (NON-IFRS MEASURE) Adjusted net earnings are a measure that does not have a standardized meaning or a consistent basis of calculation under IFRS (non-IFRS measure). We use this measure as a more meaningful way to compare our financial performance from period to period. We believe that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, certain investors use this information to evaluate our performance. Adjusted net earnings are our net earnings attributable to equity holders, adjusted to better reflect the underlying financial performance for the reporting period. The adjusted earnings measure reflects the matching of the net benefits of our hedging program with the inflows of foreign currencies in the applicable reporting period, and has also been adjusted for NUKEM purchase price inventory write-downs and recoveries, income taxes on adjustments, impairment charges on non-producing property, and the after tax gain on the sale of our interest in BPLP. Adjusted net earnings are non-standard supplemental information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information prepared according to accounting standards. Other companies may calculate this measure differently, so you may not be able to make a direct comparison to similar measures presented by other companies. Discontinued operation On March 27, 2014, we completed the sale of our 31.6% limited partnership interest in BPLP, which was accounted for effective January 1, 2014. The aggregate sale price for our interest in BPLP and certain related entities was $450 million. We realized an after tax gain of $127 million on this divestiture. As a result of the transaction, we presented the results of BPLP as a discontinued operation and we revised our statement of earnings, statement of comprehensive income and statement of cash flows to reflect the change in presentation. See note 4 to the interim financial statements for more information.

See Uranium 2015 Q2 updates below for more information. The 13% increase in uranium revenues was a result of a 14% increase in the Canadian dollar average realized price, partially offset by a 1% decrease in sales volume. The US dollar average realized price increased by 1% compared to 2014 mainly due to higher prices on fixed price contracts, while the higher Canadian dollar realized prices this quarter were a result of the weakening of the Canadian dollar compared to 2014. This quarter the exchange rate on the average realized price was $1.00 (US) for $1.25 (Cdn) compared to $1.00 (US) for $1.11 (Cdn) in the second quarter of 2014. Total cost of sales (including D&A) increased by 12% ($297 million compared to $266 million in 2014) due to a 14% increase in the unit cost of sales, partially offset by a 1% decrease in sales volume. The increase in the unit cost of sales was mainly the result of an increase in the volume of material purchased in the quarter at prices higher than our average cost of inventory. The net effect was a $17 million increase in gross profit for the quarter. FIRST SIX MONTHS Production volumes for the first six months of the year were 8% higher than in the previous year due to the addition of production from Cigar Lake, partially offset by lower production at McArthur/Key Lake, our US operations and Inkai. See Uranium 2015 Q2 updates below for more information. Uranium revenues increased 9% compared to the first six months of 2014 due to a 9% increase in the Canadian dollar average realized price. Sales volumes in the first six months were the same as in 2014. Our Canadian dollar realized prices for the first six months of 2015 were higher than 2014, primarily as a result of the weakening of the Canadian dollar compared to 2014. For the first six months of 2015, the exchange rate on the average realized price was $1.00 (US) for $1.23 (Cdn) compared to $1.00 (US) for $1.10 (Cdn) for the same period in 2014. Total cost of sales (including D&A) increased by 12% ($552 million compared to $495 million in 2014) mainly due to a 12% increase in the unit cost of sales. The increase was mainly the result of an increase in the volume of material purchased in the first six months at prices higher than our average cost of inventory, and an increase in unit production costs. The net effect was an $11 million increase in gross profit for the first six months. We are active in the uranium market, buying and selling uranium on the spot market and under long-term contracts when we expect it will be beneficial for us. Purchases are impacted by foreign exchange rates, and may, in some cases, require we pay prices higher or lower than current spot prices. Depending on the volume and unit cost of purchases in a quarter, our average cost of inventory can be impacted, which flows through to our cost of sales. The table below shows the costs of produced and purchased uranium incurred in the reporting periods (which are non-IFRS measures, see the paragraphs below the table). These costs do not include selling costs such as royalties, transportation and commissions, nor do they reflect the impact of opening inventories on our reported cost of sales. Cash cost per pound, non-cash cost per pound and total cost per pound for produced and purchased uranium presented in the above table are non-IFRS measures. These measures do not have a standardized meaning or a consistent basis of calculation under IFRS. We use these measures in our assessment of the performance of our uranium business. We believe that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, certain investors use this information to evaluate our performance and ability to generate cash flow. These measures are non-standard supplemental information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared according to accounting standards. These measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under IFRS. Other companies may calculate these measures differently, so you may not be able to make a direct comparison to similar measures presented by other companies. To facilitate a better understanding of these measures, the following table presents a reconciliation of these measures to our unit cost of sales for the second quarter and the first six months of 2015 and 2014. SECOND QUARTER Total revenue for the second quarter of 2015 remained the same as the prior year at $70 million. A 27% decrease in sales volumes was offset by a 40% increase in average realized price, primarily due to the mix of products sold. The total cost of products and services sold (including D&A) decreased by 7% ($50 million compared to $54 million in the second quarter of 2014) due to the decrease in sales volumes, partially offset by an increase in the average unit cost of sales. When compared to 2014, the average unit cost of sales was 30% higher due to the mix of fuel services products sold. The net effect was a $3 million increase in gross profit. FIRST SIX MONTHS In the first six months of the year, total revenue increased by 24% due to a 6% increase in sales volumes and a 17% increase in realized price that was the result of increased realized prices for UF6 and the mix of products sold. The total cost of sales (including D&A) increased 17% ($109 million compared to $93 million in 2014) due to an increase in sales volume and a 12% increase in the average unit cost of sales, which resulted from the mix of fuel services products sold. The net effect was a $9 million increase in gross profit.

Total revenues increased by 31% as a result of average realized prices which were 21% higher than those realized in the second quarter of 2014. Gross margin percentage was 14% in the second quarter of 2015, a 33% decrease compared to the second quarter of 2014. The allocation of the historic purchase price to the sale of inventory on hand at the time of acquisition of NUKEM, impacted margins for the quarter. The net effect was a $2 million decrease in gross profit. FIRST SIX MONTHS During the six months ended June 30, 2015, NUKEM delivered 4.0 million pounds of uranium, an increase of 82%, due to timing of customer requirements and generally lower activity in the market during 2014. Total revenues increased 89% due to an 82% increase in sales volumes and a 4% increase in average realized price. Gross margin percentage was 12% for the first six months of 2015 as compared to 11% for the same period in 2014. Included in the 2014 margin was a $6 million write-down of inventory compared to a $3 million recovery in 2015. The write-down in 2014 was a result of a decline in the spot price during the period. The net effect was a $12 million increase in gross profit.

Air and road access to our operations has improved and we have resumed normal shipping of packaged product from our operations. We still expect to meet our 2015 production target of 25.3 million to 26.3 million pounds, and our sales target of 31 million to 33 million pounds. The fire risk across northern Saskatchewan has diminished, although we continue to monitor the situation closely and support our employees, their families and communities impacted by the situation. MCARTHUR RIVER/KEY LAKE Production for the quarter was 38% higher compared to the same period last year but 7% lower for the first half of the year due to the timing of mill maintenance, including an unplanned mill maintenance outage during the first quarter. The operation remains on track to achieve our planned 2015 production. We now have a licence production limit of 25 million pounds per year (100% basis) at both McArthur River and Key Lake. The increased production limit aligns with our strategy to maintain the flexibility to adjust to market conditions. CIGAR LAKE The jet boring system at the Cigar Lake mine continued to perform as expected, and during the first half of 2015, we successfully mined 4.8 million pounds of uranium for shipment to the McClean Lake mill. We are continuing to ramp up mine production, and now have three jet boring machines (JBS) commissioned for use underground. The mined ore is routinely transported to the McClean Lake mill, which, during the second quarter, packaged approximately 2.4 million pounds (100% basis, 1.2 million pounds our share), for total production of 3.1 million pounds during the first half of 2015. Cigar Lake remains on track to achieve the annual production target of 6 million to 8 million packaged pounds (100% basis). Commercial production signals a transition in the accounting treatment for costs incurred at the mine. Cigar Lake met all of the criteria for commercial production, including cycle time and process specifications, in the second quarter. Therefore, effective May 1, 2015, we began charging all production costs, including depreciation, to inventory and subsequently recognizing them in cost of sales as the product is sold. We expect Cigar Lake to produce between 6 million and 8 million packaged pounds in 2015; our share is 3 million to 4 million pounds. As we ramp up production to 18 million pounds (100% basis) by 2018, volumes may not be linear year-to-year, but will vary based on our operational experience. To ensure the most efficient operation of the mine and mill throughout the year, we expect to continually manage ore supply and, therefore, may halt and resume mining several times during a quarter without impacting planned annual production. Caution about forward-looking information relating to Cigar Lake This discussion of our expectations for Cigar Lake, including our plan for 6 million to 8 million packaged pounds (100%) in 2015, is forward-looking information that is based upon the assumptions and subject to the material risks discussed under the heading Caution about forward-looking information below. INKAI Production was 14% lower for both the second quarter and the first six months of the year compared to the same periods in 2014 due to the timing of new wellfield development. The operation remains on track to achieve our planned 2015 production. The block 3 test leach facility is now operational and state commissioning of the test wellfields was accomplished during the second quarter. Our application for an extension of the block 3 deposit evaluation period is still pending final approval from the Ministry of Energy of the Republic of Kazakhstan. Inkai continues working on the final appraisal of the mineral potential of block 3 according to Kazakhstan standards.

FNV) Franco-Nevada is the leading gold-focused royalty and stream company by both gold revenues and number of gold assets. The Company is gold-focused but also has the largest and most diversified portfolio of royalties and streams by commodity, geography, revenue type and stage of project. The portfolio is actively managed with the aim to maintain over 80% of revenue from precious metals (gold, silver & PGM). The Company does not operate mines, develop projects or conduct exploration. Franco-Nevada's business model is focused on managing and growing its portfolio of royalties and streams. The advantages of this business model are: Market Exposure to the gold price and exploration optionality; Limited exposure to many of the risks associated with operating companies; A free cash-flow business with limited cash calls; A high-margin business that can generate cash through the entire commodity cycle; A scalable and diversified business in which a large number of assets can be managed with a small stable overhead; A forward-looking business in which management focuses on growth opportunities rather than operational or development issues; and A perpetual discovery option over large areas of geologically prospective lands with no cost other than the initial investment. Franco-Nevada's financial results in the short-term are primarily tied to the price of commodities and the amount of production from its portfolio of producing assets. From time to time, financial results are also supplemented by acquisitions of new producing assets. Over the longer-term, results are impacted by the availability of exploration and development capital applied by other companies to advance Franco-Nevada's advanced and exploration assets into production. Franco-Nevada has a long-term focus in making its investments and recognizes it is in a cyclical industry. Franco-Nevada has historically operated by maintaining a strong balance sheet so that it can make investments during commodity cycle downturns. At year-end 2014, Franco-Nevada had $677.8 million in working capital and an undrawn $500.0 million unsecured credit facility. Franco-Nevada's shares are listed on the Toronto and New York stock exchanges under the symbol FNV. An investment in Franco-Nevada's shares is expected to provide investors with yield and more upside than gold ETF without exposure to operating cost inflation. Since its IPO over seven years ago, Franco-Nevada's share price has outperformed the gold price and all relevant gold equity benchmarks. Franco-Nevada Reports Q1 2015 Results and Increases Quarterly Dividend TORONTO, May 6, 2015 - Franco-Nevada Corporation (TSX: FNV; NYSE: FNV) today reported first quarter 2015 financial results realizing 85,081 Gold Equivalent Ounces (\"GEOs\")1 from its mineral assets and $5.5 million in revenue from its oil & gas assets. Net Income and Adjusted Net Income2 were $19.2 million, or $0.12 per share, and $22.9 million, or $0.15 per share, respectively, with Adjusted EBITDA3 being $83.3 million, or $0.53 per share. \"Franco-Nevada's mineral assets continue to deliver dependable results with our new asset, Candelaria, having a strong first quarter. However lower average oil prices impacted our revenue,\" said David Harquail, President and CEO. \"Our overall portfolio is diverse with high margin assets that continue to deliver strong operating cash flows. This has allowed us to continue the tradition of increasing our dividend each year. Our previously announced 5% dividend increase has now been formally declared for the second quarter of 2015. Franco-Nevada remains debt free with $671.3 million in working capital at quarter end. We expect to continue to grow our portfolio with further investments.\" Investments Ring of Fire: On April 28, 2015, Franco-Nevada acquired royalty rights in the Ring of Fire mining district of Ontario by providing $28.5 million in loan and royalty financing to Noront Resources Ltd. Dublin Gulch (Eagle): On January 14, 2015, Franco-Nevada acquired royalties on the Eagle deposit located in the Yukon for $7.0 million. Cobre Panama: Franco-Nevada continues to work with First Quantum to streamline reporting requirements and provide greater flexibility to finance the project. First Quantum reported that construction at Cobre Panama continued to advance in the first quarter with detailed engineering and site earthworks progressing well. Franco-Nevada expects to fund $300.0 million to $350.0 million in 2015 in connection with the precious metals stream agreement. Portfolio Updates Gold - U.S.: GEOs from U.S. gold assets decreased to 10,378 GEOs mainly due to lower production at Goldstrike partially offset by higher GEOs from Bald Mountain and Fire Creek/Midas, a February 2014 acquisition. Gold - Canada: GEOs from Canadian assets increased in the quarter with increases from the Kirkland Lake and Timmins West royalties. Lake Shore Gold has reported promising drill results at its 144 Gap Zone where Franco-Nevada holds a 2.25% NSR. Rubicon Minerals has reported positive progress to achieving production this year at the Phoenix project where Franco-Nevada holds a 2% NSR. Centerra Gold has committed $300 million to its 50-50 partnership in the Hardrock project where Franco-Nevada has a 3% NSR. In addition, Yamana Gold has agreed to acquire Mega Precious Metals, the owner of the Monument Bay project where Franco-Nevada holds a 3% NSR. Gold - Latin America: Candelaria had a good first quarter and delivered 21,705 GEOs to Franco-Nevada. Gold - Rest of World: Contributions from Sabodala and MWS represented approximately 65% of the total GEOs received from Rest of World gold assets for the first quarter of 2015. Alamos Gold has reported that the Environmental Impact Assessment for the Agi Dagi project has been returned to good standing. Franco-Nevada has a 2% NSR on Agi Dagi. Perseus Mining has announced a go-ahead decision on Sissingue where Franco-Nevada has a 0.5% NSR. PGM: PGM GEOs were impacted by the declining platinum price in the quarter. Oil & gas: Revenue from oil & gas assets was $5.5 million in Q1 2015 with similar production levels as Q1 2014. The decrease in revenue is the result of lower average oil prices and carry-over capital from 2014 related to the Weyburn Unit NRI. Stronger revenues are expected from oil & gas assets over the balance of 2015. Corporate Updates Franco-Nevada is pleased to announce that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.21 per share.

Forward Looking Statements Non-IFRS Measures: Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed under IFRS and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. These measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under IFRS. Other companies may calculate these measures differently. For a reconciliation of these measures to various IFRS measures, please see below or the Company's current MD&A disclosure found on the Company's website, on SEDAR and on EDGAR. GEOs include our gold, platinum, palladium, silver and other mineral assets. GEOs are estimated on a gross basis for NSR royalties and, in the case of stream ounces, before the payment of the per ounce contractual price paid by the Company. For NPI royalties, GEOs are calculated taking into account the NPI economics. Platinum, palladium, silver and other minerals were converted to GEOs by dividing associated revenue, which includes settlement adjustments, by the average gold price for the period. For Q1 2015, the average commodity prices were as follows: $1,219/oz gold (2014 - $1,294/oz); $1,193/oz platinum (2014 - $1,428/oz), $16.71/oz silver (2014 - $20.49/oz) and $786/oz palladium (2014 - $744/oz). Adjusted Net Income is defined by the Company as net income (loss) excluding foreign exchange gains/losses, gains/losses on the sale of investments, impairment charges related to royalties, streams, working interests and investments, unusual non-recurring items, and the impact of taxes on all these items. Adjusted EBITDA is defined by the Company as net income (loss) excluding income tax expense/recovery, finance income and expenses, foreign exchange gains/losses, gains/losses on the sale of investments, depletion and depreciation, non-cash costs of sales and impairment charges related to royalties, streams, working interests and investments.

Goldcorp achieved positive free cash flows of $174 million, compared to negative free cash flows of $(240) million in 2014. At June 30, 2015, the Company held $940 million of cash and cash equivalents, money market investments of $54 million and had $2.2 billion undrawn on its $3 billion revolving credit facility. The Company has included non-GAAP performance measures on an attributable (or Goldcorp's share) basis throughout this document. Attributable performance measures include the Company's mining operations, including its discontinued operation, and projects, and the Company's share of Alumbrera and Pueblo Viejo. The Company believes that disclosing certain performance measures on an attributable basis is a more relevant measurement of the Company's operating and economic performance, and reflects the Company's view of its core mining operations. The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, the Company and certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company's performance and ability to generate cash flow; however, these performance measures do not have any standardized meaning. Accordingly, it is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company has included non-GAAP performance measures - total cash costs, by-product and co-product, per gold ounce, throughout this document. In the gold mining industry, total cash costs is a common performance measure but does not have any standardized meaning. The Company follows the recommendations of the Gold Institute Production Cost Standard. The Gold Institute, which ceased operations in 2002, was a non-regulatory body and represented a global group of suppliers of gold and gold products. The production cost standard developed by the Gold Institute remains the generally accepted standard of reporting cash costs of production by gold mining companies. In addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, the Company assesses this measure in a manner that isolates the impacts of gold production volumes, the by-product credits, and operating costs fluctuations such that the non-controllable and controllable variability is independently addressed. The Company uses total cash costs, by-product and co-product, per gold ounce, to monitor its operating performance internally, including operating cash costs, as well as in its assessment of potential development projects and acquisition targets. The Company believes these measures provide investors and analysts with useful information about the Company's underlying cash costs of operations and the impact of by-product credits on the Company's cost structure and is a relevant metric used to understand the Company's operating profitability and ability to generate cash flow. When deriving the production cash costs associated with an ounce of gold, the Company includes by-product credits as the Company considers that the cost to produce the gold is reduced as a result of the by-product sales incidental to the gold production process, thereby allowing the Company's management and other stakeholders to assess the net costs of gold production. The Company and certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company's performance and ability to generate cash flow. Accordingly, it is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Total cash costs on a by-product basis are calculated by deducting Goldcorp's share of by-product silver, copper, lead and zinc sales revenues from Goldcorp's share of production costs. Total cash costs on a co-product basis are calculated by allocating Goldcorp's share of production costs to each co-product based on the ratio of actual sales volumes multiplied by budget metal prices, as compared to realized sales prices. The Company uses budget prices to eliminate price volatility and improve co-product cash cost reporting comparability between periods. If silver, lead and zinc for Penasquito, silver for Marlin, Cerro Negro and Pueblo Viejo, and copper for Alumbrera and Pueblo Viejo were treated as co-products, Goldcorp's share of total co-product cash costs, including discontinued operations, for the three months ended June 30, 2015, would be $656 per ounce of gold, $8.24 per ounce of silver, $4.20 per pound of copper, $0.64 per pound of zinc, and $0.59 per pound of lead (June 30, 2014 - $643 per ounce of gold, $9.85 per ounce of silver, $2.56 per pound of copper, $0.70 per pound of zinc and $0.92 per pound of lead). Using actual realized sales prices, co-product total cash costs, including discontinued operations, would be $664 per gold ounce for the three months ended June 30, 2015 (June 30, 2014 - $649). Refer to page 38 for a reconciliation of total cash costs to reported production costs. All-in sustaining costs and all-in costs are non-GAAP performance measures that the Company believes more fully define the total costs associated with producing gold; however, these performance measures have no standardized meaning. Accordingly, it is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company reports these measures on a gold ounces sold basis. The Company's all-in sustaining and all-in cost definitions conform to the guidance note released by the World Gold Council, which became effective January 1, 2014. The World Gold Council is a non-regulatory market development organization for the gold industry whose members comprise global senior gold mining companies. Refer to page 39 for a reconciliation of all-in sustaining costs. Adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share are non-GAAP performance measures. The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, the Company and certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company's performance. Accordingly, it is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Refer to page 41 for a reconciliation of adjusted net earnings to reported net earnings attributable to shareholders of Goldcorp. Adjusted operating cash flows is a non-GAAP performance measure which comprises Goldcorp's share of operating cash flows before working capital changes and which the Company believes provides additional information about the Company's ability to generate cash flows from its mining operations. Accordingly, it is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Refer to page 42 for a reconciliation of adjusted operating cash flows before working capital changes to reported net cash provided by operating activities. Free cash flows is a non-GAAPperformance measure which the Company believes, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, the Company and certain investors use to evaluate the Company's ability to generate cashflows. Accordingly, it is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Free cash flows are calculated by deducting from net cash provided by operating activities, Goldcorp's share of expenditures on mining interests, deposits on mining interest expenditures and capitalized interest paid, and adding Goldcorp's share of net cash provided by operating activities from Alumbrera and Pueblo Viejo. Refer to page 42 for a reconciliation of free cash flows to reported net cash provided by operating activities. OVERVIEW Goldcorp is a leading gold producer engaged in the operation, exploration, development, and acquisition of precious metal properties in Canada, the United States, Mexico, and Central and South America. The Company's current sources of operating cash flows are primarily from the sale of gold, silver, copper, lead and zinc. Goldcorp is one of the world's fastest growing senior gold producers. Goldcorp's strategy is to provide its shareholders with superior returns from high quality assets. Goldcorp has a strong balance sheet. Its low-cost gold production is located in safe jurisdictions in the Americas and remains 100% unhedged. Goldcorp is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (symbol: GG) and the Toronto Stock Exchange (symbol: G). At June 30, 2015, the Company's principal producing mining properties were comprised of the Red Lake, Porcupine, Musselwhite and Eleonore gold mines in Canada; the Penasquito gold/silver/lead/zinc mine and the Los Filos gold mine in Mexico; the Marlin gold/silver mine in Guatemala; the Cerro Negro gold/silver mine and the Alumbrera gold/copper mine (37.5% interest) in Argentina; and the Pueblo Viejo gold/silver/copper mine (40.0% interest) in the Dominican Republic. The Cerro Negro gold/silver mine and the Eleonore gold mine achieved commercial production effective January 1, 2015 and April 1, 2015, respectively. On March 13, 2015, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of Probe Mines Ltd. (\"Probe\"), which owns the Borden gold project in Canada. The Company's significant development projects at June 30, 2015 included the Borden and Cochenour gold projects in Canada; the Camino Rojo gold/silver project in Mexico; and the El Morro gold/copper project (70.0% interest) in Chile. On June 30, 2015, the Company disposed of its 25.9% equity interest in Tahoe Resources Inc. (\"Tahoe\") which was previously recognized as an investment in an associate. The Wharf and Marigold gold mines in the United States were sold on February 20, 2015 and April 4, 2014, respectively, and have been classified as discontinued operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014. The Company realized an average gold price of $1,189 per ounce during the second quarter of 2015 compared to $1,217 per ounce during the first quarter of 2015. The decrease in the realized average gold price was a result of ongoing negative sentiment in the market concerning the impact of an expected interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve before year end. The gold price traded between $1,165 and $1,225 per ounce during the second quarter of 2015; closing at the lower end of the range. Also impacting prices for the metal during the second quarter was lower physical demand from both India and China, as a result of lower than expected monsoon rains, and instability in the Chinese share market, respectively. Gold production for the second quarter of 2015 was 908,000 ounces, an increase of 183,200 ounces, or 25%, from the first quarter of 2015. Gold production for 2015 is expected to be weighted to the second half of the year due primarily to the new mine ramp-ups and the planned mine sequence at Penasquito. Record production of 298,000 gold ounces was achieved at Penasquito, a 142,400 ounce, or 92%, increase compared to the first quarter, due to higher sulphide grades as a result of an 18.5% positive model reconciliation realized from mining in Phase 5C in the heart of the deposit. Cerro Negro and Eleonore increased production by 38,700 gold ounces and 11,300 ounces, respectively, as both mines continued to ramp up operations. Eleonore focused on water effluent quality, stoping productivity and grade variability over the second quarter of 2015. During the quarter Eleonore resolved the remaining issues relating to the water effluent quality and continued to improve stoping productivity and mining flexibility. The ore grade variability is now within expectations based on the additional studies that have been performed. At Cochenour, intersected gold grades remain consistent with expectations; however recent drill data and newly discovered mineralized zones indicate a change in orientation of a portion of the veins compared to the existing model. Additional advanced exploration and analysis is required to support final mine planning and infrastructure. Processing of mill feed from the first test stopes is expected in the fourth quarter of 2015. All-in sustaining costs of $846 per ounce for the second quarter of 2015 decreased 4% from $885 per ounce for the first quarter of 2015 due to higher gold sales volumes, primarily as a result of the record production at Penasquito in the second quarter and Eleonore achieving commercial production on April 1, 2015, partially offset by increased production costs as Eleonore and Cerro Negro continue to ramp up. Goldcorp achieved positive free cash flow of $174 million for the second quarter of 2015 as compared to negative cash flow of $360 million in the first quarter. With the completion of a major capital spending campaign as Cerro Negro and Eleonore achieved commercial production in 2015, free cash flows increased in the second quarter as cash flows from operations were positively impacted with the ramp up of these operations and record production from Penasquito. Additionally, the Company's expenditures and deposits on mining interests decreased by $80 million, or 20%, compared to the first quarter following completion of the project expenditures at Eleonore and Cerro Negro. CORPORATE DEVELOPMENTS Sale of Tahoe: On June 30, 2015, the Company completed its divestiture of its 25.9% investment in Tahoe following completion of a secondary offering. A total of 58,051,692 Tahoe common shares beneficially held by Goldcorp were sold at an offering price of C$17.20 per share for gross proceeds of approximately C$998 million ($800 million). Extension of Credit Facility: On June 11, 2015, the Company announced that it had increased its credit facility from $2.0 billion to $3.0 billion and extended the term to June 10, 2020, under existing terms and conditions.

REVIEW OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION Three Months Ended June 30, 2015 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2014 Net earnings attributable to shareholders of Goldcorp for the second quarter of 2015 was $392 million, or $0.47 per share, compared to net earnings attributable to shareholders of Goldcorp of $181 million, or $0.22 per share, for the second quarter of 2014. Compared to the second quarter of 2014, the net earnings attributable to shareholders of Goldcorp for the three months ended June 30, 2015 was impacted by the following factors: Revenues increased by $304 million, or 34%, due to a $304 million increase in gold revenues as a result of higher gold sales volumes, primarily due to Cerro Negro and Eleonore achieving commercial production in 2015, resulting in all proceeds from sales being recognized as revenues, and record production at Penasquito in the second quarter of 2015. The positive impact of increased gold sales volumes was partially offset by lower realized gold prices; Production costs increased by $146 million, or 30%, primarily due to Cerro Negro and Eleonore achieving commercial production on January 1, 2015 and April 1, 2015, respectively. Excluding the impact of those mines, production costs decreased by $23 million due to El Sauzal entering reclamation in 2015, a $17 million decrease in reclamation and closure costs at the Company's inactive and closed sites, and the favourable impact of the strengthening US dollar; Depreciation and depletion increased by $178 million, or 100%, due to Cerro Negro and Eleonore achieving commercial production, a higher depletion rate at Marlin resulting from a reduction of proven and probable gold reserves due to the impact of the 10% mining royalty effective January 1, 2015, new assets put into service at Penasquito and higher sales volumes; An $8 million increase in exploration expense, primarily arising from drilling focused on HG Young at Red Lake; The Company's share of net losses of associates of $19 million for the second quarter of 2015 was primarily comprised of net losses of $8 million and $7 million from Pueblo Viejo and Alumbrera, respectively. The Company's share of net losses from Pueblo Viejo was impacted by a $15 million, after tax, impairment expense recognized on certain power assets. In the second quarter of 2014, the Company's share of net earnings from associates was $60 million, comprised of $45 million and $6 million from Pueblo Viejo and Alumbrera, respectively, and $9 million of net earnings from the Company's investment in Tahoe; Corporate administration, excluding share-based compensation expense, was $38 million, a $5 million decrease as compared to the second quarter of 2014, primarily due to the favourable impact of the weakening Canadian dollar. Share-based compensation expense was $15 million for the second quarter of 2015, a decrease of $1 million compared to the second quarter of 2014 primarily due to a decrease in value of the Company's performance share units (\"PSUs\") and phantom share units; An $8 million gain on derivatives in the second quarter of 2015 comprised of net gains on foreign currency, heating oil and commodity contracts. In the second quarter of 2014, an $11 million net gain on derivatives was comprised of a $9 million net gain on foreign currency, heating oil and commodity contracts; a $1 million unrealized gain on the conversion feature of the $863 million convertible senior notes which were repaid upon maturity during the third quarter of 2014; and a $1 million net gain on the Company's contract to sell 1.5 million ounces of silver to Silver Wheaton at a fixed price over each of the four years ended August 5, 2014; A $99 million gain ($95 million, net of tax) on dilution of the Company's investment in Tahoe to 25.9% on April 1, 2015 as a result of Tahoe's acquisition of Rio Alto Mining Ltd (\"Rio Alto\"); A$315 million gain on disposition of mining interests in the second quarter of 2015 arising on the disposition of the Company's remaining 25.9% investment in Tahoe on June 30, 2015 for a total gain of $299 million ($252 million, net of tax), and the sale of the Arturo project for which the Company recognized a gain of $16 million ($11 million, net of tax); Finance costs increased by $32 million primarily due to interest expense on the Company's borrowings that is no longer eligible for capitalization as a result of commercial production being achieved at Cerro Negro and Eleonore; Other income increased by $3 million for the second quarter of 2015 and included interest income arising on the Company's cash and cash equivalent and loans held with Pueblo Viejo, insurance recoveries of $3 million and foreign exchange gains on accounts payable and debt denominated in Mexican and Argentine pesos, and Canadian dollars, partially offset by foreign exchange losses on value added tax receivables denominated in Mexican and Argentine pesos, and cash and cash equivalents denominated in Canadian dollars; Income tax expense for the three months ended June 30, 2015 totaled $90 million (three months ended June 30, 2014 - income tax expense of $13 million) and was primarily impacted by: A $22 million foreign exchange loss on the translation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities arising primarily from the Placer Dome and Glamis acquisitions in 2006 and the Camino Rojo and Cerro Negro acquisitions in 2010, compared to a $24 million foreign exchange gain in the second quarter of 2014. The foreign exchange related deferred income tax impacts resulted from the weakening Mexican and Argentine Peso and the strengthening Canadian dollar (three months ended June 30, 2014 - strengthening Mexican peso and Canadian dollar, and weakening Argentine Peso); A$51 million deferred income tax expense arising on the disposition of Company's investment in Tahoe in the second quarter of 2015; and A lower effective tax rate in the second quarter of 2015, after adjusting for the above noted items and the non-deductible share-based compensation expense. The second quarter of 2015 was favourably impacted by the elimination of the Ontario Resource Tax Credit and an increase in the tax deductible foreign exchanges losses on US dollar denominated debt in Argentina. These favourable impacts were partially offset by non-deductible net losses from associates for the second quarter of 2015, compared to non-taxable net income for the second quarter of 2014. Net loss from discontinued operations of $6 million for the second quarter of 2015 comprised of a deferred tax impact arising on the disposition of Wharf which was sold on February 20, 2015. Net loss from discontinued operations for the second quarter of 2014 of $11 million was comprised of $19 million of net losses from the Company's 66.7% share of Marigold, which was sold on April 4, 2014, partially offset by $8 million of net earnings from Wharf. Adjusted net earnings amounted to $65 million, or $0.08 per share, for the three months ended June 30, 2015, compared to $164 million, or $0.20 per share, for the second quarter of 2014. Compared to the second quarter of 2014, adjusted net earnings were impacted by higher production costs, increased depreciation and depletion expense and lower gold and silver realized prices, partially offset by higher sales volumes. Total cash costs (by-product) increased to $547 per gold ounce, in the second quarter of 2015, as compared to $470 per gold ounce in the second quarter of 2014. The higher cash costs was primarily due to higher production costs following achievement of commercial production at Cerro Negro and Eleonore in 2015 and a decrease in by-product copper and silver sales credits due to lower copper sales volumes and lower silver realized prices, partially offset by higher gold sales volumes and the favourable impact of the strengthening US dollar. Adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share are non-GAAP performance measures. The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, the Company and certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company's performance. Accordingly, it is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Refer to page 41 for a reconciliation of adjusted net earnings to reported net earnings (loss) attributable to shareholders of Goldcorp. The Company has included non-GAAP performance measures - total cash costs, by-product and co-product, per gold ounce, throughout this document. In the gold mining industry, total cash costs is a common performance measure but does not have any standardized meaning. The Company follows the recommendations of the Gold Institute Production Cost Standard. The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, the Company and certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company's performance and ability to generate cash flow. Accordingly, it is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Total cash costs on a by-product basis are calculated by deducting Goldcorp's share of by-product silver, copper, lead and zinc sales revenues from Goldcorp's share of production costs. Refer to page 38 for a reconciliation of total cash costs to reported production costs. REVIEW OF QUARTERLY FINANCIAL RESULTS - Three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2015 Net earnings attributable to shareholders of Goldcorp for the second quarter of 2015 was $392 million, or $0.47 per share, compared to a net loss attributable to shareholders of Goldcorp of $(87) million, or $(0.11) per share, for the first quarter of 2015. Compared to the prior quarter, the net earnings attributable to shareholders of Goldcorp for the three months ended June 30, 2015 was impacted by the following factors: Revenues increased by $171 million, or 17%, due to a $158 million increase in gold revenues and a $19 million increase in lead and zinc revenues, net of refining charges, partially offset by a $5 million decrease in silver revenues. Gold, lead and zinc revenues increased due to higher sales volumes, primarily at Penasquito, which saw record production during the second quarter, and Eleonore achieving commercial production on April 1, 2015; Production costs increased by $20 million, or 3%, primarily due to Eleonore achieving commercial production, partially offset by the first quarter being negatively impacted by a $22 million expense arising from revisions to reclamation and closure cost estimates at the Company's inactive and closed mines, and the favourable foreign exchange effect of the strengthening US dollar; Depreciation and depletion increased by $34 million, or 11%, primarily due to depreciation and depletion associated with Eleonore's first quarter of commercial production and higher sales volumes; The Company's share of net losses of associates of $19 million for the second quarter of 2015 was primarily comprised of net losses of $8 million and $7 million from Pueblo Viejo and Alumbrera, respectively. The Company's share of net losses from Pueblo Viejo was impacted by a $15 million, after tax, impairment expense recognized on certain power assets. The Company's share of net earnings from associates of $35 million in the prior quarter was comprised of net earnings of $28 million and $12 million from Pueblo Viejo and Tahoe, respectively, partially offset by a net loss from Alumbrera of $5 million; An $8 million gain on derivatives for the second quarter of 2015 comprised of net gains on foreign currency, heating oil, and commodity contracts, compared to a $42 million loss on foreign currency, heating oil and commodity contracts in the first quarter of 2015; A $99 million gain ($95 million, net of tax) on dilution of the Company's investment in Tahoe to 25.9% on April 1, 2015 as a result of Tahoe's acquisition of Rio Alto; A$315 million gain on disposition of mining interests in the second quarter of 2015 arising on the disposition of the Company's remaining 25.9% investment in Tahoe on June 30, 2015 for a total gain of $299 million ($252 million, net of tax), and the sale of the Arturo project for which the Company recognized a gain of $16 million ($11 million, net of tax); Finance costs increased by $16 million primarily due to interest expense that is no longer eligible for capitalization as a result of Eleonore achieving commercial production; Other income of $3 million for the second quarter of 2015 included interest income arising on the Company's cash and cash equivalent and loans held with Pueblo Viejo, insurance recoveries of $3 million and foreign exchange gains on accounts payable and debt denominated in Mexican and Argentine pesos, and Canadian dollars, partially offset by foreign exchange losses on value added tax receivables denominated in Mexican and Argentine pesos, and cash and cash equivalents denominated in Canadian dollars. Other income of $18 million in the first quarter of 2015 was primarily comprised of a $15 million net foreign exchange gain driven by the weakening of the Canadian dollar and Mexican and Argentine peso. Income tax expense for the three months ended June 30, 2015 totaled $90 million (three months ended March 31, 2015 - income tax expense of $129 million) and was primarily impacted by: A $22 million foreign exchange loss on the translation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities arising primarily from the Placer Dome and Glamis acquisitions in 2006 and the Camino Rojo and Cerro Negro acquisitions in 2010, compared to a $122 million foreign exchange loss in the first quarter of 2015. The foreign exchange related deferred income tax impacts resulted from the weakening Mexican and Argentine Peso and the strengthening Canadian dollar (three months ended March 31, 2015 - weakening Mexican peso, Argentine peso and Canadian dollar); A$51 million deferred income tax expense arising on the disposition of Company's investment in Tahoe in the second quarter of 2015; and Alower effective tax rate compared to the first quarter of 2015 after adjusting for the above noted items and the non-deductible share-based compensation expense. The second quarter of 2015 was favourably impacted by the elimination of the Ontario Resource Tax Credit and lower non-deductible costs than incurred in the first quarter of 2015. These favourable impacts were partially offset by non-deductible net losses from associates for the second quarter of 2015, compared to non-taxable net income for the first quarter of 2015. Net loss from discontinued operations of $6 million for the second quarter of 2015 comprised of a deferred tax impact arising on the disposition of Wharf which was sold on February 20, 2015. Net earnings from discontinued operations of $52 million for the first quarter of 2015 was comprised of the $49 million net gain on the sale of Wharf and $3 million of net earnings of Wharf until February 20, 2015, the date of disposition. Adjusted net earnings amounted to $65 million, or $0.08 per share (1) , for the three months ended June 30, 2015, compared to $12 million, or $0.01 per share, for the first quarter of 2015.Compared to the prior quarter, adjusted net earnings increased due to higher gold, lead and zinc revenues, partially offset by increased production costs and depreciation and depletion. Total cash costs (by-product) were $547 per gold ounce (2) , in the second quarter of 2015, as compared to $585 per gold ounce in the prior quarter. The decrease in cash costs per ounce was primarily due to increased gold sales volumes and higher lead and zinc by-product credits as a result of increased sales volumes, partially offset by lower gold and silver realized prices and higher production costs. Adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share are non-GAAP performance measures. The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, the Company and certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company's performance. Accordingly, it is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Refer to page 41 for a reconciliation of adjusted net earnings to reported net loss attributable to shareholders of Goldcorp. The Company has included non-GAAP performance measures - total cash costs, by-product and co-product, per gold ounce, throughout this document. In the gold mining industry, total cash costs is a common performance measure but does not have any standardized meaning. The Company follows the recommendations of the Gold Institute Production Cost Standard. The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, the Company and certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company's performance and ability to generate cash flow. Accordingly, it is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Total cash costs on a by-product basis are calculated by deducting Goldcorp's share of by-product silver, copper, lead and zinc sales revenues from Goldcorp's share of production costs. Refer to page 38 for a reconciliation of total cash costs to reported production costs. Six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2014 Net earnings attributable to shareholders of Goldcorp for the six months ended June 30, 2015 were $305 million, or $0.37 per share, compared to net earnings attributable to shareholders of Goldcorp of $279 million, or $0.34 per share, for the six months ended June 30, 2014. Compared to the six months ended June 30, 2014, net earnings attributable to shareholders of Goldcorp for the six months ended June 30, 2015 were impacted by the following factors: Revenues increased by $443 million, or 25%, due to a $459 million increase in gold revenues, partially offset by a $16 million decrease in silver, lead and copper revenues. The increase in gold revenues was primarily due to Eleonore and Cerro Negro achieving commercial production in 2015 and increased sales volumes from Penasquito, partially offset by lower realized gold prices; Production costs increased by $279 million, or 28%, primarily due to Cerro Negro and Eleonore achieving commercial production in 2015. Excluding the impact of those mines, production costs decreased by $27 million due to the favourable impact of the strengthening US dollar and El Sauzal entering reclamation in 2015; Depreciation and depletion increased by $331 million, or 95%, due to Cerro Negro and Eleonore achieving commercial production, a higher depletion rate at Marlin resulting from a reduction of proven and probable gold reserves and higher sales volumes; An $11 million increase in exploration expense, primarily arising from drilling focused on HG Young at Red Lake; The Company's share of net earnings of associates of $16 million was primarily comprised of net earnings of $20 million from Pueblo Viejo, which was impacted by a $15 million impairment expense arising on certain power assets and a net loss of $12 million from Alumbrera. The Company's share of net earnings of associates of $116 million in the six months ended June 30, 2014 was comprised of $76 million of net earnings from Pueblo Viejo, which included a $6 million reversal of impairment expense previously recognized, $18 million of net earnings from Alumbrera and net earnings of $22 million from the Company's equity investments in Tahoe and Primero. The Company sold its investment in Primero on March 26, 2014; Corporate administration, excluding share-based compensation expense, was $78 million, a decrease of $7 million from the comparative 2014 period primarily due to the favourable impact of the weaker Canadian dollar. Share-based compensation expense of $30 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014 was $10 million lower than in the six months ended June 30, 2014 due to a decrease in the fair value of the Company's PSUs; A $34 million net loss on derivatives for the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to an $8 million net gain on derivatives in the comparative period, comprising realized and unrealized gains and losses on the Company's foreign currency, heating oil and commodity contracts; A $99 million gain ($95 million, net of tax) on dilution of the Company's investment in Tahoe to 25.9% on April 1, 2015 as a result of Tahoe's acquisition of Rio Alto; A$315 million gain on disposition of mining interests in the second quarter of 2015 arising on the disposition of the Company's remaining 25.9% investment in Tahoe on June 30, 2015 for a total gain of $299 million ($252 million, net of tax), and the sale of the Arturo project for which the Company recognized a gain of $16 million ($11 million, net of tax). An $18 million net gain on disposition of mining interests was recognized in the comparative period, arising on disposition of the Company's investment in Primero; Finance costs increased by $43 million primarily due to interest expense that is no longer eligible for capitalization as a result of Cerro Negro and Eleonore achieving commercial production; Other income of $21 million comprised mainly of interest income arising on the Company's cash and cash equivalent and loans held with Pueblo Viejo and foreign exchange gains on accounts payable and debt denominated in Mexican and Argentine pesos, and Canadian dollars, partially offset by foreign exchange losses on value added tax receivables denominated in Mexican and Argentine pesos, and cash and cash equivalents denominated in Canadian dollars. Other expense of $22 million in the comparative period was primarily comprised of foreign exchange losses; Income tax expense for the six months ended June 30, 2015 totaled $219 million (six months ended June 30, 2014 - income tax expense of $102 million) and was primarily impacted by: A $144 million foreign exchange loss on the translation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities arising primarily from the Placer Dome and Glamis acquisitions in 2006 and the Camino Rojo and Cerro Negro acquisitions in 2010, compared to a $82 million foreign exchange loss for the six months ended June 30, 2014. The foreign exchange related deferred income tax impacts resulted from the weakening Mexican Peso, Argentine Peso and Canadian dollar (six months ended June 30, 2014 - weakening Canadian dollar and Argentine Peso, and strengthening Mexican peso); A$51 million deferred income tax expense arising on the disposition of Company's investment in Tahoe in the second quarter of 2015; and A higher effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2015, after adjusting income taxes for the above noted items and the non-deductible share-based compensation expense, as a result of a decrease in the tax deductible foreign exchange losses on US dollar denominated debt in Argentina, lower income from associates not being subject to tax and the gain on sale of Primero in the first quarter of 2014 not being subject to tax. These unfavourable items were partially offset by the favourable impact from the elimination of the Ontario Resource Tax Credit. Net earnings from discontinued operations of $46 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 comprised of a $43 million net gain on the sale of Wharf and $3 million of net earnings of Wharf until February 20, 2015, the date of disposition. Anet loss from discontinued operations of $2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014 included a $15 million net loss recognized on the sale of the Company's 66.7% share of Marigold, which was classified as a discontinued operation during 2014 and $13 million net earnings from Wharf. Adjusted net earnings amounted to $77 million, or $0.09 per share, for the six months ended June 30, 2015, compared to $373 million, or $0.46 per share, for the six months ended June 30, 2014. Compared to the six months ended June 30, 2014, adjusted net earnings decreased due to higher production costs and depreciation and depletion expense, partially offset by increased revenues primarily resulting from higher sales volumes. Total cash costs (by-product) increased to $565 per gold ounce (2) , for the six months ended June 30, 2015, as compared to $490 per gold ounce for the six months ended June 30, 2014. The increase in cash costs was primarily due to higher production costs due to Cerro Negro and Eleonore achieving commercial production in 2015, lower realized gold prices and a decrease in by-product sales credits due to lower realized silver, copper and lead prices and lower copper volumes, partially offset by higher gold sales volumes. Adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share are non-GAAP performance measures. The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, the Company and certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company's performance. Accordingly, it is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Mission To create sustainable value through increased commodity exposure on a per share basis, in high-quality and growing long-life deposits in mining-friendly jurisdictions. Competitive Strengths Growth in copper, gold and zinc production with exploration upside Consistent performance from reliable operations Disciplined and clear growth strategy already being executed Strong financial position Experienced management and operating team Hudbay Releases Second Quarter 2015 Results TORONTO, ONTARIO -- (Marketwired) -- 07/29/15 -- HudBay Minerals Inc. (\"Hudbay\" or the \"company\") (TSX: HBM)(NYSE:HBM) today released its second quarter 2015 financial results. In the second quarter of 2015, operating cash flow before stream deposit and change in non-cash working capital increased to $20.7 million from $11.8 millionin the second quarter of 2014. The net loss and loss per share in the second quarter of 2015 were $55.2 million and $0.24, respectively, compared to net income and income per share of $0.3 million and nil, respectively, in the second quarter of 2014. Net loss and loss per share in the second quarter of 2015 were affected by, among other things. The Constancia mine commenced production in December 2014, and achieved commercial production on April 30, 2015. Ocean shipments began in April 2015, and the mine and concentrator are currently processing ore at or above design capacity. Hudbay expects to achieve full year 2015 production and operating cost guidance for all of its operations. Financial and Operating Results Cash flow from operations was positively impacted by increased revenue as a result of significant increases in production of all metals as the Constancia mine achieved commercial production at the end of April 2015. Copper, gold, silver and zinc production increased by 270%, 37%, 301% and 9%, respectively, in the second quarter of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. In addition, cash costs per pound of copper produced, net of by-product credits, declined by 37% compared to the same period in 2014, to US$1.29. The business benefited from slightly higher production volumes in Manitoba, weaker local currencies, lower energy and other input costs and the achievement of commercial production from the large-scale Constancia mine during the second quarter. While improved when compared to the prior year, cash flow from operations and net earnings were negatively impacted by unsold copper, gold, and silver during the quarter. At quarter end, Hudbay had approximately 73,100 tonnes of unsold copper concentrate containing 19,200 tonnes of copper, 30,300 ounces of gold and 579,300 ounces of silver. Shipments from the Constancia mine to the port in Matarani were constrained during May and June by several factors including truck availability, protests along the lower part of the trucking route, unrelated to Constancia, and road refurbishment activities along the route that increased cycle times for concentrate trucks. Steps have been taken to increase the size of the trucking fleet, and the excess inventory is expected to be drawn down over the second half of 2015. In addition, limitations on rail service resulted in a continued build up of copper concentrate inventory in Manitoba. However, additional leased rail cars are expected to enter service during the third quarter which is expected to draw down inventory levels. Also, cash flow from operations was negatively affected by a $10.5 million increase in cash taxes, when compared to the prior year's quarter, as gross profit, before depreciation and the non-cash pension expense, increased by 68% to $63.4 million. In addition to the pension expense resulting from pension enhancements agreed to as part of the Manitoba collective bargaining process and the Lalor concentrator impairment charge, net earnings were also negatively affected by higher depreciation resulting from commercial production at Constancia and Lalor, and higher interest expense as interest related to the Constancia project is no longer being capitalized. Recent Developments On May 4, 2015, Hudbay closed a transaction to acquire a 100% interest in the New Britannia mine and mill, located in Snow Lake, Manitoba. While there are presently no plans to bring the New Britannia mine back into production, based on its initial review, Hudbay believes the New Britannia mill (the \"NBM Mill\"), if refurbished, has the potential to process approximately 2,000 tonnes per day of gold zone ore from the Lalor mine. As a result of the acquisition of the NBM Mill, Hudbay no longer plans to construct a new concentrator at Lalor, and during the three months ended June 30, 2015, an impairment loss of $24.6 million related to its Lalor concentrator assets was recognized. Hudbay has received commitments from its current lenders to increase the size of its corporate revolving credit facility from US$300 million to US$400 million. The upsized credit facility will be on substantially similar terms to the existing revolving credit facility and will be repayable in March 2018. Hudbay expects to complete definitive documentation for the credit facility amendments during the third quarter of 2015. The collective agreements with each of the seven labour unions representing employees at the Manitoba business unit expired on December 31, 2014. The members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, Local No. 1848 have been on strike since May 2, 2015. The other six unions, representing approximately 88% of Hudbay's employees in Manitoba, have ratified new three year agreements. The Manitoba operations continue to operate under a comprehensive contingency plan. A semi-annual dividend of $0.01 per share was declared on July 29, 2015. The dividend will be paid on September 30, 2015 to shareholders of record as of September 11, 2015. Peru Operations Review Mining operations continue to progress as planned and cost optimization is underway. Equipment availabilities are within design parameters and both loading and hauling efficiencies are consistent with expectations. Optimization of plant performance was a primary focus in the later part of the second quarter of 2015 in response to normal ramp up challenges regarding ore blending and recoveries. Coordination among the mine planning, mine operations and plant operations groups has resulted in progress, and recoveries are now in line with expectations. Daily ore throughput continues to meet ramp-up milestones. Since the end of the second quarter, daily ore throughput has averaged approximately 80,000 tonnes and copper recoveries have averaged approximately 75%. Commissioning of the molybdenum flotation circuit commenced late in the second quarter of 2015, and ramp up of production is planned during the third quarter. Manitoba Operations Review For the second quarter of 2015, ore processed was 3% higher compared to the same period of 2014 primarily as a result of increased production at Lalor partially offset by lower production at the 777 mine. Compared to the second quarter of 2014, zinc and gold grades were 7% and 11% higher, and copper and silver grades were 7% and 17% lower as a result of normal mine sequencing. Recoveries of zinc and gold in the second quarter of 2015 were consistent with the same period of 2014, and recoveries of copper and silver in the second quarter of 2015 were 4% and 13% higher compared to the same period of 2014 as a result of higher copper ore grades received by the Flin Flon concentrator. Combined operating costs per tonne of ore processed in the second quarter of 2015 were 25% higher, compared to the same period in 2014, primarily due to increased production at the Snow Lake operations which have higher unit costs, as well as increased unit costs at the Flin Flon operations resulting from decreased production at the 777 mine. Year-to-date ore processed was 9% higher than the same period in 2014 as a result of increased production from Lalor and Reed. Year-to-date copper, zinc and gold grades were 5%, 4% and 6% higher, respectively, and silver grades were 15% lower compared to the same period of 2014 as a result of normal mine sequencing. Year-to-date recoveries of copper, zinc and gold were consistent with the same period of 2014. Recoveries of silver were 14% higher compared to the same period of 2014 as a result of higher copper ore grades received by the Flin Flon concentrator. Combined operating costs per tonne of ore processed year-to-date in 2015 were 17% higher, compared to the same period in 2014, primarily due to the same factors that affected second quarter production and costs. Lalor Copper-Gold Zone Exploration Results The Phase 1 copper-gold zone drill program at Lalor included a total of 14 holes (totalling approximately 4,500 metres) drilled from the 1,025 metre level; assay results from seven holes were released with Hudbay's first quarter results in May. Assay results from the remaining seven holes are shown in the table on the following page and were similar to those from previous holes, confirming a high grade thick core down the middle of the main zone with decreasing grade and thickness towards the contacts, as well as separate hanging wall and footwall mineralization. The Phase 2 exploration ramp extension to the north, which will allow testing of the copper-gold zones down plunge, and step out drilling to the east and west, is progressing well and is expected to be complete by the end of August. Drilling from the Phase 2 exploration ramp is anticipated to commence in September 2015 with approximately 8,500 metres of drilling planned. The Phase 2 portion of the ramp development continues to maintain a drift size capable of accommodating future mine equipment and related infrastructure for mining the copper-gold zones. Conversion to US Dollar Reporting Following the declaration of commercial production at Constancia, Hudbay has determined that, effective July 1, 2015, the appropriate functional currency of its corporate entity has changed from Canadian dollars to US dollars. In addition, Hudbay intends to change its reporting currency to US dollars effective with the financial reports for the three and nine months ending September 30, 2015. Non-IFRS Financial Performance Measures Operating cash flow per share and cash cost per pound of copper produced are included in this news release because the company believes that, in the case of operating cash flow per share, it helps investors and management to evaluate changes in cash flow while taking into account changes in shares outstanding, and in the case of cash cost per pound of copper produced, it helps investors assess the performance of the company's operations. These measures do not have a meaning prescribed by IFRS and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with IFRS and are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under IFRS. Other companies may calculate these measures differently. Reconciliation of Cash Cost, After By-product Credits (non-IFRS) to Cost of Sales (IFRS) Cash cost per pound of copper produced (\"cash cost\") is a non-IFRS measure that management uses as a key performance indicator to assess the performance of the company's operations. Hudbay's calculation designates copper as its primary metal of production as it has been, and is expected to be, the largest component of revenues. Two changes have been made to the cash cost calculation beginning with the period ended June 30, 2015. First, the basis of measurement has been changed from pounds of copper sold to pounds of copper produced. This change has been made to better align the costs of production in the same period as the copper produced and reduce variation in cash cost due to inventory sales timing. Second, royalties have been removed from the cash cost. This change increases consistency between Hudbay's cash cost calculation and industry peers. The calculation is presented in two manners: Cash cost, before by-product credits - This measure is gross of by-product revenues and is a function of the efforts and costs incurred to mine and process all ore mined. However, the measure divides this aggregate cost over only pounds of copper produced, Hudbay's primary metal of production. This measure is generally less volatile from period to period, as it is not affected by changes in the price received for by-product metals. It is, however, significantly affected by the relative mix of copper concentrate and finished zinc production, and an increase in production of zinc metal will tend to result in an increase in cash costs under this measure. Cash cost, net of by-product credits - In order to calculate the cost to produce and sell copper, the net of by-product credits measure subtracts the revenues realized from the sale of the metals other than copper. The by-product revenues from zinc, gold, silver, and molybdenum are significant and are integral to the economics of Hudbay. The economics that support Hudbay's decision to produce and sell copper would be different if the company did not receive revenues from the other significant metals being extracted and processed. This measure provides management and investors with an indication of the minimum copper price consistent with positive operating cash flows and operating margins, assuming that realized by-product metal prices are consistent with those prevailing during the reporting period. It also serves as an important operating statistic that management and investors utilize to measure Hudbay's operating performance versus that of its competitors. However, it is important to understand that if by-product metal prices decline alongside copper prices, the cash cost net of by-product credits would increase, requiring a higher copper price than that reported to maintain positive cash flows and operating margins.

Lundin Mining Second Quarter Result TORONTO, ONTARIO--(Marketwired-July29, 2015)- LundinMining Corporation (TSX:LUN)(OMX:LUMI) (\"Lundin Mining\" or the \"Company\") today reported net earnings of $53.7 million or net earnings attributable to Lundin shareholders (after deducting non-controlling interests) of $46.4 million ($0.06 per share) for the quarter ended June 30, 2015. Cash flows of $262.7 million were generated from operations in the quarter, not including the Company's attributable cash flows from Tenke Fungurume. Earnings for the three month period included a full quarter of operating and financial results from Candelaria, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2014 and Eagle, which was commissioned in the same period. Candelaria and Eagle generated operating earnings of $141.3 million and $40.3 million, respectively, in the current quarter. Paul Conibear, President and CEO commented, \"With another strong operating quarter, the Company remains very well positioned to continue to deliver record levels of cash flow at good margins despite the current commodity price environment. Our strong year-to-date performance coupled with weaker local currencies, has once again enabled us to improve our annual cash cost guidance across several of our operations.\" \"We are also extremely pleased that several key milestones have recently been achieved at Candelaria, including the approval of the Environmental Impact Assessment (\"EIA\"), and the completion of an optimized mine plan. Through these important advancements, Lundin Mining is expected to continue to generate excellent shareholder value well into the future,\" added Mr. Conibear.

Net debt is a non-GAAP measure defined as cash and cash equivalents, less long-term debt and finance leases, before deferred financing fees. Neves-Corvo Zinc Expansion The Feasibility Study examining an expansion of the zinc operations at Neves-Corvo achieved substantial completion by quarter end. The scope of the study includes underground development of the lower Lombador zinc deposits, a major underground conveying system to take ore to the existing shaft, expansion of shaft capacity to 5.6 million tonnes per year, zinc plant expansion to 2.5 million tonnes per year ore throughput, and construction of expanded water treatment, paste backfill and tailings storage infrastructure. Maximum zinc production is nominally 165 ktpa with 25 ktpa of lead by-product. The estimated capital cost, including the first full year of underground development costs, is approximately EUR245 million. The project schedule is estimated to be approximately 24 months from approval to proceed through to commissioning of the expanded facilities. An investment decision on zinc expansion has been deferred pending additional work to improve the existing zinc plant metallurgical recoveries and plant stability, and pending improved metal markets. Lundin Mining Senior Organizational Changes The Company is pleased to announce that Peter M. Quinn, currently the President of Candelaria and Ojos Del Salado will assume the position of Chief Operating Officer of Lundin Mining effective August 1, 2015. Mr. Quinn has over 25 years of experience in the mining industry, overseeing all aspects of mining, leaching and concentrating processes in both open pit and underground operations. He commenced his career at Western Mining Corporation's Olympic Dam Operations in 1988 (now BHP Billiton) and subsequently gained experience in Newcrest Mining, Phelps Dodge, and Freeport -McMoRan before joining Lundin Mining in November 2014. Mr. Quinn has had major green-field project startup experiences with the Mt. Keith Nickel Project in Western Australia and the Cadia Hill Gold Mine Project in New South Wales, Australia and has extensive experience with operating large scale open pit mining operations such as the Morenci Mine Operations, Arizona USA and the Candelaria operations. Throughout his career Mr. Quinn has been a leader in safety and production efficiency, through organizational team building and people development and was recognized by CORESEMIN, Third Region de Atacama Premier Award for Safety Leadership in 2012. Mr. Quinn received his Bachelor of Engineering in mining engineering from the South Australian Institute of Technology. Following the successful completion of construction and ramp up of operations at the Eagle mine, General Manager Mike Welch will be transferring from the Eagle Mine to take up the role of General Manager at Neves-Corvo in August. Quarter Highlights Operational Performance For the second quarter of 2015, all of the Company's operations continued to perform well, with most operations meeting or exceeding expectations. Production results continue to be strong, cash costs remain competitive, and favourable profit margins were maintained at all operations. Candelaria (80%): The Candelaria operations produced, on a 100% basis, 46,651 tonnes of copper, and approximately 464,000 ounces of silver and 26,900 ounces of gold in concentrate, with copper and gold production better than expectations as a result of higher throughputs and good metallurgical recoveries. Copper cash costs1 of $1.21/lb for the quarter benefitted from lower mine and mill costs, favourable foreign exchange rates, and higher production. Cash cost/lb of copper, zinc and nickel are non-GAAP measures defined as all cash costs directly attributable to mining operating, less royalties and by-product credits. Eagle (100%): Eagle's operational results were generally in-line with expectations, with nickel production (6,349 tonnes) meeting expectations, and copper production (5,403 tonnes) exceeding expectations for the quarter with higher than expected head grades and recoveries. Nickel cash costs of $2.15/lb for the quarter were higher than full year guidance of $2.00/lb as a result of lower than expected copper by-product credit pricing and higher treatment charges. Neves-Corvo (100%): Neves-Corvo produced 15,348 tonnes of copper and 16,022 tonnes of zinc in the second quarter. Copper production exceeded the prior year comparable period by 14% due to higher head grades and the continued rollout of bulk mining methods in more areas. Zinc production fell short of the prior year comparable period, resulting from a reduction in mill throughput and below target metal recovery in the zinc plant. Copper cash costs of $1.43/lb for the quarter were lower than guidance ($1.60/lb) due primarily to favourable foreign exchange rates. Zinkgruvan (100%): Zinc production was strong in the second quarter of 2015, with the mine once again hoisting a record volume of ore. Zinc production of 21,237 tonnes was 10% higher than the comparable period in 2014 due to higher head grades and recoveries. Lead production exceeded expectations in the current quarter, but fell short of the prior year comparable period as mining took place in areas with lower lead grades. Cash costs for zinc of $0.43/lb for the quarter were higher than guidance ($0.35/lb) due to lower by-product credit pricing. Aguablanca (100%): Aguablanca had another strong quarter of operational performance as mining transitioned from open pit to underground. Current quarter production of 2,245 tonnes of nickel and 1,975 tonnes of copper exceeded both expectations and the prior year comparable period. Cash costs of $1.72/lb of nickel for the quarter were significantly below expectations and the prior year comparable period as mining of the open pit was extended early into the second quarter. Tenke (24%): Tenke operations continue to perform well. Lundin's attributable share of second quarter production included 12,544 tonnes of copper cathode and 996 tonnes of cobalt in hydroxide. The Company's attributable share of sales included 11,376 tonnes of copper at an average realized price of $2.63/lb and 893 tonnes of cobalt at an average realized price of $9.27/lb. Tenke operating cash costs for the second quarter of 2015 were $1.07/lb of copper sold, lower than the latest guidance, primarily reflecting higher cobalt credits, partly offset by lower copper sales volumes. Cash distributions received by Lundin Mining in the quarter were $5.9 million, in-line with expectations. An additional $0.8 million was received from the Freeport Cobalt operations. Year-to-date cash distributions to the Company from Tenke and Freeport Cobalt totalled $17.0 million.

The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of Candelaria's ($141.3 million) and Eagle's ($40.3 million) operating results. Operating earnings were also positively impacted by favourable foreign exchange rates ($21.6 million), partially offset by lower realized metal prices and price adjustments ($40.3 million) from our European operations. On a year-to-date basis, operating earnings were $517.0 million, an increase of $399.7 million in comparison to the first six months of 2014 ($117.3 million). The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of Candelaria's ($305.0 million) and Eagle's ($96.4 million) operating results. Sales for the quarter ended June 30, 2015 were $501.3 million, an increase of $309.5 million in comparison to the second quarter of the prior year ($191.8 million). The increase was mainly due to incremental sales from Candelaria and Eagle of $256.5 million and $85.0 million, respectively, and higher sales volumes ($12.9 million) from the Company's European operations, partially offset by lower realized metal prices and price adjustments ($40.3 million) from the Company's European operations. On a year-to-date basis, sales were $1,032.8 million, an increase of $691.1 million in comparison to the first six months of 2014 ($341.7 million). The increase was mainly due to incremental sales from Candelaria and Eagle of $548.7 million and $173.4 million, respectively, and higher European sales volumes ($52.5 million), partially offset by lower realized metal prices and price adjustments ($74.9 million) from the Company's European operations. Average metal prices for copper, nickel and lead for the quarter ended June 30, 2015 were lower (11%, 30%, and 7%, respectively) in comparison to the second quarter of the prior year, while zinc prices increased from the prior year comparable period (6%). On a year-to-date basis, average metal prices for copper, nickel and lead were lower (14%, 17%, and 11%, respectively) in comparison to the first six months of 2014, while zinc prices increased from the prior year comparable period (4%). Operating costs (excluding depreciation) for the quarter ended June 30, 2015 were $251.6 million, an increase of $140.6 million in comparison to the second quarter of the prior year ($111.0 million). The increase was largely due to the incremental costs from Candelaria and Eagle of $115.2 million and $44.7 million, respectively, partially offset by favourable foreign exchange rates in the Euro and Swedish krona ($21.6 million). On a year-to-date basis, operating costs (excluding depreciation) were $502.2 million, an increase of $291.0 million in comparison to the first six months of 2014 ($211.2 million). The increase was largely due to the incremental costs from Candelaria and Eagle of $243.7 million and $77.0 million, respectively, partially offset by favourable foreign exchange rates in the Euro and Swedish krona ($41.4 million). Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 when measured against the comparable period in 2014. The increase was attributable to the acquisition of Candelaria (Q2 2015 - $80.7 million; YTD - $165.8 million) and the start of commercial production at Eagle (Q2 2015 - $34.2 million; YTD - $70.7 million). Net earnings for the quarter ended June 30, 2015 were $53.7 million, an increase of $14.0 million in comparison to the second quarter of the prior year ($39.7 million). Net earnings were impacted by: Addition of Candelaria ($44.0 million) and the second full quarter of operations at Eagle ($6.9 million); offset by interest expense associated with the senior secured notes ($19.4 million); and Lower income from investment in Tenke ($14.4 million). On a year-to-date basis, net earnings were $137.0 million, an increase of $83.9 million in comparison to the first six months of 2014 ($53.1 million). Net earnings were impacted by: Addition of Candelaria ($108.1 million) and Eagle's first two full quarters of operations ($22.4 million); and a foreign exchange gain of $10.8 million; partially offset by lower income from investment in Tenke ($23.5 million); and Interest expense associated with the senior secured notes ($38.6 million). Cash flow from operations for the quarter ended June 30, 2015 was $262.7 million, an increase of $228.9 million in comparison to the second quarter of the prior year ($33.8 million). The increase was primarily due to the operating earnings from Candelaria ($141.3 million) and Eagle ($40.3 million), and changes in non-cash working capital and long-term inventory ($86.3 million), partially offset by lower realized metal prices and price adjustments ($40.3 million) from our European operations. On a year-to-date basis, cash flow from operations was $486.6 million, an increase of $425.3 million in comparison to the first six months of 2014 ($61.3 million). The increase was attributable to the operating earnings from Candelaria ($305.0 million) and Eagle ($96.4 million), and changes in non-cash working capital and long-term inventory ($87.5 million), partially offset by higher income taxes paid ($38.1 million). Corporate Highlights On July 23, 2015, the Company announced that it had received approval of its EIA for the extension of operations and mine life at its Candelaria Mine in Chile. Refer to the new release entitled \"Lundin Mining Receives Approval of Environmental Impact Assessment for the Candelaria Mine\" on the Company's website. Financial Position and Financing Net debt position at June 30, 2015 was $497.2 million compared to $829.2 million at December 31, 2014 and $649.2 million at March 31, 2015. The $152.0 million decrease in net debt during the quarter was largely attributable to operating cash flows of $262.7 million, partially offset by investments in mineral properties, plant and equipment of $78.8 million and interest payments of $38.8 million. For the six months ended June 30, 2015, net debt decreased by $332.0 million due primarily to operating cash flows of $486.6 million, partially offset by investments in mineral properties, plant and equipment of $142.7 million. The Company has a revolving credit facility available for borrowing up to $350 million. As at June 30, 2015, the Company had no amount drawn on the credit facility. A letter of credit in the amount of $19.7 million (SEK 162 million) is outstanding. Net debt at July 29, 2015 is approximately $525 million. Outlook 2015 Production and Cost Guidance Production and cash cost guidance for 2015 have been adjusted to account for mine site performance and foreign exchange rates to-date, and second half expectations. Guidance on Tenke's copper production and cash costs have been updated to reflect the most recent guidance provided by Freeport. Cash cost and production guidance for the Aguablanca Mine is currently under review. While both nickel and copper production year-to-date have been above expectations, a permitting complexity has arisen that could affect production levels and cost projections towards the end of the year. The Spanish mining authority had previously granted approvals to convert from open pit to underground mining; however another government agency has recently requested a new EIA on the change in mining method. The Company is cooperating fully with this request and will have a third party authored underground mining EIA submitted shortly. The Company may undertake a full or partial shutdown of the underground operations pending the EIA approval. Stockpiles are sufficient to continue processing at full tonnages until early in the fourth quarter. Updated guidance will be provided in the next quarterly outlook. 2015 Guidance Guidancea Revised Guidance (contained tonnes) Tonnes C1 Cost Tonnes C1 Costb Copper Candelaria (80%) 130,000 - 135,000 $1.55/lb 135,000 - 140,000 $1.35/lb Eagle 20,000 - 23,000 20,000 - 23,000 Neves-Corvo 50,000 - 55,000 $1.60/lb 50,000 - 55,000 $1.55/lb Zinkgruvan 2,000 - 3,000 2,000 - 3,000 Aguablanca 5,500 - 6,000 5,500 - 6,000 Tenke (24%)c 49,500 $1.26/lb 50,000 $1.12/lb Total attributable 257,000 - 271,500 262,500 - 277,000 Nickel Eagle 25,000 - 28,000 $2.00/lb 25,000 - 28,000 $2.00/lb Aguablanca 7,000 - 7,500 $3.75/lb 7,000 - 7,500 $3.75/lb Total 32,000 - 35,500 32,000 - 35,500 Zinc Neves-Corvo 68,000 - 73,000 60,000 - 65,000 Zinkgruvan 78,000 - 82,000 $0.35/lb 80,000 - 85,000 $0.40/lb Total 146,000 - 155,000 140,000 - 150,000 Lead Neves-Corvo 4,000 - 5,000 4,000 - 5,000 Zinkgruvan 27,000 - 30,000 30,000 - 33,000 Total 31,000 - 35,000 34,000 - 38,000 Guidance as outlined in our Management's Discussion and Analysis for the quarter ended March 31, 2015. Cash costs remain dependent upon exchange rates (forecast at EUR/USD:1.15, USD/SEK:8.25, USD/CLP:625) and metal prices (forecast at Cu: $2.70/lb, Zn: $0.95/lb, Pb: $0.80/lb, Ni: $6.25/lb, Co: $13.00/lb). Prior guidance forecast EUR/USD at 1.10. Freeport has provided 2015 sales and cash costs guidance. Tenke's 2015 production is assumed to approximate sales guidance. 2015 Capital Expenditure and Exploration Guidance Capital expenditures for 2015 are expected to be $350 million (excluding Tenke). The Company expects to spend $40 million less on sustaining capital expenditures at Candelaria and $10 million less on sustaining capital expenditures at Neves-Corvo. In total, this represents a reduction of $50 million from the previous guidance. The Company estimates its share of expansion related initiatives and sustaining capital funding for 2015 at Tenke to be $80 million, $10 million less than previously guided. All of the capital expenditures are expected to be self-funded by cash flow from Tenke operations. The Company expects to receive cash distributions from Tenke in 2015 of approximately $20 - $30 million, slightly increased from previous guidance of $20 million. The total exploration expense is expected to be $60 million, unchanged from previous guidance.

(TSE: POT) Who we are PotashCorp is the world's largest fertilizer company by capacity, producing the three primary crop nutrients: potash (K), nitrogen (N) and phosphate (P). We are the world's leading potash producer by capacity and our Canadian operations represent nearly one-fifth of global capacity1. To enhance our global footprint, we also have investments in four potash-related businesses in South America, the Middle East and Asia. With operations and business interests in seven countries, PotashCorp is an international enterprise and plays an important role in helping the world grow the food it needs. What we produce Our potash, phosphate and nitrogen products help provide the primary nutrients that crops need. They are also used to make livestock feeds and industrial goods. Produced from mineral deposits (potash and phosphate) and from the air we breathe (nitrogen), our main products are: potash, in standard and granular grades DAP (diammonium phosphate), MAP (monoammonium phosphate) and phosphoric acid Ammonia and urea Why fertilizer? With world population rising, arable land per person diminishing and demand increasing for higher quality diets that include more fruits and vegetables and protein from crop-fed livestock, the need to maximize the efficiency of farmland has never been greater. Every crop harvested removes nutrients from the soil, which must be replaced to keep soil healthy and productive. Responsible for more than 40 percent of the world's total crop yield, fertilizers feed plants, which help to feed animals and people. Where we serve Our products serve customers throughout the global marketplace from China, the world's most populous nation and largest fertilizer consumer, to India, with its 1.2 billion people. From Latin America an agricultural superpower to the rice and oil palm producing fields of Other Asian countries and the breadbasket markets of North America. Together these five regions account for nearly three-quarters of the world's population and roughly 80 percent of the total fertilizer consumption. Delivering when we're needed As the world's food challenges become more pressing, we're taking an active role in meeting them, investing heavily in our assets to deliver quality product when and where our customers need it. We are adding to our current potash capacity without building a new mine - an advantage as demand is expected to rise. And through our partnerships and investments, we strive to better serve customers in emerging markets. How we do business We hold ourselves to the highest business standards and consider factors beyond financial performance when evaluating our success. Guided by our Core Values, we cultivate mutually beneficial relationships with our communities, customers, employees, investors and other people critical to our success. Acting with a long-term view, we make decisions that consider people and the planet, always looking for opportunities to improve. Q2: PotashCorp Reports Second-Quarter 2015 Earnings of $0.50 per Share Key Highlights Second-quarter earnings of $0.50 per share Record first-half offshore potash shipments of 3.4 million tones Full-year 2015 earnings guidance adjusted to $1.75 - $1.95 Third-quarter earnings guidance set at $0.35 - $0.45 per share Proposal to acquire K+S Aktiengesellschaft (K+S) CEO Commentary \"Our earnings for the quarter hit the midpoint of our guidance range but trailed last year's total, primarily due to weaker nitrogen prices,\" said PotashCorp President and Chief Executive Officer Jochen Tilk. \"While we have faced some near-term market headwinds, we are encouraged by the strength of global potash demand, especially in offshore markets. During the first six months of this year, our offshore shipments reached a record total and we believe these conditions will continue to support further growth of our potash business in the years ahead.\" Saskatoon, Saskatchewan - Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc. (PotashCorp) reported second-quarter earnings of $0.50 per share ($417 million), bringing the first-half total to $0.94 per share ($787 million). Earnings for both the quarter and the first six months trailed 2014's comparable period amounts of $0.56 per share ($472 million) and $0.95 per share ($812 million), respectively. Improved potash and phosphate contributions were offset by weaker nitrogen earnings, resulting in gross margin of $711 million in this year's second quarter (down 5 percent) and $1.4 billion for the first half (up 5 percent). Cash from operating activities of $836 million in the second quarter and $1.4 billion for the first half of 2015 surpassed last year's comparable totals due to favorable changes in non-cash operating working capital. Earnings before finance costs, income taxes and depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $792 million for the quarter and $1.5 billion for the first six months were below 2014 comparative figures. Our investments in Arab Potash Company (APC) in Jordan, Israel Chemicals Ltd. (ICL) in Israel, Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile S.A. (SQM) in Chile and Sinofert Holdings Limited (Sinofert) in China contributed $64 million to our quarterly earnings. This result exceeded the $55 million earned in the second quarter of 2014 and brought first-half contributions to $97 million, down significantly from last year's total of $155 million, which included a special dividend from ICL. Market Conditions Global potash shipments remained strong during the second quarter, especially to China and India where higher contract volumes supported robust shipments for most producers. Demand in other offshore markets remained at historically high levels, although the impacts of weaker crop economics, currency volatility and credit availability slowed purchases from 2014's record pace - most notably in Brazil. In North America, a shortened planting season and greater availability of product from offshore suppliers kept domestic producer sales below 2014's exceptionally strong comparative period. In nitrogen, prices for most products declined from those realized in second-quarter 2014 as market fundamentals weakened on increased global supply and record Chinese urea exports over the past 12 months. As the quarter progressed, urea prices found support on stronger demand in key import markets and slowing exports from China, while ammonia markets stabilized due to supply constraints in major exporting regions. In phosphate, solid phosphate fertilizer prices were generally consistent with those in the second quarter of 2014 as improved Indian demand more than offset weakness in Latin America and record Chinese exports. Robust demand for other phosphate products - most notably liquid fertilizers in India and North America - supported improved prices relative to 2014's second quarter. Potash Potash gross margin of $417 million for 2015's second quarter and $845 million for the first six months reflected improved realizations, with results in both periods exceeding the respective totals of $395 million and $695 million generated in 2014. While total sales volumes for both the quarter (2.5 million tonnes) and first six months (4.9 million tonnes) were in line with those of 2014, offshore shipments were especially robust, up 18 percent and 17 percent, respectively. Canpotex3 shipments reached record levels for both periods in 2015 due to improved rail logistics and enhanced infrastructure and distribution capabilities. For the quarter, the majority of Canpotex's shipments were to Latin America (37 percent) and Other Asian countries outside of China and India (30 percent), while China and India accounted for 20 percent and 8 percent, respectively. North American sales volumes declined for both the quarter (down 31 percent) and the first six months (down 25 percent) from the exceptionally strong comparative periods in 2014. Our average realized potash price of $273 per tonne for the second quarter was up from $263 per tonne in the same period last year. This improvement reflected higher prices in most markets compared to last year's second quarter when realizations were still recovering from the lows experienced in early 2014. Per-tonne cost of goods sold for the second quarter was slightly above the same period in 2014. The favorable impact of a weakened Canadian dollar and operational efficiencies was more than offset by fewer tonnes sourced from our lower-cost mines. This was due largely to the Allan Canpotex proving run that we completed in the second quarter of 2014. Nitrogen Weaker prices for all nitrogen product categories resulted in gross margin of $222 million for the quarter and $403 million for the first six months, trailing last year's comparable periods by 27 percent and 26 percent, respectively. Our US operations accounted for 71 percent of our nitrogen gross margin for the quarter, with Trinidad providing the remainder. Second-quarter sales volumes of 1.6 million tonnes were relatively flat with the same period in 2014. Total first-half sales volumes were 2.9 million tonnes - 11 percent below the same period last year. This reduction was primarily due to first-quarter headwinds, which included market weakness, mechanical challenges at Lima and greater gas curtailments in Trinidad. Our average realized price of $334 per tonne during the quarter declined from the $393 per tonne in the same period last year. This was largely the result of increased supply in key producing regions, which pressured benchmark prices and realizations for all our products. Cost of goods sold for the quarter averaged $201 per tonne, down from $213 per tonne in 2014's second quarter, driven primarily by lower natural gas costs in both the US and Trinidad. Phosphate Phosphate gross margin of $72 million for the second quarter (up 50 percent) and $130 million for the first six months of 2015 (up 76 percent) improved significantly from the comparable periods in 2014. The absence of accelerated depreciation charges incurred in 2014 related to the closure that year of our Suwannee River chemical plant - as well as higher average netbacks this year - supported improved margins and more than offset lower sales volumes. Absence of production from Suwannee River reduced tonnes available for sale. Sales volumes of 0.7 million tonnes for the quarter and 1.3 million tonnes for the first six months trailed comparative periods in 2014 by 20 percent and 18 percent, respectively. Our average realized phosphate price for the quarter was $553 per tonne, up from $509 per tonne in the same period last year, reflecting a greater proportion of sales from higher-netback feed, industrial and liquid fertilizer products. Cost of goods sold of $450 per tonne for the second quarter was slightly below the same period in 2014. The absence of accelerated depreciation charges more than offset the negative impact of reduced production. Financial Provincial mining and other taxes for the second quarter increased to $90 million from the $69 million recorded in 2014, reflecting the impacts of a weaker Canadian dollar, higher potash prices and changes in the timing of allowable deductions within Saskatchewan's potash taxation regulations. Lower total earnings resulted in income tax expense declining to $152 million in the second quarter from $166 million during 2014's comparable period. Capital-related cash expenditures totaled $294 million during the quarter, exceeding the total in the same period last year, as we advanced work at our potash expansions in Rocanville and New Brunswick as well as our nitrogen expansion in Lima. During the quarter, we proposed to acquire K+S for EUR41 per share. This business combination would bring together complementary assets to create a well-capitalized, more diversified company across products, geographies, distribution and customers. Despite K+S' initial rejection, we believe that our proposal balances the interests of investors and other stakeholders, including the employees and communities in which the companies operate. As such, we remain focused on engaging with and having constructive discussions with K+S management that would include commitments to secure German locations and employment. Please bear in mind that we have not yet decided to make a formal offer. Potash Market Outlook Our expectations of global potash demand remain unchanged as we anticipate 2015 shipments of approximately 60 million tonnes. In North America, demand for our summer-fill program has been strong. We expect shipments in this market to accelerate through the remainder of the year, although competitive pressures have resulted in lower prices than recognized during the first six months. We now expect total 2015 shipments of 9.0-9.5 million tonnes. In Latin America, we anticipate strong third-quarter demand ahead of its key planting season. However, reduced credit availability and currency weakness in Brazil could slow purchases compared to the record pace in 2014. For the full year, we now forecast shipments of 10.6-11.1 million tonnes for this region. In China, strong shipments are expected through the second half as suppliers deliver against significant annual contracted volumes. Rising demand in China for compound fertilizers and bulk blends with higher potassium content is expected to require optional tonnage deliveries and push Canpotex sales volumes above its 1.8 million tonne minimum. Based on this strength - and increased domestic production - we now expect total shipments to reach 14.2-14.7 million tonnes. In India, potash demand continues to improve without meaningful subsidy change. Robust demand for direct application and compound fertilizers - as well as a later first-half contract settlement - is expected to result in significant Canpotex shipments through the rest of 2015. We maintain our full-year shipment estimate of 4.5-5.0 million tonnes and believe total deliveries could reach the upper end of our range. In Other Asian countries (outside of China and India), we maintain our estimate for shipments of 8.4-8.8 million tonnes. Significant competitive pressures and currency volatility could weigh on prices in these markets through the balance of the year. Financial Outlook With the first half behind us, we have revised our full-year expectations for our potash business. Our full-year sales volumes estimate has been narrowed to 9.3-9.6 million tonnes and - due to a decline in certain spot market prices through the second quarter - we have lowered the upper end of our previous potash gross margin range, now forecast at $1.5-$1.7 billion. We maintain our combined nitrogen and phosphate gross margin estimate of $1.0-$1.2 billion in 2015. In nitrogen, we expect greater supply will lead to a more subdued market and weaker prices relative to 2014, although lower natural gas prices are expected to keep cost of goods sold below last year's level. In phosphate, a shift to a more profitable product mix and supportive market fundamentals are expected to keep realizations above those of 2014. Additionally, we expect to benefit from per-tonne costs trending lower through the balance of the year on improved mining conditions at Aurora. We have increased our estimate of income from offshore equity investments to a range of $190-$210 million due to increased dividend income from ICL in the first half of the year. Selling and administrative expenses are now forecast in the range of $235-$245 million and finance costs are now expected to be in the range of $190-$200 million. As a result of the noted changes, we have revised our full-year 2015 earnings guidance to $1.75-$1.95 per share. For the third quarter, we forecast a range of $0.35-$0.45 per share. Other annual guidance numbers - including those noted above - are outlined in the table below. 2015 Guidance Earnings per share Annual: $1.75-$1.95 Q3: $0.35-$0.45 Potash sales volumes 9.3-9.6 million tonnes Potash gross margin $1.5-$1.7 billion Nitrogen and phosphate gross margin $1.0-$1.2 billion Capital expenditures* ~$1.2 billion Effective tax rate 26-28 percent Provincial mining and other taxes** 20-22 percent Selling and administrative expenses $235-$245 million Finance costs $190-$200 million Income from offshore equity investments*** $180-$210 million Annual Foreign Exchange Rate CDN$1.24 per US$ Annual EPS sensitivity to Foreign Exchange US$ strengthens vs. CDN$ by $0.02 = +$0.01 EPS * Does not include capitalized interest ** As a percentage of potash gross margin *** Includes income from dividends and share of equity earnings Notes 1.

SILVER WHEATON REPORTS RECORD PRODUCTION OF OVER TEN MILLION SILVER EQUIVALENT OUNCES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2015 VANCOUVER, May 7, 2015 /CNW/ - Silver Wheaton Corp. (\"Silver Wheaton\" or the \"Company\") (TSX:SLW) (NYSE:SLW) is pleased to announce its unaudited results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2015. All figures are presented in United States dollars unless otherwise noted. FIRST QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS Record attributable silver equivalent production in Q1 2015 of 10.4 million ounces (6.3 million ounces of silver and 55,100 ounces of gold), compared with 9.0 million ounces in Q1 2014, representing an increase of 15%. Attributable silver equivalent sales volume in Q1 2015 of 7.7 million ounces (5.7 million ounces of silver and 28,400 ounces of gold), compared with 8.1 million ounces in Q1 2014, representing a decrease of 5%. During the three month period ending March 31, 2015, payable silver equivalent ounces attributable to the Company produced but not yet delivered increased by 1.6 million ounces to approximately 6.5 million ounces. Revenues of $130.5 million in Q1 2015 compared with $165.4 million in Q1 2014, representing a decrease of 21%. Average realized sale price per silver equivalent ounce sold in Q1 2015 of $16.90 ($16.95 per ounce of silver and $1,214 per ounce of gold), compared with $20.38 in Q1 2014, representing a decrease of 17%. Net earnings of $49.4 million ($0.13 per share) in Q1 2015 compared with $79.8 million ($0.22 per share) in Q1 2014, representing a decrease of 38%. Operating cash flows of $89.1 million ($0.24 per share1) in Q1 2015 compared with $114.8 million ($0.32 per share1) in Q1 2014, representing a decrease of 22%. Cash operating margin1 in Q1 2015 of $12.44 per silver equivalent ounce compared with $15.81 in Q1 2014, representing a decrease of 21%. Average cash costs1 in Q1 2015 were $4.14 and $388 per ounce of silver and gold, respectively. On a silver equivalent basis, average cash costs1decreased to $4.46 compared with $4.57 in Q1 2014. Declared quarterly dividend of $0.05 per common share. On January 5, 2015, the Company announced that it had amended its silver purchase agreement related to Barrick Gold Corporation's ( \"Barrick\") Pascua-Lama project (\"Pascua-Lama\"), located on the border of Chile and Argentina. On February 27, 2015, the Company announced that it had amended and restated its revolving credit facility (\"Revolving Facility\"). Silver Wheatonincreased the available credit from $1 billion to $2 billion and used proceeds drawn from the Revolving Facility together with cash on hand to repay the$1 billion of debt previously outstanding under the Company's non-revolving term loan. On March 2, 2015, Silver Wheaton announced that it had acquired from Vale S.A. (\"Vale\") an additional 25% of the life of mine gold production from its Salobo mine, located in Brazil, for an upfront payment of $900 million. On March 2, 2015, the Company announced that it had entered into an agreement with a syndicate of underwriters led by Scotiabank, pursuant to which they agreed to purchase, on a bought deal basis, 38,930,000 common shares of Silver Wheaton at a price of US$20.55 per share (the \"Offering\"), for aggregate gross proceeds to Silver Wheaton of approximately US$800 million. On March 17, 2015, the Company announced that it had closed the Offering and received $800 million in gross proceeds (net proceeds of approximately$769 million after payment of underwriters' fees and expenses). Events Subsequent to the Quarter \"Silver Wheaton had a strong start to 2015, with record production in the first quarter and the addition of more gold from one of our cornerstone assets. For the first time in our history, Silver Wheaton produced over ten million silver equivalent ounces in one quarter. While the quarterly sales volumes did not reflect the record production, we recognize that this is simply a timing issue and we fully expect to see increased sales as the year progresses,\" said Randy Smallwood, President and Chief Executive Officer of Silver Wheaton. \"Our record first quarter production was driven by the recent acquisition of an additional 25% of gold from the Salobo mine in Brazil, as well as the first contributions of gold and silver from the Constancia mine in Peru. We expect both of these streams to realize further gains over the coming year, as the Salobo mine is currently ramping-up production after expanding in the middle of last year and the Constancia mine achieved commercial production on April 30th of this year. We also continue to see some very good opportunities to add additional accretive ounces to our existing portfolio. Overall, the first quarter represents a strong start to what we believe will be a prolonged period of significant organic growth for Silver Wheaton without requiring any further capital.\" Financial Review Revenues Revenue was $130.5 million in the first quarter of 2015, on silver equivalent sales of 7.7 million ounces (5.7 million ounces of silver and 28,400 ounces of gold). This represents a 21% decrease from the $165.4 million of revenue generated in the first quarter of 2014 due primarily to a 17% decrease in the average realized silver equivalent price ($16.90 in Q1 2015 compared with $20.38 in Q1 2014), coupled with a 5% decrease in the number of silver equivalent ounces sold. Costs and Expenses Average cash costs1 in the first quarter of 2015 were $4.46 per silver equivalent ounce as compared with $4.57 during the comparable period of 2014. This resulted in a cash operating margin1 of $12.44 per silver equivalent ounce, a reduction of 21% as compared with Q1 2014. The decrease in the cash operating margin was primarily due to a 17% decrease in the average silver equivalent price realized in Q1 2015 compared with Q1 2014.1 Earnings and Operating Cash Flows Net earnings and cash flow from operations in the first quarter of 2015 were $49.4 million ($0.13 per share) and $89.1 million ($0.24 per share1), compared with $79.8 million ($0.22 per share) and $114.8 million ($0.32 per share1) for the same period in 2014, a decrease of 38% and 22%, respectively. Earnings and cash flow continued to be impacted by lower gold and silver prices. Balance Sheet At March 31, 2015, the Company had approximately $88.0 million of cash on hand and $800 million outstanding under the Company's $2 billion revolving term loan. As per the Company's February 27, 2015, news release, Silver Wheaton amended its Revolving Facility by increasing the available credit from $1 billion to $2 billion and extending the term by two years, with the facility now maturing on February 27, 2020. As part of the amendment, the financial covenants were revised. The interest rate applicable to any drawings under the amended Revolving Facility remains unchanged. The Company used proceeds drawn from this amended Revolving Facility together with cash on hand to repay the $1 billion of debt previously outstanding under its nonrevolving term loan and terminated that loan. On March 2, 2015, the Company announced that it had entered into an agreement with a syndicate of underwriters led by Scotiabank, pursuant to which they had agreed to purchase, on a bought deal basis, 38,930,000 common shares of Silver Wheaton at a price of $20.55 per share (the \"Offering\"), for aggregate gross proceeds to Silver Wheaton of approximately $800 million. On March 17, 2015, the Company announced that it had closed the Offering and received $800 million in gross proceeds (net proceeds of approximately $769 million after payment of underwriters' fees and expenses). The net proceeds were used to help fund the Company's acquisition of an additional 25% gold stream from the Salobo mine. First Quarter Asset Highlights During the first quarter of 2015, attributable silver equivalent production was 10.4 million ounces (6.3 million ounces of silver and 55,100 ounces of gold), representing an increase of 15% compared with the first quarter of 2014. Operational highlights for the quarter ended March 31, 2015, are as follows: Salobo In the first quarter of 2015, Salobo produced 27,185 ounces of gold attributable to Silver Wheaton, an increase of approximately 205% relative to the first quarter of 2014 primarily due to the doubling of the percentage of gold Silver Wheaton is entitled to as detailed below and the increased throughput as a result of the expansion to 24 million tons per annum (\"Mtpa\") which commenced production mid-year 2014. On March 2, 2015, the Company amended the agreement with Vale to acquire an additional amount of gold equal to 25% of the life of mine gold production from any minerals from the Salobo mine that enter the Salobo mineral processing facility from and after January 1, 2015. This acquisition is in addition to the 25% of the Salobo mine gold production that the Company acquired pursuant to the agreement in 2013. Silver Wheaton is now entitled to a total of 50% of the life of mine gold production from the Salobo mine. Under the amended agreement, the Company paid Vale upfront cash consideration of $900 million and will pay ongoing payments of the lesser of $400 per ounce of gold (subject to an inflationary adjustment of 1% commencing as of January 1, 2017) for the full 50% of gold production or the prevailing market price per ounce of gold delivered. The additional 25% life of mine production that was processed from and after January 1, 2015, accrued retroactively to the Company. If throughput capacity is expanded above the current 24 Mpta within a predetermined period, the Company will be required to make an additional payment to Vale, relative to the 50% stream, based on a set fee schedule. Constancia As disclosed in Hudbay's first quarter of 2015 MD&A, the Constancia mine achieved commercial production on April 30, 2015. Hudbay reported that ocean shipments began in April 2015 and that the mine and concentrators are currently operating at or above design capacity. According to Hudbay, the plant is performing as designed and throughput has occasionally exceeded design due to favourable ore characteristics, with peaks of over 90,000 tonnes per day. Hudbay has indicated that as at April 30, 2015, 42,575 tonnes of copper concentrate had been produced, of which approximately 20,500 tonnes had been shipped. Hudbay continues to expect the operation to achieve steady San Dimas On August 6, 2010, Goldcorp Inc. (\"Goldcorp\") completed the sale of the San Dimas mine to Primero Mining Corp (\"Primero\"). In conjunction with the sale, Silver Wheaton amended its silver purchase agreement relating to the mine. The term of the agreement, as it relates to San Dimas, was extended to the life of mine. During the first four years following the closing of the transaction, Primero delivered to Silver Wheaton a per annum amount equal to the first 3.5 million ounces of payable silver produced at San Dimas and 50% of any excess, and Silver Wheaton received an additional 1.5 million ounces of silver per annum that was delivered by Goldcorp. According to the amended agreement, beginning on August 6, 2014, the fourth anniversary of the closing, Primero delivers a per annum amount to Silver Wheaton equal to the first 6 million ounces of payable silver produced at San Dimas and 50% of any excess, and Goldcorp's obligation to deliver supplemental silver ceased. In the first quarter of 2015, San Dimas produced 1.9 million ounces of silver, an increase of approximately 20% relative to the first quarter of 2014. This was primarily due to increased production as a result of the expansion to 2,500 tonnes per day (\"tpd\") which was completed early in 2014 and to the sharing threshold increasing to 6 million ounces1. In addition, during the quarter, the San Dimas mill consistently operated above its nameplate capacity of 2,500 tpd with an average throughput of 2,863 tpd, a 30% increase versus Q1 2014. Importantly, the San Dimas mine maintained pace with the mill, achieving record quarterly production of 2,931 tpd, 21% higher than in Q1 20142 . Metallurgical recoveries also reverted to their historical high levels with the completion of a final leach tank, averaging 93% for silver in the quarter. Penasquito In the first quarter of 2015, the Penasquito mine produced 1.4 million ounces of silver attributable to Silver Wheaton, a decrease of approximately 29% relative to the fourth quarter of 2014 due to lower grades being mined and lower metallurgical recoveries. Goldcorp has indicated that it anticipates grades to improve throughout 2015. As disclosed in Goldcorp's first quarter of 2015 MD&A, in the first quarter of 2015, Penasquito commenced a feasibility study on the Metallurgical Enhancement Project (\"MEP\") which is the combined study to assess the feasibility of the Concentrate Enrichment Project (\"CEP\") and Pyrite Leach Penasquito sulphide plant (\"Pyrite Leach\"). The study will assess the potential for producing saleable copper concentrate (CEP) and the viability of leaching a pyrite concentrate from the zinc flotation tailings (Pyrite Leach). Successful implementation of one or both of these new process improvements has the potential to improve the overall economics and life of mine of Penasquito. The feasibility study is expected to be complete in early 2016. Barrick / Pascua-Lama In the first quarter of 2015, attributable silver production from Barrick was 0.6 million ounces, an increase of approximately 112% relative to the first quarter of 2014 primarily due to higher grades at the Veladero and Lagunas Norte mines. On January 5, 2015, the Company announced that it had amended its silver purchase agreement related to Barrick's Pascua-Lama project. The amendment entails Silver Wheaton being entitled to 100% of the silver production from Barrick's Lagunas Norte, Pierina and Veladero mines until March 31, 2018, an extension of 1  1/4  years, and extending the completion test deadline an additional 2  1/2  years to June 30, 2020. As a reminder, if the requirements of the completion test have not been satisfied by the amended completion date, the agreement may be terminated by Silver Wheaton. In such an event, Silver Wheaton will be entitled to the return of the upfront cash consideration of $625 million less a credit for any silver delivered up to that date. Sudbury In the first quarter of 2015, Sudbury produced 10,112 ounces of gold, an increase of approximately 57% relative to the first quarter of 2014 primarily due to the commencement of operations at the Totten mine as well as higher gold grades being mined. Other: Toroparu On April 22, 2015, the Company amended its early deposit precious metal purchase agreement with Sandspring Resources Ltd. (\"Sandspring\") to include the acquisition of an amount equal to 50% of the silver production from its Toroparu project (\"Toroparu\") located in the Republic of Guyana, South America. Silver Wheaton will pay Sandspring incremental upfront cash payments totaling $5.0 million for 50% of the payable silver production from Toroparu. In addition, Silver Wheaton will make ongoing payments to Sandspring of the lesser of the market price and $3.90 per payable ounce of silver delivered to Silver Wheaton over the life of Toroparu, subject to a 1% annual increase starting on the fourth anniversary of production. Sandspring is entitled to receive US$2.0 million of the incremental US$5.0 million cash payment in four equal installments over the course of 2015, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. Produced But Not Yet Delivered During the first quarter of 2015, payable silver equivalent ounces produced but not yet delivered to Silver Wheaton by its partners increased by 1.6 million ounces to approximately 6.5 million silver equivalent payable ounces at March 31, 2015, primarily related to an increase related to the Salobo gold purchase agreement. Payable ounces produced but not yet delivered to Silver Wheaton are expected to average approximately 2 to 3 months of annualized production but may vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of mining operations factors including mine ramp-up, delays in shipments, etc. Sherritt International Corporation (S: TSX) Sherritt is a world leader in the mining and refining of nickel from lateritic ores with projects and operations in Canada, Cuba and Madagascar. The Corporation is the largest independent energy producer in Cuba, with extensive oil and power operations on the island. Sherritt licenses its proprietary technologies and provides metallurgical services to commercial metals operations worldwide. The Corporation's common shares are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol \"S\". Sherritt is committed to the highest standards of environment, health and safety practices at all of its operations, while making valuable contributions to local communities. Sherritt Announces Q2 2015 Results Nickel production increases 8% over Q2 2014 and Net Direct Cash Costs decline at Moa and Ambatovy Toronto, Ontario - July 28, 2015 - Sherritt International Corporation (\"Sherritt\" or the \"Corporation\") (TSX: S), a world leader in the mining and refining of nickel from lateritic ores, today reported its financial results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015. \"Our metals business continues to provide stable production while we find ways to lower cash costs. Our business-wide emphasis on controlling costs while ramping up to full production at Ambatovy contributed to lower cash costs of US$5.48 at Ambatovy, and US$4.12 at Moa,\" said David Pathe, President and CEO. \"Despite a once in ten year maintenance shutdown at Fort Saskatchewan and some unplanned disruptions at Ambatovy in the quarter, we saw overall nickel production increase by 8% over the prior year period,\" continued Pathe. \"During the quarter, we obtained three more certificates from the Independent Engineer, leaving two outstanding certificates to attain financial completion at the end of September.\" Q2 HIGHLIGHTS Average reference prices for our primary products were down significantly year over year, with nickel down 30% and oil down 45% from the same quarter last year. Finished nickel production was 8% higher at 8,035 tonnes, in a quarter that included a once-in-10 year maintenance shutdown at Fort Saskatchewan and Ambatovy production impacts from a strike and damage to ore thickeners. Net direct cash costs fell for the second consecutive quarter this year, to US$4.12 per pound at the Moa JV and US$5.48 per pound at Ambatovy. Ambatovy's Independent Engineer signed off on the Efficiency, Production and Environmental Certificates, leaving two remaining certificates required for Financial Completion. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 47% from the same quarter last year, and 9% from Q1 2015 Adjusted EBITDA, consistent with the decline in metal and oil prices. Combined adjusted operating cash flow per share increased to $0.09 per share in the second quarter this year from $0.06 per share in the same quarter last year. Combined administration expenses declined for the second consecutive quarter this year, to $17.3 million compared to $27.5 million in the second quarter of 2014. OUTLOOK AND SIGNIFICANT ITEMS We lowered production guidance at Ambatovy and narrowed the expected production range to 45,000 - 48,000 tonnes (100% basis) finished nickel, from the original guidance of 47,000 - 52,000 tonnes finished nickel (100% basis). Mixed sulphide and cobalt production expectations have also been revised as presented in the Outlook table. This change recognizes the production impacts in the second quarter, and our schedule to return to operations with both thickeners online. We reduced expected capital spending in Oil and Gas to $81 million from the $96 million projection provided as part of the Q1 2015 disclosure, which was itself a downward revision from the original $107 million estimate. These revisions are consistent with the objective of preserving capital and adjusting capital spending as new results are analyzed. In the first quarter this year, we had a tax recovery of $30.1 million due to the reduction in statutory tax rates in Cuba accompanying Cuba's new foreign investment regime. In the second quarter, we had an additional tax recovery of $13.2 million in Oil and Gas, as we received clarification from the Cuban tax authority pertaining to a further recovery, which will be a nonrecurring item. We recorded a $19.1 million gain on the sale of our corporate head office. Q2 2015 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS During the second quarter, $27.6 million ($0.09 per share) in adjusting items occurred that primarily included a $19.1 million gain on the sale of the corporate office, and a $13.2 million tax recovery due to the reduction in statutory tax rates in Cuba. This tax recovery follows a similar tax recovery of $30.1 million recognized in the first quarter of 2015. We received clarification from the Cuban tax authority pertaining to this additional recovery, which will be a non-recurring item. Metal markets Nickel prices continued to deteriorate in the second quarter, reaching a new six year low in July when spot prices dipped below US$ 5.00 per pound for the first time since 2009. At the prices reached in July approximately 50% of global nickel production is below break even on a C1 cash cost basis. Despite some nickel production being curtailed in the last year it appears that more significant production cuts will be required in order to have any impact on market fundamentals. Weaker nickel demand is supported by the decline in stainless steel output as many mills are entering a period of planned maintenance outages and stainless steel inventories remain high. Longer term, a supply deficit is still expected, although timing is expected to shift from the latter half of 2015 to 2016 as a consequence of reduced global stainless steel demand. A decline in nickel ore inventories in China, a modest reduction in LME inventory levels and less than 50% capacity utilization of Chinese NPI production facilities as reported by Shanghai Metal Markets support the thesis that Chinese NPI production has declined. This had been an expected consequence of NPI production being generally at a higher cost than current market. The average reference price for cobalt was relatively flat year over year and over the first quarter this year over year. Realized price differences between Moa and Ambatovy in cobalt generally reflect the longer shipment times to customers from Ambatovy, and timing of revenue recognition. Moa Joint Venture (50% interest) and Fort Site Adjusted EBITDA declined by 35% ($7.8 million) during the second quarter compared to the prior year period primarily due to lower nickel prices, partially offset by lower fuel oil and other energy prices and higher fertilizer prices. Finished nickel production of 3,877 tonnes (50% basis) for the second quarter of 2015 was 7 tonnes higher than the prior year quarter despite a longer planned annual maintenance shutdown. Stable operations at Moa continue to have a positive impact on mixed sulphides availability. Finished cobalt production of 429 tonnes (50% basis) for the second quarter of 2015 was higher than the prior year quarter, consistent with the trend in Q1 2015. A modestly higher cobalt ratio in the feed contributed to the increase. Nickel recovery at Moa of 89% in the quarter was consistent with the prior year quarter, and up slightly from the 88% historical standard. The net direct cash cost of US$4.12 per pound of nickel was down 18% (US$0.93 per pound) from the second quarter of 2014, despite flat production, as lower fuel oil and energy prices and lower third party feed costs were partially offset by higher sulphur and sulphuric acid prices. Fertilizer's EBITDA contributions have been strong both in the quarter and year to date, although the impact was partly offset by reduced production and sales volumes. Lower opening inventories after a strong Q4 2014 and the maintenance shutdown that occurred this quarter impacted production and sales volumes. Capital spending of $15.9 million in the quarter and $24.0 million year to date is mainly attributable to the higher planned spending, with expansion capital as budgeted for the construction of the 2,000 tonne per day acid plant which will eliminate the need to import acid. Ambatovy Joint Venture (40% interest) Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter was negative $1.7 million during the quarter compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $2.1 million in the same quarter last year. For the six month period ended June 30, 2015, Adjusted EBITDA of $2.6 million compares with negative $2.3 million in the first half of last year. During the quarter, finished nickel production was 4,158 tonnes (10,395 tonnes, 100% basis), an improvement of 15% over last year. Nickel average-realized prices in the quarter followed the decline in reference prices year over year. Average-realized prices for cobalt strengthened in the second quarter this year compared to their year ago level mainly because of exchange rate benefit, but also from the first quarter this year without any exchange rate benefit. The change from Q1 to Q2 this year relates to the timing of shipments and revenue recognition. Second quarter throughput and production were impacted by a strike in April, and by unplanned repair and redesign work required on both ore thickeners, one of which has returned to service. As announced in the May Ambatovy monthly production update, both ore thickeners were damaged in the third week of May, 2015 after two power failures and were subsequently emptied and taken offline for repair. Unthickened ore was processed directly through the PAL circuit during late May and June, reducing ore throughput capacity by approximately 15%. Ore Thickener 1 has since returned to service and is operating normally, with overall ore throughput rate capacity currently reduced by approximately 6%. Ore Thickener 2 will be re-assembled with additional support to the bridge structure, with the repair scheduled for Q3 this year. Capital spending is not expected to increase beyond the original 2015 guidance of $35 million (40% basis). Q2 nickel recovery was 86% compared to 85% in Q1 primarily due to efficiency improvements in the mixed sulphide precipitation circuit resulting from operational and process control improvements. The net direct cash cost (NDCC) of nickel was US$5.48 per pound in the second quarter of 2015, compared to US$5.74 in the first quarter this year, when production was higher. Mining, processing and refining costs per pound continue to fall with lower commodity input costs and lower maintenance costs, apart from the thickener repairs. Impacts to NDCC from the ore thickener failures have been limited, as fixed costs over lower unit volumes have been offset by savings in input costs, specifically sulphuric acid. Significant fixed cost reductions have also been identified and realised in response to the continued nickel price deterioration, including the head count reduction of approximately 1,100 employees and contractors as previously announced. The estimated annual savings from this reduction are approximately $5 million. Production in the second half of 2015 is expected to return to forecast levels with the outlook impacted by the unplanned and now resolved challenges experienced in the first half. Accordingly, we have narrowed our expected outlook range with a modest reduction to 45,000 - 48,000 tonnes nickel. Financial completion is described in Note 6 to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the period ended June 30, 2015. The two remaining certificates required to achieve financial completion are Legal and Other Conditions Certificate, which requires, among other things, registration of security interests over the project's assets and real property; and the Financial Certificate, which requires the funding of a senior debt reserve account in an amount equivalent to six months principal and interest payable, or approximately US$48 million for Sherritt's 40% share. Upon submission of the final certificates, the US$1.7 billion Ambatovy Joint Venture Financing (100% basis, balance at June 30, 2015) becomes non-recourse to the Ambatovy partners, and the interest rate increases by approximately 1% from approximately LIBOR plus 1.4% to LIBOR plus 2.55%. For the three months ended June 30, 2015, the Joint Venture partners were required to fund US$90.0 million on a 100% basis (US$36 million, Sherritt's 40% share) to cover obligations including the required semi-annual principal payments on the project finance facility. Further funding is required for obligations including the senior debt reserve account described above, prior to the September 30 2015 deadline for financial completion. OIL AND GAS Adjusted EBITDA was 48% ($27.6 million) lower in the second quarter compared to the prior year period, with realized oil and gas prices down 37% over the same period. In our Cuban operation, the averagerealized price in the second quarter was $45.71 per barrel, an improvement over the average-realized price of $41.44 in the first quarter this year, as WTI and Brent crude prices showed some signs of stabilization in the second quarter. Gross working interest (\"GWI\") oil production in Cuba decreased by 5% (921 barrels of oil per day in the second quarter compared to the prior year period, primarily due to natural reservoir declines and lower than expected production from development wells drilled under the Puerto Escondido/Yumuri Production Sharing Contract (PSC) extension. We have now drilled and completed a total of six new wells with a seventh in progress, fulfilling our commitments under the PSC extension. To date, oil production from the PSC extension wells has been lower than expected, with four of the six wells producing oil, and one being evaluated. After evaluation including results of the well currently in progress, we will determine what new drill activity to conduct, if any, on the PSC extension. Unit operating costs in Cuba increased 32% ($2.44 per barrel) in the second quarter compared to the prior year period, mainly reflecting increased workover costs, lower production and the weaker Canadian dollar. Q2 unit operating costs were also higher than Q1 this year, with lower production and increased workover costs accounting for the majority of the change. Cost-recovery oil production for the three and six months increased, consistent with the lower realized prices and an increase in eligible expenditures that can be claimed compared to the prior year periods. On a year to date basis, capital spending of $43.5 million is up 39% year over year, consistent with the higher capital expenditures required drilling the PSC extension. Consistent with the objective of preserving capital and adjusting capital spending as new production results are analyzed, we are reducing estimated capital spending for the second consecutive quarter to $81 million from $96 million estimated last quarter. POWER Quarterly Adjusted EBITDA increased by 17% ($1.1 million) year over year with most of the benefit coming from higher average-realized pricing, which is mainly due to the weaker Canadian dollar. The average-realized price of electricity was 13% higher ($5.93 per MWh) in the second quarter compared to the prior year period. In the second quarter this year, electricity production and sales were consistent with the prior year period. On a year to date basis, production and sales are higher in the first six months of 2015, with six months of production from the Boca de Jaruco Combined Cycle Project compared to five months in the same period last year. Operating costs increased by 8% ($1.24 per MWh) in the second quarter compared to the prior year period, due to an increase in turbine maintenance and equipment repairs.

Headquartered in Vancouver, Canada, we own, or have an interest in, 12 mines in Canada, the United States, Chile and Peru. We also operate a large metallurgical complex, are partners in a wind power facility, and are a significant producer of specialty metals such as germanium and indium. We are actively exploring for copper, zinc and gold in the Americas, Asia Pacific, Europe and Africa. TECK REPORTS UNAUDITED SECOND QUARTER RESULTS FOR 2015 Vancouver, BC - Teck Resources Limited (TSX: TCK.A and TCK.B, NYSE: TCK) (\"Teck\") reported second quarter adjusted profit attributable to shareholders of $79 million, or $0.14 per share, compared with $72 million or $0.13 per share in 2014. Profit attributable to shareholders was $63 million ($0.11 per share) compared with $80 million ($0.14 per share) a year ago. \"Our operations have turned in a solid performance for the quarter,\" said Don Lindsay, President and CEO. \"All of our operations have remained cash flow positive after sustaining capital investment and our balance sheet remains strong with over $6.5 billion of liquidity. This has been achieved notwithstanding a material drop in the U.S. dollar spot coal price since the beginning of 2015.\" Highlights and Significant Items Profit attributable to shareholders was $63 million and EBITDA was $596 million in the second quarter. Gross profit before depreciation and amortization was $676 million in the second quarter compared with $636 million in the second quarter of 2014. Cash flow from operations, before working capital changes, was $531 million in the second quarter of 2015 compared with $520 million a year ago. We have reached agreements with the majority of our customers for the third quarter of 2015, based on a quarterly benchmark of US$93 per tonne for the highest quality product and we expect total sales in the third quarter, including spot sales, to be at least 6.0 million tonnes of steelmaking coal. All critical milestones are being achieved on the Fort Hills oil sands project. The partners are focused on opportunities to manage capital cost in the current economic environment. A falling Canadian dollar, lower oil prices and our cost reduction program have contributed to reduce our U.S. dollar unit costs for our products with copper and coal unit costs falling by US$0.15 per pound and US$17 per tonne, respectively, compared to last year. The Red Dog concentrate shipping season commenced on June 28, with the first vessel sailing. We expect sales of 170,000 tonnes of contained zinc metal in the third quarter and 200,000 tonnes in the fourth quarter reflecting the normal seasonal pattern of Red Dog sales. Our liquidity remains strong at over $6.5 billion inclusive of $1.5 billion cash at July 22, 2015 and US$4.2 billion of undrawn, committed credit facilities. Our cash balance is in line with expectations and consistent with our goal of finishing the year with at least $1.0 billion in cash. On May 28, in response to steelmaking coal market conditions we announced rotating shutdowns totaling three weeks in the third quarter at our steelmaking coal mines. These shutdowns have commenced and further steps to reduce production may be taken in the fourth quarter unless the supply-demand balance in the market improves. On June 25, unexpected ground movement was observed in the area of the SX-EW plant at our Quebrada Blanca Operations in Chile leading to a temporary suspension of cathode production. Partial production has since resumed. Production in the second half of 2015 is expected to be reduced by 5,000 to 10,000 tonnes of copper cathode. As planned, Duck Pond ceased operations on June 30 after exhausting all of its remaining ore resources. On July 9, we increased our cash position by US$162 million as a result of entering into a gold offtake agreement and terminating a separate royalty agreement with subsidiaries of Royal Gold, Inc. related to our Carmen de Andacollo Operation. We were the top-ranked mining company and fourth-ranked company overall named to the Best 50 Corporate Citizens in Canada ranking by media and investment research company Corporate Knights and were also named one of the Top 50 Socially Responsible Corporations in Canada by Sustainalytics, a global responsible investment research firm. Overview We are responding to challenging market conditions by focusing management's efforts on cost reduction initiatives and capital discipline. Prices for all of our major commodities fell significantly in the quarter, putting downward pressure on margins and profits. This has been partly offset by the weaker Canadian dollar. Our focus on cost reduction has partially mitigated the effects of lower prices. Our site operating costs for our coal business unit were down 15%, or $8 per tonne compared to a year ago. Copper unit costs were also down in both Canadian and U.S. dollar terms and both our copper and zinc business units reported significantly higher profits than in the first quarter of the year. However, our coal business unit profits fell sharply and at the end of June we began our announced program of rotating shutdowns in our coal business unit. During these shutdowns, we expect to be able to reduce inventories while maintaining our unit costs. We may consider additional shutdowns based on our assessment of market conditions. In our zinc business unit we completed the restart of the Pend Oreille mine in the quarter, which is now supplying concentrates to our Trail Operations. We continue to maintain strong discipline on capital spending. The Fort Hills project remains on time and on budget. In April we announced a dividend of $0.15 per share compared to a dividend of $0.45 per share which had been our recent practice. In June we extended the maturity of our US$3.0 billion committed line of credit by one year to July 2020 and augmented our liquidity with the addition of a US$1.2 billion committed line of credit maturing June 2017. Subsequent to quarter end we entered into an additional gold streaming arrangement with RGLD Gold AG, a wholly owned subsidiary of Royal Gold Inc., which provided proceeds of US$162 million. Profit and Adjusted Profit Profit attributable to shareholders was $63 million, or $0.11 per share, in the second quarter compared with $80 million or $0.14 per share in the same period last year. Adjusted profit attributable to shareholders, before items identified in the table below, was $79 million, or $0.14 per share, in the second quarter compared with $72 million or $0.13 per share in the same period last year. The tax item in the current quarter is the effect on our deferred tax balances of a 2% increase in the Alberta corporate tax rate. Performance Gross profit before depreciation and amortization from our coal business unit increased from year ago levels as the benefits of our cost reduction program and lower fuel prices more than offset lower realized coal prices. The average realized coal price of US$95 per tonne was 14% lower than the second quarter of 2014, reflecting oversupplied steelmaking coal market conditions and a large drop in spot price assessments. The favourable effect of a stronger U.S. dollar in the second quarter partly offset the lower coal price, which weakened by 5% in Canadian dollar terms compared with the same period a year ago. Second quarter production of 6.6 million tonnes was 3% higher than the same period a year ago. Unit cash production costs (CAD) at the mines were 15% lower this quarter than in the comparative period as a result of initiatives undertaken through our cost reduction program, slightly higher production rates and lower energy prices. Property, plant and equipment expenditures totaled $23 million in the second quarter, of which $16 million was spent on sustaining capital. Capitalized stripping costs were $108 million in the second quarter compared with $137 million a year ago. We continue to implement the water quality management measures contemplated by our Elk Valley Water Quality Plan. The water treatment facility built at our Line Creek Operations is now expected to be commissioned in the fourth quarter of 2015. Markets Coal prices declined further during the quarter. Although Chinese imports have declined substantially compared to the prior year, demand in the rest of the world has been strong for our products, with record first half sales. Given oversupply in the market, we do not expect a substantial recovery in price until a better market balance is established. Coal prices for the third quarter of 2015 have been agreed with the majority of our quarterly priced customers based on US$93 per tonne for the highest quality products. This is consistent with prices reportedly achieved by our competitors. Additional sales priced on a spot basis will reflect market conditions when sales are concluded. Operations Coal processing performance was excellent. The annual cycle of maintenance shutdowns in our processing facilities was completed during the quarter and processing yields were above budget. Despite slightly higher raw strip ratios, mined material movement was 10% higher in the quarter compared to the same period in 2014, owing largely to improved productivity in our truck and shovel operations, supported somewhat by slightly shorter haul distances. Our cost reduction initiatives continue to produce significant results and remain focused on improvements in equipment and labour productivity, reduced use of contractors, reduced consumable usage and limiting the use of higher cost equipment. However, a number of factors have partially offset the strong performance of our cost reduction program. These included the effects of the strengthening U.S. dollar on some inputs and higher electricity costs. In the second quarter of 2015, we continued to experience the positive effects of lower energy prices. Combined with reduced fuel usage and equipment productivity improvements from a number of our cost reduction initiatives, energy costs per tonne produced have decreased by 37% compared to the second quarter of 2014. In response to current market conditions, we began rotating temporary shutdowns of each of our steelmaking coal operations. Three-week shutdowns will be staggered over the summer months among the operations and began in June. By carefully managing the timing and duration of these shutdowns and drawing from existing inventories of clean coal, we will continue to meet all contracted and committed coal sales for our entire suite of coal products. Additional coal production adjustments will be considered over the course of 2015 as market conditions continue to evolve. On July 11 a localized rainfall event resulted in two separate landslides impacting the main site access road and infrastructure corridor between the mine and plant at the Line Creek Operation. No one was injured and the damage caused to the access road, raw coal conveyor and other infrastructure will be repaired, however, the slides have resulted in a suspension of mining and processing activities at the site, but are not expected to affect overall production or sales for the coal business unit. Cost of Sales Site cash cost of sales in the second quarter of 2015, before depreciation and inventory writedowns, was $45 per tonne, $8 per tonne or 15% lower than a year ago. Our total cost of sales for the quarter also included a $12 per tonne charge for the amortization of deferred stripping costs and $15 per tonne for other depreciation. In U.S. dollar terms, unit costs have fallen by $17 per tonne from $85 per tonne to $68 per tonne due to reductions in the site costs as shown in the Canadian dollar unit cost table and the change in exchange rates. Outlook In response to steelmaking coal market conditions, temporary shutdowns began in June and will be staggered over the summer months among the operations. By carefully managing the timing and duration of these shutdowns and drawing from existing inventories of clean coal, we will continue to meet all contracted and committed coal sales for our entire suite of coal products. The durations of the individual site shutdowns may be varied to account for the loss of production from the Line Creek operation noted above. As a result of the planned temporary shutdowns of our coal mining operations in the third quarter discussed above, production will be reduced by approximately 1.5 million tonnes to 5.7 million tonnes, a reduction of 22% for the quarter, with expected sales to be at least 6 million tonnes. Vessel nominations for quarterly contract shipments are determined by customers and final sales and average prices for the quarter will depend on product mix, market direction for spot priced sales, timely arrival of vessels, as well as the performance of the rail transportation network and coal-loading facilities. On an annual basis, in light of the announced adjustments to our production plans in the third quarter we now expect our 2015 coal production to be in the range of 25 to 26 million tonnes. If market conditions do not improve, we may reduce production further in the fourth quarter. Gross profit before depreciation and amortization from our copper business unit increased by $24 million in the second quarter compared with a year ago (see table below). This was primarily due to higher sales volumes, positive effects of the stronger U.S. dollar and cost reduction efforts, which more than offset lower realized copper prices. Second quarter copper production was 15% higher than the first quarter of 2015. Copper production increased by 6,900 tonnes compared to a year ago, with higher production at all operations except for Duck Pond which ceased operating on June 30, 2015. Copper production at Highland Valley Copper was 4,700 tonnes higher than a year ago primarily due to higher grade and recoveries while our share of production from Antamina increased by 1,300 tonnes as a result of record mill throughput during the quarter. Copper production was also higher at both of our Chilean operations, although production was halted at Quebrada Blanca during the last week of June as a precautionary measure due to unanticipated ground movement. Markets LME copper prices averaged US$2.74 per pound in the second quarter of 2015, up 3.8% over the prior period. Copper prices remained volatile trading off yearly lows shortly after quarter end. Total reported exchange stocks fell 136,000 tonnes during the quarter to 464,000 million tonnes. Total reported global copper stocks are now estimated to be 23 days of global consumption, below the estimated 25 year average of 28.5 days of global consumption. Operational issues at copper mines continue to impact current and future mine production. The large copper surpluses forecast for 2015 have moved closer to balance despite moderating demand growth. Market fundamentals remain positive over the medium term to long term with supply constrained by lower grades and ongoing operational difficulties. Current low prices may exacerbate future supply limitations as more projects are delayed or deferred. Operations Highland Valley Copper Copper production was 40,100 tonnes in the second quarter or 13% higher than a year ago, due to higher copper grades and higher recoveries. Mill throughput was lower than a year ago due to harder ore in the current phase of the Valley pit. Molybdenum production declined to 0.9 million pounds from 1.3 million pounds a year ago primarily due to lower grade, partially offset by higher recovery. Operating costs increased $37 million or 31% than in the same period a year ago as a result of higher sales. Unit costs were similar to a year ago. As we continue to mine the higher grade but harder ore in the current phase of the Valley pit, throughput and grades are expected to remain similar to the first half for the remainder of 2015. A $68 million crusher relocation project for the Valley pit is progressing on schedule and is expected to be complete in the third quarter. This project provides access to over 30 million tonnes of reserves as part of our current life of mine plan. Antamina Copper production in the second quarter increased by 7% compared with a year ago primarily as a result of higher mill throughput. The mix of mill feed in the quarter was 70% copper-only ore and 30% copper-zinc ore compared to 73% and 27%, respectively, in the same period a year ago. Zinc production of 56,400 tonnes in the second quarter increased by 19% compared with a year ago due to higher mill throughput. Antamina achieved record mill throughput of 14.8 million tonnes for the quarter, an average of 163,000 tonnes per day, 16% higher than the same period last year. Recent debottlenecking projects focused primarily on the crushing and conveying system have enabled throughputs much higher than the 130,000 tonnes per day design capacity of the original expansion project. Throughput rates going forward will be dependent on ore hardness and the mix of ore feeds to the plant, but are expected to continue above original design capacity rates. Operating costs in the second quarter were 5% lower compared to a year ago. Significant progress has been made in reducing U.S. dollar unit costs, with savings offset by foreign currency translation and the effects of the weaker Canadian dollar. Quebrada Blanca Copper production in the second quarter increased by 10% compared with a year ago due to higher production from the dump leach circuit. Heap leach ore placed increased by 34%, helped by recent capital improvements to the crushing and agglomeration circuit. Higher than expected ground movement caused some deformation of the buildings and infrastructure in the SX-EW plant area, leading to a temporary shutdown of the facilities and suspension of mining in the area adjacent to the plant as a precautionary measure on June 25. Since then ground movement in the plant area has slowed considerably. Cathode production has now restarted in the south half of the electro-winning (EW) plant to recover copper from recirculating solutions. We continue to assess the full economic and production impact of the situation as we continue geotechnical and structural assessments. We are in discussions with the relevant regulators seeking approval to restart mining in the affected area, including placing a stabilization buttress towards the north end of the plant which will take approximately three months to construct. Once mining in the affected area starts, normal heap leaching activities will resume. In the meantime, mining in other areas of the pit and general maintenance activities are continuing. We expect to operate only the south end of the EW plant at a rate of approximately 40,000 tonnes per annum over the coming weeks while we continue to monitor ground movement and take remedial actions. Production in the second half of 2015 is expected to be reduced by 5,000 to 10,000 tonnes of copper cathode. Operating costs decreased by $8 million or 12% compared with the same period a year ago as a result of lower sales volumes, continued cost reduction efforts and lower supply costs, offset by foreign currency translation and the effects of the weaker Canadian dollar. Work continued to progress on updating the permits for the existing facilities for the supergene operation. The review, response and consultation processes by the relevant regulatory agencies are in progress. We expect to receive approval of the Social and Environmental Impact Assessment (SEIA) submitted in July 2014 by the end of the third quarter. Carmen de Andacollo Copper production in the second quarter increased by 4% compared with a year ago primarily as a result of higher copper grades and recovery. The mill is back to full production rates following a tailing thickener failure in the first quarter and throughput rates similar to the second quarter are anticipated for the remainder of the year. Operating costs increased by $5 million or 7% compared with a year ago due to higher sales. U.S. dollar unit costs were similar for the quarter as lower costs for operating supplies and consumables were offset by foreign currency translation and the effects of the weaker Canadian dollar. In June, Andacollo was charged in connection with alleged environmental infractions. We are in discussions with the environmental authority regarding the charges. A dust decontamination plan for the city of Andacollo was signed into law earlier this year which has specific improvement and reporting requirements over the next two years, including for our operation. We have already made substantial improvements to our dust emissions and are in compliance with all requirements in the plan. We continue working closely with the community, government and other stakeholders to further improve the quality of air in Andacollo. Duck Pond Duck Pond permanently ceased operations on June 30, 2015. Copper and zinc production in the second quarter was 3,200 and 3,900 tonnes, respectively, compared with 4,000 and 4,500 tonnes, respectively, last year. Copper and zinc production declined due to lower ore grades and lower recoveries as the mine approached closure. Cost of Sales Unit cash costs of product sold in the second quarter of 2015 as reported in U.S. dollars, before cash margins for by-products, decreased primarily due to higher sales volumes, continued cost reduction efforts and the favourable effects of a stronger U.S. dollar at our Canadian operations. Copper Development Projects Quebrada Blanca Phase 2 During the second quarter of 2015, activities to support permitting for the Quebrada Blanca Phase 2 project continued, including additional environmental baseline work to support the submission. Optimization efforts continued focused on capital reduction opportunities. Other Copper Projects Targeted studies continue at the Relincho, Galore Creek, Schaft Creek and Mesaba projects as we further explore ways to enhance the value of these projects, and the pre-feasibility study continued to progress at our 50% owned Zafranal copper-gold project located in southern Peru. Outlook Previous production guidance at Quebrada Blanca for 2015 was between 45,000 to 50,000 tonnes of copper. We now expect this to be reduced by 5,000 to 10,000 tonnes as a result of the recent ground movement issues. We expect full year production guidance for copper in the range of 340 to 350 thousand tonnes, in the bottom half of our previous guidance of 340 to 360 thousand tonnes. Performance Gross profit before depreciation and amortization from our zinc business unit increased by $3 million in the second quarter (see table below). Contributing to the increased gross profit was a 2% rise in zinc prices, the favourable effect of the stronger U.S. dollar and an 8% increase in sales volumes from Trail, partially offset by lower sales at Red Dog. Refined zinc production from our Trail Operations increased by 4% compared to last year due to improved operating efficiencies in the electrolytic plant and to the improved reliability of the new acid plant, which led to higher throughput. The table below summarizes the gross profit change, before depreciation and amortization, in our zinc business unit for the quarter. Markets LME zinc prices averaged US$0.99 per pound in the second quarter of 2015, up 5.35% over the prior quarter. Zinc prices were volatile during the quarter hitting both one year lows and highs during the quarter. Reported zinc exchange stocks fell 8,616 tonnes during the quarter to end the quarter at 644,500 tonnes. Total global reported stocks are now estimated at 33.5 days of global consumption down from the 25 year average of 42 days. Combined exchange stocks have now fallen over 900,000 tonnes since peaking in December 2012. Demand for refined zinc in our key North American markets has been moderately challenging this quarter with our customers facing headwinds from a harsh U.S. winter, port closures, reduced spending in the oil sector and a significant increase in imported galvanized sheet. Market turbulence in Asia has also impacted sentiment. Zinc stocks however continue to decline in both metal and concentrates. Zinc supply will become further constrained later in 2015 with planned mine closures taking effect. Operations Red Dog Mill throughput was higher than the second quarter of 2014. Zinc grade was similar and recoveries were higher than 2014 resulting in 9% more zinc production. Both higher lead grade and recoveries than 2014 yielded 16% more lead production. Zinc sales volumes were 14% lower than the second quarter of 2014. Lower sales volumes were due to lower market inventories in the current quarter. Higher treatment charges in the current quarter were offset by higher zinc prices. Operating costs in the current quarter decreased due to lower fuel and freight costs. Capitalized stripping costs were $16 million in the second quarter compared with $8 million a year ago. Trail Zinc production was 4% higher this quarter than in the second quarter of 2014. This was the result of the commissioning of new acid plants in the second quarter of 2014 which resulted in improved acid plant reliability and processing efficiencies. Lead production was impacted by a 15-day annual maintenance shutdown of the KIVCET smelter in June and was 29% lower than a year ago when the annual shutdown occurred in the fourth quarter. Similarly, silver production also decreased by 1.0 million ounces over the same quarter a year ago. Cost of concentrate purchases increased compared to last year due to higher refined zinc production levels combined with higher zinc prices and the Canadian to U.S. dollar exchange rate. Higher operating costs reflected timing of maintenance work performed during shutdowns. Labour costs were slightly higher as the impact of higher wages was partially offset by work force reductions through attrition and lower energy expenses were the result of less consumption during the KIVCET shutdown. Pend Oreille Mill throughput reached design capacity of 2,000 tonnes per day in June. Zinc grade has improved as ore production from more selective, secondary mining stopes increases. Zinc recovery is continuing to improve towards the target of 90% as mill feed rate and grades stabilize. The restart projected capital cost is unchanged at US$41 million compared to the plan of US$45 million. Outlook We now expect the Pend Oreille mine to reach the full production rate of 44,000 tonnes per year of zinc metal by the end of the third quarter of 2015. Additional ground support rehabilitation is required in previously mined areas than anticipated. The ground support is required to permit secondary mining/pillar recovery of higher grade ore sources. The Red Dog concentrate shipping season commenced on June 28, with the first vessel sailing. We expect sales of 170,000 tonnes of contained zinc metal in the third quarter and 200,000 tonnes in the fourth quarter reflecting the normal seasonal pattern of Red Dog sales. ENERGY BUSINESS UNIT Fort Hills Project Construction of the Fort Hills project is progressing substantially in accordance with the project schedule. In the second quarter of 2015 our capital expenditures were $204 million compared with a cash spending estimate of $213 million. Our capital expenditures in 2015 were $447 million to date compared with our cash forecast spending estimate which was $466 million. Our share of Fort Hills cash expenditures in 2015 is estimated at $850 million. Since sanction, the project has achieved and continues to track to key milestones. Engineering activity is progressing well, and is now 85% complete, construction is progressing per plan and is now 35% complete. Equipment and material deliveries are continuing and off-site modular fabrication, site civil works and process facility construction are well underway. Site construction workforce is currently approximately 3,500 and will continue to ramp-up to peak in 2016. The capital cost and schedule outlook have not changed since we announced project sanction in October 2013. First oil is still expected as early as the fourth quarter of 2017, with 90% of our planned production capacity of 180,000 barrels per day (bpd) expected within 12 months. Our share of production is expected to be 36,000 bpd (13 million barrels per year) of bitumen. We are continuing to review options to sell diluted bitumen into the North American and overseas markets which may include the use of pipelines from Hardisty or rail to access U.S. Gulf Coast refineries and tidewater ports. Frontier Energy Project The Frontier project regulatory application review continues with the provincial and federal regulators. We responded to the regulators latest information requests and provided a project update in June 2015. The project update improves the economic and social benefits and overall environmental performance of the project. The revised mine plan incorporates recently acquired adjacent leases and allows for the recovery of an additional 200 million barrels of bitumen for a total recovery of 3.0 billion barrels within a reduced overall project footprint, with lower GHG emissions intensity, lower water use intensity and improvements to our tailings management plan. The earliest anticipated first oil date for our Frontier Project is now 2026, which reflects additional time required for updates to the project in light of a land-swap transaction and revisions to the project scope. The regulatory review process is expected to continue through 2015; making late 2016 the earliest a decision report is expected. Wintering Hills Wind Power Facility During the second quarter, our share of the power generation from Wintering Hills was 33 GWhs, resulting in 21,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent offsets. Our share of expected power generation in 2015 is 135 GWhs, resulting in approximately 85,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent offsets, although actual generation will depend on weather conditions and other factors. OTHER OPERATING COST AND EXPENSES Other operating expenses, net of other income, were $21 million in the second quarter compared with $35 million a year ago. This includes negative pricing adjustments on copper of $43 million and positive pricing adjustments on zinc and lead of $6 million and $4 million, respectively. Finance expense was $78 million in the second quarter, $3 million higher than a year ago. Debt interest expense increased due to the effect of the stronger U.S. dollar, as all our debt and related interest expense is U.S. dollar denominated. We capitalized a total of $55 million in interest in the quarter. Income and resource taxes for the second quarter were $90 million, or 57% of pre-tax profits. This rate is higher than the Canadian statutory rate of 26% mainly as a result of resource taxes and higher rates in foreign jurisdictions. In this quarter, a 2% increase in the Alberta corporate tax rate and other adjustments resulted in an increase in our deferred tax balances, which contributed to the higher rate. Without the effect of these items, our combined income and resources taxes for the quarter would be $68 million and our effective tax rate would be 43%. The combined effect of resource taxes and higher rates in foreign jurisdictions tends to be magnified in periods when our operating earnings are lower relative to our head office administrative and finance charges incurred in Canada. This occurs because resource taxes and taxes in foreign jurisdictions are based on profits before these head office administrative, finance costs and certain other costs. Due to available tax pools, we are currently shielded from cash income taxes, but not resource taxes in Canada. We remain subject to cash taxes in foreign jurisdictions. Our cash position declined from $1.6 billion to $1.3 billion in the quarter. Significant outflows included $204 million on Fort Hills project expenditures. In the second quarter our share of the funding of the Fort Hills project declined from 27.5% to 20% as we completed our earn-in contribution. Our cash balance was augmented in July by US$162 million from the Carmen de Andacollo gold offtake agreement. Our cash flow in the second half of the year will be affected by the seasonality of Red Dog sales and the reduction of inventories. Based on current commodity prices and exchange rates we expect to meet our year-end target of $1.0 billion of cash at existing debt levels. In June in light of recent market conditions and a change in outlook for the industry as a whole, S&P changed the outlook on its BBB- rating of Teck from stable to negative and Moody's changed the outlook on its Baa3 rating of Teck from stable to negative. DBRS rates us BBB with a negative trend and Fitch rates us BBB- with a stable outlook. Operating Cash Flow Cash flow from operations, before changes in non-cash working capital items, was $531 million in the second quarter compared with $520 million a year ago. Changes in working capital items absorbed cash of $199 million in the second quarter. The increase in working capital in the quarter was due to higher inventory levels and lower payables in 2015. This is a matter of the timing of a number of operating items. Investing Activities Expenditures on property, plant and equipment were $204 million in the second quarter for the Fort Hills oil sands project, $83 million on sustaining capital and $11 million on major enhancement projects. The largest components of sustaining expenditures were $16 million at our coal operations and $15 million at Highland Valley Copper. Major enhancement expenditures included approximately $7 million at our coal operations. Capitalized stripping expenditures were $175 million in the second quarter compared with $199 million a year ago. The majority of this item constitutes the advancement of pits for future production at our coal mines. Financing Activities Financing activities in the second quarter consisted of capital lease repayments of $14 million (2014 - $24 million) and debt interest payments of $39 million (2014 - $33 million). We distributed $3 million to minority interests in our operations (2014 - $4 million). In addition, Antamina refinanced a loan of which our portion was $28 million. This is included in both issuance and repayment of debt on our cash flow statement. During the quarter we extended the maturity on our US$3 billion revolving credit facility by one year to July 2020. There were no other changes to the facility's principal terms. We also put in place a new US$1.2 billion revolving credit facility maturing in June 2017 in order to provide additional liquidity should circumstances require it. OUTLOOK We continue to experience challenging markets for our products and prices for some of our products have declined. Commodity markets have historically been volatile, prices can change rapidly and customers can alter shipment plans. This can have a substantial effect on our business. Demand for coal, particularly in China, has weakened substantially. Increased supply from Australian mines has also put downward pressure on coal prices. The weakness in some of these markets may persist for some time and, if of a long-term nature, could affect the fair value of our operating assets, which could require adjustments to company values. We are also significantly affected by foreign exchange rates. In the last six months, the U.S. dollar strengthened by approximately 8% against the Canadian dollar, which has had a positive effect on the profitability of our Canadian operations. It will, to a lesser extent, put upward pressure on the portion of our operating costs and capital spending that is denominated in U.S. dollars. In October 2013, we approved an estimated $2.9 billion (our share) to complete the development of the Fort Hills oil sands project, of which approximately $1.8 billion remains to be spent at the end of June 2015. We have access to cash and credit lines which are expected to be sufficient to meet our capital commitments and working capital needs over this period. We are taking further steps to manage our capital spending profile and we continuously monitor all aspects of our cost reduction program, our capital spending and key markets as conditions evolve. Previous production guidance at Quebrada Blanca for 2015 was between 45,000 to 50,000 tonnes of copper. We now expect this to be reduced by 5,000 to 10,000 tonnes as a result of the recent ground movement issues. We expect full year production guidance for copper in the range of 340 to 350 thousand tonnes, in the bottom half of our previous guidance of 340 to 360 thousand tonnes. In addition, we could be subject to labour unrest or other disturbances as a result of delays in or the failure of negotiations of new contracts, which could limit our ability to maintain coal or copper production in accordance with our plans. If this were to occur, the potential shortfall in planned production could be material. We continue to monitor market conditions for steelmaking coal and further steps to reduce production may be taken in the fourth quarter unless the supply-demand balance in the market improves. Foreign Exchange, Debt Revaluation and Interest Expense The sales of our products are denominated in U.S. dollars, while a significant portion of our expenses are incurred in local currencies, particularly the Canadian dollar and the Chilean peso. Foreign exchange fluctuations can have a significant effect on our operating margins, unless such fluctuations are offset by related changes to commodity prices. Our U.S. dollar denominated debt is subject to revaluation based on changes in the Canadian/U.S. dollar exchange rate. As at June 30, 2015, $6.2 billion of our U.S. dollar denominated debt is designated as a hedge against our foreign operations that have a U.S. dollar functional currency. As a result, any foreign exchange gains or losses arising on that amount of our U.S. dollar debt are recorded in other comprehensive income, with the remainder being charged to profit. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND DERIVATIVES We hold a number of financial instruments and derivatives which are recorded on our balance sheet at fair value with gains and losses in each period included in other comprehensive income and profit for the period as appropriate. The most significant of these instruments are marketable securities, foreign exchange forward sales contracts, metal-related forward contracts and settlements receivable and payable. Some of our gains and losses on metalrelated financial instruments are affected by smelter price participation and are taken into account in determining royalties and other expenses. All are subject to varying rates of taxation depending on their nature and jurisdiction. OUTSTANDING SHARE DATA As at July 22, 2015 there were 566.8 million Class B subordinate voting shares and 9.4 million Class A common shares outstanding. In addition, there were 16.1 million director and employee stock options outstanding with exercise prices ranging between $4.15 and $58.80 per share. More information on these instruments and the terms of their conversion is set out in Note 19 of our 2014 audited financial statements. INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Any system of internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. There have been no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2015 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS - IMPAIRMENT TESTING In preparing consolidated financial statements, management makes estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses across all reportable segments. Management makes estimates and judgments that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our estimates and judgments are based on historical experience and other factors we consider to be reasonable, including expectations of future events. Critical accounting estimates and judgments are those that could affect the consolidated financial statements materially, are highly uncertain and where changes are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Impairment testing is an area that requires significant judgment, both in assessing whether certain factors would be considered an indicator of impairment and when an indicator is present, determining the assumptions used in preparing discounted cash models. We consider both internal and external information to determine whether there is an indicator of impairment present and accordingly, when impairment testing is required. When impairment testing is required, discounted cash flow models are used to estimate the recoverable amounts of respective assets. Significant assumptions used in preparing these discounted cash flow models include commodity prices, reserves and resources, operating costs, capital expenditures, discount rates, foreign exchange rates, tax assumptions and inflation rates. These inputs are based on management's best estimates of what an independent market participant would consider appropriate and are reviewed by senior management. Changes in these inputs may alter the results of impairment testing, the amount of impairment charges recorded in the statement of income and the resulting carrying values of assets. During the second quarter we performed a detailed review of impairment indicators across all of our operations and assets. For Teck Coal, Quebrada Blanca and Carmen de Andacollo, we perform impairment testing of our goodwill annually. Our last goodwill impairment test was completed as at October 31, 2014. Since that date, we have not identified an indicator of impairment for any of our cash-generating units that would require us to perform an updated analysis of our impairment with the exception of Fort Hills, which is outlined in more detail below. Even in the absence of an indicator of impairment, we continuously assess commodity prices, discount rates, operating costs, capital expenditures and other key assumptions to determine what effect, if any, updated information could have on our most recent impairment test results. Based on this analysis, we have not identified any significant changes in our assumptions since our disclosures as at December 31, 2014. We have provided further detail below on the sensitivity of our Teck Coal mine sites to impairment since our previous disclosure considered goodwill sensitivity only. Fort Hills During the second quarter, in light of conditions in the oil market, we performed an analysis of impairment of our 20% interest in the Fort Hills project and did not identify an impairment loss. We account for our investment in Fort Hills as a joint operation and record our share of the assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and cash flows from the operation. As at June 30, 2015, our net carrying value for our 20% interest in the Fort Hills project was approximately $2.3 billion. The majority of our carrying value is classified as mineral properties and leases within property, plant and equipment. The recoverable amount of our 20% interest in Fort Hills was estimated on a fair value less cost of disposal basis. Fair value less cost of disposal was estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology taking into account assumptions likely to be made by market participants. Cash flow projections are based on the life of mine plan for Fort Hills and the cash flows cover a period of 56 years. Given the nature of expected cash flows used to estimate the recoverable amount, material changes could occur over time as the cash flows are significantly affected by the key assumptions used to estimate the fair value less cost of disposal. For the purposes of estimating the recoverable amount, we have applied an assumed long-term WTI oil price of US$82/barrel and our share of estimated remaining development capital expenditures of $1.8 billion. Based on these assumptions, the estimated recoverable amount in respect of our interest in Fort Hills exceeds the carrying value by a significant amount. The recoverable amount is sensitive to changes in key assumptions and future changes in these assumptions, individually or in combination, could result in the recoverable amount being less than the carrying value and an impairment adjustment might result. Teck Coal The recoverable amounts of our coal operations are most sensitive to the long-term commodity price and foreign exchange rate assumptions. Our last impairment test performed in 2014 used a long-term coal price of US$185/tonne. We note that at a US/CAD exchange rate of 1.25, a reduction in the long-term price of greater than 24% to below US$140 per tonne would be required before our recoverable fair market value fell below our current carrying value for the coal business unit as a whole and this is without including the benefit of the on-going cost reduction program that has been implemented in the first six months of 2015 and cost reductions that could be implemented in a lower price environment going forward. ADOPTION OF NEW AND AMENDED IFRS PRONOUNCEMENTS Accounting Developments New IFRS pronouncements that have been issued but are not yet effective are listed below. We plan to apply the new standard or interpretation in the annual period for which it is required. Revenue from Contracts with Customers In May 2014, the IASB and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) completed their joint project to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue and to develop a common revenue standard for IFRS and United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U.S. GAAP). As a result of the joint project, the IASB issued IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (IFRS 15) to replace IAS 18, Revenue and IAS 11, Construction Contracts and the related interpretations on revenue recognition. The new revenue standard introduces a single principles-based five-step model for the recognition of revenue when control of a good or service is transferred to the customer. The five steps are: identify the contract(s) with the customer, identify the performance obligations in the contract, determine transaction price, allocate the transaction price, and recognize revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied. IFRS 15 also requires enhanced disclosures about revenue to help investors better understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows from contracts with customers, and improves the comparability of revenue from contracts with customers. In May 2015, the IASB issued an exposure draft that proposes to delay the effective of IFRS 15 by one year to annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018 to align with the timing of the new U.S. GAAP revenue standard. IFRS 15 is currently effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The comment period for the exposure draft ended July 3, 2015. We are assessing the effect of this standard on our financial statements. Financial Instruments IFRS 9, Financial Instruments (IFRS 9), addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. The IASB has previously issued versions of IFRS 9 that introduced new classification and measurement requirements (in 2009 and 2010) and a new hedge accounting model (in 2013). The July 2014 publication of IFRS 9 is the completed version of the Standard, replacing earlier versions of IFRS 9 and superseding the guidance relating to the classification and measurement of financial instruments in IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement (IAS 39). IFRS 9 requires financial assets to be classified into three measurement categories on initial recognition: those measured at fair value through profit and loss, those measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, and those measured at amortized cost. Investments in equity instruments are required to be measured by default at fair value through profit or loss. However, there is an irrevocable option to present fair value changes in other comprehensive income. Measurement and classification of financial assets is dependent on the entity's business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset. For financial liabilities, the standard retains most of the IAS 39 requirements. The main change is that, in cases where the fair value option is taken for financial liabilities, the part of a fair value change relating to an entity's own credit risk is recorded in other comprehensive income rather than the income statement, unless this creates an accounting mismatch. IFRS 9 introduces a new three-stage expected credit loss model for calculating impairment for financial assets. IFRS 9 no longer requires a triggering event to have occurred before credit losses are recognized. An entity is required to recognize expected credit losses when financial instruments are initially recognized and to update the amount of expected credit losses recognized at each reporting date to reflect changes in the credit risk of the financial instruments. In addition, IFRS 9 requires additional disclosure requirements about expected credit losses and credit risk. The new hedging section of the final IFRS 9 standard remains relatively unchanged from when the new hedging accounting section of IFRS 9 was second introduced in November 2013. The new hedge accounting model aligns hedge accounting with risk management activities undertaken by an entity. Components of both financial and non-financial items will now be eligible for hedge accounting, as long as the risk component can be identified and measured. The new hedge accounting model includes eligibility criteria that must be met, but these criteria are based on an economic assessment of the strength of the hedging relationship. New disclosure requirements relating to hedge accounting will be required and are meant to simplify existing disclosure. The IASB currently has a separate project on macro hedging activities and until the project is completed, the IASB has provided a policy choice for entities to either apply the hedge accounting model in IFRS 9 or IAS 39 in full. Additionally, there is a hybrid option to use IAS 39 to account for macro hedges only and to use IFRS 9 for all other hedges. Turqoise Hill Resources Ltd. (TSE: TRQ) Turquoise Hill Resources (TRQ: TSX, NYSE & NASDAQ) is an international mining company with copper-gold and coal mines in the Asia Pacific region. Principal assets: A 66% interest in Oyu Tolgoi, one of the world's largest copper-gold-silver mines now producing and shipping concentrate to customers in China. A 22.63% interest in established Mongolian coal miner SouthGobi Resources (SGQ: TSX, 1878: HK). Turquoise Hill announces financial results and review of operations for the second quarter of 2015 VANCOUVER, CANADA - Turquoise Hill Resources today announced its financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2015. All figures are in US dollars unless otherwise stated. HIGHLIGHTS On May 18, 2015, the Oyu Tolgoi Underground Mine Development and Financing Plan were signed addressing key outstanding shareholder matters and setting out long-term funding of the project. Following signing of the Underground Mine Development and Financing Plan, Turquoise Hill and Rio Tinto are advancing project financing and updating the underground feasibility study. Oyu Tolgoi achieved a solid safety performance with an All Injury Frequency Rate of 0.22 per 200,000 hours worked for the first half of 2015. Oyu Tolgoi recorded revenue of $421.3 million in Q2'15 on sales of 189,800 tonnes of concentrate, a 1.2% reduction over Q1'15 reflecting lower gold prices partially offset by higher concentrate sales. Turquoise Hill reported income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders of $49.9 million. Turquoise Hill generated operating cash flow of $239.2 million during Q2'15, an increase of 127.2% over Q1'15. Concentrate production for Q2'15 increased 64.6% over Q1'15 due to a 20.1% increase in concentrator throughput and higher head grades. In Q2'15, Oyu Tolgoi delivered record-setting concentrate production and throughput. Copper and gold in concentrates for Q2'15 increased 64.6% and 176.7% respectively over Q1'15. Oyu Tolgoi began accessing higher-grade material in Q2'15 and mining and processing of higher-grade ore is expected to continue into the second half of 2015. Turquoise Hill continues to expect Oyu Tolgoi to produce 175,000 to 195,000 tonnes of copper and 600,000 to 700,000 ounces of gold in concentrates in 2015. On July 9, 2015, Oyu Tolgoi marked the second anniversary of its first shipment of concentrate. Turquoise Hill's cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2015 were $1.2 billion. FINANCIAL RESULTS In Q2'15, the Company recorded net income attributable to owners of Turquoise Hill of $24.9 million ($0.01 per share) compared with net income of $7.9 million ($nil per share) in Q2'14, an increase of $17.0 million. Results for Q2'15 reflect the impact of lower production costs, partly offset by one-time charges and adjustments relating to agreements made as part of the Oyu Tolgoi Underground Mine Development and Financing Plan signed on May 18, 2015, and loss on partial divestment of SouthGobi on April 23, 2015. Operating cash flows in Q2'15 were $239.2 million compared with $153.8 million in Q2'14, reflecting production and delivery cost improvements, effective working capital management, and receipts relating to sales shipments not collected from the warehouse by customers at the period end. These benefits contributed to a $133.9 million increase compared with Q1'15. Additions to property, plant and equipment were $36.4 million in Q2'15, including approximately $33.9 million for sustaining capital activities including the tailing storage facility. Turquoise Hill's cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2015 were $1.2 billion. OYU TOLGOI The Oyu Tolgoi mine is approximately 550 kilometres south of Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia's capital city, and 80 kilometres north of the Mongolia-China border. Mineralization on the property consists of porphyry-style copper, gold, silver and molybdenum contained in a linear structural trend (the Oyu Tolgoi Trend) that has a strike length extending over 26 kilometres. Mineral resources have been identified in a series of deposits throughout this trend. They include, from south to north, the Heruga Deposit, the Southern Oyu deposits (Southwest Oyu, South Oyu, Wedge and Central Oyu) and the Hugo Dummett deposits (Hugo South, Hugo North and Hugo North Extension). Mining of ore commenced in May 2012 and first concentrate was produced in January 2013. The Oyu Tolgoi mine has initially been developed as an open-pit operation. A copper concentrator plant, with related facilities and necessary infrastructure to support a nominal throughput of 100,000 tonnes of ore per day, has been constructed to process ore mined from the Southern Oyu open pit. Long term development plans for Oyu Tolgoi are based on a 95,000-tonne-per-day underground block-cave mine. In August 2013, development of the underground mine was delayed pending resolution of matters with the Government of Mongolia, which was reached on May 18, 2015. Oyu Tolgoi Underground Mine Development and Financing Plan On May 18, 2015, Turquoise Hill, the Government of Mongolia and Rio Tinto announced the signing of the Oyu Tolgoi Underground Mine Development and Financing Plan (the Underground Plan), which addressed key outstanding shareholder matters and set out an agreed basis for the funding of the project. The Underground Plan confirmed the project cost for Oyu Tolgoi's initial construction and development and reinforced the principles set out in the Investment Agreement and the Amended and Restated Shareholders Agreement (ARSHA). The agreements addressed key outstanding matters including the following specific items: tax matters, the 2% net smelter royalty, sales royalty calculation and management services payments. The agreements also addressed the sourcing of power for Oyu Tolgoi from within Mongolia. The overall value impact for the Company in connection with the agreements is less than 2% of the value of the reserve case of $7.4 billion presented in the 2014 Oyu Tolgoi Technical Report. In 2003, Turquoise Hill acquired a 2% net smelter royalty from BHP Billiton. The enforceability of the royalty was challenged by the Assistant General Prosecutor of Mongolia under Mongolian law. The Company determined, as part of the Underground Plan negotiated, that it would not contest its right to receive payment and consequently recognized a charge of $36.8 million in Q2'15 for write-off of the original royalty acquisition cost. In June 2014, Oyu Tolgoi LLC received a Tax Act (Tax Assessment) from the Mongolian Tax Authority as a result of a general tax audit for the period 2010 through 2012. Oyu Tolgoi appealed the assessment and in September 2014 received a response reducing the amount of tax, interest and penalties claimed to be payable, from approximately $127.0 million to approximately $30.0 million. In a separate agreement with the Government of Mongolia, Oyu Tolgoi agreed, without accepting liability and without creating a precedent, to pay the amount of the determination by way of settlement to resolve the tax matter. A final charge of $22.1 million has been recognized in Q2'15 for settlement of amounts not previously paid or provided for in relation to the Tax Assessment. The parties agreed that Oyu Tolgoi's 5% sales royalty paid to the Government of Mongolia will be calculated on gross revenues by not allowing deductions for the costs of processing, freight differentials, penalties or payables. Oyu Tolgoi has recalculated royalties payable accordingly since the commencement of sales and submitted an additional amount payable in Q2'15 of approximately $17.1 million to the Government, which includes approximately $14.5 million on previous years' sales. Notwithstanding the terms of the ARSHA, the parties agreed that in calculating the Management Services Payment (MSP), the rate applied to capital costs of the underground development will be 3% instead of 6%, as provided by the ARSHA. The MSP rate on operating cost and capital related to current operations remains at 6%. In accordance with the ARSHA, 50% of the MSP is payable to Turquoise Hill and 50% to Rio Tinto. Oyu Tolgoi LLC and Turquoise Hill agreed to prepare and submit working assumptions for possible support of Oyu Tolgoi LLC's obligations under a potential power purchase arrangement from the Tavan Tolgoi power plant project. Next steps toward the underground development include updating and receiving approval of the underground feasibility study and completing the approximate $4.0 billion in project financing. Turquoise Hill continues to expect signing of project financing by the end of 2015. The 2015 Oyu Tolgoi Feasibility Study, which was submitted to the Mongolian Minerals Council (the MMC) in March 2015, has been tentatively accepted pending an update of schedules and alignment with the Underground Plan. This update is due to be resubmitted to the MMC in September 2015. Ahead of final approval of the project by the Turquoise Hill, Rio Tinto and Oyu Tolgoi boards, an update to the capital estimate will be completed in parallel with other pre-start activities. The preferred engineering, procurement and construction management contractor has been engaged to complete this work along with some critical path detailed engineering. Underground development prior to August 2013 suspension Prior to the suspension in August 2013, underground lateral development at Hugo North had advanced approximately 16 kilometres off Shaft #1. Sinking of Shaft #2, the primary operations access and initial production hoisting shaft, had reached a depth of 1,168 metres below surface, 91% of its final depth of 1,284 metres. The 96 metre-high Shaft #2 concrete headframe has been constructed. Sinking of Shaft #5, a dedicated exhaust ventilation shaft, had reached a depth of 208 metres, 17% of its final depth of 1,174 metres. Surface facilities, including offices, mine dry, and workshop, are in place to support initial pre-production development and construction. Care and maintenance activities have continued for Shaft #1, facilities and mobile equipment. Ground remediation work is underway and execution readiness activities have commenced in preparation for restarting underground development. Q2'15 performance Safety continues to be a major focus throughout Oyu Tolgoi's operations and the mine's management is committed to reducing risk and injury. Oyu Tolgoi achieved a solid safety performance with an All Injury Frequency Rate of 0.22 per 200,000 hours worked for the first half of 2015. Revenue in Q2'15 decreased by 1.2% over Q1'15. Lower revenues reflect a fall in gold prices, partially offset by higher volumes of copper-gold concentrate sales. The Q2'15 mix of revenue by metals is the result of inventory with lower contained gold drawn down during the quarter from concentrate produced in Q1'15. Gross margin at 46.4% for the quarter increased from 39.5% in Q1'15, due to the combined effect of higher overall volumes sold and cost improvements as Oyu Tolgoi continued to optimize operations, which offset the impact of lower gold sales. Production and delivery costs include primarily the cash costs in inventory sold as well as allocated mine administration costs. Depreciation and depletion includes the depreciation and depletion in inventory sold as well as any depreciation of assets used in the selling and delivery process, including the depreciation of capitalized production phase stripping costs. Total additions capitalized to property, plant and equipment, on an accruals basis, for Q2'15 were $36.4 million (Q2'14: $44.8 million) and comprised approximately $33.9 million for sustaining activities, including the tailings storage facility and deferred stripping. Total cash operating costs at Oyu Tolgoi in Q2'15 were $284.6 million. Following transition to IFRS, the 5% royalty payable to the Government of Mongolia, previously deducted from revenue, is reflected as a cash operating expense, and production phase stripping costs, previously included within cash operating expense, are capitalized and depreciated. During Q2'15, Oyu Tolgoi continued to improve and optimize operations in order to reduce costs across the mine's operation. Oyu Tolgoi's C1 costs in Q2'15 were $0.73 per pound, compared with $0.09 per pound in Q1'15. The increase is driven by reduced by-product credits compared with Q1'15 as inventory with lower contained gold content was sold during the quarter, combined with the impact of certain adjustments relating to the signing of the Underground Plan on May 18, 2015. The adverse impact on C1 costs of reduced by-product revenue and Underground Plan adjustments was partly offset by the impact of higher production volumes. Oyu Tolgoi's openpit mine has a high-grade zone containing a large proportion of gold in addition to copper; Turquoise Hill anticipates quarterly fluctuation of C1 costs as the quantity of gold in concentrates sold varies after ore from this zone is fed through the mill. Income from continuing operations attributable to owners of Turquoise Hill in Q2'15 has been reduced by a charge of $36.8 million for write-off of the net smelter royalty purchased from BHP Billiton in 2003, and by owners' share of adjustments to Oyu Tolgoi segment income following signing of the Oyu Tolgoi Underground Mine Development and Financing Plan on May 18. Adjustments to the Oyu Tolgoi segment income mainly relate to: recalculation of prior periods' sales royalties to the Government of Mongolia ($17.1 million); and payment agreed for settlement of the June 2014 Tax Assessment ($22.1 million). Oyu Tolgoi began accessing higher-grade material in Q2'15. Record-setting concentrate production for Q2'15 increased 64.6% over Q1'15 due to a 20.1% increase in concentrator throughput and higher head grades. Throughput for Q2'15 also set records for Oyu Tolgoi. Copper and gold in concentrates increased 64.6% and 176.7% respectively over Q1'15. Funding of Oyu Tolgoi by Turquoise Hill In accordance with the ARSHA dated June 8, 2011, Turquoise Hill has funded Oyu Tolgoi's cash requirements beyond internally generated cash flows by a combination of equity investment and shareholder debt. For amounts funded by debt, Oyu Tolgoi must repay such amounts, including accrued interest, before it can pay common share dividends. At June 30, 2015, the aggregate outstanding balance of shareholder loans extended by subsidiaries of the Company to Oyu Tolgoi was $6.8 billion, including accrued interest of $1.4 billion. These loans bear interest at an effective annual rate of LIBOR plus 6.5%. Subsidiaries of the Company have accrued $135.8 million in deferred tax liabilities for the withholding taxes due upon payment of the accrued interest by Oyu Tolgoi. In Q2'15, Oyu Tolgoi repaid a total amount of $152.0 million with respect to these loans, including accrued interest of $47.7 million. In accordance with the ARSHA, a subsidiary of the Company has funded the common share investments in Oyu Tolgoi on behalf of Erdenes. These funded amounts earn interest at an effective annual rate of LIBOR plus 6.5% and are repayable, by Erdenes to a subsidiary of the Company, via a pledge over Erdenes' share of Oyu Tolgoi common share dividends. Erdenes also has the right to reduce the outstanding balance by making cash payments at any time. As at June 30, 2015, the cumulative amount of such funding was $751.1 million, representing approximately 34% of invested common share equity; unrecognized interest on the funding amounted to $199.1 million. Operational outlook A planned concentrator shutdown at Oyu Tolgoi was successfully completed in July 2015. Initial assessment of the improvement projects completed appears positive. Production of higher-grade ore is expected to continue into the second half of 2015. Oyu Tolgoi's metal production, especially gold, is strongly dependent on the proportion of ore treated from the high-grade zone. During the second half of the year, copper production is expected to be higher than the first half while gold production is expected to moderate as grades begin to decline in the later part of Q3'15. Turquoise Hill continues to expect Oyu Tolgoi to produce 175,000 to 195,000 tonnes of copper and 600,000 to 700,000 ounces of gold in concentrates in 2015. Sales contracts have been signed for 100% of Oyu Tolgoi's expected 2015 concentrate production. Q2'15 exploration Oyu Tolgoi's exploration strategy is focused on developing a project pipeline prioritized in areas that can impact the current development of the Oyu Tolgoi orebodies, seeking low-cost development options; in particular looking for shallower targets. Historical datasets are added to and reinterpreted to enable future discovery. SOUTHGOBI - HELD FOR SALE On April 23, 2015, the Company completed sale of 48.7 million shares in SouthGobi to Novel Sunrise Investments Limited (NSI) at a price of C$0.35 per common share payable in cash, and on June 3, 2015 a further 1.7 million shares were sold to NSI at a price of C$0.35 per share. Half of the aggregate cash proceeds, representing C$8.5 million in total, was received at closing and the balance of approximately C$8.5 million will be payable on the first anniversary of closing. A loss on divestment of $20.2 million has been recorded in Q2'15; the loss arose as a result of the price per share divested being below the quoted share price on which the carrying value was based. The carrying value of the Company's remaining interest in SouthGobi at June 30, 2015 was $33.1 million based on the quoted share price at that date. At June 30, 2015, Turquoise Hill owned 54.4 million SouthGobi common shares, representing approximately 22.6% of the issued and outstanding SouthGobi shares at that date. On May 1, 2015, Turquoise Hill announced that a previously announced share purchase agreement with National United Resources Holdings Limited (NUR), which provided for the sale to NUR of 56.1 million shares in the capital of SouthGobi, had expired on April 30, 2015 without the transaction contemplated thereunder having been completed. At June 30, 2015, SouthGobi is classified as an investment in associate in the Company's financial statements. Following completion of the sale to NSI, and consequent loss of control such that Turquoise Hill is no longer the largest single shareholder, the Company's exposures in relation to its investment in SouthGobi include, but are not wholly limited to: factors having an impact on fair value, and ability to complete divestment of its remaining interest in the future; and possible recognition of a proportionate share of losses and liabilities of SouthGobi. CORPORATE ACTIVITIES Election of directors The nominees set forth in the Company's management proxy circular dated March 20, 2015 were elected as directors of Turquoise Hill at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders, which took place on May 8, 2015. Series D Warrants expire unexercised The Company's Series D and Anti-Dilution Series D Warrants (the Warrants) expired on May 22, 2015 unexercised. The Warrants were acquired by Rio Tinto in conjunction with the 2012 Memorandum of Agreement. The Series D Warrants were exercisable to purchase 74,247,460 common shares of the Company at a price of $8.20 per common share. The Anti-Dilution Series D Warrants were exercisable to purchase 74,247,460 common shares of the Company at a price of $4.31 per common share. NON-GAAP MEASURES The Company's financial results are prepared in accordance with IFRS. In addition, the Company presents and refers to the following measures (non-GAAP measures) which are not defined in IFRS. A description and calculation of these measures is given below, and may differ in some aspects from equivalent measures provided by other issuers. Cash operating costs This measure comprises Oyu Tolgoi cash operating costs, and is presented in order to provide investors and other stakeholders in the Company with a greater understanding of performance and operations at Oyu Tolgoi. The measure of cash operating costs excludes: depreciation and depletion; exploration and evaluation; charges for asset write-down (including write-down of materials and supplies inventory), and includes management services payments to Rio Tinto, and management services payments to Turquoise Hill which are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements of the Company. C1 cash costs C1 cash costs is a metric representing the cash cost per unit of extracting and processing the Company's principal metal product to a condition in which it may be delivered to customers, net of by-product credits. It is provided in order to support peer group comparability and to provide investors and other stakeholders' useful information about the underlying cash costs of Oyu Tolgoi and the impact of by-product credits on the operations' cost structure. C1 cash costs are relevant to understanding the Company's operating profitability and ability to generate cash flow. When calculating costs associated with producing a pound of copper, the Company includes gold and silver revenue credits as the production cost is reduced as a result of selling these by-products. Turquoise Hill's principal metal product is copper, and C1 cash costs are reported for Oyu Tolgoi only. All-in sustaining costs All-in sustaining costs (AISC) is an extended cash based cost metric, providing further information on the aggregate cash, capital and overhead outlay per unit, and is intended to reflect the costs of producing the Company's principal metal product over the life-cycle of its operations. The measure seeks to reflect the full cost of copper production from current operations and as a result development project capital is not included. AISC allows Turquoise Hill to assess the ability of Oyu Tolgoi to support sustaining capital expenditures for future production from the generation of operating cash flows QUALIFIED PERSON Disclosure of a scientific or technical nature in this MD&A in respect of the Oyu Tolgoi mine was prepared under the supervision of Bernard Peters (responsibility for overall preparation and mineral reserves), B. Eng. (Mining), FAusIMM (201743), employed by OreWin as Technical Director - Mining and Kendall Cole-Rae (responsibility for mineral resources, geology and exploration), B.Sc.

Each of these individuals is a \"qualified person\" as that term is defined in NI 43-101."}, {"title": "Farmers use drones and data to boost crop yields; Drones have long been used for military purposes, but Nova Scotia-based start-up Sky Squirrel Technologies Inc. has found a more peaceful use for the technology.", "article": "Drones have long been used for military purposes, but Nova Scotia-based start-up Sky Squirrel Technologies Inc. has found a more peaceful use for the technology. Sky Squirrel deploys small drones equipped with infrared cameras to cruise the skies over vineyards, sending back images that help growers monitor for moisture level, disease, rot, insect damage and general crop health - all things that contribute to the quality of the grapes and the resulting wine. In the past, farmers would have had to walk their fields, taking samples back to send off to the lab. \"If you have hundreds of acres, that is just not feasible,\" says Richard van der Put, the Swiss-born co-founder and chief technology officer for Sky Squirrel. In comparison, the company's drone technology takes as many as 500 images during a single flight. \"Our clients send the images to us via the cloud and we combine them into a map,\" says van der Put. \"Then we use a specialized image algorithm that allows us to assess crop health.\" With the help of GPS positioning on their mobile devices, farmers, \"can see where they are currently in the field and correlate that with the analysis\" to pinpoint areas of concern, van der Put says. The result: One client managed to reduce his water usage by a third. And the system has proven 97 per cent effective at detecting diseases like Flavesence Doree - which mainly affects European vineyards. It also picks up leafroll - a disease that can devastate vineyards, wiping out 30 to 50 per cent of the crop. Just six months into its first year of sales, Sky Squirrel had already achieved its one-year revenue target of $150,000, with clients in Chile, France, Spain, Romania, Switzerland and Canada. And it is just one of the many Canadian tech companies that have taken a bead on the agricultural market, according to Doug Knox, vice-president of technology for Bioenterprise Corp., a non-profit business accelerator that specializes in agricultural technology. \"The large corporate farm is here to stay,\" says Knox. \"And technology will increasingly be a driving force in terms of greater efficiency and production.\" Nonetheless, he contends, the agricultural market remains a challenge for young companies, mainly because it is so diverse and fractured. \"Corn producers don't have the same needs as wheat farmers or canola producers,\" explains Knox. \"The biggest barrier to entry to the agricultural market is creating awareness.\" Sky Squirrel overcame that barrier by targeting a specific niche (vineyards), with the intention of building out its solution to cover other crops in future. Similarly Resson Aerospace of Fredericton has teamed up with McCain foods to use drone technology to collect information that can help farmers reduce spraying and increase yields in potato fields. Other companies have focused on technology with a wider application. Manitoba-based Farmers Edge Precision Consulting Inc. got its start in founder Wade Barnes's basement 10 years ago with a general focus on precision agriculture and agronomics - basically using comprehensive data to boost farmers' yields and lower their fertilizer usage. The company uses satellite images to identify where to plant, how much fertilizer to use and when and how much to irrigate - allowing farmers to increase yields and lower fertilizer and water usage (hence costs). By 2014, it had been named one of Canada's Fastest Growing Companies by Profit magazine and had received a significant equity investment by blue-chip Silicon Valley venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers (KPCB). Food safety is another area of agriculture ripe for innovation, says Knox. He points to the \"geofencing\" software developed by Guelph-based startup Be Seen Be Safe with the goal of preventing the spread of diseases such as avian influenza (bird flu) and porcine epidemic virus from farm to farm. Anyone with the Be Seen Be Safe app on their smartphone or tablet automatically triggers a signal the moment they enter a geofenced property. \"When there's a disease outbreak, we can basically hit a button and have it automatically show us where the people who've been on the potentially infectious farm came from and where they went,\" says the company's president and CEO Tim Nelson. Mississauga, Ont.-based AbCelex Technologies Inc. has honed in on the burgeoning problem of antibiotic resistance in North America. Administering antibiotics to animals reduces food-borne pathogens that can cause illness, says president and CEO Saeid Babaei. But it also contributes to the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant infections in humans. Babaei and his partner Dr. Ali Riazi - both molecular biologists with a string of degrees - founded AbCelex in 2010. Their aim: to modify a specific type of antibody found in the guts of camels to create an antibiotic-free additive for agricultural feed products or water capable of guarding against dangerous bacteria like Campylobacter and Salmonella. The pair's research focused on ensuring the anti-microbial additive could withstand the heat generated during feed production, as well as the digestion process in a feed animal's gut. And it had to be cost-effective. Says Babaei: \"People won't buy a chicken in the grocery store if the cost goes up from $7 to $20.\" In 2014, AbCelex got a vote of confidence in the form of a $2-million in Series A financing from Cultivian Sandbox, a leading U.S. venture fund specializing in agriculture and food. The company is currently engaged in field trials and expects its feed additive to be on the market by 2017. \"And that's a conservative estimate,\" says Babaei.

(\"GVIC\" or the \"Company\") (TSX:GCT) reported cash flow, earnings and revenue for the period ended June 30, 2015. Summary Results The following results are presented on an adjusted basis(1) to include the Company's share of its joint venture operations on a proportionate basis, because this is the basis on which management bases its operating decisions and performance. For a reconciliation to results in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), refer to the \"Reconciliation of IFRS to Adjusted Results\" as presented below and in Management's Discussion & Analysis (MD&A).  Transformation Strategy To address the challenges facing some of the businesses, the Company has been implementing a strategy to transform its business and focus efforts on a narrower spectrum of operating sectors in order to deploy resources and capital in areas where long-term growth opportunities can best be realized, and GVIC has a strong competitive position. GVIC's core focus is to operate as an information & marketing solutions company pursuing growth in sectors where the provision of essential information & related services provides high customer utility & value. The related \"go to market\" strategy is being implemented through two operational segments:  Sector Focus As part of this transformational strategy, the decision was made to focus growth efforts on the following sectors:  These spaces are dynamic and their changing and continually evolving needs are expected to increase the demand and value relating to information, intelligence and marketing solutions. Community Media. The community media business is maturing and print revenue has been declining as a result of the shift to digital media, which continues to impact the Company's results. However, these operations generate significant cash flow and provide scale for the Company. The products still provide value for advertisers, and opportunities exist to leverage the local brands, marketing reach and customer relationships to generate new revenues. Efforts will be made to restructure community media assets to create greater direct value and simplicity for GVIC, or monetize where appropriate value can be realized. The Company's objective is to grow its business information assets and the portion of cash flow generated by these operations, which have higher growth profiles and valuations, and harvest the cash flow from community media assets and reduce the related financial and operating exposure. Target Leverage. Management is seeking to reduce senior debt levels to less than $50 million, such that ongoing debt can be supported by the business information operations, and the community media operations can provide free cash flow for investment purposes, further debt reduction and financial flexibility. Business Information Revenue and Profitability. In 2014, GVIC's business information operations earned $27.8 million of adjusted EBITDA (before corporate costs) on $93.3 million of adjusted revenue (excluding the assets that were sold in January 2015):  Almost half of this EBITDA comes from rich data digital information products and services. These rich data digital information products and services have a high level of profitability and recurring revenue streams. Business information businesses trade at higher valuations, typically 7x-15x+ EBITDA, depending on their attributes. For the six months ending June 30, 2015, GVIC's business information assets generated $13.0 million of adjusted EBITDA (before corporate costs) on $48.0 million of adjusted revenue. See Note 20 to the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements - Segmented Disclosure. The Company's business information operations have generated strong organic growth and value historically and continue to perform well. Despite weak commodities markets, the agriculture and natural resources group remain highly profitable. While advertising revenue has fallen in these sectors, electronic subscription and data related sales have been resilient. The environmental risk, mutual fund and digital real estate businesses are all generating strong growth in 2015. Operational Overview 12 Aug 2015 21:23 ET Press Release: GVIC Reports Second Quarter Results -2- Business Information  Community Media  Profitability Measures. In addition to a wide range of new revenue initiatives and focus on higher-margin revenues, comprehensive cost management and restructuring efforts are being implemented to improve profitability over the remainder of the year. Near-Term Initiatives  Financial Position On an adjusted basis, including the Company's share of the joint venture interests, GVIC's consolidated debt net of cash outstanding before deferred financing charges was 2.7x trailing 12-months EBITDA as at June 30, 2015. GVIC's consolidated debt (excluding joint ventures), net of cash outstanding before deferred financing charges, was $91.7 million as at June 30, 2015. Reconciliation of IFRS to Adjusted Results The following table is a reconciliation of the IFRS results to the adjusted results (which include the Company's proportionate share of its joint venture operations). Refer to the MD&A for further discussion and analysis of these results:  12 Aug 2015 21:23 ET Press Release: GVIC Reports Second Quarter -3-  The qualitative discussion of the second quarter 2015 results in this President's Message is relevant and applicable for the adjusted results and the IFRS results. Outlook Economic conditions have weakened significantly in 2015 in Western Canada, particularly in energy and agriculture, and remain challenging. Structural challenges continue to exist in community media. However, the balance of better prospects in some of the Company's key markets and businesses, comprehensive new revenue initiatives as well as cost management are expected to result in improved performance going forward, assuming market conditions do not worsen further. The Company is taking care to make sure it invests in and focuses on transforming its products and services to ensure that it continues to offer high value to customers in its various markets, and does not reduce resources overly through cost reduction and weaken the businesses in terms of long-term viability. Importantly, the Company has made substantial progress towards its objectives of both strengthening its financial position and narrowing its spectrum of operating sectors in order to redeploy capital and resources to higher-growth and higher-value products and services. Focused efforts are being made to complete the desired restructuring objectives outlined in terms of reduced long-term debt levels and better corporate and operating simplicity. As indicated, GVIC is pursuing its transformational growth efforts through a comprehensive Evolve, Enrich and Extend strategy. The strategy focuses on providing richer content, data and information, related analytics and business and market intelligence, as well as more comprehensive and sophisticated marketing solutions. The strategy is intended to provide growing levels of sales from high-margin products with high levels of recurring revenue, while requiring low levels of sustaining capital investment in order to generate strong free cash flow and return on capital. Once leverage is reduced to lower operating levels, management will seek an ongoing balance of maintaining debt at those levels and delivering increased value to shareholders through operations and acquisitions. Shares in GVIC are traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol GCT. About the Company: GVIC Communications Corp. is an information communications company focused on the provision of primary and essential information and related services through print, electronic and online media. GVIC is pursuing this strategy through its core businesses: the community media, trade information and business and professional information markets. Financial Measures To supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), GVIC uses certain non-IFRS measures that may be different from the performance measures used by other companies. These non-IFRS measures include cash flow from operations (before changes in non-cash operating accounts and non-recurring items), net income attributable to common shareholders before non-recurring items, net income from continuing operation attributable to common shareholders before non-recurring items, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and all 'adjusted' measures which are not alternatives to IFRS financial measures. Management focuses on operating cash flow per share as the primary measure of operating profitability, free cash flow and value. EBITDA per share is also an important measure as the Company has low ongoing capital expenditures and depreciation and amortization largely relates to acquisition goodwill and copyrights and does not represent a corresponding sustaining capital expense. These non-IFRS measures do not have any standardized meanings prescribed by IFRS and accordingly they are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. The adjusted consolidated financial results reported have been adjusted to include the Company's share of revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities from its joint venture operations on a proportionate accounting basis as this is the basis on which management bases its operation decisions and performance evaluation. IFRS does not allow for the inclusion of the joint ventures on a proportionate basis. These results include additional non-IFRS measures such as EBITDA, cash flow from operations and net income attributable to common shareholders before non-recurring items. The adjusted results are not generally accepted measures of financial performance under IFRS. The Company's method of calculating these financial performance measures may differ from other companies and accordingly, they may not be comparable to measures used by other companies. Refer to the MD&A for a reconciliation of these non-IFRS measures and adjusted results.

Summary results The following results are presented on an adjusted basis to include the company's share of its joint venture operations on a proportionate basis, because this is the basis on which management bases its operating decisions and performance. For a reconciliation to results in accordance with international financial reporting standards, refer to the reconciliation of IFRS to adjusted results as presented in management's discussion and analysis.  Transformation strategy To address the challenges facing some of the businesses, the company has been implementing a strategy to transform its business and focus efforts on a narrower spectrum of operating sectors to deploy resources and capital in areas where long-term growth opportunities can best be realized, and Glacier has a strong competitive position. Glacier's core focus is to operate as an information and marketing solutions company pursuing growth in sectors where the provision of essential information and related services provides high customer utility and value. The related go-to-market strategy is being implemented through two operational segments: - Content and marketing solutions (evolution of media business); - Data, analytics and intelligence. Sector focus As part of this transformational strategy, the decision was made to focus growth efforts on the following sectors: - Agriculture: The company has a very strong, national presence in the agriculture information sector. The company's agriculture publications, websites, weather models and networks, databases, and trade shows are the leading sources of information for Canadian farmers, ranchers, agribusinesses and those involved in the Canadian agriculture industry. The agriculture industry is experiencing rapid change and innovation with new technologies and methods such as precision farming, an open grain-marketing system and other trends, increasing the need for and value of information. The company is well positioned to capitalize on these trends. - Energy and mining: These are global sectors with strong long-term needs for information, in which Canada is a major player and Glacier has strong brands and market positions. While these sectors experience cyclicality, as is currently the case, this can be mitigated by the continued shift to generate more revenue from information subscription products versus advertising. Given the pure scale of these sectors, many information product growth opportunities exist. - Environmental risk and compliance information: ERIS, Glacier's environmental risk information business, is the main provider in Canada of phase 1 environmental information and recently launched into the United States, where it is the main competitor to the largest operator in the American market. Phase 1 environmental information is used by buyers and sellers of commercial real estate and financial lenders in evaluating mortgage lending risk, amongst other things. A variety of other growth opportunities exists in environmental risk and compliance information. - Real estate information: The REW website, the company's real estate listing portal in the Lower Mainland in British Columbia, now has 98 per cent of the residential listings in Vancouver and an estimated 70 to 80 per cent of MLS's Web traffic. REW has a significant growth opportunity as a platform for residential, commercial and recreational real estate information and marketing. - Mutual fund information: Fundata is the market leader in mutual fund listings information in Canada and is expanding through analytics and other products and areas. It provides Glacier with steady and growing cash flow, and offsets some of the cyclical risk of natural resources cash flows. These spaces are dynamic, and their changing and continually evolving needs are expected to increase the demand and value relating to information, intelligence and marketing solutions. Community media: The community media business is maturing, and print revenue has been declining as a result of the shift to digital media, which continues to impact the company's results. However, these operations generate significant cash flow and provide scale for the company. The products still provide value for advertisers, and opportunities exist to leverage the local brands, marketing reach and customer relationships to generate new revenues. Efforts will be made to restructure community media assets to create greater direct value and simplicity for Glacier, or monetize where appropriate value can be realized. The company's objective is to increase its business information assets and the portion of cash flow generated by these operations, which have higher growth profiles and valuations, harvest the cash flow from community media assets, and reduce the related financial and operating exposure. Target leverage: Management is seeking to reduce senior debt levels to less than $50-million, such that continuing debt can be supported by the business information operations, and the community media operations can provide free cash flow for investment purposes, further debt reduction and financial flexibility. Business information revenue and profitability: In 2014, Glacier's business information operations earned $27.8-million of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (before corporate costs) on $93.3-million of adjusted revenue (excluding the assets that were sold in January, 2015). Almost half of this EBITDA comes from rich data digital information products and services. These rich data digital information products and services have a high level of profitability and recurring revenue streams. Business information businesses trade at higher valuations, typically 7x-15x+ EBITDA, depending on their attributes. For the six months ended June 30, 2015, Glacier's business information assets generated $13.0-million of adjusted EBITDA (before corporate costs) on $48.0-million of adjusted revenue. See Note 19 to the interim consolidated financial statements -- segmented disclosure. The company's business information operations have generated strong organic growth and value historically and continue to perform well. Despite weak commodities markets, the agriculture and natural resources group remains highly profitable. While advertising revenue has fallen in these sectors, electronic subscription and data-related sales have been resilient. The environmental risk, mutual fund and digital real estate businesses are all generating strong growth in 2015. Operational overview: Business Information: - ERIS continues to ramp up its North American expansion plan. With a full year of U.S. activity, ERIS now offers complete North America-wide data. It is undertaking key regional hiring in important American and Canadian centres. It has had strong reception from U.S. customers and is generating significant revenue growth. - Glacier's energy information group has been impacted by the downturn in the oil and gas sector caused by sharply lower energy prices. The JuneWarren-Nickle's energy group is focusing sales efforts on data and information products that can help energy companies identify production and cost savings opportunities, as well as acquisition opportunities as asset values become cheaper. As part of its focus on data and insights tools, Glacier's CanOils oil and gas evaluation and benchmarking database launched a new assets module, which provides users with oil and gas well-based insights. The company also believes attractive energy information acquisition opportunities will arise as a result of the downturn in energy market conditions. - The Northern Miner group was commissioned to produce two major research reports focusing on the Canadian mining industry. This type of report aligns with Glacier's efforts through its evolve, enrich, extend strategy to focus on monetizable thought leadership initiatives that further enhance the deep brand equity enjoyed by many Glacier products. - InfoMine released its new Intelligence Mine product, a global database providing detailed insights into thousands of mining companies and their operations around the world. Sold on a subscription basis, early sales results are promising despite weaker conditions in the mining sector. - Glacier FarmMedia had a soft quarter, as a result of weaker commodity prices, drought conditions in several areas of Western Canada and the loss of business from a large agribusiness that cut back marketing spending significantly due to a major potential lawsuit. Efforts are being made to offset these conditions with new growth initiatives. - Glacier FarmMedia launched the first outdoor farm demonstration show in Western Canada in July, called Ag in motion. The 2015 show is expected to generate over $1-million in revenue. The show builds on the success of the company's agricultural show in Eastern Canada, Canada's outdoor farm show, which has run for 15 years in Woodstock, Ont., and attracts over 40,000 farmers and attendees annually. Community media: - Glacier's community media operations continue to face challenges associated with traditional print advertising. In particular, national and other print advertising sales continue to move to digital. To offset this trend, efforts are being made to target new areas of revenue sources to offset the declines. These include digital products, new multiplatform features and supplements, and events, amongst other things. - Glacier completed the sale of certain of its community media assets on Vancouver Island and in the Lower Mainland of British Columbia to Black Press at the end of March, 2015. It also acquired certain assets in the Lower Mainland of B.C. from Black Press. Restructuring initiatives are now being implemented in the Lower Mainland markets to increase operating efficiencies and effectiveness. The transactions and restructuring efforts have resulted in improved cash flow. Profitability measures: In addition to a wide range of new revenue initiatives and focus on higher-margin revenues, comprehensive cost management and restructuring efforts are being implemented to improve profitability over the rest of the year. Near-term initiatives: - Operating initiatives are being pursued to continue to develop the company's operations through its evolve, enrich and extend strategy. New management and staff are being hired to expand Glacier's expertise in the information areas and opportunities it is pursuing. A variety of core products will continue to be redeveloped and new products launched to address evolving market needs and opportunities. - Non-core asset sales: Through its efforts to transform its business, reduce leverage and increase operating strength, the company sold $46-million of real estate assets and non-core trade publications over the last two years. Both the real estate and operating assets were sold at attractive valuations. The proceeds were used to reduce leverage and pay the deposit required relating to the previously disclosed Canada Revenue Agency reassessment for the taxation years 2008 to 2013. Additional dispositions of real estate and non-core operating assets are currently being pursued to reduce company senior debt levels further to less than $50-million. - Dividend policy: To balance the objectives of both reducing leverage and transforming its growth businesses, the company has decided to stop paying dividends at this time. This will allow the company to have greater financial flexibility to invest in the operating sectors that have been identified, including related acquisitions that may result from current depressed market conditions, and other potential investment opportunities that may include the repurchase of shares. The company is currently in the late stages of two business information acquisitions. These acquisitions are expected to close in the fall of this year and are highly accretive. The company will review its dividend policy in the future as deemed prudent from a shareholder value and return perspective. - Simplify corporate structure: Due to various changes in some of the industries and markets the company operates, the business reasons for having separate corporate structures have changed. Consequently, Glacier intends to simplify its corporate structure and reduce costs and complexity accordingly. - Greater clarity of segmented reporting: The company is transforming its business to focus on achieving long-term growth through a select group of business information sectors going forward, being agriculture, energy, mining, environmental risk and compliance, real estate, and financial information. As such, the company has begun segmenting financial reporting for its operations in two segments: (1) business information and (2) community media. This should provide better understanding of the financial performance of the business information operations and their value. As stated, these businesses typically trade in the seven to 15-plus times EBITDA range. Financial position: On an adjusted basis, including the company's share of the joint venture interests, Glacier's consolidated debt net of cash outstanding before deferred financing charges was 2.1 times trailing 12 months earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization as at June 30, 2015. Glacier's consolidated debt (excluding joint ventures), net of cash outstanding before deferred financing charges, was $71.7-million as at June 30, 2015. Outlook Economic conditions have weakened significantly in 2015 in Western Canada, particularly in energy and agriculture, and remain challenging. Structural challenges continue to exist in community media. However, the balance of better prospects in some of the company's key markets and businesses, comprehensive new revenue initiatives, and cost management is expected to result in improved performance going forward, assuming market conditions do not worsen further. The company is taking care to make sure it invests in and focuses on transforming its products and services to ensure that it continues to offer high value to customers in its various markets, and does not reduce resources overly through cost reduction and weaken the businesses in terms of long-term viability. Importantly, the company has made substantial progress toward its objectives of both strengthening its financial position and narrowing its spectrum of operating sectors to redeploy capital and resources to higher-growth and higher-value products and services. Focused efforts are being made to complete the desired restructuring objectives outlined in terms of reduced long-term debt levels and better corporate and operating simplicity. As indicated, Glacier is pursuing its transformational growth efforts through a comprehensive evolve, enrich and extend strategy. The strategy focuses on providing richer content, data and information, related analytics, and business and market intelligence, as well as more comprehensive and sophisticated marketing solutions. The strategy is intended to provide growing levels of sales from high-margin products with high levels of recurring revenue, while requiring low levels of sustaining capital investment to generate strong free cash flow and return on capital. Once leverage is reduced to lower operating levels, management will seek a continuing balance of maintaining debt at those levels and delivering increased value to shareholders through operations, acquisitions and share buybacks.

(TSX:AGU) (NYSE:AGU) announced today 2015 second quarter net earnings from continuing operations of $675-million ($4.71 diluted earnings per share), compared to $625-million ($4.34 diluted earnings per share) in the second quarter of 2014. The increase in earnings was supported by higher Wholesale volumes and lower production costs for most products. Retail results were impacted by lower crop prices, drought in Western Canada and wet conditions in the U.S. Corn Belt, which affected growers' decisions and limited the opportunities for use of certain crop inputs and services. Highlights:  \"Agrium's solid second quarter earnings were supported by the strong competitive advantages across our product portfolio, the diversity of our product and geographic mix and our continued focus on operational excellence. Wholesale delivered impressive results across all products, supported by lower costs and higher volumes. Retail earnings held up well despite approximately a 5 percent decline in crop input expenditures across the North America market and the impact of the severe weather conditions across this region. We believe we outperformed against our U.S. retail peers achieving an increase in U.S. normalized comparable store sales in a down market, a demonstration of the strength of our business model and market position,\" commented Chuck Magro, Agrium's President and CEO. \"Agrium is committed to delivering on our capital allocation vision as we execute our Operational Excellence initiatives, optimize our portfolio and continue to return capital to shareholders through future dividend growth and share repurchases,\" added Mr. Magro. (1) Forecasted annual effective tax rate of 28 percent used for adjusted net earnings and per share calculations. These are non-IFRS measures which represent net earnings adjusted for certain income (expenses) that are considered to be non-operational in nature. We believe these measures provide meaningful comparison to the earnings of other companies by eliminating share-based payments expense (recovery), gains (losses) on foreign exchange, gains (losses) on non-qualifying derivative hedges and other one-time adjustments. These should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS and may not be directly comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. ADJUSTED NET EARNINGS RECONCILIATION  UPDATED ANNUAL 2015 GUIDANCE Based on our Market Outlook, Agrium expects to achieve annual diluted earnings per share of $7.00 to $7.50 in 2015 compared to our previous estimate of $7.00 to $8.25 per share. We have narrowed the guidance range due primarily to the impact of low crop prices on grower decisions and lower expected potash and phosphate pricing in the second half of the year relative to our previous guidance. We are assuming a normal fall season, recognizing there is risk to fall nutrient applications in regions impacted by drought or a delay in the North American harvest. As a result, our Retail EBITDA(4) for 2015 is now expected to be from $1.00-billion to $1.05-billion. This incorporates challenges that our Canadian retail operations face in 2015 due to the drought and lower crop prices, while our U.S. Retail operations is expected to achieve earnings in-line with 2014 levels. Our annual nitrogen and potash production targets remain unchanged. However, strong sales in the second quarter resulted in low beginning inventories to start the third quarter, which will impact sales volumes in this period. We have updated our finance costs range for 2015 to $240-million to $255-million to reflect a higher than anticipated cost of financing for our customer pre-payment programs. Our estimates of the Canada and U.S. foreign exchange rates and NYMEX for 2015 have been narrowed from our previous estimates based on current market conditions. We have also updated the range for our annual effective tax rate for 2015 to 28 percent to 29 percent to reflect the impact of the recently announced increase to the Alberta corporate income tax rate effective July 1, 2015, increasing from 10 percent to 12 percent. As a result, we had a one-time deferred tax liability charge in the second quarter, which contributed to the increase in our annual effective tax rate for 2015. This guidance and updated additional measures and related assumptions are summarized in the table on page 3. Guidance excludes the impact of share-based payments expense (recovery), gains (losses) on foreign exchange and non-qualifying derivative hedges.(5) (1) Represents diluted per share information attributable to equity holders of Agrium. (2) One-time adjustment mainly relates to the increase in current and deferred taxes due to an increase in the Alberta corporate income tax rate.

The variance was due to the following:  FINANCIAL CONDITION The following are changes to working capital on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to December 31, 2014.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Summary of Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows 5 Aug 2015 17:31 ET Press Release: Agrium Reports Strong Results -6- Below is a summary of our cash provided by or used in operating, investing, and financing activities as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:  Short-term Debt  Capital Management  NORMAL COURSE ISSUER BID In January 2015, the Toronto Stock Exchange (\"TSX\") accepted Agrium's notice of intention to make a normal course issuer bid (\"NCIB\") whereby Agrium may purchase up to 7,185,866 common shares on the TSX and New York Stock Exchange during the period from January 26, 2015 to January 25, 2016. During the six months ended June 30, 2015, we purchased 952,053 shares at an average share price of $104.99 for total consideration of $100-million. There were no share repurchases subsequent to June 30, 2015. Shareholders can obtain a copy of the NCIB notice submitted to the TSX from Agrium without charge upon request. OUTSTANDING SHARE DATA Agrium had 142,791,278 outstanding shares at July 31, 2015. At that date, under our stock option plans, shares expected to be issued for options outstanding were negligible.  5 Aug 2015 17:31 ET Press Release: Agrium Reports Strong Results -7- The agricultural products business is seasonal in nature. Consequently, comparisons made on a year-over-year basis are more appropriate than quarter-over-quarter comparisons. Crop input sales are primarily concentrated in the spring and fall crop input application seasons. Crop nutrient inventories are normally accumulated leading up to each application season. Our cash collections from accounts receivables generally occur after the application season is complete and our customer prepayments are mostly concentrated in December and January. ADDITIONAL IFRS AND NON-IFRS FINANCIAL MEASURES Certain financial measures in this MD&A are not prescribed by IFRS. We consider these financial measures discussed herein to provide useful information to both management and investors in measuring our financial performance and financial condition. In general, an additional IFRS financial measure is a measure relevant to understanding a company's financial performance that is not a minimum financial statement measure mandated by IFRS. A non-IFRS financial measure generally either excludes or includes amounts not excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS. Non-IFRS financial measures are not recognized measures under IFRS and our method of calculation is unlikely to be directly comparable to that of other companies. These non-IFRS measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. The following table outlines our additional IFRS financial measure, its definition and why management uses such measure.  The following table outlines our non-IFRS financial measures, their definitions and why management uses each measure.  RECONCILIATIONS OF ADDITIONAL IFRS AND NON-IFRS FINANCIAL MEASURES  5 Aug 2015 17:31 ET Press Release: Agrium Reports Strong Results -8-  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES We prepare our financial statements in accordance with IFRS, which requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates in applying accounting policies. For further information on the Company's critical accounting estimates, refer to the section \"Critical Accounting Estimates\" in our 2014 annual MD&A, which is contained in our 2014 Annual Report. Since the date of our 2014 annual MD&A, there have not been any material changes to our critical accounting estimates. BUSINESS RISKS The information presented in the \"Enterprise Risk Management\" section on pages 64 - 68 in our 2014 Annual Report and under the heading \"Risk Factors\" on pages 22 - 31 in our 2014 Annual Information Form has not changed materially since December 31, 2014. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2015 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PUBLIC SECURITIES FILINGS MARKET OUTLOOK Prospects for global crop prices have improved since June due to less than ideal weather conditions across a number of geographies. Excessive moisture in the U.S. Corn Belt has led to the deterioration in crops and led to lower than anticipated planted acreage in some areas. Severe drought across much of Western Canada has also reduced yield expectations. While new crop futures prices have recently declined, the rally in crop prices in late June and early July is evidence of how sensitive global crop supply and demand is to relatively small changes in yield expectations. In areas with excessive moisture, it has been difficult to get equipment into the fields to apply crop nutrients and crop protection products, which in some cases has led to missed applications. In drought areas growers have in some cases sought to reduce crop nutrient and crop protection applications on struggling crops. The prospects outside of drought impacted areas are more positive for the remainder of 2015 as stronger prices in early July offered growers higher priced selling opportunities and improved grower sentiment. Furthermore, in areas with excess moisture, the wet conditions tend to lead to increased disease pressure, supporting fungicide demand. Following the end of the northern hemisphere's spring application season, crop nutrient prices have generally weakened, driven by the seasonal slow-down in demand. Tightened Chinese urea export supplies and seasonal demand fuelled an increase in urea prices in-season. However, the expectation of a return of increased Chinese supply to the export market, combined with new exportable supply in Algeria, Saudi Arabia and the U.S. in the second half of the year have pressured global prices. We expect Chinese anthracite-based urea costs to continue to provide a floor to the urea market in the second half of 2015, and that Indian import demand will be strong, particularly in light of the strong start to the monsoon season. Potash shipments to China and India have been robust in recent months and are expected to provide a solid base to global demand in the second half of 2015. In contrast, Brazilian demand has been relatively slow, down 21 percent year-over-year in the first half of 2015. However, we expect the pace of demand to improve in the third quarter, in advance of the domestic planting season. Following the spring season, North American potash prices declined, significantly narrowing the premium relative to other major global markets. The phosphate market has been relatively stable, with robust Indian demand offset by relatively weak Brazilian import demand and record Chinese DAP/MAP exports.

Summarized Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the six months ended June 30, 2015 (Millions of U.S. dollars, unless otherwise stated) (Unaudited) 1. Corporate Information Corporate information Agrium Inc. (\"Agrium\") is incorporated under the laws of Canada with common shares listed under the symbol \"AGU\" on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX). Our Corporate head office is located at 13131 Lake Fraser Drive S.E., Calgary, Canada.

Due to a strong correlation between AECO future contract prices and our delivered cost, we did not experience any ineffectiveness on our hedges, and accordingly we have recorded the full change in the fair value of natural gas forward contracts designated as hedges to other comprehensive income. Currency risk Foreign exchange derivative financial instruments outstanding (notional amounts in millions of U.S. dollars)  There have been no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements in the six months ended June 30, 2015 or June 30, 2014. We do not measure any of our financial instruments using Level 3 inputs. 7. Additional Information Property, plant and equipment At the end of 2014, we completed a major turnaround to tie in the expansion project at our Vanscoy potash facility and the assets related to the expansion project became available for use in 2015.

They had been in London too long and were getting crotchety. Not enough green space makes farmers agitated. They needed to get out of town and kick some tyres. Hosting a group of farmers is a bit like opening a box of chocolates. In the words of Forrest Gump: \"You never know what you're gonna get.\" Topics ebb and flow, and a handful of subjects always get an airing. Farm support, regulation and technological advance are firm favourites. Discussions about farm support - a most clandestine subject - makes even the boldest farmers bashful. No one wants to own up to having more \"help\" than their foreign counterparts. Visitors relish the opportunity of talking to a British farmer about regulation. Are the rumours true Does our government really measure our hedges and give sheep their own passports This particular group treated it a bit like an opportunity to gaze into a crystal ball. They perceive Britain to be the \"global leader\" in farm regulation, and are concerned that our overzealous approach to regulation may be imposed in their countries in the future. I love the openness of these meetings. Farmers don't see one another as competitors. The sharing of knowledge is honest and candid. The discussions about practical husbandry, technology and machinery are fascinating. Everyone has an opinion and it demonstrates the diversity of agriculture across the planet. One size certainly doesn't fit all and the biggest and shiniest isn't always best. On this particular visit we stumbled upon the subject of faulty electronics in farm machinery. The group was united in its frustration. It was rather cathartic to know that I wasn't alone. We have embraced precision farming, the benefits of which I fully endorse. But when it goes wrong I get very peeved. The cost of calling out an agricultural engineer to plug in a laptop, upgrade the software of the machine in question, reboot it and depart, leaves me with a rather empty and dissatisfied feeling. Is my attitude to agricultural engineering stuck in the 1990s I love technology and yet I hanker to see my friendly engineer, JT, getting covered in hydraulic oil, curse when he skins his knuckles on a seized pulley and then methodically set about repairing the problem that has defeated us. Once sorted, the debrief has an atmosphere of job well done and the metaphorical baton - a coffee mug covered in a concoction of Swarfega and oil - is handed back. All present agreed it was a struggle to impart the same value to the repair of an electronic breakdown. There was a feeling that the manufacturer had you in a corner. It's 2015 and while our tractors can steer themselves and locate a pinprick in a 1,000ha field, for an engineer to find an electronic fault is still by an archaic process of elimination. We all confessed to being less inclined to make a cuppa for an engineer performing an electronic repair. Except for the Aussie. \"Why don't you mend it yourself\" he said. \"It's not that straightforward,\" we countered. \"Our dealership is 10 hours away so we had to learn. If it bothers you that much, learn ag electronics code. If not, embrace the technology, pay up for the expertise and enjoy the benefits.\" Abrupt but fair. It is easy to value advice from a kindred spirit. Ian Pigott farms 700ha in Hertfordshire. The farm is a Leaf demonstration unit.

To these people I say, \"poppycock!\" These garbled views of the past are not only wrong-headed they are dangerous. The days before science delivered modern agricultural practices, such as advanced plant breeding and effective crop inputs, saw the rural Canadian landscape filled with poverty, hardship and reduced life expectancy. And this is not that long ago -a generation or two at best. No one who lived through these times would want to go back. And people who live in these conditions today, in developing parts of the world, deserve the chance to get out. Agriculture's best days are not in the past they are ahead and science and research is the path that will take us there. Science and research have already delivered. Never in the history of human development has food been as cheap and abundant as it is today in the developed world. Never in the history of human development has food been as safe to eat as it is today in the developed world. And I would argue that never in the history of human development has agriculture been as environmentally sustainable as it is today. Modern agricultural practices like zero and conservation tillage mean that Saskatchewan does not blow into Ontario anymore like it did when my dad was growing up. Precision agriculture and modern crop inputs minimize greenhouse gas emissions and maximize the efficiency of crop nutrients. New varieties developed through modern plant breeding are delivering more and more food without having to cut down more trees. Safe food abundantly produced in a sustainable manner. Brought to you by science, research and modern agriculture. And the forecast for the future is more of the same, only faster. You might not see this message on the internet much because agriculture has been particularly bad at communicating the benefits we deliver to society. Too often we just assumed everyone knew and went about our business producing more food. But in an increasingly urban country with generations of separation between the city and the farm (if there ever was a connection) this assumption is dangerously wrong. It is dangerous to assume that consumers are aware of the benefits of modern farming because the vacuum created by the lack of communication from agriculture is being filled by those who want us to reject science and turn our backs on the future benefits that research can deliver. Farms and industry must speak out in defense of science or we will lose our ability to advance the industry. Examples of the anti-science message are all around us, from those who put us all at risk because they don't trust vaccinations to those who want to ban pesticides, seed treatments or varieties developed through modern biotechnology. Fortunately we are seeing renewed investment in Canadian agriculture research. Recently the French firm Limagrain and CANTERRA SEEDS announced a major research partnership. Alberta Wheat Commission and Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada are partnering with private industry to deliver new varieties to Canadian farmers. Bayer has recently announced significant investments in wheat breeding in Western Canada. Richardson's has recently completed expansion of their research farm in Manitoba and announced plans for a similar facility in Saskatchewan. These are just a few examples demonstrating great optimism in the future of Canadian agriculture. The economic benefits delivered by agriculture research and development is part of the Canadian DNA. In 1904 Dr. Charles Saunders' first planting of Marquis Wheat was 12 seeds. Less than 20 years later there were 20 million acres of Marquis grown in Western Canada and the U.S. This research, these 12 seeds, opened up the Canadian Prairies, delivered jobs and growth and was the backbone of communities that seemed to spring up overnight. Marquis Wheat is powerful demonstration of what research delivers. I have a sheaf of Marquis Wheat (a little sheaf) on my mantle at home. To me, it is a symbol of what agriculture research will accomplish again -if society lets it happen."}, {"title": "Press Release: AgJunction Q2 2015 Conference Call Notice", "article": "AgJunction Q2 2015 Conference Call Notice Canada NewsWire HIAWATHA, KS, July 28, 2015 HIAWATHA, KS, July 28, 2015 /CNW/ - (TSX: AJX)--AgJunction Inc. will release financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2015 prior to the start of trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Monday August 17, 2015.

(katy.stech@wsj.com; @katystech) 16:31 EDT - Companies based in the US have been driving corporate bond issuance so far this year as borrowers from other countries have pulled back, according to a new report from Moody's Capital Markets Research. Corporations domiciled in the US borrowed $793B between January and May this year, a 56.8% increase from the same period last year, according to Moody's. Meanwhile, companies from the rest of the world have borrowed $634B, a 22.2% decline. The difference highlights the separate paths taken by the US and much of the rest of the world's economies, says John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's. Western European companies offerings are down 19.8% from last year--surprising because interest rates in Europe are historically low, he says. But Lonski adds that companies may be wary of borrowing money in euros when the currency could lose value in coming months.

In 2013, Victory Healthcare ranked as the fourth largest out-of-network provider in Texas and soon faced \"unprecedented levels of pressure\" from major insurers, including delayed payments, says CEO Robert Helms Jr. in court papers. It eventually became an in-network provider for United (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Cigna (CI). Last year, the company's revenue intake dropped 41% on-year to $167M.

Tom Wheeler wants to make that much clear. In a speech Friday, the Federal Communications Commission chairman said: \"there will be an incentive auction in the first quarter of 2016.\" That was aimed at putting to rest the idea the government's plan to auction broadcast spectrum to wireless carriers might be delayed. A 2016 auction should benefit T-Mobile US and Dish Network, according to Paul Gallant, an analyst with Guggenheim Securities. Any delay could mean it happens under a Republican administration, which would likely do away with a provision restricting AT&T and Verizon Communications from bidding on about a third of the spectrum in the auction. The two wireless giants already own about 70% of the type of spectrum being sold in the auction, so the rule was designed to allow smaller carriers a chance to purchase some. An earlier auction would also be good for broadcasters because it would allow them to monetize their spectrum holdings more quickly, Mr. Gallant says. As for investors, more certainty about timing never hurts.

Using it correctly will be essential to feeding the world's growing population while also improving the environment, according to Lux Research. Today, farmers struggle to find value in big data -- tech developers need to focus on meeting strategic and tactical goals, and identify use and business cases to lay the groundwork for adoption and growth. \"There's no dearth of information or computing power -- today's challenge is integrating the deluge of data in a way that farmers buy into,\" said Mark Bunger, Lux Research Director and one of the lead authors of the report titled, \"Big Data in Precision Agriculture. \"While many farmers are still reluctant despite increasing availability of information and technology, there are clear ways to use big data in agriculture now,\" he added. Lux Research analysts assessed the various ways in which big data can help precision agriculture, and their economic viability. Among their findings: Focus should be on farm-to-fork economics. Big data strategies in agriculture must start with overall farm-to- fork economics, focusing on data-driven tactical goals like increasing the profitability of crops, and strategic goals like minimizing the environmental impact of agriculture while ensuring food security. Top use cases organize into five major categories. Based on an analysis of 120 use cases for big data in agriculture, Lux Research identified five categories: Reduce input and environmental impact while maintaining output; manage and maintain machinery; finance and administration; obtain best possible price at market; and comply with regulations.

ENDS !END !STD RWE (MI) Oceanfront Real Property Owners Class Action Lawsuit Filed Against Plains All American Pipeline Over Santa Barbara Oil Spill Sydney - Wednesday - June 24 (RWE) - A class action lawsuit was filed yesterday against Houston, Texas-based Plains All American Pipeline arising out of the May 19, 2015 oil pipeline spill that discharged over 100,000 gallons of toxic crude oil onto beaches and into the ocean along the Santa Barbara County coastline. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of over 3,000 beachfront property owners from Point Conception to the Mexico border. The lawsuit alleges that Plains' 24-inch-wide Line 901 pipeline that runs for 10 miles adjacent to the shoreline lacked an automatic shut- off system that would have prevented such a large oil spill from occurring. When the pipeline was built in 1987, according to the lawsuit, Santa Barbara County demanded that a shut-off system be installed and that the county inspect the welds on the pipeline. Instead, the defendants sued, arguing that the county lacked the authority to force it to install an automatic shut-off system or inspect its pipeline. \"This was no accident,\" says A Barry Cappello, managing partner of Cappello & Noel LLP, the Santa Barbara law firm representing the plaintiff in the case. \"This was a total disregard of safety measures on the part of Plains. Federal agencies have cited Plains for at least 175 safety and maintenance violations since 2006. It's paid millions of dollars in fines. This is the way Plains operates. It plays fast and loose when it comes to safety and now property owners, wildlife, the environment and all those who enjoy the California coastline are paying a very high price. As the Santa Barbara City Attorney in 1969, Cappello was the chief litigator against Union Oil, Mobil, Gulf and Texaco for a massive Santa Barbara Channel oil spill. The disaster and the ensuing litigation awakened the nation's consciousness to the dangers to the environment and the consequences if not protected. \"Ocean and beachfront properties along California's Pacific Coast are highly desirable and valuable places to live,\" says Cappello. \"Property owners had enjoyed unspoiled sand and water and direct access to fishing, surfing and other water sports. These waters are home to a wide variety of fish, birds and aquatic mammals. All this is now damaged by the spill and the damage and threat of additional spills will likely last decades.

To date, the Geoscience BC Board has approved $2.4 million in funding to support Phase I of the SeArch project and this year's primary activity will be flying an airborne magnetic survey. Additional activities in 2015 will include community outreach and potentially some geochemical work. The Phase I SeArch project area is still in the planning stages, and roughly extends south from Terrace to Kitimat and west to Smithers. The area was surveyed in 2008 with airborne gravity and electromagnetic survey technology as part of Geoscience BC's QUEST-West project, which was done in partnership with the Regional District of Bulkley-Nechako and the Northern Development Initiative Trust. The new SeArch project will utilize magnetic sensor technology and gather regional data at a line spacing of 250 metres, a much higher resolution than what currently exists in the public domain. The magnetic survey will passively read the natural magnetic signature of the earth using a magnetometer, while the surveys flown in 2008 measured the resistivity and conductivity and gravity responses of the earth at 2- and 4-kilometre line spacings.

The study, performed by Bloomberg New Energy Finance cites the trillions of dollars already invested and provides a forecast for the renewable energy boom for the global power markets through 2040. One key takeaway highlights falling solar prices that could represent the cheapest form of power by 2026. According to BNEF, $3.7 trillion will be spent on solar investments between now and 2040, accounting for more than one third of new power capacity worldwide. The study also presents data that indicates that by 2040, rooftop solar will be cheaper than electricity from the grid in every major economy, due to the result of high electricity prices. \"This study presents extremely compelling data that supports our outlook of the high-growth solar market of which we conduct our primary business efforts,\" said Jim Nelson, CEO of Solar3D \"Data such as this provides the market with the insight needed to understand the rapidly growing solar landscape, one that is driven by government spending, economic, and environmental factors. We believe that the company is well positioned to take advantage of these trends due to our comprehensive offering of solar solutions, and knowledgeable and experienced executive leadership. About Solar3D, Inc Solar3D, a leading provider of solar power solutions, is focused on the design, installation and management of solar power systems for commercial, agricultural and residential customers.

ENDS !END !STD RWE (MI) Antea Group Releases 2015 Technology Professionals Survey Results on Environment, Health and Safety Sydney - Wednesday - June 24 (RWE) - Two-thirds of technology industry professionals value feeling personally safe and secure in the workplace, but nearly the same amount are unaware of the environment, health and safety functions in their workplace, according to new research released today by Antea Group. Antea Group, a leading provider of EHS services, conducted the survey with the goal of better understanding employee attitudes and preferences related to EHS in the technology industry. The study surveyed 500 US-based respondents working in global IT organizations with more than 5,000 employees. According to the research, there is a disconnect between employees' understanding of the role EHS plays and how it impacts satisfaction at work. Only half of employees feel comfortable pointing out potentially unsafe behavior to both their peers and superiors; however a majority would appreciate if they were told they were doing something potentially unsafe. Of particular concern, a large per centage likely would not feel obligated to intervene if they saw an unsafe act and a significant per centage would not appreciate or actually would be offended if they were told they were doing something potentially unsafe. These survey results point to the fact that if employees are not comfortable talking about safety and helping their colleagues be safe in the workplace, this is likely to limit the effectiveness of many company safety programs, such as an incident reporting program, injury and illness prevention program, and risk assessment program -- all critical to companies with 5,000 plus employees to manage. \"These survey results highlight just how important EHS is to the tech workforce and the gaps in creating truly effective programs in this fast-changing industry,\" said Peylina Chu, senior consultant and technology segment leader at Antea Group. \"By prioritizing the health and safety of their employees, technology companies will not only safeguard their brand, but also retain their most important assets, their people. Other findings reveal divisions among gender, age and demographic groups on the importance of feeling safe and secure in the workplace. Across the board, findings show that women value attributes pertaining to EHS more highly than men. ENDS !END !STD RWE (MI) Flo Trend and Environmental Improvements, Inc.

ENDS !END !STD RWE (MI) Carbon Sciences Using Graphene to Improve Cloud Computing Performance Sydney - Wednesday - June 24 (RWE) - Carbon Sciences Inc [OTCBB: CABN], focused on developing breakthrough technologies based on graphene, the new miracle material, today commented further on it plans to develop graphene-based devices for cloud computing. Graphene-based fiber optics components, such as photodetectors, fiber lasers and optical switches are expected to unclog the existing bottlenecks and enable ultrafast communication in data centers for Cloud computing. The Problem Fiber optics technology is the backbone of the Internet. With the observed and predicted explosive growth of Internet data -- as a result of Cloud-based services such as Netflix, Facebook, Google and many more -- the fundamental speed limits of current state-of-the-art fiber optic materials are being reached. While signals can move at the speed of light down an optical fiber, the actual information that can be transmitted is limited by the detection speed of the photodetectors, which convert light signal into electrical signal for processing by computer chips. Current state-of-the-art photodetectors are based on expensive rare and high power materials such as germanium, gallium, arsenic and indium, also known as III-V semiconductors. However, the fundamental physics of these materials limit them to a practical bandwidth of 25 Gbps. New materials such as graphene must be explored in order to keep up with the speed of data movement in the Cloud. The Solution With a very high charge-carrier mobility and broad- spectrum optical response, the company's management team believes graphene- based components, such as photodetectors, fiber lasers and optical switches, will be able to overcome the speed limits of today's fiber optics technology. This will unleash a global era of high-resolution video on demand, high fidelity music streaming, high volume e-commerce and many more Cloud- based services. The first component the company is focused on is an ultrafast graphene photodetector. Various research laboratories had proven that graphene is a very promising material for photodetectors and some have demonstrated detection speeds of 50 Gbps.

These funds are targeted to provide for the balance of completion capital required by Dejour to see the eight wells recently drilled at Kokopelli through to production. The independent members of the Board of Directors approved the loan agreement and the principal and director appropriately abstained from voting in the loan transaction. As previously reported, Dejour owns an ongoing 25% working interest in the Kokopelli Project. The funds drawn under this facility represent the pro-rata contribution required to be paid by Dejour to maintain its full share of the current development phase and includes costs related to project infrastructure intended to maximize future production efficiencies. The successful establishment of gas volumes from the high pressure Mancos could significantly alter the production profile of the entire project and the value of the total hydrocarbon resource available at Kokopelli. \"As a result of closing these two recent low cost funding transactions, Dejour has been provided with the requisite capital needed to achieve our performance targets. We are especially pleased to see the new Kokopelli wells being integrated into our overall production profile as it represents the successful culmination of several years of planning and development efforts.

Feschuk, winner of a 2014 BC Aboriginal Business Award, said a number of First Nations are concerned that the Province is falling short in its duty to consult and accommodate First Nations interests, while at the same time approving energy developments that will worsen, not improve, BC's environmental performance. The coalition, which includes the Sliammon, Klahoose, Sts'ailes and shishalh Nations, demands the Province reconsider its decision to approve the Site C dam on the Peace River, \"in view of the impact on the environment and on First Nations rights, in view of the lack of demonstrated need, and in view of the existence of clean energy alternatives that pose less financial risk. In a joint statement, the coalition members - who have taken a leadership role in clean energy developments in their territories in the past decade - also conclude that BC's definition of LNG as a \"clean or renewable resource\" runs counter to the Clean Energy Act. \"In recent years the decisions made by the Provincial government and BC Hydro regarding clean energy are moving the province further away from our vision: the development of clean energy as we define it, with our participation,\" said Feschuk, upon the release of a Clean Energy Plan for First Nations and British Columbia. \"Site C would not generate clean energy as we define it,\" the plan says. \"It would be more prudent and quite likely less costly for the Province to meet its need for power by adding incremental capacity developed by independent power producers, among whom we count ourselves, as power is needed. The plan identifies renewable energy resources as including biomass, biogas, geothermal, heat, hydro, solar, ocean and wind.

ENDS !END !STD RWE (MI) BioSolar Files Patent for Super Battery Technology Sydney - Wednesday - June 24 (RWE) - BioSolar, Inc, developer of breakthrough energy storage technology and materials, today announced that it has jointly filed a patent application with the University of California, Santa Barbara. This invention forms the basis for the company's super battery technology. The inventors of the jointly owned patent application include Dr Alan Heeger and Dr David Vonlanthen of UCSB, and Dr David Lee, the company's chief executive officer and Dr Stanley Levy, the company's chief technology officer. A battery contains two major parts, a cathode and an anode, that function together as the positive and negative sides. Today's state-of-the-art lithium-ion battery is limited by the storage capacity of its cathode, while the anode can store much more. BioSolar is developing a novel high capacity cathode that can fully utilize the storage capacity of conventional anodes. By integrating the BioSolar high capacity, high power and low-cost cathode with conventional anodes, battery manufacturers can create a super lithium-ion battery. Instead of conventional cathodes that use lithium-ion intercalation chemistry, a process that is inherently slow, the company's novel high- capacity cathode exploits the fast redox-reaction properties of polymers to enable rapid charge and discharge. Based on the company's internal analysis, a super battery built using its technology can double the range of a Tesla electric car, cost four times less, enable a faster charging time and longer life, and can potentially break the $100/kWh cost barrier needed for mass market adoption of energy storage.

These new regulations will mirror that of their American counterpart, Dodd-Frank Act. This comes despite previous recommendations from the European Commission that reporting be voluntary. Under this new ruling, it will be mandatory for a vast majority of European companies to issue reports regarding the source of materials that fall into the classification of conflict minerals. These requirements will also charge importers, smelters and refiners to gain certification from an independent, third-party audit stating their supplies are not sourced from conflict regions. The European Union encompasses more than 400 of these types of entities, which makes it one of the largest markets for minerals potentially sourced from conflict regions. Financial support will also be made available to SMBs wanting to obtain certification for the Competitiveness of Enterprises and Small and Medium-sized Enterprises. European Parliament will model these reporting guidelines after the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas. These are the same guidelines used for drafting Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act. This is good news for future efforts and legislation, as it creates a foundation for globally standardized reporting.

Closing in on $100 Million in Revenue and Sustained Profitability Sydney - Wednesday - June 24 (RWE) - LiveDeal, Inc [NASDAQ: LIVE] announced this week that it has already identified the first target in its new acquisition strategy and considering the timing of the release, it is likely that the company is nearing the closing of the transaction. LiveDeal management noted that the yet-to-be-revealed company recorded $60 million in revenue and $5 million in profit, according to its 2014 unaudited financial statements. Based on its fourth quarter 2014 revenue of $8 million, LiveDeal is likely operating at an estimated annual revenue run rate of $32 million for 2015. Add in the targeted companyaTMs financials, and virtually overnight, LiveDeal becomes a company with nearly $100 million in total revenue and sustained profitability in 2015 and beyond. It should be noted that the companyaTMs market cap prior to the announcement was around $45 million. Most growth stocks, regardless of industry affiliation, tend to trade at price/revenue multiples of 2-3x current year projected sales. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that LiveDealaTMs market cap, revised to include the acquisition, would be roughly $200-300 million once integrated, versus the current, paltry $45 million valuation. This new multiple represents a future market cap that is 4-6 times higher than the one presently afforded LiveDeal. Furthermore, once fully integrated, reliable net income and earnings per share forecasts can be initiated and could provide yet another rise in valuation. To take advantage of a favorable debt and interest rate market and eliminate shareholder dilution from such a transaction, investors can expect the company to utilize traditional debt financing in this transaction. Moreover, with two successful M&A transactions to its credit, it is likely that LiveDeal management will continue to add even larger, earnings positive growth companies to its stable, which should take the stock to new heights.

The Old World combines the boldness of American rye with an elegance imparted from the finest European Sauternes, Madeira and Port oak wine casks. \"WhistlePig's Old World delivers an exquisite balance of flavors through its unprecedented aging process and careful finishing in the highest quality wine casks,\" said WhistlePig Founder and CEO Raj Peter Bhakta. \"This new release is the culmination of years of innovation at WhistlePig. After studying the best techniques of the Old World -- particularly Scotch whiskies -- Master Distiller Dave Pickerell and the WhistlePig team finished 12-year-old rye in premium European Sauternes, Madeira, and Port wine casks, releasing these single wine barrel finishes individually as the Old World Series in limited quantities this spring. The series debuted with the Sauternes finish, making WhistlePig the first company to age American rye in casks from this highly rare, sweet white wine. The Madeira finish was inspired by America's first President, George Washington, who was a passionate drinker of Madeira wine and also a distiller of rye whiskey himself. The port finish combines the bold taste of rye with the sweetness of the Portuguese wine, perfectly combining the old world with the new world. WhistlePig then carefully married the three whiskeys into the Old World, highlighting their distinct flavors to create an exceptionally balanced spirit. This ultra-premium straight rye is distinctly American, yet harkens back to its stately Old World roots. \"The result is a new form of America's first and boldest spirit, rye whiskey, with the essences of Madeira, Sauternes, and Port, adding a level of complexity and refinement that is rare in a whiskey,\" said Dave Pickerell.

The market leading alcohol-removed wine brand in Canada, St Regis, owned by I-D Foods, prides itself on using the highest quality grape varietals from Spain and France to deliver a consistent product with remarkable structure, body and aroma. Only the best wine varietals, made from carefully selected grapes harvested at their peak of maturity, are selected to make St Regis products. These wines are all made in the traditional manner by master wine makers. Just before bottling, the alcohol is removed by a state-of-the-art vacuum distillation process at temperatures below 40AC This process preserves the wine's original attributes with only 0.5% alcohol by volume and fewer calories per serving than classic wine. Until recently, great tasting non-alcohol wine substitutes have been limited to fruit juices, teas and uninspiring wine imitations. St Regis delivers a flavorful option which earns its place on the dinner table, at home gatherings, or celebrations. Pregnant and nursing women, designated drivers, and some medically restricted consumers now have a viable classic wine alternative to enjoy. \"Alcohol-removed wine is a growth category as consumers look at health benefits personal to them,\" stated Susan Guerin, CEO of World Finer Foods. \"We see St Regis as the brand to address this consumer need with its high quality, elegant packaging and delivery of a pleasing bouquet, character, flavor, and color. The use of varietals as opposed to blends, provides a taste experience consistent with traditional sparkling and still wines.

ENDS !END !STD RWE (MI) Foreign Direct Investment: Which Nations Are Playing to Win? Sydney - Wednesday - June 24 (RWE) - Foreign direct investment has never been more important in catalyzing growth, whether in the developed or developing world. Although equity markets around the world have largely recovered since the financial crisis, global capital flows have contracted sharply. The Milken Institute's Global Opportunity Index, released today, provides policy makers and investors vital information on policies that can best attract foreign direct investment, expand economies and accelerate job creation. The index is also a guide for countries seeking to improve their business environments and attract investors who commit long-term capital, rather than move it around as a fleeting portfolio tactic. The index ranks 136 countries across four broad categories: economic fundamentals, ease of doing business, quality of regulation, and rule of law. Among the findings:Singapore, Hong Kong, and Finland achieved the top three spots. Malaysia is the only developing country in the top ten; it scored particularly well in rule of law. From 2009- 2015, there was a slight decline among many advanced economies and mainly positive changes among developing countries, highlighting the hit that developed markets took during the financial crisis, as well as continuing reforms in developing countries. In Latin America, countries with improving scores -- including Chile, Uruguay, Panama, Colombia, and Ecuador - outnumbered decliners by a margin of 2 to 1. Six sub-Saharan countries in Africa are in the top half of the index: Mauritius, South Africa, Botswana, Rwanda, Namibia, and Zambia. Germany and the United States are tied at 18 -- behind the Netherlands, Estonia, and Iceland.\"The Milken Institute's Global Opportunity Index is both descriptive and prescriptive,\" says Institute economist Heather Wickramarachi, co-author of the report. \"The higher the country scores in the index, the greater the inflow of foreign direct investment. With the pending normalization of monetary policy by developed countries, it will be more important than ever that developing countries are attractive places for investment. We hope our Global Opportunity index help both countries and companies understand the most productive policies and investment opportunities. The Global Opportunity Index top 10: 1.

The RDM Mine is 100% owned by the Corporation's wholly-owned subsidiary, Mineracao Riacho dos Machados Ltda. The RDM Mine is situated in a semi-arid region of Brazil and is heavily dependent on the annual rainy season for its supply of water. However, the amount of rain received during the most recent season has, like in many other parts of Brazil, fallen considerably short of annual averages. Consequently, due to the restriction on the availability of water, which is required for the operations at the RDM Mine, management is now preparing for a temporary reduction in the levels of mining and processing activities at the RDM Mine for the next few months. During this time, the RDM Mine will move toward minimal production levels, depending on the availability of water. While it is difficult to predict for how long operations will be reduced, normal production will not resume until the start of the next wet season which typically begins in October of each year. MRDM is currently in discussions with all the stakeholders in Brazil to ensure an orderly reduction in operations.

These 1,000 gram plus intersections are in relatively close proximity to each other. Ascot is now testing the continuity of mineralization in the immediate area and investigating the potential for selective high grade mining. This is analogous to the mining of the historic \"glory hole zone\" in the early 1910's. Recent drilling at Premier, in the upper main zone has demonstrated that higher grade mineralization is present including P15-751 which returned a 1.63 m interval grading 73.40 g/t Au and 1,880 g/t Ag within a wider well mineralized quartz breccia body. This intersection is approximately 75 meters updip from the P14-706 intersection which returned 216.00 g/t Au and 4720.0 g/t Ag over 0.88 m. Drilling in the west zone is expanding the known mineralization beyond the historic drilling and workings in to new areas and is demonstrating good continuity. Hole P-15-788 returned four individual high grade intersections including 189.50 g/t Au over 0.90 m. The Premier property covers more than one hundred square kilometres near the town of Stewart in northwest BC, and includes the old Premier Mine, a past producer of 2.1 MOz Au and 44.9 MOz Ag. Work in 2015 will concentrate exclusively on the Premier Mine Area of the property. Historic work and Ascot drilling indicate mineralization is focussed in a structural zone ranging from 30-150 meters in thickness which contains mineralized quartz stockwork, cored by one to four higher grade quartz breccia bodies. Individual quartz breccia zones range in thickness from 2.0-50.0 meters and generally contain higher gold and silver grades along with Pb and Zn values. This system has a known strike length of 1600+ meters and a dip length of up to 1500 meters but a majority of the target area has only been loosely tested from underground, with most work dating back to the 1920-30's.

As a complement to its Ginger Ridge Gold Zone discovery, the company will carry out a regional airborne geophysical survey covering prospective Tireo formation volcanic rocks within the central and east portions of its Juan de Herrera land package. The primary objective of this program is to survey untested portions of the project in search of new geophysical anomalies, similar to Ginger Ridge, for follow up exploration and possible future drill testing. The helicopter-borne survey will cover two proximal areas southeast of Ginger Ridge. The survey will use high sensitivity magnetic and radiometric detectors and will comprise an estimated 450 line kilometres, at 120 metre wide line spacing. The significance of targeting these two key prospective areas is: Both areas are on trend and on strike from multiple known mineralized zones within the Tireo belt, specifically Ginger Ridge, and GoldQuest Mining Corp's Jengibre and Jengibre NW; The survey areas are underlain by the largest contiguous exposures of Tireo volcanics within Precipitate's project; and These areas lie mainly within new additions to the greater Juan de Herrera project, and were not subject to prior exploration work by the company Jeffrey Wilson, Precipitate's President and CEO stated \"We're eager to expand our exploration efforts to new areas within our substantial Tireo property package as a means of increasing our foothold in this emerging gold-copper mineralized camp.

The new feature, which will be effective upon the later of receipt of required regulatory approvals or July 14, 2015, will allow ALL Unitholders to redeem their SBT Units AT ANY TIME for cash in the amount of 95% of Net Asset Value, based on the average published NAV of SBT for the five trading days following the notice of redemption. The enhanced cash redemption feature, which will remain in place regardless of the outcome of the unsolicited offer made by Sprott, is expected to offer a number of benefits to Unitholders, including: Significantly reduced potential future trading discounts to NAV, as all investors will have the option to redeem for cash at 95% of NAV at any time. Accessibility by ALL Unitholders, regardless of the size of their holdings, in stark contrast to Sprott Physical Silver Trust's physical redemption feature, which is only available to investors with holdings greater than approximately US$119,000, or over 19,000 units. Redemptions will be accretive on a pre-tax basis to non-redeeming Unitholders, as SBT would be redeeming Units at a 5% discount to their underlying NAV SBT's enhanced cash redemption feature is clearly superior to that of Sprott Physical Silver Trust, which is based on 95% of the lesser of NAV or market price, and exposes investors to significant market risk for up to 46 days since pricing only occurs once a month.

Open Pit Drilling Results Drilling continues to expand the open extent of mineralization in the North and South open pit deposits including areas that may have economic copper mineralization but are currently categorized as inferred, or waste, due to limited drill data. Phase 1 of the drill program, which started in late February, has been completed. Currently 21 holes have been completed for a total of 34,600 feet. The results for 10 holes have previously been released. This news release provides the results for five drill holes bringing the total holes released to 15. The results for the remaining 6 holes are pending. The holes were drilled in the North and South deposits and the Connector zone between the deposits. Drill holes NC15-08 and NC15-10 were drilled in the Connector zone. NC15-11 was drilled in the center of the North deposit where mineralization was expanded and copper grades were higher than the adjacent holes. Drill hole NC15-15 expanded mineralization within the current pits limits on the north edge of the North deposit and NC15-12, drilled in the South deposit, expanded mineralization to the north toward the Connector zone. Drill holes NC15-08 and NC15-10 are located in the Connector zone between the North and South open pit deposits. Both holes intersected narrow zones of mineralization. Drill hole NC15-11, located in the center of the North deposit, intersected multiple zones of mineralization in the center of the deposit. The largest zone, 116.3 meters true thickness averaging 0.53% copper is higher grade and thicker than adjacent holes. The new lower zones below this intercept fill in areas where drill density was limited and the material was previously classified as waste or inferred. Additional drilling is currently under review. Drill hole NC15-12 which is located on the northern edge, and within the designed South pit limit, intersected multiple zones of mineralization.

About Candente Gold Candente Gold's flagship asset is El Oro, a district scale gold project encompassing a well known prolific high grade gold dominant silver epithermal vein system in Mexico. The project covers 20 veins with past production and more than 57 veins in total, from which approximately 6.4 million ounces of gold and 74 million ounces of silver were reported to have been produced from just two of these veins. Modern understanding of epithermal vein systems indicates that several of the El Oro district's veins hold excellent discovery potential, particularly below and adjacent to the historic workings of the San Rafael Vein, which was mined to an average depth of only 200 metres. Current focus is the evaluation of potential for historic tailings to generate near-term cash flow. These tailings are left from pre-1930s milling of ores from the Mexican Mine in the El Oro District. These tailings have had extensive historic assessments including drill testing and metallurgical test work. The Mexico Mine Tailings deposit lies within the town of El Oro and covers an area of approximately 5.6 hectares that once reclaimed, will be available for the town's future development. The tailings are adjacent to existing road access, power and water services. The Mexico Mine Tailings contain an Inferred Resource* of 1,267,400 Tonnes grading 2.94 Au g/t, 75.12 Ag g/t containing 119,900 ounces of gold and 3,061,200 ounces of silver. *Note: Mineral Resources are not Mineral Reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability.

Told directly by people who reside along the Kuskokwim River, the stories captured in the four-part series convey both the vibrant and challenging realities of life in the remote communities of the Yukon- Kuskokwim region where the Donlin Gold project is located. The traditional ways of life in the Y-K region encompass not only economic survival in a rapidly changing world, but also sustain a long- cherished spiritual way of life that is vital to the well-being of these communities. NOVAGOLD prides itself in establishing strong and collaborative relationships with its partners and neighbors as the company works continuously to enhance its knowledge of and ties to the communities where it operates. This process begins with a deep understanding of the heritage, languages and values of the local people. Part Three of the Alaska Video Series is entitled \"People's Connection to the River\". For generations, communities in the Y-K region have been connected by and to the Kuskokwim River. The Kuskokwim River is the longest free flowing river in the United States, serving as a foundation in many aspects of the daily life for virtually everyone in this part of Southwest Alaska. Local residents rely heavily on annual salmon runs for their food, with most families putting away hundreds of pounds of fish every summer. In addition, the Kuskokwim River is a medium of communication and many times it serves as the only means of transportation to the remote communities for cargo such as food, diesel and household goods. It is the \"highway\" that connects the villages by boat in the summer and via snow machines or trucks in the winter. A healthy river means a thriving community, connecting families and villages to each other and sustaining their traditional way of life. The final segment of the Alaska Video Series will be released later this year.

Highly purified graphite is required for a number of advanced applications, including lithium ion batteries. Typical Li-Ion battery specifications demand a minimum purity of 99.95%. Jamie Deith, President and CEO notes \"We have attained a critical milestone with this result. While we fully expected that over time we would be able to meet purity requirements for batteries, exceeding our target by such a comfortable margin on the first attempt is a most welcome development. I have nothing but praise for the research team who have achieved this. Purification was carried out using a method that does not make use of either hydrofluoric acid, or caustic, both of which are highly toxic substances. HF- and NaOH-based purification methods are widely criticised due to safety and environmental concerns. Mr Deith adds, \"The avoidance of HF and caustic is key to preserving our light environmental footprint. No consumer wants to find out that the batteries in their electric vehicle or home power storage unit were produced at huge environmental cost. The 99.995% purity result is a significant step forward in achieving one of Eagle Graphite's near term objectives. Mr Deith explains, \"Upon going public in January of this year, we established two main objectives for 2015. Demonstrating that our graphite is suitable for Li-Ion batteries is important for diversifying our product range, and we will build on progress to date with further testing. We are simultaneously pursuing an expanded graphite resource for our project, with exploration programs at both our established Hoder Creek deposit, and in the mineralized area immediately adjacent to our processing plant. The commencement of exploration work in the plant area was announced on April 30, 2015, and preliminary results are expected in the third quarter of 2015. Industry analysts project that between 2017 and 2020, North American graphite consumption for Li-Ion battery production may grow to exceed all other applications combined. Western North American consumption for batteries is expected to exceed 90,000 tonnes per year. Eagle Graphite has the only graphite quarry in Western North America.

Ferrosilicon was produced from the Langis quartzite deposit, 100% own by Canadian Metals. The series of prototype tests was conducted between end of May 2015 and early June 2015. This phase one was intended to give a very rough indication of the technical feasibility of producing ferrosilicon from the Langis quartzite. It involved smelting four batches of quartzite, low ash coal, wood chips, and iron ore in a 40kW DC electric arc furnace. The feed was pre-mixed and charged into the furnace intermittently over a 6-8 hour period. The furnace was then switched off and allowed to cool down before collecting, weighing, sampling, and analyzing the products. Four tests were attempted where the major variables were the feed recipe and target temperature. Moreover, during the tests the excellent thermal shock resistance of the Langis quartzite was confirmed considering the low carry-over of fines that was observed. All the samples were independently analyzed by MINTEK confirming that ferrosilicon can be produced from the Langis quartzite. In the coming weeks, a detailed report will be issued by MINTEK This important document will be later reviewed by a qualified person and later inserted in the section thirteen of the NI 43-101 the backbone of the future preliminary economic assessment. \"This is a great moment for CME The production of the first ferrosilicon demonstrates the company's potential to design, build, and operate an industrial ferrosilicon smelter using proven and established technologies,\" said Stephane Leblanc, President and CEO of CME \"Given that the beginning of the project was barely more than six months ago, our ability to make so much progress in this very short timeframe only highlights the simplicity and robustness of our innovative and professional approach. Leblanc added that he wanted to thank all of CME employees, consultants and suppliers for their hard work to put this industrial project on the right track.

The mineralized 1985 trench is located within the area of an eight- hole 1988 diamond drilling survey. Minfocus resampled the mineralized trench during its recent June program at the Coral Zinc project. After cleaning out the trench, chip channel samples were collected at one metre intervals over the full 9.0 metre length yielding an average grade of 3.22% zinc, 0.72% lead and 0.9 grams per tonne of silver. Though the resampling conditions impeded truly evenly spaced samples, the intervals extended over barren, as well as mineralized samples. Three of the nine trench samples assayed 5.86-6.43% zinc, while all other samples exceeded 1.32% zinc, except one at 0.46% zinc. Two samples assayed 2.11% and 3.81% lead.* The original 1985 sampling of this trench with two metre samples yielded an average of 1.56% zinc, 0.27% lead and 0.2 grams per tonne of silver. Prospecting also revealed sufficient points to re-establish the location on the geochemical survey grid and provide for accurate location of future drilling to test the very large soil anomaly with highly elevated zinc along with contiguous anomalous lead and silver values, which is open- ended in at least two directions. The four mineralized drill holes from the 1988 program, and the 1985 trench recently resampled by Minfocus, are located 50 - 100 metres from the edge of this large zinc geochemical anomaly.

The ongoing field program comprises mapping, prospecting, soil sampling, BLEG sampling, biogeochemical sampling and claim staking, as well as ground truthing of structures and targets identified by geophysics. Currently, nine significant structures, previously unrecognized and with displacements of up to 300 metres, have been mapped. This has led to an important structural reinterpretation of the main target areas. Jasperoids and/or pebble dikes are associated with several structures which indicate these have the potential to host structurally controlled gold-silver mineralization. As well, displacements along the structures has brought prospective stratigraphy closer to surface and, therefore, more easily explored. Three principal target areas along the Joy Fault are recognized based on the presence of, gold +/- trace element geochemical anomalies, geological structures and geophysical anomalies : Core area - approximately 1,200 metres long SE area - approximately 1,000 long N area - approximately 300 metres long The primary exploration focus is structural feeders and breccias along the Joy Fault and structural/stratigraphic targets in Cambrian carbonate rocks. These targets have the potential to host large, high-grade gold and silver mineralization in veins, stockworks, breccias and bulk-tonnage deposits. New claims have been staked to protect new discoveries and prospective structures. Assays are pending for rock, soil, BLEG and biogeochemical samples. Troymet plans a trenching program once the field work is complete and compiled, and specific targets are selected, prior to drilling. It is anticipated that permitting of trenches, drill roads and drill pads will begin in July.

Northern Empire's Chairman, John Robins, stated: \"The Manson Creek option aligns with our strategy to take advantage of the depressed market conditions in the resource sector to acquire properties with significant exploration potential at low entry and low holding cost. The Manson Creek Property consists of three claims aggregating 3484 hectares and is located 70 kilometres west of the town of Mackenzie and 45 kilometres north of the Mount Milligan Mine. It is road accessible from Mackenzie or Fort St James year round and terrain is moderate. The claim blocks contain gold-in-silt anomalies in a favorable geological setting which has been largely untested by work completed to date. Favorable access and infrastructure make this an ideal early-stage prospect which can be advanced with an initial modestly-sized exploration program. Property Geology The claims are underlain by black clastic sediments and basic volcanic rocks of the Nicola Group. Quartz-carbonate veining and associated alteration is widespread. A number of regional, northwest-trending faults are located adjacent and within the claims as well as numerous splays off these major structures. The Dunne Creek Fault, which is likely a splay of the Manson Lakes Fault Zone, passes through the central part of the claim area. Slices of alpine-type, ultramafic rocks occur along segments of both the Manson Lakes fault and the Dunne Creek Fault.

ENDS !END !STD RWE (MI) Paramount Gold Nevada Metallurgical Tests Support Potential for Major Improvements in Sleeper Project Economics Sydney - Wednesday - June 24 (RWE) - Paramount Gold Nevada Corp [NYSE MKT:PZG] announced today that a final report from its metallurgical consultants confirms the potential for substantially higher gold recoveries from Paramount's 100%-owned Sleeper Gold Project in Nevada. The new metallurgical program, conducted by McClelland Laboratories of Reno, Nevada, culminates a multi-year series of met tests designed to improve the economics of the Sleeper Gold Project. The met test program addressed two main objectives: 1] To optimize heap leach recoveries from oxide and mixed oxide-sulfide material from all the project's resource areas; 2] To find a viable recovery process for higher grade sulfide material from the West Wood, Wood and Sleeper zones. In situ oxide material accounts for about 12 % of resource tonnes and about 11% of gold resource ounces. Mixed material represents approximately 16% of resource tonnage and 15% of gold resource ounces. Sulfide material totals around 72% of resource tonnes and 74% of gold resource ounces, reflecting its significant potential value to the project. Oxide and Mixed Material: Heap Leach Recoveries Improve at Relatively Coarse Grind Optimization of the oxide and mixed material involved acquiring additional representative material from each of the different resource areas and testing coarser crush sizes in order to reduce the already low projected crushing costs for heap leaching. A total of four column tests were performed on oxide material and five on mixed material. For the oxide material, the most efficient recovery option was for 80% passing a 3/4 inch crush size with an overall average gold recovery of 80%. The 80% recovery average was obtained in 67 to 139 days of leaching using moderate lime consumption and moderate to high cyanide consumption, however, according to the McClelland report, \"sodium cyanide consumption should be substantially lower during a commercial heap leach operation. Bill Pennstrom added that \"Typical cyanide consumption in production heaps is less than half of the cyanide consumption observed in column tests.

There are several opportunities offered for ancillary businesses in the indigenous vegetables value chain such as marketing, value addition technology and vegetable seed enterprise. The fertiliser micro-dosing technology is known to be beneficial to resource-poor farmers because it brings about increased yield, cost effectiveness and environmental friendliness. Therefore a synergy between indigenous vegetables production and integrated soil nutrient (micro dose)/water management will bring about cost effectiveness, enhanced yields and better quality vegetables. Vital Project The Acting Vice-Chancellor, Osun State University Prof. Oguntola Jelil Alamu has said an international research consortium led and coordinated by Prof. Clement Adeboye (Agronomy/Crop Physiology) of the Osun State University, Osogbo has been awarded a total of $4.45 million by Canada's GovernmentInternational Development Research Centre (IDRC) to advance indigenous vegetables production and utilisation technology in South-west Nigeria and Benin Republic. The collaborative project also involves the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife; University of Parakou, Benin Republic; University of Manitoba and University of Saskatoon, Canada. The research for development grant was provided by Canadian International Food Security Research Fund (CIFSRF), a joint programme of Canada's International Development Research Centre (IDRC), and the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada (DFATD). Speaking on the project in Osogbo Prof. Alamu noted that the research team will work to expand novel farming practices to 50,000 farmers and promote demand through indigenous vegetable production and value addition technology. He posited that the UNIOSUN team will also lead innovative farming techniques research, training of farmers, value addition technology and general superintendence of project activities. According to him this project \"will be implemented in Osun, Oyo, Ogun, Ondo, Ekiti, Kwara and Lagos States in South-west Nigeria and Benin Republic\". He also stressed that the project will support the School Feeding Programme of the State of Osun (O-Meals) through the formation of Young Vegetable Scientists Clubs (YVSC) in selected secondary schools. The three year (2015-2018) project is to conduct action research on 'Synergising fertiliser micro-dose and indigenous vegetables innovations to enhance food and economic security of farmers in the West African sub-region'. Field research will be implemented in 13 States in Nigeria and Benin Republic. The research team will focus on scaling up advancements in indigenous vegetables production and will increase vegetable yields while also preserving soil and water ecosystems, and conserving fertiliser costs. Special emphasis will be placed on resource-poor women farmers in the development and research project, which will promote policy advocacy to integrate the successful indigenous vegetables production and value addition innovations into local, national and regional food security programmes in West Africa. Focus on Vegetables The project will focus on three high premium indigenous vegetables: Fluted pumpkin - Ugu (Telfairia occidentalis f. Hooke), African eggplant - Igbagba (Solanum macrocarpon L.) and Local amaranth - Tete atetedaye (Amaranthus viridis L.) because of their high market value, cross-cultural acceptability and marketability in Nigeria and Benin. The people of Benin Republic share significant eating habits with the people of South-west Nigeria and these indigenous vegetables are being consumed in both countries as well as in many other African countries. Span and Target Over a 36-month period, the project is expected to support the generation of knowledge and innovations, and the testing and deployment of different approaches for scaling up to ensure maximum uptake of indigenous vegetables production, utilisation and consumption in Nigeria and Benin. The project targets over 255,000 male and female farmers (60 per cent women) who will adopt fertiliser micro-dose technologies for increasing productivity of indigenous vegetables. Micro-dosing is a low cost system for precision application of fertilisers and water. Its optimum application to the production of indigenous vegetable is one of the practical innovations for sustainable intensification of agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa. It increases cereal yields up to 200 per cent while reducing fertiliser costs by 22 per cent and increasing income by 30 - 90 per cent. It enhances fertiliser access and affordability through re-packing fertiliser into small bags, which is beneficial for small-scale farmers who cannot afford large quantities of fertilisers. Novel Approach The approach, according to the project coordinators, develops input supply business (agro-dealers) and improves adoption of fertiliser by small-scale farmers. These are strategic low cost precision agriculture technologies needed to increase the productivity and profitability of small-scale agriculture, while reducing costs and risks in the semi-arid zones characterised by low productivity of soils and water scarcity. The project will support women vegetable cooperatives and youth groups to develop profitable vegetable businesses in small and medium towns and large urban centres. Cooperatives offer scalable inclusive business models that create economic and social benefits to members, and support the transition to a more commercial agriculture. Local Investment It is expected that indigenous entrepreneurs will invest in building vegetables and inputs businesses that will involve private sector partners, farmers' cooperatives, women associations and government agencies. These are the key actors who can advance the innovations and products through to large-scale implementation and impacts. This will expand demand and supply for the three high premium indigenous vegetables with enhanced nutritional quality, and double the income of vegetable famers, mostly women. Increasing women's income and control of income will have positive impacts on children's nutrition, education, health and household welfare. The project is expected to further consolidate the three African universities to become knowledge leaders on indigenous vegetables and micro-dosing research, linking research to development, policy and practice. It is significant that the project leverages Canadian knowledge in using the only synchrotron technology in Canada to analyse long-term effects of micro-dosing techniques and the long-term sustainability of the system. Lucky Beneficiaries The target beneficiaries will receive hands-on skills and it is expected that the spiral effect will reach about one million households in Nigeria and Benin Republic by the end of the project, doubling their incomes and ensuring nutritional security through sustainable development of indigenous vegetable production enterprises. The project will establish young vegetable scientists clubs (YVSC) in selected secondary schools in Nigeria and Benin Republic. For this purpose it is targeting at least 25,550 YVSC members in Benin Republic and Nigeria. The project will therefore support the School Feeding Programme, which is being proposed in Nigeria through the formation of Young Vegetable Scientists Clubs (YVSC) in selected secondary schools. It is known that these indigenous vegetables are potent sources of nutrients which help the development of cognitive ability, help to build good body structure, and also help combating diseases for children. Therefore, the project is playing the expected role of contributing to the development of the State through research. For quality seed production, the project will establish unconventional seed production system at the local farmers' level. Accompanying this, the coordinators will conduct massive training on indigenous vegetables seed production practices i.e. seeding method, isolation distance, exclusion of off-types, harvesting indices, seed harvesting, seed cleaning, seed sorting, seed drying, seed treatment, seed packaging, seed storage and seed testing. Objectives and Expectations The main objective here is to establish professional seed producers who possess adequate knowledge and who will engage in seed production as a business enterprise within the indigenous vegetables value chain. The professional seed producers will be organised into functional cooperative societies to allow for seed quality control and to gain access to governmental support in terms of inputs and loans. It is expected that production of indigenous vegetables will significantly increase as a result of the adoption of simple agronomic practices and micro-dosing techniques. Household consumption of indigenous vegetables is expected to increase by at least 40 per cent. Large-scale adoption of indigenous vegetables will increase dietary diversity and provide an opportunity for reversing food insecurity and malnutrition in rural areas of Benin and Nigeria. The project will further consolidate the three African universities to become knowledge leaders on indigenous vegetables and micro-dosing research, linking research to development, policy and practice. It is significant that the project leverages Canadian knowledge in using the only synchrotron in Canada to analyse long-term effects of micro-dosing techniques and the long-term sustainability of the system. The expected results of this project have the potential to set up profitable vegetable value chains and businesses that will continue to work in a self-sustaining manner beyond the life of the project. These results have broad relevance and general application in the majority of African countries where indigenous vegetables are important, but underutilised.

The weekly samples are tested at a provincial lab for E. coli bacteria, with results in approximately two days. Grey Bruce Health Unit Safe Water Manager, Andrew Barton, said \"over-all water quality in this area is good,\" although last year's testing results were the \"worst on recent record.\" Last summer, the Health Unit posted Grey Bruce beaches as unsafe for swimming 11 times, Barton said in a June 4 telephone interview. \"The poor quality was primarily driven by the number of storm events...\" Barton said, adding they did not post any unsafe conditions in 2013. After the public raised concerns about the safety of other untested beaches last year, the GBHU modified its sampling protocol to include additional sites and expanded limits of testing. Health units follow a provincial Beach Management Protocol, which includes a pre-season assessment and routine (minimum weekly) sampling during the swimming season. A beach will be posted as unsafe when evidence suggests the water is potentially dangerous to human health, possibly due to bacterial contamination from water fowl or agricultural run-off. \"Not only did we have to post 11 times, but last year we had quite a lot of sample results above the provincial, and even the federal, levels of contamination,\" Barton said. Water sampling is underway at beaches with double-digit water temperatures, and will be expanded in coming weeks. NEW BUOYS FOR SAFETY Five swimming buoys, two lifesaving stations and signs will help improve safety at a popular Southampton Beach area near Chantry Dunes, south of Gerry's Fries. Like the buoys that mark the safe swim zone at Port Elgin's Main Beach, the new equipment in Southampton will clearly mark areas for recreational swimming and boating. The buoys will be installed and removed annually by the fire department as part of its waterfront emergency training. The buoys, signs and lifeguard stations will cost approximately $4,000. FARMING UPDATE Agriculture is an \"economic driver for Bruce County\" and the food grown here is produced under some of the strictest regulations in the world, according to Saugeen farmer, Pat Jilesen. Jilesen, an Ontario Federation of Agriculture director, and newly-elected President of the Bruce County Federation of Agricuture, recently briefed Saugeen Shores councillors on farming and the environment. Jilesen listed farming advancements, noting they now practice \"precision agriculture\" with GPS on farm equipment to reduce fuel consumption, and allow for more targeted applications of nutrients, seeds and crop protection products. Jilesen said most farms now have environmental plans, continually train and upgrade on new advancements and regulated themselves to reduce greenhouse gases. Jilesen said if councillors take away one thing from his presentation, he hopes they realize that farmers live where they work. \"We breathe the air and drink the water. We want to leave our land in even better shape for the next generation, and we take pride in growing safe, high quality food,\" he said, adding farmers eat the same food as everyone else. With approximately 37,000 people in Bruce County employed in the agriculture/food business, Coun. John Rich said it would be \"real interesting\" to find out what ideas the agricultural industry could bring to the issue of economic development. Deputy-Mayor Luke Charbonneau, who, with his family co-owns Hi Berry Farm in Port Elgin, agreed that agriculture is a huge part of the local economy that they often don't focus on enough. He asked Jilesen if there are areas where municipalities could do a better job working with agriculture. Jilesen said province-wide, officials must be mindful of growth encroaching on farmland because \"350 acres a day is being gobbled up by housing.\""}, {"title": "WEATHER WIZARDS - Private-sector forecasting, monitoring services using technology to predict patterns, issue warnings sooner", "article": "The potential for isolated, severe weather events can put fans on edge and stadium officials on high alert at major outdoor sporting events. But for upcoming FIFA Women's World Cup matches, as well as every Winnipeg Blue Bomber game this season at Investors Group Field, there'll be no cause for undue concern. That's because the stadium has subscribed to a new weather monitoring service from a local company called Precision Weather Solutions (PWS). In addition to an on-site weather station installed at the south end of the stadium, the service includes automated lightning detection notification that can send alerts up to an hour ahead of potential strikes. \"It's a way better system,\" said Kelly Keith the stadium director of security and volunteers. \"The bonus is the station is right at the stadium. We can get the weather system right to the stadium, and not have to rely on the forecast for the entire city.\" Instead of having to step outside and see the lightning and count off the seconds to the sound of thunder, stadium managers like Keith can get automatic notifications and see on their computers the storm's approach and make the right call. Meteorologist Guy Ash, who co-founded PWS in 2013 with business consultant Suzi Bonk, said among other things their network can analyze in-cloud as well as cloud-to-ground lightning potential, which is critical to understanding the mechanics of the storm. Since 2013, PWS has already installed 800 of their own stations - they cost about $1,700 each - mostly in Western Canada. Its network also integrates the information from another 500 sites including all Environment Canada, provincial government and public domain weather stations. Its service is customizable to monitor and display on unique dashboards whatever weather feature the customer is interested in. So it can create an alert well in advance of a dangerous thunderstorm that is proceeding toward the asset in question. \"There is an explosion of technology now available like in many other industries,\" said Ash, who has 25 years of experience in the field. \"This kind of monitoring and big data is now a part of meteorology.\" PWS is one of only a handful of Canadian companies in the growing private-sector weather monitoring and forecasting business. In the U.S. such services have been booming for a few years already. A U.S. company called Climate Corp, which crunches climate data available for free from government weather services, was sold to Monsanto in October 2013 for close to US$1 billion. Neil Townsend, the director of market research at the CWB where Ash worked for several years, is an advocate of deploying big data to analyze weather information in the agricultural space. (Ash helped the CWB build its own multi-site weather service called WeatherFarm, that was sold in 2013 to a partnership between Glacier Media and Weather Innovations Inc.) Townsend said he has no first-hand knowledge of how PWS works but said he understands the concept of what they are doing. \"Probably at this stage, as a tool it (big-data weather services) is in its infancy,\" Townsend said, \"But it is going to be something that will be transformative.\" That's what Ash and Bonk are betting on. \"We are in the process of ramping things up,\" said Bonk, who has been involved in consulting on agricultural and weather-related businesses in the past. She would not disclose any details on the current financial state of PWS other than it is likely the self-financed company will be looking to raise additional capital sometime in the near future. It currently has a staff of about 10 people, as well as about 25 contract installers and a battery of software and systems-engineering contractors. The company just hired its first director of business development and sales, and Bonk said it seems as though it is adding to the staff every week. \"All I can say is that if we weren't bringing in some revenue, we wouldn't still be around,\" she said. There is a growing understanding of cost savings that are possible if you can mitigate weather risks. Some estimates say it could be as much as $1 trillion annually in North America alone. \"I don't see the need for less weather information... there is a need for more,\" Ash said. \"I can't predict the future, but weather variability has become much more of an issue as I have gone along in my career.\" PWS has a whole range of service offerings including integrating its weather stations and analysis as part of a total agronomy service from precision farming firms like Farmers Edge. It has all sorts of customers in the agricultural space as well as rural municipal and conservation areas. For instance, the West Souris River Conservation District has installed five PWS stations at five schools in the region. Dean Brooker, the district manager, said, \"Environment Canada has only one station in Melita in southwestern Manitoba. The weather is quite different between Melita and Reston and Oak Lake.\" The PWS network integrates all Environment Canada and provincial weather station data as well as international services. Bonk and Ash say they have great respect for the work that Environment Canada and other services provide. But they believe there is a growing market of customers that need more granular information - and are willing to pay for it. martin.cash@freepress.mb.ca Who needs Precision Weather Solutions Agriculture and agri-business Help producers lower costs and increase profits on operations such as spraying, planting, harvesting, storage, and shipping.

With a single Agrian account, users can access a full suite of customizable applications via computer, tablet or smartphone. The Agrian 6 system is programmed to capture data on fertilizer applications; nutrient management; planting records; field scouting reports; spray records; integrated soil, tissue and water laboratory analysis; and asset tracking with wireless data transfer from field equipment. The Agrian 6 mobile mapping application allows users to plot field samples and track inputs, scouting records, seeding rates, crop performance and yield records. The robust mapping features are customizable and can be used to document field-specific records and events. Satellite imagery is available, capturing up to two-million square miles daily, and provides access to high-resolution, multispectral, in-season imagery for timely extraction of data that directlyimpact crop production and performance. Agrian 6 dashboards can be easily customized to provide users with summary snapshots or detailed real-time reports on water use, fertilizer and chemical inputs. With permission from growers, the dashboards also allow for a network of users such as applicators, agronomists or ag retail partners to record their field-level activities.

Ms. Lennox is chief executive officer of Startup Canada. Canada's cold and long winters will never be confused with the perpetual hot and humid breeze of Israel's Mediterranean climate, not to mention the fact that we are separated by more than 8,000 kilometres. However, once you get past differences in weather and geography, our countries have much in common. Ranked as the first and second most educated populations in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, Israelis and Canadians are finding natural partnerships in a range of sectors. One of those is technology and innovation. Companies large and small from both countries are collaborating and merging, as we saw last month with BlackBerry's purchase of the Israeli file-sharing company WatchDox and its announcement to open a security research and development centre in Israel, to leverage expertise and experience. Whether it's Vancouver-based MacDonald Dettwiler and Associates Ltd., which has supplied space and satellite technology to Israel Aerospace Industries, or Saskatchewan's capabilities in seed biology, digital agriculture and soil science, Israel has shown great interest in Canadian tech. Likewise, Canadians have reciprocated by turning to Israeli expertise in life sciences, water tech, green energy and cybersecurity. But we're only scratching the surface. To move forward, the Israeli embassy and Startup Canada, the locomotive behind a grassroots network of Canadian entrepreneurs, are searching for the top Canadian seed-stage information and communications startup to represent Canada at Start Tel Aviv, a global competition that brings the top tech startups from 23 countries together in Tel Aviv to build business relationships and see the key elements that contribute to the success of Israel's renowned startup ecosystem: its culture, unique work force and easy access to capital. Tel Aviv, a city that was selected by researcher Startup Genome as the second-best place for startups after California's Silicon Valley, is home to a population that always strives to think outside the box. Israelis truly believe an individual can change the world with a new idea. Young Israelis are looking for the next \"game-changer\" and are willing to put in the hard work to achieve it. What sets the Israeli startup culture apart is its failure to accept failure. This culture is given life by easy access to capital. Even though Israel has a population of just more than eight million, it's second in the world in total numbers, behind the United States, in availability of venture capital. The engine behind Israel's startup scene is its highly skilled work force and its focus on research. Israel boasts the most engineers per capita in the world, has the highest R&D expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product in the OECD and its seven universities and five medical schools rank among the world's best. Global multinationals have taken notice, with more than 350 of them establishing R&D centres in Israel. The Canadian winner of this competition will be warmly welcomed by Israelis who are actively looking for connections with Canadians in order to compete in the globalized market. According to Ronen Tanne, a Vancouver-based Israeli entrepreneur: \"Israelis are intrigued by Canada's diverse, multicultural society with large immigrant populations, especially from Asia, who maintain close business connections to back home.\" In addition, Israelis view Canada as an entry point to North American markets. Since Israel and Canada have both relatively small domestic markets, we need to work together. This idea of leveraging expertise and access to markets is what guides the Canada-Israel Research and Development Foundation. Recently, it has a special interest in connecting the startup sectors with projects such as the Nova Scotia-Israel Innovation Program, the Saskatchewan-Israel R&D Collaboration Program and the Ontario-Israel Collaboration Program. While startups are the lifeblood of Israel's high-tech economy, Canada is reaping the rewards of this growing sector. It's our hope that this contest will help diminish the geographic distance and connect these communities. Only by collaborating with like-minded partners and leveraging expertise can Israeli and Canadian startups truly reach their potential."}, {"title": "Semios Launches Frost Module for Precision Farming Platfrom", "article": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, May 26, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Semios, provider of real-time agricultural information for precision farming, launches a new Frost Module. \"The Semios Frost Module, takes the guess work out of frost protection on a per acre basis,\" said Michael Gilbert, CEO of Semios. \"It alerts farmers when there is cause for concern and tracks the outcome of frost mitigation tools in action, so the farmer can respond accordingly or get a good nights sleep.\" The Frost Module is part of a custom designed controller and sensor network that gives farmers remote access to the conditions in the field 24/7. Other modules include Pest Management, Disease Control and Irrigation Management. The Semios platform captures and logs data from a network of sensors placed on every acre of a grower's property. From site-specific sensors, the frost module monitors temperature inversions (up to 20' high) every 10 minutes, provides wet bulb calculations and sprinkler thresholds based on stage of bud development. When a frost alert is sent by text and email, growers know exactly where action needs to be taken and furthermore can determine if their frost mitigation tools are having the desired effect or need to be adjusted for efficiency. Mr. Scott Hassle of Berrybrook Enterprises, said, \"Having Semios Frost Alert text me with the data I needed to know, made my decision to start the wind machines a lot easier. I was able to return indoors and watch the graphs map the evolving field conditions, giving me peace of mind.\" Berrybrook came online with the Frost Module the day before the first frost hit and found it very easy to use. In 2015, this service was launched to existing Semios customers on 5,000 acres of apple, pear, grapes, walnuts, almonds, pistachios and citrus orchards. Each sensor station has the ability to run any module, so a simple activation by Semios is all that is required. Modules have video tutorials and Semios customer support is available 24/7.

We think this is the best way to manage our money to invest in the future and return a great deal to our shareholders.\" A shareholder had questioned the decision, particularly in light of corporate cousin Viacom's (VIAB) move on Wednesday to boost its dividend by 21% even though, as the shareholder put it, \"its earnings were not of CBS's quality.\" (keach.hagey@wsj.com; @keachhagey) (END) Dow Jones Newswires May 21, 2015 13:50 ET (17:50 GMT)"}, {"title": "Nova Scotia Aerial Imaging Startup Signs Strategic UAV Services Partnership with PrecisionHawk", "article": "WOLFVILLE, NS, May 20, 2015 /CNW/ - Wolfville-based AerHyve Aerial Technologies has announced a strategic partnership with PrecisionHawk. AerHyve analyzes high quality, multi-sensor data from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, aka drones), for use in precision agriculture. PrecisionHawk are world leaders in UAV remote sensing and GIS data processing, and this partnership will provide AerHyve clients with access to PrecisionHawk's industry-leading hardware and software tools. For AerHyve the partnership will bring increased exposure and scalability to their cutting-edge data analysis tools in an emerging global market. \"We value AerHyve for their regional presence and expertise in the development of algorithms for UAV data analysis,\" said Christopher Dean, PrecisionHawk CEO. \"This partnership will allow us to expand and customize our services while equipping AerHyve clients to make more informed business decisions.\" \"The partnership with PrecisionHawk will empower AerHyve with an end to end system for incorporating aerial data into an agricultural workflow; from innovative UAV hardware to a library of data analysis tools,\" said John Frost, President, AerHyve Aerial Technologies. AerHyve can provide agricultural operations with actionable data on the status of their crops that otherwise would be difficult, if not impossible, to access. By processing aerial data with Machine Learning technology AerHyve is able to offer agricultural producers information to make more targeted, resource allocation decisions. AerHyve's initial focus has been on the wild blueberry industry, Nova Scotia's largest fruit crop. However, their technology can be applied to other types of crop analysis. \"Our precision agriculture developments focus on the ability to detect plant health and stresses outside of the normal human range of visualization,\" says Frost. By pooling multiple data streams like microclimate, surrounding habitat, soil composition and moisture, we're also looking deeper into the patterns of growing cycles and associated anomalies. This information can inform small changes that yield big results.\" Frost says their developments will also ultimately be used to optimize harvest and pollination efficacy and increase yields. Acadia University's Rural Innovation Centre supported AerHyve's development through their small business incubation services. AerHyve also received a 2014-2015 Nova Scotia Productivity & Innovation voucher, and were a finalist for the Annapolis Valley Chamber of Commerce Agriculture Innovator Award (2014). \"The Rural Innovation Centre is home to high-growth potential, innovative startups and AerHyve is leading the charge with their strategic partnership and novel Machine Learning development,\" says Hope McCallum, manager of the Rural Innovation Centre.

With the planet's rapid depletion of non-renewable resources, it's a daunting task, seemingly impossible to get your head around. But thousands of Calgary students have already faced up to the challenge through an innovative educational program teaching sustainable farming at the Stampede's new agricultural facility. The Calgary Stampede, in partnership with Agrium Inc., a major sponsor of the new Agrium Western Event Centre, is celebrating the inaugural year of Journey 2050. The unique educational program has seen 4,500 junior high students from 50 schools visit the centre since September. They study agricultural sustainability, precision farming and look at innovative ways to feed the world's population by 2050. Chuck Magro, president and CEO of Agrium, says while the planet continues to waste up to 25 per cent of the food it grows and produces every year, need is still expected to rise up to 60 per cent in the next 35 years. And within all of that are growing environmental challenges, greenhouse gas emissions, a warming planet, erosion and depletion of the non-renewable resources required for food production. \"Today's world population is at seven billion, but we're growing so fast, we will hit nine billion by the year 2050. Feeding all of these people is one of the key global challenges we will face,\" said Magro. \"All of the changing economic, social and environmental conditions will put even more pressure on agricultural yields. So we need to teach the next generation about sustainability. This is part of our social responsibility.\" Students attending Journey 2050 are given iPads with a unique application that allows them to imagine what it is like to be farmers. The game teaches them about the difficult choices in balancing the use of water, fertilizer, pesticide and arable land to maximize yield, but also minimize environmental impacts. Toby Adigun, a Grade 7 student with Don Bosco School studying at the Agrium Centre Thursday, said he's learned that preventing food waste will go a long way toward reducing unnecessary food production. \"Just think of how much food we waste in our houses, in our city, our country, in the whole world. That food could instead be going to food banks to help the poor, or go toward producing less.\" Ajia Inocencio, also in Grade 7, adds that North America needs to do more to educate developing countries about technologies that will improve sustainable growth. \"There's so much we can teach them about better fertilizers, how to better use soil, so there is less waste.\" Jennifer Nagel, a science teacher with the Catholic school district's Don Bosco School, explained that because Alberta Education is adding more environmental sustainability content to the provincial science curriculum, a program like Journey 2050 is a perfect fit for middle school students. \"It's about how we balance human impacts on the environment with basic human needs,\" she said. \"There's huge waste in our world. North America in particular throws away so much food, yet other parts of the planet don't have enough. It will be up to this generation to make a difference.\" eferguson@calgaryherald.com"}, {"title": "INDUSTRY SNAPSHOTS; CANADA - MINING", "article": "LATEST COMPANY NEWS News and Commentary Canadian mining industry urged to bring more women on board of directors - 11/5/2015 Canada's mining industry lags behind most sectors when it comes to gender equality on its boards of directors.

Agrium to Present at the Goldman Sachs Basic Materials Conference 2015 - 7/5/2015 THURSDAY, MAY 07, 2015 CALGARY, AB--(Marketwired - May 07, 2015) - Agrium Inc. (TSX: AGU) (NYSE: AGU) announced today that Mr. Steve Douglas, CFO will be presenting at Goldman Sachs Basic Materials Conference 2015 in New York, NY on Wednesday, May 20, 2015 at 9:45 a.m. EST. About Agrium Latest Research Surface coal mining influences on macroinvertebrate assemblages in streams of the Canadian Rocky Mountains Kathryn A. Kuchapski*, Joseph B. Rasmussen Abstract To determine the region specific impacts of surface coal mines on macroinvertebrate community health, chemical and physical stream characteristics and macroinvertebrate family and community metrics were measured in surface coal mine-affected and reference streams in the Canadian Rocky Mountains. Water chemistry was significantly altered in mine-affected streams which had elevated conductivity, alkalinity, selenium and ion concentrations compared to reference conditions. Multivariate redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated alterations in macroinvertebrate communities downstream of mine sites. In RDA ordination, Ephemeroptera family densities, family richness, EPT richness and % Ephemeroptera declined while densities of Capniidae stoneflies increased along environmental gradients defined by variables associated with mine influence including waterborne Se concentration, alkalinity, substrate embeddedness and interstitial material size. Shifts in macroinvertebrate assemblages may have been the result of multiple region specific stressors related to mining influences including selenium toxicity, ionic toxicity, or stream substrate modifications.

The Industry Mining Facts Minerals and metals are the building blocks of the computers and smartphones we rely on, of the vehicles and public transit that get us places, of the buildings where we live and work, and of green technologies that help make the world a more sustainable place. Just as we as individuals depend on mining to support our daily lives, Canada relies on the industry to keep the economy humming. Mining is one of Canada's most important economic sectors and a major job creator. A major employer: Approximately 380,000 people across Canada work in the mining and mineral processing industries. Mining is the largest private sector employer of Aboriginal peoples in Canada on a proportional basis, and employment is poised to increase. Canada has one of the largest mining supply sectors globally with more than 3,400 companies supplying engineering, geotechnical, environmental, financial and other services to mining operations. Those who work in mining enjoy the highest wages and salaries of all industrial sectors in Canada with an average annual pay exceeding $110,000, which surpassed the average earnings of workers in forestry, manufacturing, finance and construction by a range of $31,000 to $46,000 for those sectors. An economic engine: Mining contributed $54 billion to Canada's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2013. The industry accounted for 19.6% of the value of Canadian goods exports in 2013. Canada's value of mineral production was nearly $43.6 billion in 2013. The mining industry's payments to Canadian federal and provincial governments total $71 billion in taxes and royalties over the last decade (2003-2012). A global leader: Thanks to its rich geology, Canada is one of the largest mining nations in the world producing more than 60 minerals and metals. Canada ranks in the top five countries in the global production of 11 major minerals and metals: First in potash Second in uranium and cobalt Third in aluminum and tungsten Fourth in platinum group metals, sulphur and titanium Fifth in nickel and diamonds 57% of the world's public mining companies are listed on the TSX and TSX-Venture Exchanges. Together, the two exchanges handled 48% of global mining equity transactions in 2013, and accounted for 46% of global mining equity capital for that year. Globally, Canada is recognized for its leadership in safety and sustainability. Mining companies in Canada were the first in the world to develop an externally-verified performance system for sustainable mining practices with the creation of MAC's Towards Sustainable Mining initiative in 2004. Leading Companies Agnico Eagle Mines Limited About Agnico Eagle Agnico Eagle is a senior Canadian gold mining company that has produced precious metals since 1957. Its nine mines are located in Canada, Finland and Mexico, with exploration and development activities in each of these regions as well as in the Unitedn States. The Company and its shareholders have full exposure to gold prices due to its long-standing policy of no forward gold sales. Agnico Eagle has declared a cash dividend every year since 1983. Agnico Eagle Reports First Quarter 2015 Operating and Financial Results - Strong Operational Performance Drives Record Gold Production and Low Costs - Amaruq and Kittila Drill Programs Yield Positive Results TORONTO, April 30, 2015 /PRNewswire/ - Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (NYSE:AEM, TSX:AEM) (\"Agnico Eagle\" or the \"Company\") today reported quarterly net income of $28.7 million, or net income of $0.13 per share for the first quarter of 2015. This result includes a non-cash foreign currency translation loss on deferred tax liabilities of $23.3 million ($0.11 per share), various mark-to-market and other adjustment gains of $22.7 million ($0.11 per share), unrealized losses on financial instruments of $13.6 million ($0.06 per share), non-cash foreign currency translation gains of $11.7 million ($0.05 per share), non-cash stock option expense of $7.8 million ($0.04 per share) and non-recurring gains of $7.6 million ($0.03). Excluding these items would result in adjusted net income of $31.4 million ($0.15 per share) for the first quarter of 2015. In the first quarter of 2014, the Company reported net income of $97.1 million or net income of $0.56 per share. First quarter 2015 cash provided by operating activities was $143.5 million ($176.8 million before changes in non-cash components of working capital). This compares to cash provided by operating activities of $250.4 million in the first quarter of 2014 ($207.2 million before changes in non-cash components of working capital). The decrease in cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital during the current period was largely due to lower realized gold and silver prices (down 8% and 17% respectively, period over period) and timing of sales which resulted in lower sales volumes relative to the ounces produced during the quarter. \"The year is off to a good start with continued strong operating performance from all of our mines. This performance coupled with lower fuel prices and weaker local currencies, has also resulted in better than expected operating costs\", said Sean Boyd , Chief Executive Officer. \"This year is also shaping up to be an exciting time on the exploration front, as we have drills operating at most of our mines and development projects. Drilling at Kittila has potentially outlined a new zone parallel to the main mineralized trend, and infill drilling is underway at Amaruq, with initial results suggesting good potential to expand the resource base and ultimately enhance our Nunavut platform\", added Mr. Boyd. First Quarter 2015 highlights include: Record quarterly gold production - Payable gold production1 in Q1 2015 was 404,210 ounces of gold at total cash costs2 per ounce on a by-product basis of $588 and all-in sustaining costs3 (\"AISC\") of $804 per ounce. Record quarterly precious metal production in Mexico - In Q1 2015, payable gold and silver production was 89,077 ounces and 663,000 ounces respectively. Total cash costs per ounce of gold on a by-product basis from our Mexico operations averaged $387. 2015 guidance reiterated - Expected production for 2015 is maintained at approximately 1.6 million ounces with total cash costs on a by-product basis of $610 to $630 per ounce and AISC of approximately $880 to $900 per ounce. Infill drilling at Amaruq continues to yield positive results - Drilling resumed in late March, and holes drilled from the ice on Whale Lake have yielded promising results including 14.0 grams per tonne (\"g/t\") gold over 18.9 meters, in one of four lenses cut by the same drill hole (AMQ15-168), as well as 15.3 g/t gold over 8.9 meters in another hole (AMQ15-172). Drilling at Kittila yields deepest Suuri Trend intersection to date and indications of a new parallel zone - Drilling of the Suuri Trend below the Roura area has returned 5.3 g/t gold over 10 meters at a vertical depth of approximately 1.6 km (ROD14-004F). Drilling has also shown indications of a new parallel zone 150 meters east of the main zone with intersections including 7.0 g/t gold over 7.0 meters at almost 1.3 km depth (ROD14-005) Continued focus on a strong balance sheet - In Q1 2015, $100 million was repaid under the Company's credit facility A quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share declared First Quarter Financial and Production Highlights In the first quarter of 2015, strong operational performance continued at the Company's mines, which led to record quarterly production. Payable gold production in the first quarter of 2015 was a record 404,210 ounces compared to 366,421 ounces in the first quarter of 2014. The higher level of production in the 2015 period was primarily due to the inclusion of Canadian Malartic, a full quarter of production at La India, increased throughput levels at Goldex, increased mill capacity at Kittila and higher grades and better recoveries at Pinos Altos. A detailed description of the production and cost performance of each mine is set out below. Total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis for the first quarter of 2015 were higher at $588 versus $537 per ounce for the first quarter 2014. Total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis in the first quarter of 2015 were negatively impacted by lower zinc and copper production and lower realized silver and copper prices (down 17% and 21%, respectively, period over period) which were slightly offset by higher production levels at most of the Company's mines and weaker local currencies (C$ 2% lower, EURO 4% lower and MXP 15% lower when compared to the 2015 currency price assumptions, see February 11, 2015 news release) compared to the first quarter of 2014. Costs in the 2014 period were positively affected by record production and lower costs at Meadowbank (which processed the remaining high grade ore at the Portage and Goose deposits) and higher grades at LaRonde compared to the current period. AISC for the first quarter of 2015 was $804 per ounce on a by-product basis, which is below 2015 guidance of $880 to $900 per ounce on a by-product basis. The lower AISC is primarily due to lower than forecast total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis in 2015 and timing of capital expenditures. Cash Position Remains Strong and Debt Levels Reduced Cash and cash equivalents and short term investments decreased to $172.1 million at March 31, 2015, from the December 31, 2014 balance of $215.3 million. The outstanding balance on the $1.2 billion credit facility was reduced from $500 million at December 31, 2014 to $400 million at March 31, 2015. Total capital expenditures made by the Company in the first quarter of 2015 were $82.9 million, including $16.6 million at LaRonde, $12.0 million at Pinos Altos, $10.7 million at Canadian Malartic, $10.4 million at Kittila, $10.0 million at Goldex, $9.4 million at Meadowbank, $8.4 million at Meliadine, $2.8 million at Lapa, $2.3 million at La India and $0.3 million at Creston Mascota. Sustaining capital expenditures made by the Company in the first quarter were $60.8 million, including $16.6 million at LaRonde, $9.4 million at Meadowbank, $9.2 million at Canadian Malartic, $8.9 million at Kittila, $7.0 million at Pinos Altos, $4.3 million at Goldex, $2.8 million at Lapa, $2.3 million at La India and $0.3 million at Creston Mascota. The Company has adopted a phased approach to capital and exploration spending in 2015 and anticipates the potential for increased expenditures on select projects (if merited based on positive results). Projects that may warrant additional spending include Amaruq, El Barqueno, Goldex and Meliadine. As of March 31, 2015, the Company had drawn down $400 million on its $1.2 billion credit facility. This results in available lines of approximately $800 million, excluding another $300 million available in an accordion feature. Agrium Inc. (TSE: AGU) Agrium's first quarter affected by delayed start to U.S. spring season; announces dividend increase of 12 percent May 5, 2015 - ALL AMOUNTS ARE STATED IN U.S.$ CALGARY, Alberta -- Agrium Inc. (TSX and NYSE: AGU) announced today its 2015 first quarter earnings results, with net earnings of $14-million ($0.08 diluted earnings per share) this quarter compared to $3 million ($0.02 diluted earnings per share) in the first quarter of 2014. The higher earnings were supported by strong margins and operating rates for nitrogen products in Wholesale, while some first quarter Retail earnings were pushed into the second quarter as a result of the delayed start to the spring season in the U.S. this year. Highlights: First quarter adjusted net earnings of $19-million or $0.12 per share1 (see page 2 for adjusted net earnings reconciliation) Strong nitrogen performance contributed to Wholesale gross profit of $234-million compared to $171-million in Q1 2014 Retail gross profit of $371-million compared to $387-million in Q1 2014, impacted by slow start to U.S. spring season, shifts earnings into Q2 Announced a 12 percent increase to dividend, now $3.50 per share on an annualized basis Repurchased $75-million or approximately 712,000 shares since the beginning of April First half guidance range of $4.75 to $5.25 diluted earnings per share and updated 2015 annual guidance range narrowed to $7.00 to $8.25 diluted earnings per share Agrium's Board of Directors also announced today it has approved an increase to Agrium's dividend by 12 percent, or $0.38 U.S. per common share to a total dividend of $3.50 U.S. per common share on an annualized basis. Based on the closing price of Agrium's shares on the NYSE on Tuesday, May 5, 2015, his represents a dividend yield of 3.4 percent. The increased dividend is expected to be paid in quarterly installments of $0.875 U.S. and the next $0.875 U.S. per common share dividend has been declared by the board of Directors and will be paid on July 16, 2015 to shareholders of record on June 30, 2015. \"Agrium's first quarter results were impacted by a late start to the spring season in the U.S. this year. All indications are that Agrium will deliver strong second quarter results on solid crop input demand now that he spring application season is fully underway and given we have made excellent progress ramping up production from our expanded potash facility over the past month. We continue to position our operations and asset mix to support higher cash flow and capital returns over time irrespective of any short term headwinds. The increase in the dividend and recent share buy-back activity demonstrates our commitment to this strategy and to our shareholders,\" commented Chuck Magro, Agrium's President and CEO. UPDATED 2015 ANNUAL GUIDANCE Based on our Market Outlook, Agrium expects to achieve annual diluted earnings per share of $7.00 to $8.25 in 2015 compared to our previous estimate of $7.00 to $8.50 per share. We have narrowed the guidance range primarily based on the impact of higher Chinese urea exports on global urea prices, margin pressure on seed sales and the expected impact on crop input expenditures associated with a reduction in U.S. corn acres this year. We are issuing earnings guidance of $4.75 to $5.25 diluted earnings per share for the first half of 2015 indicative of a strong spring season despite earlier weather related delays. We have reduced our estimate of nitrogen production tonnes to reflect our plan to dispose of our West Sacramento upgrade facility announced subsequent to March 31, 2015. Our estimate is now 3.5 million to 3.7 million tonnes for the year as all other facilities are in line with our previously disclosed production range. Our Retail EBITDA3 for 2015 is now expected to be from $1.15-billion to $1.22-billion. The slight narrowing of the range from our previous estimate is due to some seed margin pressure this year, a reduction in U.S. corn acres and a slightly lower fertilizer pricing environment in 2015. We have updated our finance costs range for 2015 to $230-million to $250-million to reflect the incremental interest expense related to our $1-billion bond issuance in February 2015. Our estimates of the Canada/U.S. foreign exchange rate and NYMEX for 2015 have been narrowed from our original estimates based on current market conditions. This guidance and updated additional measures and related assumptions are summarized in the table on page 3. Guidance excludes the impact of share-based payments expense (recovery), gains (losses) on foreign exchange and non-qualifying derivative hedges. Volumetric and earnings estimates assume normaln seasonal growing and harvest patterns in the geographies where Agrium operates.

Sales Retail sales increased by $31-million for the first quarter of 2015 compared to the same period last year primarily due to higher sales volumes for crop protection products in the U.S. and Australia and slightly higher sales for crop nutrients and seed. Wholesale sales for the first quarter of 2015 decreased compared to 2014 as a result of lower potash sales volumes attributable to lower opening inventory and lower production volumes associated with the start-up of the Vanscoy expansion project. Product purchased for resale had lower sales as a result of the strategic review in 2014 that lead to exiting portions of this business, but contributed higher gross profit during the quarter. Gross Profit Our gross profit for the first quarter of 2015 increased by $28-million compared to the first quarter of 2014. The main drivers of this variance consisted of: Wholesale's gross profit increased by $63-million to $234-million primarily due to lower natural gas costs and manufacturing cost efficiencies and higher realized selling prices for ammonia and phosphate. Retail's gross profit decreased by $16-million to $371-million due to a slow start to the spring season, a crop shift in planted acres, and competitive pressures which impacted our seed, application, and crop protection margins this quarter. Expenses General and administrative expenses decreased in the first quarter of 2015 compared to the same period last year as we began to realize reductions related to our Operational Excellence program. Share-based payments Due to a larger share price increase and stronger share performance relative to our peers during the current quarter, our share-based payments increased by $14-million compared to the same period last year. The Board of Directors approved changes to our share-based payment plan effective January 1, 2015. Refer to note 6 of our Summarized Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. In the first quarter of 2015, we began to designate all of our natural gas derivatives as qualifying hedges for accounting purposes. During 2014, we designated only certain longer-term derivatives as hedges, none of which settled in 2014. We now record all gains and losses from these natural gas derivatives initially to equity, and subsequently to cost of product sold when we sell the related product. Previously, we recorded these natural gas derivative gains and losses to other expenses, resulting in the change in 2015 compared to 2014, which included natural gas derivative gains of $32-million. In the first quarter of 2015, we completed the sale of our Niota and Meredosia storage and distribution facilities resulting in a gain on sale of assets of $38-million. We also announced our intention to divest the West Sacramento nitrogen upgrade facility which will reduce capital cost, working capital and is not expected to impact net earnings. Environmental remediation and asset retirement obligation expense increased by $11-million due to an increase in our environmental remediation provision for our phosphate legacy sites. Effective Tax Rate The effective tax rate on continuing operations was 26 percent for the first quarter of 2015 compared to 29 percent for the same period last year due to an increase in income earned from low tax jurisdictions. BUSINESS SEGMENT PERFORMANCE Retail Retail reported first quarter sales of $2.3-billion, which is slightly above the $2.2-billion reported in the same quarter last year. Gross profit was $371-million in the first quarter of 2015, down from $387-million in last year's first quarter. Retail reported an EBITDA loss of $8-million compared to earnings of $17-million in the first quarter of last year. Retail's results were impacted by a late start to the spring season in the eastern and southern U.S., which has pushed North American earnings into the second quarter. International sales and gross profit were down in the current quarter as a result of lower merchandise sales and nutrient margins in Australia and weaker crop protection sales in South America. The first quarter saw a similar split between North American and International gross profit as the same period last year. Total crop nutrient sales were $911-million this quarter, up slightly from $896-million in the first quarter of 2014. A 3 percent increase in total sales volumes was partially offset by marginally lower nutrient prices in the first quarter. Higher nutrient volumes were due to strong demand in the Western U.S. and from tuck-in acquisitions over the past year. Gross profit for crop nutrients was $126-million this quarter, down marginally compared to the $128-million reported in the first quarter of 2014, while per tonne margins also declined slightly from $70 per tonne in the first quarter of 2014 to $67 per tonne this quarter. The slight reduction in margins was due to the stronger relative growth in volumes in lower margin international and Canadian markets, while nutrient margins in the U.S. were up year-over-year. Crop protection product sales were $793-million in the first quarter of 2015, compared to $730-million in the same period last year. The higher sales were attributable to increased volumes, primarily of lower margin glyphosate used for early weed control in areas where it was too wet to till. Gross profit was $108-million this quarter, compared to $105-million reported in the first quarter of 2014. Crop protection margins as a percentage of sales were 13.6 percent this quarter compared to 14.4 percent in the same period of 2014 due to a shift in sales mix to lower margin products, as well as a higher relative percentage of sales in lower margin regions such as Canada due to application delays in certain regions of the U.S. Seed sales were $308-million in the first quarter of 2015, up slightly from $298-million reported in the first quarter of last year. The increase in sales was driven by a slight increase in volumes in the U.S. this quarter as farmers prepared in advance for the spring season. This was partly offset by lower sales in Canada due to timing of purchases and the impact of the lower Canadian dollar compared to the same period last year. Gross profit was $40-million this quarter compared to $46-million for the same period last year, as competitive sales and crop mix shift impacted margins. Planted acres of corn are expected to be lower in 2015 compared to last year, and the spring delays have mainly impacted corn growing regions. These factors caused a lower percentage of higher-margin corn seed sales in the first quarter. As a result, seed margins as a percentage of sales were 13.0 percent in the first quarter of 2015, a reduction from the 15.4 percent reported in the first quarter of 2014. Sales of merchandise in the first quarter of 2015 were $142-million, compared to $186-million in the same period last year. Gross profit for this product line was $20-million this quarter, down slightly from $24-million in the first quarter of 2014. Merchandise results were impacted by lower demand and selling price for fuel in Western Canada, as well as decreased demand for fencing and water equipment in Australia. Services and other sales were $109-million this quarter, compared to the $122-million reported in the first quarter of 2014. Gross profit was $77-million in the first quarter of 2015, compared to $84-million for the same period last year. These decreases were largely due to a later than usual start to the spring application season across much of the eastern and southern U.S. and the timing of livestock shipments in Australia. Selling expenses as a percentage of sales were 18.7 percent in the first quarter of 2015 which is down from the 19.5 percent reported in the same period last year stemming from operational excellence initiatives and from the lower Canadian dollar. Retail selling expenses were $423-million for the first quarter, compared to $436-million in the same period last year. This variance was due to lower employee-related costs and the overall improvement in the cost structure of Australia, lower fuel costs for rolling stock expenses and lower depreciation charges. Wholesale Wholesale's 2015 first quarter sales were $867-million, down from the $1.1-billion reported in the same quarter last year primarily due to lower potash sales volumes and a decision to reduce the low-margin purchase for resale business. Gross profit was $234-million this quarter, compared to $171-million in the first quarter of 2014. Wholesale Adjusted EBITDA was $286-million in the first quarter of 2015 compared to $237-million reported in the same period last year. The increase in earnings was primarily due to significantly lower cost of production for our nitrogen and phosphate facilities, as a result of lower natural gas costs, improved operating rates and efficiencies and the impact of a weaker Canadian dollar on related fixed costs. Nitrogen gross profit for the first quarter of 2015 was $143-million compared to $90-million in the same quarter last year. Nitrogen production in the quarter was about 5 percent higher than the same quarter last year due to higher operating rates. Sales volumes were 761,000 tonnes, a slight decrease from the 792,000 tonnes in the same quarter last year due to lower opening inventories in the current period. Overall realized nitrogen sales prices were $414 per tonne, a $10 per tonne decrease from the same period in 2014. The decrease was due to lower urea benchmark prices, as record Chinese global urea exports in the first quarter of 2015 contributed to weakened international prices. Nitrogen cost of product sold was $226 per tonne this quarter, compared to $311 per tonne for the same period last year. The decrease was a result of significantly lower natural gas costs, a weaker Canadian dollar which lowered production costs reported in U.S. dollars and stronger operating rates and efficiencies. Average nitrogen gross margins were $188 per tonne this quarter, compared to $113 per tonne in the same period last year. As of January 1, 2015, we have designated all of our natural gas derivatives as hedges , with realized gains and losses now recorded to cost of product sold (which also includes transportation and administration costs). Nitrogen cost of product sold for the first quarter of 2014 would have been $288 per tonne if realized gains from natural gas derivatives had been applied on a comparative basis. Agrium's average natural gas cost was $2.93/MMBtu this quarter ($2.52/MMBtu excluding the impact of realized losses on natural gas derivatives) compared to $4.29/MMBtu ($5.02/MMBtu excluding the impact of realized gains on natural gas derivatives) for the same period in 2014. The average U.S. benchmark (NYMEX) natural gas price for the first quarter of 2015 was $2.96/MMBtu, compared to $4.90/MMBtu in the same quarter last year. The AECO (Alberta) basis differential was a $0.74/MMBtu discount to NYMEX in the first quarter of 2015, an increase from the $0.56/MMBtu discount in the first quarter of 2014. Potash gross profit for the first quarter of 2015 was $7-million, compared to $46-million reported in the same quarter last year. Sales volumes were 185,000 tonnes this quarter compared to 428,000 tonnes in the first quarter of 2014. The decrease in sales volumes was a result of the initial ramp-up of production volumes in the quarter after completing the tie-in of the Vanscoy one million tonne expansion project in December of 2014 and very low opening inventory in 2015. Average realized potash sales prices were $361 per tonne compared to $298 per tonne in the same period last year. Both North America and international realized sales prices were 10 to15 percent higher than the same period last year combined with a higher proportion of our sales this quarter sold into the North American market. Gross margin per tonne was impacted by higher costs related to the ramp-up of production, which were allocated over lower sales volumes. This was partially offset by the impact of a weaker Canadian dollar on fixed costs in the current period compared to the same period last year. Phosphate gross profit was $45-million in the first quarter of 2015, compared to $2-million in the same quarter last year. Phosphate sales volumes were 282,000 tonnes in the first quarter of 2015, compared to 308,000 tonnes in the same quarter last year. Realized phosphate sales prices were $639 per tonne this quarter compared to $544 per tonne in the same period last year, due to strong market conditions and tight supply. Phosphate cost of product sold was $481 per tonne in the first quarter of 2015, a decrease of $55 per tonne compared to the same period last year as a result of higher production rates, lower ammonia and rock costs, fixed cost savings and the impact of the weaker Canadian dollar on fixed costs. Gross margin in the first quarter of 2015 was $158 per tonne compared to $8 per tonne in the same period last year. Wholesale's Other, which includes product purchased for resale, ammonium sulfate, Environmentally Smart Nitrogen (\"ESN(r)\", hereinafter referred to as \"ESN\") and other gross profit was $39-million this quarter compared to $33-million in the same quarter of 2014. Ammonium sulfate gross profit was $16-million this quarter, $4-million higher than same period last year due to higher realized sales prices and lower input costs. ESN gross profit was $12-million compared to $10-million in the first quarter of 2014. This increase was due to higher volumes and lower ammonia input costs partially offset by lower realized sales prices for ESN in the current quarter. Product purchased for resale gross profit for the first quarter was $3-million higher than the same period last year due to higher margins in the current period. Wholesale expenses in the first quarter of 2015 were $9-million higher compared to the same period last year. The increase was related primarily to the $32-million gain from natural gas derivatives in the first quarter of 2014 and recorded in other expenses, and an $11-million increase in environmental remediation estimates. This was largely offset by a $38-million gain on the sale of non-core Purchase for Resale terminals this quarter. Other EBITDA for our Other non-operating business unit for the first quarter of 2015 was a net expense of $88- million, compared to a net expense of $68-million for the first quarter of 2014. The increase was due to the following: a $19-million higher gross profit elimination for the first quarter of 2015 compared to the first quarter of 2014. This is the result of an increase in margin per tonne in 2015 on intercompany inventory held by our Retail business unit compared to a decrease in the first quarter of 2014 coupled with higher intercompany inventory at the end of the first quarter of 2015; and, a $14-million increase in share-based payments expense. FINANCIAL CONDITION The following are changes to working capital on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for the three-month period ended March 31, 2015 compared to December 31, 2014. Analysis of cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2015 Cash flows provided by operating activities decreased due to a smaller growth in accounts payable during the first quarter of 2015 compared to the first quarter of 2014 as a result of softer market conditions and outlook on fertilizer pricing. Other key changes in our cash flows in the first quarter of 2015 were capital expenditures and financing. We incurred capital expenditures of $318-million for our Vanscoy potash facility ramp-up and our Borger nitrogen expansion project and we repaid short-term debt of $1.2-billion primarily from the proceeds of the issuance of $1-billion of debentures. Dividend payments were $109-million for the three months ended March 31, 2015. Our investing capital expenditures decreased in the first three months of 2015 compared to the first three months of 2014 due to the completion of the tie-in of our Vanscoy potash facility expansion in the fourth quarter of 2014, partially offset by increased expenditures relating to the Borger nitrogen expansion project. We incurred investing capital expenditures amounting to $197-million and $121-million for the Vanscoy facility ramp-up and the expansion of the Borger nitrogen facility, respectively. We expect the remaining capital spending to approximate $900-million to $1-billion in 2015. Short-term Debt Our short-term debt of $265-million at March 31, 2015 is outlined in note 5 of our Summarized Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our short-term debt decreased by $1.3-billion during the three months ended March 31, 2015, which primarily increased our unutilized short-term financing capacity to $2.6-billion as at March 31, 2015. Capital Management During the quarter, we issued $550-million of 3.375 percent debentures due March 15, 2025 and $450- million of 4.125 percent debentures due March 15, 2035. The debentures were issued under our base shelf prospectus, which permits issuance in Canada and the U.S. of up to $2.5-billion of common shares, debt and other securities less the offering price of securities issued between the 2014 filing date of the base shelf prospectus and May 2016. Issuance of further securities under the base shelf prospectus requires filing a prospectus supplement and is subject to availability of funding in capital markets. Our revolving credit facilities require that we maintain specific interest coverage and debt-to-capital ratios, as well as other non-financial covenants as defined in our credit agreements. We were in compliance with all covenants at March 31, 2015. NORMAL COURSE ISSUER BID On January 22, 2015, the Toronto Stock Exchange (\"TSX\") accepted Agrium's notice of intention to make a normal course issuer bid (\"NCIB\") whereby Agrium may purchase up to 7,185,866 common shares on the TSX and New York Stock Exchange during the period from January 26, 2015 to January 25, 2016. From April 1, 2015 to May 5, 2015, we purchased approximately 712,000 shares at an average share price of $105 for total consideration of $75-million. There were no share repurchases during the three months ended March 31, 2015. Shareholders can obtain a copy of the NCIB notice submitted to the TSX from Agrium without charge upon request. OUTSTANDING SHARE DATA Agrium had 143,029,081 outstanding shares at May 5, 2015. At that date, under our stock option plans, shares expected to be issued for options outstanding were negligible. The agricultural products business is seasonal in nature. Consequently, comparisons made on a year-overyear basis are more appropriate than quarter-over-quarter comparisons. Crop input sales are primarily concentrated in the spring and fall crop input application seasons. Crop nutrient inventories are normally accumulated leading up to each application season. Our cash collections generally occur after the application season is complete. ADDITIONAL IFRS AND NON-IFRS FINANCIAL MEASURES Certain financial measures in this MD&A are not prescribed by IFRS. We consider these financial measures discussed herein to provide useful information to both management and investors in measuring our financial performance and financial condition. In general, an additional IFRS financial measure is a measure relevant to understanding a company's financial performance that is not a minimum financial statement measure mandated by IFRS. A non-IFRS financial measure generally either excludes or includes amounts not excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS. Non-IFRS financial measures are not recognized measures under IFRS and our method of calculation is unlikely to be directly comparable to that of other companies. These non-IFRS measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. The following table outlines our additional IFRS financial measure, its definition and how management assesses such measure. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES We prepare our financial statements in accordance with IFRS, which requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates in applying accounting policies. For further information on the Company's critical accounting estimates, refer to the section \"Critical Accounting Estimates\" in our 2014 annual MD&A, which is contained in our 2014 Annual Report. Since the date of our 2014 annual MD&A, there have not been any material changes to our critical accounting estimates. CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES The accounting policies applied in our Consolidated Interim Financial Statements for the three months ended March 31, 2015 are the same as those applied in our audited annual financial statements in our 2014 Annual Report, with the exception of changes in accounting estimates described in note 9 of our Summarized Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the three months ended March 31, 2015. BUSINESS RISKS The information presented in the \"Enterprise Risk Management\" section on pages 64 - 68 in our 2014 Annual Report and under the heading \"Risk Factors\" on pages 22 - 31 in our 2014 Annual Information Form has not changed materially since December 31, 2014. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended March 31, 2015 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PUBLIC SECURITIES FILINGS MARKET OUTLOOK Record global crop production in 2014 and a sizeable Southern Hemisphere crop this year has weighed on international crop prices. The start of the spring application season in North America was delayed due to wet weather across the southern and eastern United States but seeding rates started to catch up in late April, and as of early May, were above the historical average. Drier conditions in the Northern Plains and Western Canada are expected to support strong seeded acreage and related crop input demand in these regions this year compared to recent history. This is particularly important for our Wholesale nitrogen sales and Canadian Retail operations. California is in a drought situation, which is expected to reduce acreage of some row crops this year, but high fruit and vegetable prices have supported crop input demand. U.S. corn acreage expectations have decreased slightly over the past month as a result of the delayed spring season in the Southern and Eastern U.S. If U.S. crop yields come in at or below trend levels this year we expect crop prices to firm up in the second half of 2015. The late start to the season in the Southern and Eastern U.S., combined with lower crop prices, resulted in delays in decisions regarding seeding and crop protection product use, pushing sales into the second quarter. Some growers have been more discerning regarding genetic traits and in some cases have selected older, lower-priced varieties. The later planting season is expected to support demand for retail services in the second quarter as growers focus on getting the crop inputs in place in a compressed season. Global crop nutrient demand was relatively strong in late 2014 and early 2015 as buyers purchased product ahead of the Northern Hemisphere spring season. This led to comfortable inventory levels heading into the spring season and has contributed to recent weakness in global nutrient pricing. The significant decline in the value of most non-U.S. currencies relative to the U.S. dollar has lowered the cost of production for many non-U.S. producers and raised the cost of crop inputs in some local currencies. However, overall the lower currencies have been a net benefit for growers in these regions due to higher crop prices in local currencies. China exported just over four million tonnes of urea in the first quarter of 2015, more than double the volume exported in the same period of 2014. Exports were supported by strong import demand from the United States and India. Ukrainian urea production and exports increased over the past few months, further adding prilled urea supplies to global trade. In recent weeks, Chinese nitrogen producers have resisted further price declines, indicating that urea prices are near the cost-based floor level and that the pace of Chinese exports is expected to slow relative to 2014 levels in the coming months. The delay in concluding Chinese and Indian potash supply agreements resulted in other potash buyers postponing purchases which pressured global potash prices in the first quarter of 2015. The North American potash market was also impacted by the delayed spring and higher offshore potash imports this year. Global phosphate demand has slowed in recent weeks, which has put some pressure on international and domestic pricing. Brazilian phosphate demand has begun relatively slow in 2015, but domestic deliveries improved in March and the import pace is expected to increase in the coming months. Analysts expect that Indian potash and phosphate demand will increase again in 2015.

Barrick Gold Corporation (TSX: ABX) Barrick Reports First Quarter 2015 Results Production and costs in the first quarter were in line with operating plans. The company produced 1.39 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs (AISC)1 of $927 per ounce and generated $316 million in operating cash flow. Full-year gold operating guidance remains on track for 6.2-6.6 million ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $860-$895 per ounce, with higher production and lower costs expected in the second half of the year. All-in sustaining costs and cash costs are expected to be highest in the second quarter of the year. The company remains committed to debt reduction of at least $3 billion by the end of 2015, with asset sales and other initiatives well advanced. Detailed evaluation of all capital spending plans using a 15 percent hurdle rate is now underway. To date, we have identified $200 million in capital expenditure reductions for 2015, with further reductions expected as the evaluation proceeds. Barrick is announcing a significant new gold discovery, known as Alturas, on Chile's prolific El Indio belt. Drilling to date suggests Alturas is geologically similar to Veladero, with the potential to be significantly higher grade. Barrick has formed a new partnership with Quantum Pacific Exploration, a company using innovative strategies and tools to increase the probability of discovery, faster than conventional approaches and at lower costs. The Lumwana mine will continue operating following announcement of new tax system by the government of Zambia. Copper production guidance for 2015 has been increased to 480-520 million pounds, with C1 cash costs unchanged at $1.75-$2.00 per pound. Value Realization Reviews underway to identify opportunities to maximize free cash flow, grow production and lower costs across the portfolio. TORONTO, April 27, 2015 - Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:ABX) (TSX:ABX) (Barrick or the company) met cost and production targets for the first quarter, reporting net earnings of $57 million ($0.05 per share). Adjusted net earnings were $62 million ($0.05 per share) . Operating cash flow was $316 million. Gold production guidance for 2015 remains at 6.2-6.6 million ounces, with production 55 percent weighted to the second half of the year, in line with plan. Costs are also expected to be 20 percent lower in the second half of the year, with full-year all-in sustaining costs in line with guidance of $860-$895 per ounce. TAKING BARRICK 'BACK TO THE FUTURE' We have revitalized the Board of Directors and the management team; implemented a lean, decentralized operating model to drive greater free cash flow per share; adopted a rigorous capital allocation framework with a minimum hurdle rate of 15 percent; implemented a concrete strategy to reduce debt by at least $3 billion this year; and restored the company's original partnership culture with the appointment of 35 new partners and the creation of the most owner-centric, long-term compensation system of any company in Canada and within our industry. We now have superb people, in the right roles, focused on the right things. In our new decentralized model, our miners are free from bureaucracy and are focused on maximizing free cash flow. A small head office is focused on allocating that cash flow to maximize shareholder returns. Our leaders are owners, with deep financial and emotional ownership in the long-term success of the business. We are determined to once again be the world's leading gold company, a company that consistently grows free cash flow per share from a portfolio of the best gold assets in the best regions, delivering industry-leading returns to our owners. BECOMING A TALENT-OBSESSED COMPANY Barrick is obsessed with talent. People issues are the first topic at every weekly meeting of Barrick's most senior leaders and the Board of Directors now regularly engages in in-depth talent diagnosis. Darian Rich, elevated to the role of Executive Vice President, Talent Management, reports on people issues at every Board meeting. The company has attracted 13 new senior leaders in the last nine months, individuals who personify the company's original values and bring vital skills and experience that support the company's business objectives, such as strengthening the balance sheet, fixing Pascua-Lama, improving efficiency and productivity, and building partnerships in China and beyond. Our newest addition is Dana Easthope. He will join the company in May as Vice President and Corporate Secretary. His first responsibility will be to bring greater depth, continuity, and strength to the relationship between our owners and the Board of Directors. Under his tenure as Corporate Secretary at Sun Life Financial, the company consistently appeared at the top of the Globe and Mail's annual ranking of companies with the best corporate governance practices, placing first out of 250 companies in Canada in 2012 and 2013 and second in 2014. RESTORING A STRONG BALANCE SHEET As we take Barrick 'back to the future', no priority is more important than restoring a strong balance sheet. Prudent financial management is a bedrock principle of the company. Our lean, decentralized operating model will maximize free cash flow per share--with more efficient and rigorous capital spending, reduced general and administrative costs, and profitable growth. These changes will contribute to the strength of our balance sheet over the long-term. We remain committed to our debt reduction target of at least $3 billion by the end of 2015, and have moved quickly to advance a number of asset sales and joint venture opportunities: Numerous companies have participated in the sales processes for the Cowal mine and the Porgera Joint Venture. Detailed due diligence on both assets is now underway, including site visits with prospective buyers. We have begun a process for the sale of a stake in the Zaldivar copper mine in Chile. Zaldivar is a consistently strong performer in the world's best jurisdiction for copper mining. Potential buyers have expressed a strong interest in acquiring an interest in the mine. We are actively exploring a number of other joint venture and sales opportunities We will take only those actions that make sense for the business, on terms we consider most favorable to our owners. Our strong liquidity means we can proceed with patience and discipline. We have less than $900 million in debt due over the next three years, a $4 billion undrawn credit facility, and $2.3 billion2 in cash at the end of the first quarter. CAPITAL ALLOCATION Barrick has returned to a lean, decentralized operating model with minimal bureaucracy. Our operational leaders are focused on maximizing free cash flow, and the head office, now about half the size it was a year ago, is focused on allocating that cash flow to maximize long-term value for our owners. At the end of 2014, we implemented a rigorous new capital allocation framework that goes beyond anything Barrick has undertaken in the past. We expect our portfolio to deliver a 10-15 percent return on invested capital through metal price cycles and, as such, individual projects are assessed against a hurdle rate of 15 percent. We will defer, cancel or sell projects that cannot achieve this target. The capital we invest to sustain or increase production at our existing operations is not spread evenly across the portfolio. Our operations must compete for it. Capital will flow to mines that meet our overall expectations for returns on invested capital. Assets that are unable to meet our capital allocation objectives will be sold. We are bringing this level of rigor to every part of the business. We have launched a detailed evaluation of all capital expenditures for 2015 and 2016. All spending plans will be re-assessed against our capital allocation objectives, including a minimum hurdle rate of 15 percent return on invested capital. Expenditures that do not meet our capital allocation objectives will be cancelled or deferred. We have already identified $200 million in capital expenditure reductions for 2015, with further reductions expected as we continue to implement our new capital allocation framework. We will report further progress with our second quarter results. The reductions identified thus far have been partially offset by an increase in copper sustaining capital following our decision to continue operations at Lumwana. As a result, our total capital expenditure guidance for 2015 has been reduced by $100 million to $1.8-$2.1 billion. OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE We remain on track to achieve our overall target of $30 million in savings from reduced general and administrative expenditures and overhead costs in 2015, reaching $70 million in annualized savings by 2016. We expect more to follow, as our operational leaders focus on maximizing free cash flow without the constraints of bureaucracy and unnecessary management layers. A multidisciplinary team of Barrick's leading mining experts and independent technical specialists is also in the process of reassessing the economic potential of every Barrick mine, identifying specific projects to maximize free cash flow, increase production and lower costs. Known as the Value Realization Project, these reviews also support our non-core asset sale process by ensuring we understand the full value of every mine before we proceed with any divestiture. Value Realization reviews are well underway for 10 operations, including our five core mines. Upside opportunities identified as part of the process will be incorporated into current mine plans where the initiatives meet our 15 percent hurdle rate or, where more engineering work and evaluations are required, may be added to mine plans for 2016 and beyond, strengthening our long term business plans. See the Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Information on page 25 of this press release. As one example, the Valuation Realization process completed at Barrick's Pueblo Viejo mine has identified a number of initiatives designed to increase efficiencies and create substantial value (100 percent basis) to the already successful operation. Key initiatives include: Increasing processing plant throughput by 2019: By making a series of on-going upgrades to the processing plant requiring capital expenditures of approximately $20 million, Barrick anticipates that it could increase plant throughput capacity by up to an additional 10 percent. Converting the fuel supply at the Quisqueya I power plant from heavy fuel oil to liquefied natural gas (LNG): By converting the fuel supply at the Quisqueya I power plant, which provides electricity to the Pueblo Viejo mine, from heavy fuel oil to LNG, Barrick anticipates that it could significantly reduce power plant operating costs. This initiative is expected to require minimal capital from Barrick, as the power plant is designed to operate on both fuels and could be completed as early as the end of 2017. Mine plan enhancements: Approximately 7-8 million ounces of mineral resources may potentially be converted into mineral reserves, extending the mine life, as a result of continued optimization efforts and by removing tailings capacity and other constraints and bottlenecks in mining and processing, using Barrick's current price guidance for reserves. This initiative is expected to require incremental capital expenditures over the life of mine of between $120-$150 million. Lime Kilns Fuel Conversion by 2017: By converting the fuel supply for the lime kilns at Pueblo Viejo from diesel fuel to LNG, Barrick anticipates that it can reduce energy consumption, costs and greenhouse gas emissions. This initiative will require capital expenditures of approximately $25 million over 18 months, with a payback period of approximately three years. Barrick will complete the technical analysis of these initiatives while its Value Realization team continues its site-by-site review. An updated Technical Report for Pueblo Viejo will be filed by the applicable filing deadline. We expect to provide more details about our Value Realization Project on a quarterly basis. GROWTH IN THE AMERICAS Barrick's five core mines in the Americas are expected to account for 60 percent of our production in 2015 at average all-in sustaining costs of $725-$775 per ounce. At two grams per tonne, these mines have an average reserve grade more than double that of our peer group average. They generate strong free cash flow in today's gold price environment and offer exceptional leverage to higher gold prices. We maintain a strong competitive advantage in Nevada and the Andes, with a growing pipeline of projects that have the potential to grow free cash flow per share: Four prefeasibility studies on growth projects in Nevada will be completed by the end of this year; We have formed an innovative new partnership for exploration in Chile; We intend to initiate a prefeasibility study to extend the life of the Lagunas Norte mine inPeru; and We are also announcing a significant new gold discovery on the El Indio belt in Chile. Alturas - A significant new gold discovery Approximately 85 percent of our 2015 exploration budget of $220-$260 million is allocated to the Americas, where our teams have uncovered some of the largest gold discoveries in recent decades, including the Lagunas Norte and Goldrush deposits. Today we are announcing another significant new gold discovery known as Alturas, located in the Andean region of Chile approximately 30 kilometers south of the former El Indio mine. Alturas is part of a large mineralized system which extends well beyond the limits of the current drilling area. To date, 35 core holes have been completed in a one-square-kilometer area. Mineralization appears to be oxide in nature and geologically similar to Veladero, with the potential to be significantly higher grade. Intercepts have been thick (typically ranging from 50-150 meters) and continuous. Assay results for the significant intercepts are provided in Appendix 3 and include the following highlights: ALT-011: 97 meters grading 4.4 grams per tonne ALT-017: 103.5 meters grading 1.64 grams per tonne ALT-033: 170 meters grading 2.76 grams per tonne This region of the Andes is home to some of the world's largest gold deposits, including Veladero, Pascua-Lama, El Indio and Tambo. Barrick controls almost all of the prospective ground on the 140 kilometer long El Indio belt. The new discovery at Alturas is the result of a methodical re-evaluation of the El Indio belt led by our exploration team, including members of the teams behind the Goldrush and Lagunas Norte discoveries. Drilling at Alturas will continue until the end of the summer season in May. With mineralization open in multiple directions, the focus going forward will be on defining the full extent of the deposit, as well as exploring for additional targets nearby. While we expect to report an initial resource at the end of the year, the potential quantities and grades in these preliminary results are conceptual in nature and there has been insufficient exploration to define a mineral resource at this time and it is uncertain that further exploration will result in the target being delineated as a mineral resource. Lagunas Norte Mine Life Extension Since it began operations in 2005, Lagunas Norte has outperformed production expectations. In 2014, the mine produced 582,000 ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of $543 per ounce. In its early years, production peaked at more than one million ounces per year. To date, Lagunas Norte has operated as an oxide heap leach mine. Barrick is currently evaluating a plan to significantly extend the life of Lagunas Norte by mining the refractory ore below the oxide ore body in the current pit. We intend to initiate a prefeasibility study to evaluate this opportunity. As part of the study, we intend to evaluate the installation of a new grinding-flotation-autoclave processing circuit to treat the refractory ore, including the potential relocation of one autoclave from the Goldstrike mine to Lagunas Norte. Innovative exploration partnership with QPX Barrick's focus is gold. As we have said, we have no plans to expand our existing copper position. Yet we do seek to maximize the value of those assets we already own, including large land positions in Chile in some of the world's most prolific districts for copper. Thus we have formed a strategic partnership with Quantum Pacific Exploration (QPX) to explore for copper deposits in a number of highly prospective areas of northern Chile. QPX is a company that focuses on exploring for one mineral commodity--copper--in one country--Chile. It is a part of the Quantum Pacific Group, an international business that includes some of the most innovative companies in natural resources, energy and commodities. Consistent with that theme, QPX is pioneering a new, multidisciplinary approach to exploration. The company has built a world-class team of experts who have a proven track record of copper discoveries and expertise in machine learning and big data analysis, among other disciplines. Their internal R&D lab uses proprietary technology to develop new strategies and tools designed to increase the probability of discovery, faster than conventional approaches and at lower costs. They combine world-class technical expertise with cutting-edge computer science, and they bring in learning from other industries to develop non-traditional approaches. QPX also shares Barrick's spirit of collaboration and regularly seeks out joint ventures with companies that are complementary in assets and expertise. Under the terms of our agreement, QPX will manage the exploration program. Any gold deposits located on Barrick land will remain 100 percent Barrick-owned. If a copper project is identified on either Barrick or QPX land, it will be 50 percent owned by each company. Certain properties where Barrick is already actively exploring, including zones around Zaldivar, Pascua-Lama, Cerro Casale and El Indio, are excluded from the agreement. The agreement is for five years, with an option to extend for another three years. The partners will contribute up to $30 million per year for exploration, with each bearing 50 percent of the total costs. Four Nevada Prefeasibility Studies on Track for Delivery in 2015 The Goldrush project, located six kilometers from the Cortez mine, is one of the largest and highest grade gold discoveries of the last decade. The prefeasibility study is now expected to be complete by the end of 2015. Permitting is progressing for twin exploration declines that will allow the company to better explore the northern limits of the known deposit. At the Turquoise Ridge mine (75 percent owned by Barrick), we are advancing a project to develop an additional shaft, which could bring forward more than one million ounces of production, roughly doubling output to an average of 500,000 ounces per year (100 percent basis) at all-in sustaining costs of about $625-$675 per ounce. The joint venture partners have approved a feasibility study and detailed engineering for the project. Pending receipt of permits and joint venture approval, initial production could commence in 2019. Preliminary estimates indicate capital expenditures of approximately $300-$325 million (100 percent basis) for additional underground development and shaft construction, and an attractive payback period of about two and a half years at a gold price assumption of $1,300 per ounce. Drilling will continue in 2015 at the northern extension of the deposit where the ore body is still open to the north and east with higher grades than the average reserve grade. A prefeasibility study for expanded underground mining at Cortez below currently permitted levels will be completed in late 2015. Mineralization in this zone is primarily oxide and higher grade compared to the current underground mine, which is refractory in nature. The limits of the Lower Zone have not yet been defined, and drilling has indicated the potential for new targets at depth. The Spring Valley project (75 percent owned by Barrick) is located approximately 75 miles west of Cortez, is a low capital cost, oxide heap leach project with potential to become another standalone mine in Nevada. In addition, there is good potential to expand the current resource at higher gold prices. The company is on track to complete a prefeasibility study in late 2015. FINANCIAL DISCUSSION First quarter 2015 net earnings were $57 million ($0.05 per share) compared to $88 million ($0.08 per share) in the prior year period. Operating cash flow in the first quarter was $316 million compared to $585 million in the first quarter of 2014. Lower net earnings and operating cash flow reflect lower realized gold and copper prices, and lower gold sales compared to the prior year period. Adjusted net earnings for the first quarter were $62 million ($0.05 per share) compared to $238 million ($0.20 per share) in the first quarter of 2014. Significant adjusting items (net of tax and non-controlling interest effects) in the quarter include: $22 million in gains from asset dispositions; $13 million adjustment reflecting the use of a lower discount rate to calculate the provision for environmental remediation at our closed mines; and $6 million in unrealized foreign currency translation losses. Barrick expects to be free cash flow positive in 2015 at current gold prices. OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS AND GUIDANCE Gold production guidance for 2015 is 6.2-6.6 million ounces at AISC of $860-$895 per ounce. Production will be approximately 55 percent weighted to the second half of the year and costs are expected to be 20 percent lower in that period. Additionally, all-in sustaining costs and cash costs are expected to be highest in the second quarter of the year. Following the decision to continue operations at Lumwana, total copper guidance for 2015 is now expected to be 480-520 million pounds at C1 cash costs of $1.75-$2.00 per pound. Cameco Corporation (TSE: CCJ) Cameco is one of the world's largest uranium producers accounting for about 16% of the global production from its mines in Canada, the US and Kazakhstan. Our leading position is backed by about 429 million pounds of proven and probable reserves and extensive resources. Cameco Reports First Quarter Financial Results ALL AMOUNTS ARE STATED IN CDN $ (UNLESS NOTED) higher revenue and gross profit lower uranium production due to unplanned Key Lake mill outage, still on track for year continued success ramping up production at Cigar Lake mine and McClean Lake mill McArthur River production limit increase to 25 million pounds annually approved by CNSC supply agreement signed between Cameco Inc. and India's Department of Atomic Energy Cameco (TSX:CCO) (NYSE:CCJ) today reported its consolidated financial and operating results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2015 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). \"We have continued to perform well in an uncertain market,\" said president and CEO, Tim Gitzel. \"We have not only achieved success at the operational level, with excellent progress at Cigar Lake, and permission for a higher production level at McArthur River, but our company as a whole has focused on remaining a market leader, by maintaining strong relationships with our customers, and forging new relationships, as Cameco Inc. did by signing a long-term supply agreement with India. Our strengths have always been great people, great assets, and a strong portfolio of contracts, and we continue to build on those strengths, even in a depressed market.\" FIRST QUARTER Net loss attributed to equity holders (net loss) this quarter was $9 million (loss of $0.02 per share diluted) compared to net earnings of $131 million ($0.33 per share diluted) in the first quarter of 2014. Our net loss was primarily due to higher mark-to-market losses on foreign exchange derivatives. In addition, our 2014 earnings included a gain on the sale of our interest in BPLP of $127 million. On an adjusted basis, our earnings this quarter were $69 million ($0.18 per share diluted) compared to $36 million ($0.09 per share diluted) (non-IFRS measure, see section) in the first quarter of 2014. The change was mainly due to higher earnings from our fuel services and NUKEM segments based on higher sales volumes, partially offset by lower earnings in our uranium segment. In addition, our 2014 adjusted net earnings also included an early termination fee of $18 million incurred as a result of the cancellation of our toll conversion agreement with Springfields Fuels Ltd. (SFL), which was to expire in 2016. Uranium market update The market in the first quarter of 2015 changed little from the last quarter of 2014. The modest level of contracting activity was comparable to the previous quarter, with no significant strength or weakness emerging. On the positive side, China started approving new reactor projects after a hiatus following the 2011 events in Japan, and four reactors under construction in China joined the grid. As a result, China now has 26 reactors operating and 23 under construction. On the supply side, production issues at several large uranium mines threaten to tighten supply in the coming year, although the market impact has not yet been significant. Japan continued to experience difficulties with reactor restarts in 2015, although the country reported a mix of both negative and positive developments. The industry experienced another potential setback with the recent court injunction preventing the restart of Kansai Electric's two Takahama units, which had applied for restart and had already met the Nuclear Regulatory Authority's new safety standards. This development adds to ongoing uncertainty about the pace of restarts in Japan. Additionally, it was announced that five older reactors would not submit restart applications, but would be permanently retired. However, positive news also emerged when a provisional injunction to block the restart of the Sendai reactors was rejected by the Kagoshima District Court, allowing Kyushu Electric to remain focused on the safe restart of the facility. The frontrunners for restart continue to be the two Sendai reactors, which appear poised for restart this summer, following final regulatory approvals and pre-operational safety checks. In the absence of a significant uptick in demand from fuel buyers, whose requirements continue to be well covered in 2015, there was modest movement in the uranium spot price from the later part of 2014. The spot price has shown some support just below $40 (US). Looking forward, Canada's Nuclear Cooperation Agreement with India, and Cameco Inc.'s subsequent supply agreement with India's Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), represents significant opportunities in the world's second fastest growing market for nuclear fuel. The sale, into a market that was previously closed to us, provides 7.1 million pounds of uranium concentrate under a long-term contract through 2020 and, we anticipate, marks the beginning of a long and positive relationship with a new customer. Longer term, strong fundamentals underpin a positive outlook for the industry as 63 reactors are currently under construction, and a net increase of 81 reactors is expected over the next 10 years. This demand fundamental combined with the timing, development and execution of new supply projects and the continued performance of existing supply will determine the pace of market recovery. Outlook for 2015 Our strategy is to profitably produce at a pace aligned with market signals, while maintaining the ability to respond to conditions as they evolve. Our outlook for 2015 reflects the expenditures necessary to help us achieve our strategy. Our outlook for uranium revenue, fuel services revenue, consolidated revenue, tax rate and capital expenditures has changed, as explained below. We do not provide an outlook for the items in the table that are marked with a dash. Our 2015 outlook for sales volume in our uranium and NUKEM segments does not include sales between our uranium, fuel services and NUKEM segments. For comparison of our 2015 outlook and 2014 results for revenue in our uranium and NUKEM segments, we do not include sales between our uranium, fuel services and NUKEM segments. Based on a uranium spot price of $38.25 (US) per pound (the Ux spot price as of April 27, 2015), a long-term price indicator of $49.00 (US) per pound (the Ux long-term indicator on April 27, 2015) and an exchange rate of $1.00 (US) for $1.20 (Cdn). This increase is based on the unit cost of sale for produced material and committed long-term purchases. If we make discretionary purchases in 2015, then we expect the overall unit cost of sales to increase further. Direct administration costs do not include stock-based compensation expenses. Our outlook for uranium revenue and for fuel services revenue has changed to an increase of up to 5% for each (previously decreases of 5% to 10%, and up to 5% respectively) due to further weakening of the Canadian dollar. As a result consolidated revenue is also now expected to increase by up to 5% (previously a decrease of up to 5%). We have adjusted our outlook for the tax rate to a recovery of 45% to 50% (previously a recovery of 60% to 65%) due to a change in the distribution of earnings between jurisdictions. We now expect capital expenditures to be $405 million (previously $370 million). The increase is primarily due to an increase in the cost to modify AREVA's McClean Lake mill to allow it to operate at 18 million pounds annually, as well as the timing of expenditures on projects at McArthur River and Key Lake. See Operations Updates section for more information. In our uranium and fuel services segments, our customers choose when in the year to receive deliveries, so our quarterly delivery patterns, sales volumes and revenue can vary significantly. We expect uranium deliveries in the second quarter to be similar to the first quarter, and expect remaining 2015 deliveries to be more heavily weighted to the fourth quarter. However, not all delivery notices have been received to date, which could alter the delivery pattern. Typically, we receive notices six months in advance of the requested delivery date. REVENUE AND EARNINGS SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS For the rest of 2015: a change of $5 (US) per pound in both the Ux spot price ($38.25 (US) per pound on April 27, 2015) and the Ux long-term price indicator ($49.00 (US) per pound on April 27, 2015) would change revenue by $88 million and net earnings by $57 million a one-cent change in the value of the Canadian dollar versus the US dollar would effectively change revenue by $8 million and net earnings by $6 million, with a decrease in the value of the Canadian dollar versus the US dollar having a positive impact1 1 Corrected on May 1, 2015, previously: \"a one-cent change in value of the Canadian dollar versus the US dollar would effectively change revenue by $6 million and net earnings by $1 million...\" ADJUSTED NET EARNINGS (NON-IFRS MEASURE) Adjusted net earnings are a measure that does not have a standardized meaning or a consistent basis of calculation under IFRS (non-IFRS measure). We use this measure as a more meaningful way to compare our financial performance from period to period. We believe that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, certain investors use this information to evaluate our performance. Adjusted net earnings are our net earnings attributable to equity holders, adjusted to better reflect the underlying financial performance for the reporting period. The adjusted earnings measure reflects the matching of the net benefits of our hedging program with the inflows of foreign currencies in the applicable reporting period, and has also been adjusted for NUKEM purchase price inventory write-downs and recoveries, income taxes on adjustments, impairment charges on non-producing property, and the after tax gain on the sale of our interest in BPLP. Adjusted net earnings are non-standard supplemental information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information prepared according to accounting standards. Other companies may calculate this measure differently, so you may not be able to make a direct comparison to similar measures presented by other companies. The following table reconciles adjusted net earnings with our net earnings. DISCONTINUED OPERATION On March 27, 2014, we completed the sale of our 31.6% limited partnership interest in BPLP. The aggregate sale price for our interest in BPLP and certain related entities was $450 million. The sale was accounted for effective January 1, 2014. We realized an after tax gain of $127 million on this divestiture. See note 4 to the interim financial statements for more information. FIRST QUARTER Production volumes this quarter were 11% lower compared to the first quarter of 2014, mainly due to lower production at McArthur River/Key Lake and our ISR operations, partially offset by higher production at Rabbit Lake and production from Cigar Lake. See Operations Updates section for more information. Uranium revenues were up 6% due to a 1% increase in sales volumes and a 4% increase in the Canadian dollar average realized price. The US dollar average realized price decreased by 7% compared to 2014 mainly due to lower prices on fixed price contracts. Our Canadian dollar realized prices this quarter were higher than the first quarter of 2014, primarily as a result of the weakening of the Canadian dollar. In the first quarter of 2015, the exchange rate on the average realized price was $1.00 (US) for $1.21 (Cdn) over the quarter, compared to $1.00 (US) for $1.09 (Cdn) in the first quarter of 2014. Total cost of sales (including D&A) increased by 11% ($254 million compared to $229 million in 2014). This was mainly the result of a 1% increase in sales volumes and a 13% increase in cash cost of sales. In the first quarter of 2015, total cash cost of sales were $204 million compared to $180 million in the first quarter of 2014 due to a higher volume of material purchases, and increased unit production costs due to lower overall production. The net effect was a $6 million decrease in gross profit for the quarter. The following table shows the costs of produced and purchased uranium incurred in the reporting periods (which are non-IFRS measures, see below table). These costs do not include selling costs such as royalties, transportation and commissions, nor do they reflect the impact of opening inventories on our reported cost of sales. Cash cost per pound, non-cash cost per pound and total cost per pound for produced and purchased uranium presented in the above table are non-IFRS measures. These measures do not have a standardized meaning or a consistent basis of calculation under IFRS. We use these measures in our assessment of the performance of our uranium business. We believe that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, certain investors use this information to evaluate our performance and ability to generate cash flow. These measures are non-standard supplemental information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared according to accounting standards. These measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under IFRS. Other companies may calculate these measures differently, so you may not be able to make a direct comparison to similar measures presented by other companies. To facilitate a better understanding of these measures, the following table presents a reconciliation of these measures to our unit cost of sales for the first quarters of 2015 and 2014. FIRST QUARTER Total revenue increased by 65% due to a 67% increase in sales volumes. The total cost of products and services sold (including D&A) increased by 55% ($59 million compared to $38 million in the first quarter of 2014) due to the increase in sales volumes, partially offset by a decrease in the average unit cost of sales. When compared to 2014, the average unit cost of sales was 8% lower due to the mix of fuel services products sold. The net effect was a $6 million increase in gross profit. FIRST QUARTER During the first three months of 2015, NUKEM delivered 2.5 million pounds of uranium, an increase of 1.8 million pounds (257%) due to timing of customer requirements and greater market activity. NUKEM revenues amounted to $97 million as a result of higher deliveries. Average realized prices were slightly lower than those realized in the first quarter of 2014. Gross profit amounted to $11 million, an increase of $14 million compared to the first quarter of 2014. Included in the 2014 loss for the quarter was a $6 million write-down of inventory, as a result of a decline in the spot price during the period compared to a $3 million recovery in 2015. Excluding the effects of inventory adjustments, gross profits would be 8% in the first quarter of 2015 and 9% in the first quarter of 2014. MCARTHUR RIVER/KEY LAKE Production for the quarter was 29% lower compared to the same period last year due to several weeks of unplanned mill maintenance to repair the existing calciner and related equipment. Our planned annual production for the operation is unchanged. Construction of the new calciner at Key Lake is ongoing, with commissioning planned for late 2015. The existing calciner circuit will remain in place until operational reliability of the new calciner is achieved. The calciner replacement project was planned in a way that will temporarily allow us to use either calciner, which will help to mitigate risks to our production rate during the commissioning phase. At McArthur River, the CNSC has approved an increase of our licence production limit to 25 million pounds per year (100% basis), which matches the annual mill production licence limit at Key Lake. Provincial approval for 25 million pounds of annual production at McArthur River is the final step in the approval process, and we are currently awaiting a decision. The increased production limit at the McArthur River/Key Lake operation aligns with our strategy to maintain the flexibility to respond to market conditions as they evolve, and prepare our operations and projects to respond when the market signals that additional production is needed. CIGAR LAKE The jet boring system at the Cigar Lake mine performed as expected during the first quarter, and we successfully mined 1.9 million pounds of uranium for shipment to the McClean Lake mill. We are continuing to ramp up mine production using two jet boring machines (JBS) and expect to commission the third JBS this year. The mined ore is routinely transported to the McClean Lake mill, which, during the first quarter, packaged approximately 690,000 pounds (100% basis, 345,000 pounds our share) and remains on track to achieve the annual production target of 6 million to 8 million packaged pounds (100% basis). As of April 25, a total of about 2.7 million pounds of uranium has been extracted from the mine, and a total of about 1.5 million pounds (100% basis) has been packaged at the McClean Lake mill in 2015. Commercial production is achieved when management determines that the mine is able to produce at a consistent or sustainably increasing level. Once we have declared commercial production at Cigar Lake, we will begin depreciating the assets, contributing to an increase in our overall production costs (non-cash), as indicated in our 2015 outlook. We expect Cigar Lake to produce between 6 million and 8 million packaged pounds in 2015; our share is 3 million to 4 million pounds. As we ramp up production to 18 million pounds (100% basis) by 2018, volumes may not be linear year-to-year, but will vary based on our operational experience. To ensure the most efficient operation of the mine and mill throughout the year, we expect to continually manage ore supply and, therefore, may halt and resume mining several times during a quarter without impacting planned annual production. AREVA has indicated good progress in the ramp up of the McClean mill, with feed grades exceeding 25% U3O8, and an output well above historical mill production levels. To allow the McClean Lake mill to reach full production of 18 million pounds annually, AREVA now estimates that our share of expenditures related to the mill modifications will be about $80 million in 2015 (previously $60 to $70 million (our share) in 2015), and advises additional expenditures will also be required after 2015. The increase in 2015 expenditures is due to larger quantities of piping, electrical, instrumentation, and related labour, identified upon completion of detailed engineering. AREVA is currently preparing an updated estimate of the cost to complete the mill modifications. INKAI Production in the first quarter was 14% lower compared to the same period of 2014, but remains aligned with the current 2015 mine plan. Inkai is on target to produce 5.2 million pounds (100% basis) this year. The Ministry of Energy of the Republic of Kazakhstan has issued a letter to JV Inkai approving the extension of the period for Block 3 deposit evaluation by three years to July 13, 2018, provided the design document is approved in accordance with the established legislation order before June 13, 2015. FUEL SERVICES Fuel services produced 2.6 million kgU in the first quarter, 35% lower than the same period last year, primarily due to the reduced volumes attributable to the early termination of the SFL contract in 2014. We decreased our production target in 2015 to between 9 million and 10 million kgU, so quarterly production is expected to be lower than comparable periods in 2014. The current collective bargaining agreement for our unionized employees at CFM expires on June 1, 2015. We began preparing for the collective bargaining process during the first quarter. Qualified persons The technical and scientific information discussed in this document for our material properties (McArthur River/Key Lake, Inkai and Cigar Lake) was approved by the following individuals who are qualified persons for the purposes of NI 43-101: MCARTHUR RIVER/KEY LAKE David Bronkhorst, vice-president, mining and technology, Cameco CIGAR LAKE Les Yesnik, general manager, Cigar Lake, Cameco INKAI Darryl Clark, general director, JV Inkai Caution about forward-looking information This document includes statements and information about our expectations for the future.

Corporation (TSX: FNV) Franco-Nevada Reports Q1 2015 Results and Increases Quarterly Dividend TORONTO, May 6, 2015 - Franco-Nevada Corporation (TSX: FNV; NYSE: FNV) today reported first quarter 2015 financial results realizing 85,081 Gold Equivalent Ounces (\"GEOs\")1 from its mineral assets and $5.5 million in revenue from its oil & gas assets. Net Income and Adjusted Net Income2 were $19.2 million, or $0.12 per share, and $22.9 million, or $0.15 per share, respectively, with Adjusted EBITDA3 being $83.3 million, or $0.53 per share. \"Franco-Nevada's mineral assets continue to deliver dependable results with our new asset, Candelaria, having a strong first quarter. However lower average oil prices impacted our revenue,\" said David Harquail, President and CEO. \"Our overall portfolio is diverse with high margin assets that continue to deliver strong operating cash flows. This has allowed us to continue the tradition of increasing our dividend each year. Our previously announced 5% dividend increase has now been formally declared for the second quarter of 2015. Franco-Nevada remains debt free with $671.3 million in working capital at quarter end. We expect to continue to grow our portfolio with further investments.\" Investments Ring of Fire: On April 28, 2015, Franco-Nevada acquired royalty rights in the Ring of Fire mining district of Ontario by providing $28.5 million in loan and royalty financing to Noront Resources Ltd. Dublin Gulch (Eagle): On January 14, 2015, Franco-Nevada acquired royalties on the Eagle deposit located in the Yukon for $7.0 million. Cobre Panama: Franco-Nevada continues to work with First Quantum to streamline reporting requirements and provide greater flexibility to finance the project. First Quantum reported that construction at Cobre Panama continued to advance in the first quarter with detailed engineering and site earthworks progressing well. Franco-Nevada expects to fund $300.0 million to $350.0 million in 2015 in connection with the precious metals stream agreement. Portfolio Updates Gold - U.S.: GEOs from U.S. gold assets decreased to 10,378 GEOs mainly due to lower production at Goldstrike partially offset by higher GEOs from Bald Mountain and Fire Creek/Midas, a February 2014 acquisition. Gold - Canada: GEOs from Canadian assets increased in the quarter with increases from the Kirkland Lake and Timmins West royalties. Lake Shore Gold has reported promising drill results at its 144 Gap Zone where Franco-Nevada holds a 2.25% NSR. Rubicon Minerals has reported positive progress to achieving production this year at the Phoenix project where Franco-Nevada holds a 2% NSR. Centerra Gold has committed $300 million to its 50-50 partnership in the Hardrock project where Franco-Nevada has a 3% NSR. In addition, Yamana Gold has agreed to acquire Mega Precious Metals, the owner of the Monument Bay project where Franco-Nevada holds a 3% NSR. Gold - Latin America: Candelaria had a good first quarter and delivered 21,705 GEOs to Franco-Nevada. Gold - Rest of World: Contributions from Sabodala and MWS represented approximately 65% of the total GEOs received from Rest of World gold assets for the first quarter of 2015. Alamos Gold has reported that the Environmental Impact Assessment for the Agi Dagi project has been returned to good standing. Franco-Nevada has a 2% NSR on Agi Dagi. Perseus Mining has announced a go-ahead decision on Sissingue where Franco-Nevada has a 0.5% NSR. PGM: PGM GEOs were impacted by the declining platinum price in the quarter. Oil & gas: Revenue from oil & gas assets was $5.5 million in Q1 2015 with similar production levels as Q1 2014. The decrease in revenue is the result of lower average oil prices and carry-over capital from 2014 related to the Weyburn Unit NRI. Stronger revenues are expected from oil & gas assets over the balance of 2015. Corporate Updates Franco-Nevada is pleased to announce that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.21 per share.

GoldCorp Inc. (TSE: G) MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2015 This Management's Discussion and Analysis (\"MD&A\") should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements of Goldcorp Inc. (\"Goldcorp\" or \"the Company\") for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and related notes thereto which have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\"GAAP\" or \"IFRS\") as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (\"IASB\"). This MD&Acontains \"forward-looking statements\" that are subject to risk factors set out in a cautionary note contained herein. All figures are in United States (\"US\") dollars unless otherwise noted. References to C$ are to Canadian dollars. This MD&A has been prepared as of April 29, 2015. FIRST QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS On April 6, 2015, the Company announced it had signed a binding Letter of Intent with Premier Gold Mines (\"Premier\") for the sale of its 40% interest in the South Arturo Mine Project (the \"Project\") in Nevada. The Project is a joint venture between the Company, a 40% owner, and Barrick Gold Corporation (\"Barrick\"), a 60% owner and the operator of the Project. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company will receive cash consideration of $20 million and a further 5% interest in the RahillBonaza Joint Venture in Red Lake. The closing of the agreement, which is subject to Barrick not exercising its right of first refusal in respect of the Project and completion of definitive documentation, is expected to occur by the end of May 2015. Eleonore declared commercial production effective April 1, 2015. On March 13, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of Probe Mines Limited (\"Probe\") for total consideration of C $434 million ($343 million) including the issuance of 13.3 million common shares to former Probe shareholders and 1.4 million stock options and 0.5 million warrants to former Probe option and warrant holders, respectively. Probe's principal asset is the 100%-owned Borden gold project in Ontario, 160 kilometres west of the Company's Porcupine mine. On March 12, 2015, the Company announced that Minera Penasquito had reached a definitive court approved settlement with the Cerro Gordo Ejido relating to surface land rights to 600 hectares (approximately 1,483 acres) of land located within the confines of the Penasquito Mine site. Minera Penasquito had negotiated an agreement for use of the land prior to the construction of the mine, however, in 2009 the Cerro Gordo Ejido commenced an action against Penasquito in Mexico's agrarian courts challenging the land use agreement. Following a series of legal proceedings, the agrarian courts ruled on June 18, 2013, that the land use agreement was null and ordered the land to be returned to the Cerro Gordo Ejido. This recent settlement reached fully resolves the dispute. Concurrently, Minera Penasquito and the Cerro Gordo Ejido entered into a new thirty year surface land use agreement on commercial terms for the 600 hectares. On February 20, 2015, the Company completed the sale of the Wharf mine in Lead, South Dakota to Coeur Mining, Inc. for total cash consideration of $99 million, after closing adjustments. On January 30, 2015, the Company announced it had signed a Collaboration Agreement with the Wabauskang First Nations. The agreement paves the way for long-term economic benefits for the northwestern Ontario First Nations and provides a framework for strengthened collaboration in the development and operations of the Red Lake Gold Mines. With the signing of the agreement, the Company now has collaboration agreements in place with all of the First Nations which assert Aboriginal and treaty rights in the vicinity of the Company's active operations in Canada. Cerro Negro declared commercial production effective January 1, 2015. Key consolidated financial information: Net loss attributable to shareholders of Goldcorp, including discontinued operations, of $(87) million ($(0.11) per share), compared with net earnings, including discontinued operations, of $98 million ($0.12 per share) in 2014. Operating cash flows, including discontinued operations, of $58 million, compared with $273 million in 2014. Dividends paid of $122 million, compared to $122 million in 2014. $1.3 billion of liquidity Key performance measures Goldcorp's share of gold production increased to 724,800 ounces, compared with 679,900 ounces in 2014. Goldcorp's share of gold sales was 827,500 ounces, compared with 684,000 ounces in 2014. Total cash costs of $585 per gold ounce, net of by-product silver, copper, lead and zinc credits, compared with $507 per gold ounce in 2014. On a co-product basis, cash costs of $670 per gold ounce, compared with $673 per gold ounce in 2014. All-in sustaining costs of $885 per gold ounce, compared with $840 per gold ounce in 2014. All-in costs of $1,210 per gold ounce, compared with $1,403 per gold ounce in 2014. Adjusted net earnings of $12 million ($0.01 per share), compared with $209 million ($0.26 per share) in 2014. Goldcorp's share of adjusted operating cash flows of $366 million, compared to $281 million in 2014. Goldcorp's share of negative free cash flows of $(360) million, compared to $(165) million in 2014. At March 31, 2015, the Company held $365 million of cash and cash equivalents, money market investments of $55 million and had $860 million undrawn on its $2 billion revolving credit facility. The Company has included non-GAAP performance measures on an attributable (or Goldcorp's share) basis throughout this document. Attributable performance measures include the Company's mining operations, including its discontinued operation, and projects, and the Company's share of Alumbrera and Pueblo Viejo. The Company believes that disclosing certain performance measures on an attributable basis is a more relevant measurement of the Company's operating and economic performance, and reflects the Company's view of its core mining operations. The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, the Company and certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company's performance and ability to generate cash flow; however, these performance measures do not have any standardized meaning. Accordingly, it is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company has included non-GAAP performance measures - total cash costs, by-product and co-product, per gold ounce, throughout this document. In the gold mining industry, total cash costs is a common performance measure but does not have any standardized meaning. The Company follows the recommendations of the Gold Institute Production Cost Standard. The Gold Institute, which ceased operations in 2002, was a non-regulatory body and represented a global group of suppliers of gold and gold products. The production cost standard developed by the Gold Institute remains the generally accepted standard of reporting cash costs of production by gold mining companies. In addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, the Company assesses this measure in a manner that isolates the impacts of gold production volumes, the by-product credits, and operating costs fluctuations such that the non-controllable and controllable variability is independently addressed. The Company uses total cash costs, by-product and co-product, per gold ounce, to monitor its operating performance internally, including operating cash costs, as well as in its assessment of potential development projects and acquisition targets. The Company believes these measures provide investors and analysts with useful information about the Company's underlying cash costs of operations and the impact of by-product credits on the Company's cost structure and is a relevant metric used to understand the Company's operating profitability and ability to generate cash flow. When deriving the production cash costs associated with an ounce of gold, the Company includes by-product credits as the Company considers that the cost to produce the gold is reduced as a result of the by-product sales incidental to the gold production process, thereby allowing the Company's management and other stakeholders to assess the net costs of gold production. The Company and certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company's performance and ability to generate cash flow. Accordingly, it is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Total cash costs on a by-product basis are calculated by deducting Goldcorp's share of by product silver, copper, lead and zinc sales revenues from Goldcorp's share of production costs. Total cash costs on a co-product basis are calculated by allocating Goldcorp's share of production costs to each co-product based on the ratio of actual sales volumes multiplied by budget metal prices, as compared to realized sales prices. The Company uses budget prices to eliminate price volatility and improve co-product cash cost reporting comparability between periods. If silver, lead and zinc for Penasquito, silver for Marlin, Cerro Negro and Pueblo Viejo, and copper for Alumbrera were treated as co-products, Goldcorp's share of total co-product cash costs, including discontinued operations, for the three months ended March 31, 2015, would be $670 per ounce of gold, $9.79 per ounce of silver, $2.36 per pound of copper, $0.80 per pound of zinc, and $0.81 per pound of lead (March 31, 2014 - $673 per ounce of gold, $10.58 per ounce of silver, $2.26 per pound of copper, $0.73 per pound of zinc and $0.85 per pound of lead). Using actual realized sales prices, co-product total cash costs, including discontinued operations, would be $683 per gold ounce for the three months ended March 31, 2015 (March 31, 2014 - $683). Refer to page 35 for a reconciliation of total cash costs to reported production costs. All-in sustaining costs and all-in costs are non-GAAP performance measures that the Company believes more fully define the total costs associated with producing gold; however, these performance measures have no standardized meaning. Accordingly, it is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company reports these measures on a gold ounces sold basis. The Company's all-in sustaining and all-in cost definitions conform to the guidance note released by the World Gold Council, which became effective January 1, 2014. The World Gold Council is a non-regulatory market development organization for the gold industry whose members comprise global senior gold mining companies. Refer to page 36 for a reconciliation of all-in sustaining costs. Adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share are non-GAAP performance measures. The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, the Company and certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company's performance. Accordingly, it is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Refer to page 38 for a reconciliation of adjusted net earnings to reported net earnings attributable to shareholders of Goldcorp. Adjusted operating cash flows is a non-GAAP performance measure which comprises Goldcorp's share of operating cash flows before working capital changes and which the Company believes provides additional information about the Company's ability to generate cash flows from its mining operations. Accordingly, it is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Refer to page 39 for a reconciliation of adjusted operating cash flows before working capital changes to reported net cash provided by operating activities. Free cash flows is a non-GAAPperformance measure which the Company believes, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, the Company and certain investors use to evaluate the Company's ability to generate cashflows. Accordingly, it is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Free cash flows are calculated by deducting from net cash provided by operating activities, Goldcorp's share of expenditures on mining interests, deposits on mining interest expenditures and capitalized interest paid, and adding Goldcorp's share of net cash provided by operating activities from Alumbrera and Pueblo Viejo. Refer to page 39 for a reconciliation of free cash flows to reported net cash provided by operating activities. OVERVIEW Goldcorp is a leading gold producer engaged in the operation, exploration, development, and acquisition of precious metal properties in Canada, the United States, Mexico, and Central and South America. The Company's current sources of operating cash flows are primarily from the sale of gold, silver, copper, lead and zinc. Goldcorp is one of the world's fastest growing senior gold producers. Goldcorp's strategy is to provide its shareholders with superior returns from high quality assets. Goldcorp has a strong balance sheet. Its low-cost gold production is located in safe jurisdictions in the Americas and remains 100% unhedged. Goldcorp is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (symbol: GG) and the Toronto Stock Exchange (symbol: G). At March 31, 2015, the Company's principal producing mining properties were comprised of the Red Lake, Porcupine and Musselwhite gold mines in Canada; the Penasquito gold/silver/lead/zinc mine and the Los Filos gold mine in Mexico; the Marlin gold/silver mine in Guatemala; the Cerro Negro gold/silver mine, which declared commercial production effective January 1, 2015, and the Alumbrera gold/copper mine (37.5% interest) in Argentina; and the Pueblo Viejo gold/silver/copper mine in the Dominican Republic (40% interest). The Company also owns a 39.3% equity interest in Tahoe Resources Inc. (\"Tahoe\"), which owns and operates the Escobal silver mine in Guatemala. On April 1, 2015, Tahoe acquired Rio Alto Mining Limited resulting in a dilution of the Company's interest in Tahoe to 25.9%. The Company's significant development projects at March 31, 2015 were comprised of the Eleonore and Cochenour gold projects in Canada, with Eleonore declaring commercial production effective April 1, 2015; the El Morro gold/copper project (70% interest) in Chile; and the Camino Rojo gold/silver project in Mexico. On March 13, 2015, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of Probe Mines Ltd., which owns the Borden Gold Project in Canada. The Company realized an average gold price of $1,217 per ounce during the first quarter of 2014 compared to $1,203 per ounce during the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase in the realized average gold price was a result of a price surge early in 2015 resulting in the gold price increasing $126 per ounce in the span of three weeks to $1,298 per ounce. Key events precipitating this move included the European Central Bank's announcement of a quantitative easing program, the unexpected Swiss de-pegging of the Swiss Franc from the Euro and the uncertain outcome of the Greek election. Further, low sovereign bond yields amongst the United States, Japan and Germany helped to support the gold price. However, as the quarter progressed, a weak backdrop for oil prices and continued strong economic data from the United States weighed against the gold price. In particular, the U.S. Federal Reserve's ongoing analysis and dialogue concerning raising interest rates in the United States made for a challenging gold price environment. These negative factors helped push gold to a low of $1,143 per ounce in mid-March before rebounding to trade around $1,200 per ounce at the end of the first quarter of 2015. Gold production for the first quarter of 2015 was 724,800 ounces, a decrease of 166,100 ounces, or 19%, from the prior quarter. 2015 gold production is expected to be weighted to the second half of the year due primarily to the new mine ramp-ups and the planned mine sequence at Penasquito. Contributing to the decrease was 30% lower production at Cerro Negro due to restrictions on ore haulage from stockpiles to the plant and the processing of lower grade stockpile during the first quarter of 2015. Additionally, the Company's share of Pueblo Viejo's gold production decreased 27,900 ounces, or 24%, due to processing lower grade ore from stockpiles. Cold weather conditions, which impacted the Stockpile and Mill operations at Porcupine, resulted in gold production decreasing 34,400 ounces, or 38%, from the fourth quarter of 2014. Finally, lower tonnes milled at Red Lake due to Campbell Complex depletion, increased ground support in the Footwall Zone and paste fill infrastructure delays in Upper Red Lake resulted in production at Red Lake decreasing 18% from the prior quarter. Offsetting the lower production, Penasquito continued to maintain strong gold production, with 155,600 ounces produced during the first quarter of 2015, a 10% increase from prior quarter, due to higher sulphide grades being realized with substantial mining in the heart of the deposit in Phase 5C and the bottom of Phase 4. Following first gold on October 1, 2014, and the resolution of the process plant design issues identified in the fourth quarter of 2014 related to the tailings filter press and primary crusher apron feeder, Eleonore declared commercial production effective April 1, 2015. Eleonore contributed 32,500 pre-commissioning ounces during the first quarter of 2015, which are not reflected in consolidated gold sales, a 78% increase from the fourth quarter of 2014 as the mine continues to ramp-up. All-in sustaining costs of $885 per ounce for the first quarter of 2015 decreased 14% from $1,035 per ounce for the fourth quarter of 2014 due to the timing of capital expenditures, which are expected to increase through the remainder of 2015, and higher gold sales volumes resulting from Cerro Negro declaring commercial production. At Penasquito, a feasibility study on the Metallurgical Enhancement Project (\"MEP\") commenced in the first quarter of 2015, which is the combined study to assess the feasibility of the Concentrate Enrichment Project (\"CEP\") and Pyrite Leach Penasquito sulphide plant (\"Pyrite Leach\"). The study will assess the potential for producing saleable copper concentrate at Penasquito and the viability of leaching a pyrite concentrate from the zinc flotation tailings. The feasibility study is expected to be complete in early 2016. CORPORATE DEVELOPMENTS Sale of the South Arturo Mine Project: On April 6, 2015, the Company announced it had signed a binding letter of intent with Premier for the sale of its 40% interest in the South Arturo Mine Project (the \"Project\") in Nevada. The Project is a joint venture between the Company, a 40% owner, and Barrick, a 60% owner and the operator of the Project. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company will receive cash consideration of $20 million and a further 5% interest in the Rahill-Bonaza Joint Venture in Red Lake. Concurrent with the divestiture, the Company agreed to complete a private placement with Premier in the amount of C$12.5 million, subject to Toronto Stock Exchange approval. The closing of the agreement, which is subject to Barrick not exercising its right of first refusal in respect of the Project and completion of definitive documentation, is expected to occur by the end of May 2015. Acquisition of Probe: On March 13, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of Probe, through a friendly plan of arrangement. Probe's principal asset, the 100%- owned Borden Gold project in Ontario, with its location 160 kilometres west of the Company's Porcupine mine, will provide a new potential source of production for Porcupine thereby leveraging investments made in people, infrastructure and stakeholder partnerships. The highlyprospective Borden Gold project currently has reported underground constrained indicated resources of 1.6 million ounces of gold (9.3Mt @ 5.39g/t) and inferred resources of 0.4 million ounces of gold (3Mt @ 4.37g/t) at a 2.5g/t gold cut-off grade. The deposit remains open down plunge. The deposit is located within a large land package comprising 70 kilometres of contiguous claims in a geologic setting not previously thought to host gold deposits. Total consideration was C$434 million ($343 million) and consisted primary of the issuance of 13.3 million common shares to former Probe shareholders, excluding the 18.5 million Probe common shares, or 19.7% interest, held by the Company at March 13, 2015. The Company also issued 1.4 million stock options and 0.5 million warrants to former Probe option and warrant holders, respectively. Of the 18.5 million Probe common shares owned by the Company at March 13, 2015, 10.1 million were purchased from Agnico Eagle Mines Limited during the first quarter of 2015 for cash consideration of C$51 million ($40 million), including the exercise of 2.8 million warrants of Probe Sale of Wharf: On February 20, 2015, the Company completed the sale of of its 100% interest in Wharf in Lead, South Dakota to Coeur Mining, Inc. Total consideration received was $99 million in cash, after closing adjustments, resulting in a $49 million after tax gain on sale. The sale of Wharf aligns with the Company's commitment to focus on a portfolio of core assets.

Three Months Ended March 31, 2015 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2014 Net loss attributable to shareholders of Goldcorp for the first quarter of 2015 was $(87) million, or (0.11) per share, compared to net earnings attributable to shareholders of Goldcorp of $98 million, or $0.12 per share, for the first quarter of 2014. Compared to the first quarter of 2014, the net loss attributable to shareholders of Goldcorp for the three months ended March 31, 2015 was impacted by the following factors: Revenues increased by $139 million, or 16%, primarily due to a $155 million increase in gold revenues, partially offset by a $15 million decrease in lead and zinc revenues, net of refining charges. The increase in gold revenues was a result of higher gold sales volumes primarily due to Cerro Negro declaring commercial production effective January 1, 2015 resulting in all proceeds from sales being recognized as revenues, partially offset by lower gold realized prices. Lead and zinc revenues decreased due to lower lead and zinc sales volumes and lower lead realized prices. Silver sales volumes increased from the first quarter of 2014 primarily as a result of Cerro Negro's first quarter of commercial production however the increase was offset by a decrease in silver realized prices; Production costs increased by $133 million, or 27%, due to production costs associated with Cerro Negro's first quarter of commercial production; and revisions in estimates at the Company's inactive and closed mines during the first quarter of 2015 resulting in a $22 million increase in reclamation and closure costs; partially offset by the one-time historic water use payment at Penasquito in the first quarter of 2014; the impact of El Sauzal entering reclamation effective January 1, 2015; and favourable foreign exchange movements; Depreciation and depletion increased by $153 million, or 91%, due to Cerro Negro's first quarter of commercial production, a higher depletion rate at Marlin resulting from a reduction of proven and probable gold reserves, new assets put into service and higher sales volumes; The Company's share of net earnings of associates decreased by $21 million compared to the first quarter of 2014 primarily as a result of a $17 million decrease in the Company's share of net earnings from Alumbrera and a $3 million decrease in the Company's share of net earnings from Pueblo Viejo; Corporate administration, excluding share-based compensation expense, was $40 million, which was comparable to the first quarter of 2014. Share-based compensation expense was $15 million for the first quarter of 2015, a decrease of $9 million compared to the first quarter of 2014 primarily due to a decrease in value of the Company's performance share units; A $42 million loss on derivatives in the first quarter of 2015 comprised of a loss on foreign currency, heating oil, copper, lead, and zinc contracts. In the first quarter of 2014, a $3 million net loss on derivatives was comprised of a $1 million unrealized loss on the conversion feature of the $863 million convertible senior notes which were repaid upon maturity during the third quarter of 2014; a $1 million net loss on foreign currency, heating oil, copper, lead, and zinc contracts; and a $1 million net loss on the Company's contract to sell 1.5 million ounces of silver to Silver Wheaton at a fixed price over each of the four years ended August 5, 2014; An $18 million net gain on disposition of mining interests in the first quarter of 2014 as the Company sold its equity interest in Primero Mining Corp. on March 26, 2014; Finance costs increased by $11 million primarily due to interest expense on certain financing arrangements held by Cerro Negro that is no longer eligible for capitalization as a result of commercial production being achieved; Other income of $20 million for the first quarter of 2015 was impacted by a $15 million net foreign exchange gain driven by the weakening of the Canadian dollar, and Mexican and Argentine peso during the first quarter of 2015. The net gain was comprised of foreign exchange gains on accounts payable and debt denominated in Mexican and Argentine pesos, and Canadian dollars, partially offset by foreign exchange losses on value added tax receivables denominated in Mexican and Argentine pesos, and cash and cash equivalents denominated in Canadian dollars. Other expenses of $21 million for the first quarter of 2014 were primarily comprised of $19 million of foreign exchange losses on value added tax receivables denominated in Mexican and Argentine pesos; Income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2015 totaled $129 million (three months ended March 31, 2014 - income tax expense of $89 million) and was primarily impacted by: A $122 million foreign exchange loss on the translation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities arising primarily from the Placer Dome and Glamis acquisitions in 2006 and the Camino Rojo and Cerro Negro acquisitions in 2010, compared to a $106 million foreign exchange loss in the first quarter of 2014; A higher effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2015, after adjusting for non-deductible share based compensation expense and the deferred income tax impacts of the weakening Argentine and Mexican peso, and Canadian dollar. The first quarter of 2015 was impacted by lower income from associates not being subject to tax, the gain on sale of Primero in the first quarter of 2014 not being subject to tax, higher non-deductible payments in the first quarter of 2015 and lower tax deductible foreign exchange losses on US dollar denominated debt in Argentina; and Net earnings from discontinued operations of $52 million for the first quarter of 2015 was comprised of the $49 million net gain on the sale of Wharf and $3 million of net earnings of Wharf until February 20, 2015, the date of disposition. Net earnings from discontinued operations for the first quarter of 2014 of $9 million was comprised of $5 million of net earnings of Wharf and $4 million of net earnings from the Company's 66.7% share of Marigold, which was sold in April 4, 2014. Adjusted net earnings amounted to $12 million, or $0.01 per share, for the three months ended March 31, 2015, compared to $209 million, or $0.26 per share, for the first quarter of 2014. Compared to the first quarter of 2014, adjusted net earnings was impacted by higher production costs, higher depreciation and depletion, lower gold and silver realized prices, and a higher effective tax rate, partially offset by higher gold and silver sales volumes as a result of Cerro Negro achieving commercial production effective January 1, 2015. Total cash costs (by-product) increased to $585 per gold ounce, in the first quarter of 2015, as compared to $507 per gold ounce in the first quarter of 2014. The higher cash costs was primarily due to higher production costs and lower by-product copper sales credits, partially offset by higher gold sales volumes. Adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share are non-GAAP performance measures. The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, the Company and certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company's performance. Accordingly, it is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Refer to page 38 for a reconciliation of adjusted net earnings to reported net earnings (loss) attributable to shareholders of Goldcorp. The Company has included non-GAAP performance measures - total cash costs, by-product and co-product, per gold ounce, throughout this document. In the gold mining industry, total cash costs is a common performance measure but does not have any standardized meaning. The Company follows the recommendations of the Gold Institute Production Cost Standard. The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, the Company and certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company's performance and ability to generate cash flow. Accordingly, it is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Total cash costs on a by-product basis are calculated by deducting Goldcorp's share of by-product silver, copper, lead and zinc sales revenues from Goldcorp's share of production costs. Refer to page 35 for a reconciliation of total cash costs to reported production costs. REVIEW OF QUARTERLY FINANCIAL RESULTS - Three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2014 Net loss attributable to shareholders of Goldcorp for the first quarter of 2015 was $(87) million, or $(0.11) per share, compared to a net loss attributable to shareholders of Goldcorp of $(2,396) million, or $(2.94) per share, for the fourth quarter of 2014. Compared to the prior quarter, the net loss attributable to shareholders of Goldcorp for the three months ended March 31, 2015 was impacted by the following factors: Revenues increased by $182 million, or 22%, primarily due to a $136 million increase in gold revenues and a $46 million increase in silver revenues. The increase in revenues resulted primarily from higher gold and silver sales volumes due to Cerro Negro achieving commercial production effective January 1, 2015, and higher realized prices for gold and silver as compared to the fourth quarter of 2014; Production costs increased by $38 million, or 7%, primarily due to production costs associated with Cerro Negro's first quarter of commercial production; partially offset by revisions in estimates at the Company's inactive and closed mines resulting in a $56 million increase in reclamation and closure costs during the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to a $22 million increase in the first quarter of 2015; a $31 million reduction of the carrying value of the heap leach ore inventory at Los Filos to net realizable value recognized during the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to a $5 million reduction of the carrying value during the first quarter of 2015; and favourable foreign exchange movements; Depreciation and depletion increased by $107 million, or 50%, primarily due to depreciation and depletion associated with Cerro Negro's first quarter of commercial production and higher depletion rates at certain mines as a result of a reduction in proven and probable reserves at December 31, 2014; The Company's share of net earnings of associates increased by $10 million from the prior quarter due to a $23 million increase in the Company's share of net earnings of Pueblo Viejo and an $8 million increase in the Company's share of net earnings of Tahoe, partially offset by a $21 million decrease in the Company's share of net earnings of Alumbrera; An impairment of mining interests and goodwill of $2,980 million ($2,300 million, net of tax) was recognized against the carrying amount of the Cerro Negro project in the fourth quarter of 2014. Corporate administration, excluding share-based compensation expense, was $40 million, a $6 million decrease compared to the prior quarter, primarily due to lower consulting costs. Share-based compensation expense of $15 million for the first quarter of 2015 increased by $2 million compared to the prior quarter due to an increase in the fair value of the Company's performance share units; A $42 million loss on derivatives for the first quarter of 2015 comprised of a loss on foreign currency, heating oil, copper, lead, and zinc contracts, compared to a $34 million loss on foreign currency, heating oil, copper, lead, and zinc contracts in the fourth quarter of 2014; Finance costs increased by $19 million primarily due to interest expense on certain financing arrangements held by Cerro Negro that are no longer eligible for capitalization as a result of commercial production being achieved; Other income increased by $26 million primarily as a result of an increase in net foreign exchange gains comprised of foreign exchange gains on accounts payable and debt denominated in Mexican and Argentine pesos, and Canadian dollars, partially offset by foreign exchange losses on value added tax receivables denominated in Mexican and Argentine pesos, and cash and cash equivalents denominated in Canadian dollars. The net foreign foreign exchange gain is a result of the weakening of the Canadian dollar and Mexican and Argentine peso during the first quarter of 2015. Income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2015 totaled $129 million (three months ended December 31, 2014 - income tax recovery of $625 million) and was impacted by: A $122 million foreign exchange loss on the translation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities primarily from the Placer Dome and Glamis acquisitions in 2006 and the Camino Rojo and Cerro Negro acquisitions in 2010, compared to a $105 million foreign exchange loss for the fourth quarter of 2014. The foreign exchange related deferred tax impacts reflect the weakening Canadian dollar and Argentine and Mexican peso during the three months ended March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014; During the fourth quarter of 2014 a deferred income tax recovery of $680 million arising on the impairment of mining interests and goodwill; After adjusting for the above noted items, the non-deductible share-based compensation expense and the impairment of mining interests and goodwill, a lower effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2015. There was a net loss before tax in the fourth quarter of 2014 after adjusting for the share-based compensation expense and impairment, therefore tax impacts that normally decrease the effective rate, increased the effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2014. The first quarter of 2015 was negatively impacted by a lower tax benefit of inflationary adjustments in Mexico, higher non-deductible payments,and lower deductible foreign exchange losses on US dollar denominated debt in Argentina, partially offset by higher earnings from associates not subject to income tax; and Net earnings from discontinued operations of $52 million for the first quarter of 2015 was comprised of the $49 million net gain on the sale of Wharf and $3 million of net earnings of Wharf until February 20, 2015, the date of disposition. Net earnings of Wharf of $7 million were recognized in the fourth quarter of 2014. Adjusted net earnings amounted to $12 million, or $0.01 per share, for the three months ended March 31, 2015, compared to $55 million, or $0.07 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2014. Compared to the prior quarter, adjusted net earnings was impacted higher depreciation and depletion and a higher effective tax rate, partially offset by higher sales volumes and realized prices for gold and silver. Total cash costs (by-product) were $585 per gold ounce, in the first quarter of 2015, as compared to $589 per gold ounce in the prior quarter. The decrease in cash costs per ounce was primarily due to higher gold sales volumes and higher by-product silver sales credits, partially offset by higher production costs and lower by-product copper sales credits. Adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share are non-GAAP performance measures. The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, the Company and certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company's performance. Accordingly, it is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Refer to page 38 for a reconciliation of adjusted net earnings to reported net loss attributable to shareholders of Goldcorp. The Company has included non-GAAP performance measures - total cash costs, by-product and co-product, per gold ounce, throughout this document. In the gold mining industry, total cash costs is a common performance measure but does not have any standardized meaning. The Company follows the recommendations of the Gold Institute Production Cost Standard. The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, the Company and certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company's performance and ability to generate cash flow. Accordingly, it is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Total cash costs on a by-product basis are calculated by deducting Goldcorp's share of by-product silver, copper, lead and zinc sales revenues from Goldcorp's share of production costs. Refer to page 35 for a reconciliation of total cash costs to reported production costs. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Three months ended March 31 The Company has included certain non-GAAP performance measures including the Company's share of the applicable production, sales and financial information of Alumbrera and Pueblo Viejo, throughout this document; however, these performance measures do not have any standardized meaning. The Company believes that disclosing certain performance measures including Alumbrera and Pueblo Viejo presents a more relevant measurement of the Company's operating and economic performance, and reflects the Company's view of its core mining operations. Total cash costs per gold ounce on a by-product basis is calculated net of Goldcorp's share of by-product sales revenues (by-product copper sales revenues for Alumbrera; by-product silver sales revenues for Marlin, Cerro Negro and Pueblo Viejo; and by-product lead and zinc sales revenues and 75% of silver sales revenues for Penasquito at market silver prices, and 25% of silver sales revenues for Penasquito at $4.07 per silver ounce (2014 - $4.04 per silver ounce) sold to Silver Wheaton). For the purpose of calculating all-in sustaining costs, the Company includes corporate administration expense, capital expenditures incurred at the Company's regional and head office corporate offices and regional office exploration expense as corporate all-in sustaining costs in the \"Other\" category. These costs are not allocated to the individual mine sites as the Company measures its operations' performance on all-in sustaining costs directly incurred at the mine site. An all-in sustaining cost for other is calculated using total corporate expenditures and the Company's consolidated gold sales ounces. Wharf is classified as a discontinued operation for the three months ended March 31, 2015. The 2014 and 2013 comparative information has been re-presented in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 5 - Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations. In addition, the Company's 66.7% interest in Marigold, the sale of which was completed on April 4, 2014, was classified as a discontinued operation for the three months ended March 31, 2014. Gold produced represents pre-commercial production ounces from Eleonore. However, sales and sales related revenues are excluded as they are credited against capitalized project costs. El Sauzal entered reclamation effective January 1, 2015. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES The Company has included certain non-GAAP performance measures throughout this document. These performance measures are employed by the Company to measure its operating and economic performance internally and to assist in business decision-making as well as providing key performance information to senior management. The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, certain investors and other stakeholders also use this information to evaluate the Company's operating and economic performance; however, these non-GAAP performance measures do not have any standardized meaning. Accordingly, these performance measures are intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company's primary business is gold production and its future development and current operations focus are on maximizing returns from gold production, with other metal production being incidental to the gold production process. As a result, the Company's non-GAAP performance measures are disclosed on a per gold ounce basis. The Company calculates its non-GAAP performance measures on an attributable basis. Attributable performance measures include the Company's mining operations and projects, and the Company's share of Alumbrera and Pueblo Viejo. The Company believes that disclosing certain performance measures on an attributable basis is a more relevant measurement of the Company's operating and economic performance, and reflects the Company's view of its core mining operations. TOTAL CASH COSTS (BY-PRODUCT) PER GOLD OUNCE By-product cash costs incorporate Goldcorp's share of all production costs, adjusted for changes in estimates in reclamation and closure costs at the Company's closed mines which are non-cash in nature, and include Goldcorp's share of by-product credits, and treatment and refining charges included within revenue. Additionally, cash costs are adjusted for realized gains and a loss arising on the Company's commodity and foreign currency contracts which the Company enters into to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in by-product metal prices, heating oil prices and foreign exchange rates, which may impact the Company's operating costs. In addition to conventional measures, the Company assesses this per ounce measure in a manner that isolates the impacts of gold production volumes, the by-product credits, and operating costs fluctuations such that the non-controllable and controllable variability is independently addressed. The Company uses total cash costs, by product and co-product, per gold ounce, to monitor its operating performance internally, including operating cash costs, as well as in its assessment of potential development projects and acquisition targets. The Company believes these measures provide investors and analysts with useful information about the Company's underlying cash costs of operations and the impact of by-product credits on the Company's cost structure and is a relevant metric used to understand the Company's operating profitability and ability to generate cash flow. When deriving the production costs associated with an ounce of gold, the Company includes by-product credits as the Company considers that the cost to produce the gold is reduced as a result of the by-product sales incidental to the gold production process, thereby allowing the Company's management and other stakeholders to assess the net costs of gold production. The Company reports total cash costs on gold ounces sold basis. In the gold mining industry, this is a common performance measure but does not have any standardized meaning. The Company follows the recommendations of the Gold Institute Production Cost Standard. The Gold Institute, which ceased operations in 2002, was a non-regulatory body and represented a global group of suppliers of gold and gold products. The production cost standard developed by the Gold Institute remains the generally accepted standard of reporting cash costs of production by gold mining companies. NON-GAAP MEASURE - ALL-IN SUSTAINING COSTS PER GOLD OUNCE All-in sustaining costs include total production cash costs incurred at the Company's mining operations, which forms the basis of the Company's by-product cash costs. Additionally, the Company includes sustaining capital expenditures, corporate administrative expense, exploration and evaluation costs, and reclamation cost accretion and amortization. The measure seeks to reflect the full cost of gold production from current operations; therefore new project capital is not included. Certain other cash expenditures, including tax payments, dividends and financing costs are also not included. The Company believes that this measure represents the total costs of producing gold from current operations, and provides the Company and other stakeholders of the Company with additional information of the Company's operational performance and ability to generate cash flows. An all-in sustaining cost, as a key performance measure, allows the Company to assess its ability to support capital expenditures to sustain future production from the generation of operating cash flows. This information provides management with the ability to more actively manage capital programs and to make more prudent capital investment decisions. The Company reports all-in sustaining costs on a gold ounces sold basis. This performance measure was adopted as a result of an initiative undertaken within the gold mining industry; however, this performance measure has no standardized meaning and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company follows the guidance note released by the World Gold Council, which became effective January 1, 2014. The World Gold Council is a non-regulatory market development organization for the gold industry whose members comprise global senior gold mining companies. NON-GAAP MEASURE - ADJUSTED NET EARNINGS Adjusted net earnings excludes gains/losses and other costs incurred for acquisitions and disposals of mining interests, impairment charges, unrealized and non-cash realized gains/losses on financial instruments, foreign exchange impacts on deferred income tax and foreign exchange arising on working capital at certain of the Company's capital projects, as well as significant non-cash, non-recurring items. The Company also excludes the net earnings (losses) from the Company's equity investments in Primero and Tahoe. The Company excludes these items from net loss to provide a measure which allows the Company and investors to evaluate the operating results of the underlying core operations of the Company and its ability to generate liquidity through operating cash flow to fund working capital requirements, future capital expenditures and service outstanding debt. The Company's adjusted net earnings does include the Company's equity share of net earnings from Alumbrera and Pueblo Viejo as the Company considers these operations to comprise part of the Company's core mining portfolio and to be significant contributors to the Company's financial results. ADJUSTED OPERATING CASH FLOWS AND FREE CASH FLOWS Adjusted operating cash flows comprises Goldcorp's share of operating cash flows before working capital changes. Free cash flows comprises Goldcorp's share of net cash provided by operating activities and includes the Company's share of expenditures on mining interests and deposits on mining interests expenditures. The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, the Company and certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company's performance and ability to operate without reliance on additional external funding or use of available cash. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS RISK EXPOSURE The Company manages its exposure to financial risks, including credit risk, liquidity risk, currency risk, interest rate risk and price risk in accordance with its Finance Risk Management Policy. The Company's exposure to financial risks and how the Company manages each of those risks are described in note 25(e) to the Company's consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014. There were no significant changes to those risks or to the Company's management of exposure to those risks during the three months ended March 31, 2015, except as noted below: (i) Liquidity risk During the three months ended March 31, 2015, the Company generated operating cash flows from continuing operations of $51 million (2014 - $263 million). At March 31, 2015, Goldcorp held cash and cash equivalents and money market investments of $365 million and $55 million, respectively (December 31, 2014 - $482 million and $53 million, respectively) and had working capital of $831 million (December 31, 2014 - $691 million million, $26 million of which represents the Company's net assets held for sale), which the Company defines as current assets less current liabilities. Before non-cash working capital changes, operating cash flows from continuing operations amounted to $271 million (2014 - $221 million). During the three months ended March 31, 2015, the Company drew down an additional $300 million from the $2.0 billion credit facility. At March 31, 2015, the undrawn balance of the credit facility was $860 million (December 31, 2014 - $1.2 billion). At March 31, 2015, the Company had letters of credit outstanding, including amounts relating to discontinued operations, surety bonds and secured deposits in the amount of $432 million (December 31, 2014 - $460 million). The Company's capital commitments for the next twelve months amounted to $101 million at March 31, 2015. (ii) Market risk Currency risk During the three months ended March 31, 2015, the Company recognized a net foreign exchange gain of $15 million (2014 - loss of $19 million). Based on the Company's net exposures (other than those relating to taxes) at March 31, 2015, a 10% depreciation or appreciation of applicable foreign currencies against the US dollar would have resulted in an approximate $30 million increase or decrease in the Company's after-tax net loss, respectively. During the three months ended March 31, 2015, the Company recognized a net foreign exchange loss of $131 million in income tax expense on income taxes receivable/(payable) and deferred taxes (2014 - $105 million). Based on the Company's net exposures relating to taxes at March 31, 2015, a 10% depreciation or appreciation of applicable foreign currencies against the US dollar would have resulted in an approximate $251 million decrease or increase in the Company's after-tax net loss, respectively. OUTSTANDING SHARE DATA As of April 29, 2015, there were 830 million common shares of the Company issued and outstanding and 19 million stock options outstanding which are exchangeable into common shares at exercise prices ranging between C$5.40 per share to C$48.72 per share. OTHER RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES The Company's process to manage its risks and other uncertainties, including the risks related to the Company's foreign operations, government, environmental, and other regulations, and operating costs is continuous and dynamic. Changes to these risks that result from changing internal and external factors are evaluated on a quarterly basis and significant changes in risks and corresponding mitigation activities are reported quarterly to the Company's Board of Directors. Detailed discussion of the Company's risk management process can be found on pages 68 to 69 of our 2014 Annual Report. Changes in mining or investment policies or shifts in political attitude in Canada, Mexico, Guatemala, Argentina, the Dominican Republic, Chile, and the United States continues to be a key business risk which may adversely affect the Company's operations or profitability. Operations may be affected in varying degrees by government regulations with respect to, but not limited to, restrictions on production, price controls, export controls, currency remittance, income taxes, expropriation of property, foreign investment, maintenance of claims, environmental legislation, land use, land claims of local people, water use, and mine safety. Failure to comply strictly with applicable laws, regulations and local practices relating to mineral right applications and tenure, environmental requirements, land and water use, could result in loss, reduction or expropriation of entitlements, or the imposition of additional local or foreign parties as joint venture partners with carried or other interests, fines and penalties. The occurrence of these various factors and uncertainties cannot be accurately predicted and could have a material adverse effect on the Company's operations or profitability. In addition to internal controls, systems and processes, the Company mitigates these risks by building positive, sustainable relationships with local communities, vendors, and local, regional, and federal governments, maintaining ongoing and transparent communication with stakeholders, a commitment to sustainability, and best practices in corporate governance. BASIS OF PREPARATION The Company's unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 - Interim Financial Reporting as issued by the IASB. Accordingly, certain disclosures included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB have been condensed or omitted. The Company's unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014. The accounting policies applied in the preparation of the Company's unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements are consistent with those applied and disclosed in notes 3 and 4 to the Company's audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014. CRITICAL JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES The Company's management makes judgements in its process of applying the Company's accounting policies in the preparation of its unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements. In addition, the preparation of the financial data requires that the Company's management make assumptions and estimates of the impacts from uncertain future events on the carrying amounts of the Company's assets and liabilities at the end of the reporting period, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates as the estimation process is inherently uncertain. Estimates are reviewed on an ongoing basis based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant under the circumstances. Revisions to estimates and the resulting impacts on the carrying amounts of the Company's assets and liabilities are accounted for prospectively. The critical judgements and estimates applied in the preparation of the Company's unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2015 are consistent with those applied and disclosed in notes 6 and 7 to the Company's audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31 2014 and the following critical judgment in applying accounting policies: Business combinations Determination of whether a set of assets acquired and liabilities assumed constitute the acquisition of a business or asset may require the Company to make certain judgements as to whether or not the assets acquired and liabilities assumed include the inputs, processes and outputs necessary to constitute a business as defined in IFRS 3 - Business Combination. If an acquired set of of assets and liabilities includes goodwill, the set is presumed to be a business. Based on an assessment of the relevant facts and circumstances, the Company concluded that the acquisition of Probe Mines Ltd. on March 13, 2015 did not meet the criteria of a business combination and has been accounted for as an acquisition of an asset. OUTLOOK UPDATE For 2015, the Company expects to produce between 3.3 and 3.6 million ounces of gold. All-in sustaining costs are estimated to be between $875 and $950 per ounce, driven primarily by new contributions from Cerro Negro and Eleonore. Gold production is expected to increase over the course of 2015 as mining continues into the higher-grade portions of the Penasco pit at Penasquito and as both Cerro Negro and Eleonore ramp-up through the year. Assumptions used to forecast total cash costs for 2015 include: $18.00 per ounce of silver; $3.00 per pound of copper; $1.00 per pound of zinc; $0.95 per pound of lead; and the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso at 1.14 and 14.00, respectively, to the US dollar. Capital expenditures for 2015 are forecasted to decrease approximately 40% from 2014, to between $1.2 and $1.4 billion. Significant capital expenditures in 2015 include approximately $235 million at Cerro Negro, $215 million at Penasquito, $115 million at Eleonore and $95 million at Cochenour. Exploration expenditures in 2015 are expected to amount to approximately $170 million, of which approximately one third is expected to be expensed with the focus remaining on the replacement of reserves mined during 2015 and on extending existing gold zones at each of its mines and projects. Corporate administration expense, excluding share-based compensation, is forecast at $185 million for 2015. Depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense (\"DDA\") is expected to be approximately $390 per gold ounce sold for the year with DDA per ounce expected to be higher in the first quarter of 2015 at $444 per ounce but declining over the remainder of the year. Excluding the impacts of foreign exchange on deferred tax assets and liabilities, the Company now expects an annual effective rate of 45%, with an expected 39% effective tax rate for each of the second, third and fourth quarters. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company's management, with the participation of its President and Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon the results of that evaluation, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports it files is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the appropriate time periods and is accumulated and communicated to management, including the President and Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The Company's management, with the participation of its President and Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Under the supervision of the President and Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, the Company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with IFRS. The Company's internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that: pertain to the maintenance of records that accurately and fairly reflect, in reasonable detail, the transactions and dispositions of assets of the Company; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS and that the Company's receipts and expenditures are made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the Company's Directors; and Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. There has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended March 31, 2015 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Limitations of Controls and Procedures The Company's management, including the President and Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, believes that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, they cannot provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been prevented or detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by unauthorized override of the control. The design of any control system also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING RESERVES AND RESOURCES Hudbay Minerals Inc. (HBM: TSX) Hudbay Releases First Quarter 2015 Results and Declares Commercial Production at Constancia Mine Toronto, Ontario, May 7, 2015 - HudBay Minerals Inc. (\"Hudbay\" or the \"company\") (TSX, NYSE:HBM) today released its first quarter 2015 financial results and announced that its 100%-owned Constancia mine in Peru achieved commercial production on April 30, 2015. Ocean shipments of copper concentrate from Constancia began in April 2015, and the mine and concentrator are currently operating at or above design capacity. \"Reaching commercial production on schedule at the Constancia mine is a major milestone for Hudbay,\" said David Garofalo, president and chief executive officer. \"This achievement strengthens our position as a low cost, high quality copper and zinc producer. Constancia has allowed us to broaden our skills as a mine developer, and given its ongoing ramp up, we continue to expect to meet our corporate production and cost guidance for 2015.\" In the first quarter of 2015, operating cash flow before stream deposit and change in non-cash working capital increased to $24.1 million from negative $4.6 million in the first quarter of 2014. The net loss and loss per share in the first quarter of 2015 were $23.7 million and $0.10, respectively, compared to a net loss and loss per share of $27.2 million and $0.15, respectively, in the first quarter of 2014. Net loss and loss per share in the first quarter of 2015 were affected by, among other things, the following items: Financial and Operating Results Cash flow from operations and net earnings were positively impacted by increased revenue as a result of significant increases in production of all metals as the Reed and Lalor mines achieved commercial production in 2014. While substantially improved when compared to the prior year, cash flow from operations, net earnings and cash costs per pound of copper were all negatively impacted by unsold copper and gold during the quarter. More specifically, Hudbay continues to have approximately 6,000 tonnes of unsold copper in concentrate as a result of logistical and other issues, as well as approximately 9,000 ounces of unstreamed gold produced in the first quarter of 2015 that was not sold. Net earnings were also negatively affected by higher depreciation expense resulting from commercial production at Reed and Lalor, as well as higher depreciation expense due to revised mine planning assumptions at 777. Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $84.7 million from December 31, 2014 to $122.5 million as at March 31, 2015. This decrease was mainly a result of $164.7 million of investments primarily at the Constancia project, interest payments of $55.6 million, and deposits of restricted cash in Peru of $27.7 million. At March 31, 2015, Hudbay had total available and committed liquidity of approximately $464 million, including $122.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and availability under Hudbay's credit facilities. In the second quarter, Hudbay expects to commence realizing substantial cash flow from the sale of copper concentrates from Constancia, and to receive value added tax refunds from the Peruvian government of approximately US$38 million. Hudbay expects that its current liquidity and these expected cash flows will be sufficient to meet its liquidity needs for 2015. Peru Operations Review The Constancia mine commenced production of copper concentrate in December 2014, and achieved commercial production on April 30, 2015. Ocean shipments began in April 2015, and the mine and concentrator are currently operating at or above design capacity. The ramp up has met management's expectations with regards to throughput, recovery and product quality. The plant is performing as designed and throughput has occasionally exceeded design capacity due to favourable ore characteristics, with peaks of over 90,000 tonnes per day. Copper recovery in April averaged just over 65% which is in line with ramp up design and expectations. Concentrate grade has averaged 27% copper year-to-date with average concentrations of deleterious elements below penalty levels. As at April 30, 2015, 42,575 tonnes of copper concentrate had been produced, of which approximately 20,500 tonnes had been shipped. The focus in the initial stages of ramp up was on ore throughput with an aim to meet saleable concentrate specifications. The focus is currently on increasing copper recovery while maintaining throughput and concentrate quality. A key component of improving copper recovery is expected to be the recently started concentrate regrinds circuit. Hudbay continues to expect the operation to achieve steady state design and feasibility level recoveries of copper in the fourth quarter of 2015. In addition, assuming that the copper ramp up continues as planned, the company intends, in the second quarter of 2015, to begin to ramp up the molybdenum concentrate separation circuit, which has achieved mechanical completion. Mining fleet performance is approaching design expectations; a mine dispatch system has been installed and is providing the necessary data to further optimize the fleet. To date, mine reconciliations have indicated that the long term model is supported by field measurements. Although it is too early to evaluate mine reconciliation metrics, management is confident that grade and geology characteristics are well represented in the long term plan. Sustaining capital expenditures are ongoing as planned; the tailings management facility, and the water harvesting and management are in scope and on schedule. Hudbay has received approval of a second modification to the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (\"ESIA\") for Constancia. The ESIA modification recognizes the current infrastructure and incorporates the mining of the Pampacancha deposit. Hudbay expects to begin negotiations for the purchase of surface rights to the Pampacancha deposit later this year. Manitoba Operations Review For the first quarter of 2015, ore processed at Hudbay's Manitoba business unit was 14% higher compared to the same period in 2014 primarily as a result of increased production at Reed and Lalor. Compared to the first quarter of 2014, copper grades were 18% higher as a result of increased production at Reed, which had higher copper head grades, as well as normal mine sequencing at the company's other mines. Processed zinc and gold head grades in the first quarter of 2015 were relatively consistent with the same period in 2014. Recoveries of copper, zinc and gold in the first quarter of 2015 were marginally higher compared to the same period of 2014 as a result of achieving steady operations at the company's two new mines. Combined Manitoba mine/mill unit operating costs were essentially unchanged from last year. On May 4, 2015, Hudbay closed a transaction to acquire a 100% interest in the New Britannia mine and mill, located in Snow Lake, Manitoba, for approximately US$11 million in net cash consideration, plus a contingent payment of US$5 million. The New Britannia mill (the \"NBM mill\") is currently on care and maintenance. If refurbished, it has the potential to process approximately 2,000 tonnes per day of gold zone ore from the Lalor mine, and includes an existing Carbon-in-Pulp circuit that has historically produced gold dore on site. It is expected that a paste backfill plant for Lalor will be required in addition to the refurbishment of the NBM mill. Ore from Lalor will continue to be processed at the Snow Lake concentrator, while engineering work is carried out on a potential restart of the NBM mill. It is anticipated that the results of a technical study on the NBM mill, including the estimated costs and timing of a potential restart, will be available in 2016. As a result of the acquisition of the NBM mill, Hudbay no longer expects to construct a new concentrator at Lalor. The collective agreements with each of the seven labour unions representing employees at the Manitoba business unit expired on December 31, 2014. The membership of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, Local No. 1848 (the \"IAM\") rejected a formal offer and commenced a strike action on May 2, 2015. Hudbay anticipates that operations will continue under a comprehensive contingency plan during the IAM's strike. Negotiations with the other six unions are ongoing Lalor Copper-Gold Zone Exploration Results At Hudbay's Lalor mine, the company has drilled 14 holes, totalling 4,537.6 metres, to better define the copper-gold zone from the underground 1,025 metre level exploration drift. Preliminary results to date, as shown in the tables below1 , indicate that the high-grade copper-gold mineralization as drilled from underground is of similar quantity and quality as indicated by surface drilling. Based on these preliminary results, Hudbay will proceed with a 400 metre Phase 2 exploration ramp extension to the north. Drill platforms from the Phase 2 exploration ramp will allow testing of the copper-gold zones down plunge, and step out drilling to the east and west. Further exploration drilling is expected to proceed on completion of the exploration ramp extension in the second half of 2015. Phase 2 development will maintain a drift size capable of accommodating future mine equipment and related infrastructure for mining the copper-gold zones. Non-IFRS Financial Performance Measures Operating cash flow per share and cash cost per pound of copper sold are included in this news release because the company believes that, in the case of operating cash flow per share, it helps investors and management to evaluate changes in cash flow while taking into account changes in shares outstanding, and in the case of cash cost per pound of copper sold, it helps investors assess the performance of the company's operations. These measures do not have a meaning prescribed by IFRS and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with IFRS and are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under IFRS. Other companies may calculate these measures differently. Cash Cost Per Pound of Copper Sold Cash cost per pound of copper sold is a non-IFRS measure that management uses as a key performance indicator to assess the performance of the company's operations. Hudbay's calculation designates copper as its primary metal of production as it has been, and is expected to be, the largest component of revenues. The calculation is presented in two manners: Cash cost per pound of copper sold, before by-product credits - This measure is gross of by-product revenues and is a function of the efforts and costs incurred to mine and process all ore mined. However, the measure divides this aggregate cost over only pounds of copper sold, Hudbay's primary metal of production. This measure is generally less volatile from period to period, as it is not affected by changes in the price received for by-product metals. It is, however, significantly affected by the relative mix of metal sales, and an increase in production of a by-product metal will tend to result in an increase in cash costs under this measure, regardless of the profitability of the increased by-product metal production. Cash cost per pound of copper sold, net of by-product credits - In order to calculate the cost to produce and sell copper, the net of by-product credits measure subtracts the revenues realized from the sale of the metals other than copper. The by-product revenues from zinc, gold and silver are significant and are integral to the economics of Hudbay. The economics that support Hudbay's decision to produce and sell copper would be different if the company did not receive revenues from the other significant metals being extracted and processed. This measure provides management and investors with an indication of the minimum copper price consistent with positive operating cash flows and operating margins, assuming by-product metal prices are consistent with those prevailing during the reporting period. It also serves as an important operating statistic that management and investors utilize to measure Hudbay's operating performance versus that of its competitors. However, it is important to understand that if by-product metal prices decline alongside copper prices, the cash cost net of by-product credits would increase, requiring a higher copper price than that reported to maintain positive cash flows and operating margins.

Lundin Mining Corporation (LUN: TSX) Lundin Mining First Quarter Results TORONTO, ONTARIO--(Marketwired - April 29, 2015) - Lundin Mining Corporation (\"Lundin Mining\" or the \"Company\") (TSX:LUN)(OMX:LUMI) today reported net earnings of $83.3 million or net earnings attributable to Lundin shareholders (after deducting non-controlling interests) of $71.8 million ($0.10 per share) for the quarter ended March 31, 2015. Cash flows of $224.0 million were generated from operations in the quarter, not including the Company's attributable cash flows from Tenke Fungurume. Earnings for the three month period included a full quarter of operating and financial results from Candelaria, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2014 and Eagle, which was commissioned in the same period. Candelaria and Eagle generated operating earnings of $163.7 million and $56.1 million, respectively, in the current quarter. Paul Conibear, President and CEO commented, \"Our focus on delivering operational and cost efficiencies has resulted in very strong quarterly performance across the Company, and marks an excellent start to the year. During the first quarter, we achieved record copper and nickel production as well as record levels of operating cash flow, which reflects the positive contributions now being attained from our recent acquisitions.\" \"Eagle performed at or above full design capacities for the entire quarter. Our focus now remains on the efficient transition of Candelaria into Lundin Mining and optimization of its production profile and continuing to deliver robust production, cash flow and earnings from our other operations to further contribute to our healthy balance sheet.\" Highlights Operational Performance For the first quarter of 2015, all of the Company's operations performed well, substantially meeting and in a number of cases performing better than guidance for production and cash costs. Candelaria (80%): The Candelaria operations produced, on a 100% basis, 49,350 tonnes of copper, 583,000 ounces of silver, and 27,600 ounces of gold in concentrate, better than expectations as a result of higher throughputs and good metallurgical recoveries. Copper cash costs(1) of $1.20/lb for the quarter were particularly low due to lower diesel prices, mine and mill costs and favourable foreign exchange rates. On March 24, 2015, abnormally heavy rainfall and flooding occurred in the Atacama Region, affecting power and access to the mine. There was a temporary suspension of mining and milling activities at the mine following the heavy rainfall, but no significant impact to the overall operations. There were no injuries to personnel nor significant damage at the mine site, but the surrounding communities were seriously affected by the floods. The Company has spent over $5 million to-date on relief efforts to help the communities and is expecting to continue to contribute to local relief and regional rebuilding efforts in a multi-year phased program of community investment. Eagle (100%): Eagle's operations continued to perform better than expected. Production of both nickel (7,306 tonnes) and copper (6,418 tonnes) exceeded expectations for the quarter with higher than expected throughput, grades and recoveries. Nickel cash costs of $1.45/lb were lower than full year guidance of $2.00/lb due to the strong production performance as well as lower ocean freight charges and targeted cost savings in response to nickel market conditions. Neves-Corvo (100%): Neves-Corvo had an outstanding first quarter producing 15,488 tonnes of copper and 17,340 tonnes of zinc. Zinc and copper production exceeded the prior year comparable period by 21% and 22%, respectively. Higher head grades and recently implemented bulk mining in selective stockworks stopes contributed to the increase in copper production, while additional production from the Lombador orebody resulted in the increased zinc production. Copper cash costs of $1.39/lb for the quarter were lower than full year guidance ($1.80/lb) due to lower per unit mine costs and favourable foreign exchange rates. Zinkgruvan (100%): Zinc and lead production at Zinkgruvan of 18,417 tonnes and 7,399 tonnes, respectively, largely met expectations but fell short of the comparable period in 2014 due to lower head grades. Cash costs for zinc of $0.42/lb were slightly higher than guidance ($0.38/lb) as higher per unit mine costs and lower by-product credit prices (lead and copper) were only partially offset by favourable foreign exchange rates. Aguablanca (100%): Aguablanca had yet another strong quarter of operational performance with both nickel and copper production setting quarterly records as mining of the open pit neared completion and underground development continued. Current quarter production of 2,746 tonnes of nickel and 2,122 tonnes of copper exceeded both expectations and the prior year comparable period. Cash costs of $0.91/lb of nickel for the quarter were significantly below expectations and the prior year comparable period as mining of the open pit was extended much later into the first quarter than originally planned, and the operations benefited from favourable foreign exchange rates and lower maintenance costs. Tenke (24%): Tenke operations continue to perform well. Lundin's attributable share of first quarter production included 12,648 tonnes of copper cathode and 797 tonnes of cobalt in hydroxide. The Company's attributable share of sales included 14,475 tonnes of copper at an average realized price of $2.66/lb and 901 tonnes of cobalt at an average realized price of $8.72/lb. Attributable operating cash flow from Tenke for the first quarter of 2015 was $41.1 million. Tenke operating cash costs for the first quarter of 2015 were $1.26/lb of copper sold, in-line with full year guidance. Cash distributions received by Lundin Mining in the quarter were $8.3 million, in-line with expectations. An additional $2.1 million was received from the Freeport Cobalt operations for total Tenke related cash distributions to the Company of $10.4 million. Operating earnings is a non-GAAP measure defined as sales, less operating costs (excluding depreciation) and general and administrative costs. Net debt is a non-GAAP measure defined as cash and cash equivalents, less long-term debt and finance leases, before deferred financing fees. Financial Performance Operating earnings for the quarter ended March 31, 2015 were $274.0 million, an increase of $230.9 million in comparison to the first quarter of the prior year ($43.1 million). The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of Candelaria's ($163.7 million) and Eagle's ($56.1 million) operating results. Operating earnings were also positively impacted by favourable foreign exchange rates ($19.8 million), lower per unit operating costs ($17.9 million) and higher sales volumes ($12.1 million), partially offset by lower realized metal prices and price adjustments ($32.9 million) from our European operations. Sales for the quarter ended March 31, 2015 were $531.5 million, an increase of $381.6 million in comparison to the first quarter of the prior year ($149.9 million). The increase was due to incremental sales from Candelaria and Eagle of $292.2 million and $88.4 million, respectively, and higher sales volumes ($39.4 million), partially offset by lower realized metal prices and price adjustments ($32.9 million). Average London Metal Exchange (\"LME\") metal prices for copper, nickel and lead for the quarter ended March 31, 2015 were lower (17%, 2% and 14%, respectively) than that of the comparable quarter in the prior year, while zinc prices were 2% higher. Operating costs (excluding depreciation) for the quarter ended March 31, 2015 were $250.6 million, an increase of $150.4 in comparison to the first quarter of the prior year ($100.2 million). The increase was largely due to the incremental costs from Candelaria and Eagle of $128.5 million and $32.3 million, respectively. Net earnings for the quarter ended March 31, 2015 were $83.3 million, an increase of $70.0 million in comparison to the first quarter of the prior year ($13.3 million). Net earnings were positively impacted by: addition of Candelaria ($59.5 million) and Eagle's first full quarter of operations ($13.4 million); and foreign exchange gains of $17.3 million in the current year; partially offset by interest expense associated with the senior secured notes ($19.1 million); and higher tax expenses at the European operations. Cash flow from operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2015 was $224.0 million, an increase of $196.4 million in comparison to the first quarter of the prior year ($27.6 million). The increase in cash flow is almost entirely attributable to the operating earnings from Candelaria ($163.7 million) and Eagle ($56.1 million), partially offset by higher income taxes paid ($36.4 million). Corporate Highlights On March 25, 2015, the Company reported that mining and milling operations at its Candelaria and Ojos del Salado Mines had been temporarily suspended due to heavy rainfall and flooding that affected power and access to the site. Abnormal rains occurred in central and northern Chile, with the Copiapo region being particularly affected. Mining and milling operations re-commenced at the Candelaria mine the following day at half capacity, with ramp up to full production, and re-opening of the underground mines in the following days as regional roads and access to site were restored. The Company is pleased to report that there were neither injuries to personnel nor significant damage to operations, though many employees and their homes were seriously affected by the floods. The Company has been, and will continue to be, making substantial contributions to local relief and ongoing regional rebuilding efforts. Financial Position and Financing Net debt position at March 31, 2015 was $649.2 million compared to $829.2 million at December 31, 2014. The $180.0 million decrease in net debt during the quarter was attributable to operating cash flows of $224.0 million, distributions from Tenke of $8.3 million, and a $12.8 million withdrawal from restricted funds; this was partially offset by investments in mineral properties, plant and equipment of $63.9 million. The Company has a revolving credit facility available for borrowing up to $350 million. As at March 31, 2015, the Company had no amount drawn on the credit facility. A letter of credit in the amount of $28.1 million (SEK 242 million) is outstanding. Net debt at April 29, 2015 is approximately $630 million. Outlook 2015 Production and Cost Guidance Production and cash cost guidance for 2015 have been adjusted to account for extended open pit production performance at Aguablanca, lower copper grades at Zinkgruvan, beneficial foreign exchange rates and lower by-product metal prices. While Eagle and Candelaria first quarter cash costs were better than guided, Eagle has only been operating at full run rates for one quarter and Candelaria is in the process of a revision to the current mine plan. Therefore, re-assessment of cost guidance will occur later in the year once cost trends are better understood. Guidance on Tenke's copper production and cash costs have been updated to reflect the most recent guidance provided by Freeport. 2015 Capital Expenditure Guidance Capital expenditures for 2015 are expected to be $400 million (excluding Tenke), $390 million for sustaining capital and $10 million for expansionary capital. This is unchanged from the previous reduced guidance provided in the December 31, 2014 MD&A, as press released on February 18, 2015. The Company estimates its share of expansion related initiatives and sustaining capital funding for 2015 at Tenke to be $90 million. All of the capital expenditures are expected to be self-funded by cash flow from Tenke operations. Given lower metal prices, the Company is expecting lower cash distributions from Tenke in 2015 than originally guided ($30 - $40 million). Approximately $20 million is currently forecast to be received. 2015 Exploration Guidance Total exploration expense for 2015 (excluding Tenke) is estimated to be $60 million, consistent with prior guidance. These expenditures will be principally directed towards near mine targets at Candelaria, with the remainder being invested to advance exploration activities at our existing mines and for existing South American and Eastern European exploration projects.

(TSE: POT) Q1: PotashCorp Reports First-Quarter 2015 Earnings of $0.44 per Share Key Highlights First-quarter earnings of $0.44 per share1 Agreement to acquire 9.5 percent stake in Fertilizantes Heringer S.A. (Heringer) Full-year 2015 guidance adjusted to $1.75-$2.05 per share; primary changes include: Higher Saskatchewan potash taxes: ~$0.07 per share Nitrogen (lower volumes and prices): ~$0.04 per share Potash (shift in expected sales mix by market): ~$0.03 per share Phosphate (lower volumes): ~$0.03 per share Second-quarter guidance set at $0.45-$0.55 per share CEO Commentary \"We delivered stronger earnings compared to last year's first quarter on improved potash and phosphate contributions,\" said PotashCorp President and Chief Executive Officer Jochen Tilk. \"We adjust our full-year guidance largely on higher Saskatchewan potash taxes and first-quarter performance that trailed our initial expectations. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the strength in global potash demand and see momentum accelerating through the second quarter, especially in offshore markets\" Saskatoon, Saskatchewan - Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc. (PotashCorp) reported first-quarter earnings of $0.44 per share ($370 million), up from the $0.40 per share ($340 million) generated in 2014's first quarter. Gross margin for the quarter of $667 million surpassed the $565 million total for the same period in 2014. Higher prices and lower per-tonne cost of goods sold in potash were the primary contributors, more than offsetting changes to Saskatchewan potash taxes and weaker nitrogen sales volumes. Earnings before finance costs, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA)2 of $731 million exceeded the total for 2014's first quarter of $707 million, while cash from operating activities of $521 million during the first quarter was similar to the same period last year. Income from our offshore investments contributed $33 million to our first-quarter earnings, well below the $100 million for the same period in 2014. This year's total was comprised of equity earnings from Arab Potash Company (APC) and Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile S.A. (SQM), while 2014's total included contributions from these two companies as well as a $69 million special dividend from Israel Chemicals Ltd. (ICL). Market Conditions Following a period of especially robust potash markets, demand and pricing in spot markets eased slightly during the first quarter of 2015. While currency headwinds, weaker demand in Brazil and later settlements of annual Chinese contracts caused some caution among buyers, strong consumption needs kept demand at historically elevated levels. Potash exports from North American producers increased in the quarter as rail constraints that limited deliveries in last year's first quarter largely abated. In the North American market, a slow start to the spring planting season and record offshore imports resulted in weaker domestic producer sales compared to last year's first quarter. In nitrogen, market fundamentals weakened during the quarter on reduced agricultural demand and increased supply, including record Chinese urea exports. Prices for most nitrogen products moved lower during the quarter, although supply challenges in key exporting regions kept ammonia prices in North America elevated relative to the same period last year. In phosphate, the first quarter of 2015 saw supportive market fundamentals - especially for liquid fertilizers - on strong demand and North American supply outages. Prices for all phosphate products increased compared to the same period last year, although the solid fertilizer market weakened as the quarter progressed. Potash Higher realized prices and lower per-tonne costs increased our first-quarter potash gross margin to $428 million, surpassing the $300 million generated during the same period in 2014. First-quarter sales volumes of 2.3 million tonnes were relatively flat with the same period in 2014. Shipments to offshore markets rose 17 percent as improved rail logistics enhanced the ability of Canpotex3 to meet customer demands. The majority of Canpotex's shipments during the quarter were to Other Asian countries (47 percent) and Latin America (21 percent), while China and India accounted for 12 percent and 11 percent, respectively. North American sales volumes declined by 19 percent from 2014's comparatively high total. Our first-quarter average realized potash price of $284 per tonne was above the $250 per tonne for the same period last year as realized prices reflected the strong recovery throughout 2014 driven by record consumption. Potash production reached 2.6 million tonnes during the quarter, exceeding the 2.4 million tonnes produced in 2014's comparative period. Higher production, operational efficiencies and a favorable impact from a weakened Canadian dollar lowered our per-tonne costs by $18 per tonne (15 percent) compared to the same period last year. Nitrogen In nitrogen, gross margin of $181 million trailed the $239 million generated in the first quarter of 2014 on lower sales volumes and higher production costs. Our US operations generated $120 million of our quarterly total with Trinidad accounting for the remainder. Sales volumes for the quarter of 1.3 million tonnes fell below the 1.6 million tonnes sold in 2014's comparative period. Volumes for the quarter were affected by issues related to product availability caused by mechanical challenges at our Lima facility and curtailments in Trinidad related to natural gas supply. Additionally, a delayed start to the spring planting season in North America led to weaker fertilizer demand, which constrained sales, especially for urea and nitrogen solutions. Our average realized price of $351 per tonne during the quarter exceeded the $344 per tonne in the same period last year due to stronger ammonia prices. Per-tonne cost of goods sold for the first quarter increased 8 percent from 2014's comparable period. The primary drivers were reduced production and higher losses on our hedging positions as the benefit from lower natural gas costs in the US was offset by a rise in our ammonia-linked gas prices in Trinidad. Phosphate In phosphate, our first-quarter gross margin of $58 million surpassed the $26 million earned during the same period in 2014 as a result of improved realizations and the absence of accelerated depreciation charges related to the closure of our Suwannee River chemical plant. Sales volumes for the quarter of 0.7 million tonnes were down 16 percent from the same period last year. While we experienced production constraints in both periods, this year's first-quarter also reflected the closure of Suwannee River capacity and a greater proportion of our phosphoric acid being directed to products with higher phosphate content. Our first-quarter average realized price of $574 per tonne was well above the $484 per tonne in the same period of 2014. Improved market fundamentals and a greater proportion of sales volumes coming from higher-netback feed, industrial and liquid fertilizer products were the primary drivers. Cost of goods sold of $487 per tonne for the quarter exceeded the $453 per tonne in the same period of 2014, largely due to lower sales volumes and increased input costs for sulfur. Financial A weaker Canadian dollar, stronger potash prices and changes to Saskatchewan's potash taxation regulations announced in March raised provincial mining and other taxes for the first quarter to $95 million, well above the $54 million recorded in 2014. Despite higher company earnings, our income tax expense of $140 million was slightly below the same period last year when a $38 million non-deductible impairment charge on our investment in Sinofert Holdings Limited (Sinofert) was recognized. Capital-related cash expenditures of $228 million during the quarter were relatively flat compared to the same period in 2014. During the quarter, we entered into an agreement to acquire a 9.5 percent stake in Heringer, one of Brazil's largest fertilizer distributors. Once finalized, this investment is expected to further enhance our ability to serve customers in Brazil and provide flexibility for our growing New Brunswick potash operation. In March, we issued $500 million in 10-year notes at a rate of 3.00 percent during the quarter. The proceeds are expected to be used for general corporate purposes and to redeem $500 million of 3.75 percent notes that mature in September 2015. Market Outlook We continue to see encouraging signs in potash. With positive consumption trends, buyers in all key markets remain engaged and opportunities are emerging for reliable suppliers who can quickly respond to customers' needs. With China's annual potash contracts now in place and planting underway in the Northern Hemisphere, we expect global shipments to accelerate and market fundamentals to improve in the second quarter. Although volatile currency markets and risks to crop economics have the potential to disrupt demand expectations, we believe underlying consumption needs will support 2015 global potash shipments at the upper end of our previous guidance range of 58-60 million tonnes. In North America, the need to replenish soil nutrients from last year's record crop is expected to support strong potash demand at the farm level. Increased offshore imports are likely to keep domestic producer shipments - including those for PotashCorp - below robust 2014 levels through the balance of the year. Based on these factors - along with a potential decline in planted acres - we have lowered our 2015 shipment estimate for North America to 9.3-9.8 million tonnes. In Latin America, a drawdown of distributor inventories through the first quarter is expected to support higher potash import requirements as the year progresses. We continue to see significant agronomic needs supporting total shipments to this market of 10.8-11.3 million tonnes, slightly below 2014's record level. In China, we expect encouraging consumption trends to continue, especially for bulk blends and compound fertilizers with higher potassium content. Recently signed potash contracts with most major suppliers - including Canpotex contracts with minimum shipment requirements above those of 2014 - are expected to support robust shipments through the balance of the year. As a result of higher-than-anticipated contracted tonnes we have raised our estimate for total Chinese demand to 14.0-14.5 million tonnes. In India, we expect positive consumption trends for direct application and compound fertilizers to help bolster demand growth. While contract negotiations between Canpotex and its customers in India are ongoing, we believe the need for improved fertility will provide the necessary incentive to ensure potash settlements are completed in a timely manner. For 2015, we have increased the upper end of our estimate range for total shipments, which are now forecast at 4.5-5.0 million tonnes. In Other Asian countries (outside of China and India), agronomic need is expected to support strong consumption through the balance of 2015. Higher distributor inventories to begin the year are likely to keep total potash import requirements below last year's record level, with those for 2015 forecast in the range of 8.4-8.8 million tonnes. Financial Outlook We have maintained our annual estimate for potash gross margin of $1.5-$1.8 billion and sales volumes of 9.2-9.7 million tonnes. While global demand could push our sales volumes to the upper end of our guidance range, weaker pricing and a higher proportion of offshore sales tonnes are likely to result in lower average realizations compared to previous expectations. High operating rates, along with lower costs and a weaker Canadian dollar are expected to result in lower per-tonne operating costs relative to 2014. As a result of recent changes to potash taxes in Saskatchewan, we now forecast provincial mining and other taxes for 2015 to total 20-22 percent of potash gross margin. In nitrogen, lower global energy costs and increased supply are anticipated to keep markets subdued relative to 2014. Our production run rate is expected to improve from first-quarter levels, but challenges experienced early in the year are likely to result in annual sales volumes slightly below 2014's total. In phosphate, we expect market conditions to support a stronger pricing environment relative to 2014. Although we anticipate improved production levels will reduce our per-tonne cost of goods sold through the balance of the year, first-quarter production challenges, the closure of our Suwannee River facility and a greater proportion of our sales volume being directed to higher phosphate content products are expected to keep sales volumes below 2014 levels and our initial expectations for 2015. Given these considerations, we now forecast our combined nitrogen and phosphate gross margin will be in the range of $1.0-$1.2 billion in 2015. We have lowered our estimate of income from offshore equity investments to a range of $180-$200 million due to a slightly more subdued potash price environment and reduced dividend expectations from ICL related to ongoing labor issues. Selling and administrative expenses are now forecast between $230 million and $245 million. We have lowered our full-year 2015 earnings guidance to $1.75-$2.05 per share. For the second quarter, we forecast a range of $0.45-$0.55 per share. Annual Meeting of Shareholders Note On April 27, 2015 PotashCorp adopted further amendments to the company's General By-Law which was previously amended on February 20, 2015. The sole purpose of the amendment was to delete Section 7.A(5) of the advance notice requirements for director nominations of the General By-Law. Silver Wheaton Corp. (TSE: SLW) SILVER WHEATON REPORTS RECORD PRODUCTION OF OVER TEN MILLION SILVER EQUIVALENT OUNCES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2015 VANCOUVER, May 7, 2015 /CNW/ - Silver Wheaton Corp. (\"Silver Wheaton\" or the \"Company\") (TSX:SLW) (NYSE:SLW) is pleased to announce its unaudited results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2015. All figures are presented in United States dollars unless otherwise noted. FIRST QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS Record attributable silver equivalent production in Q1 2015 of 10.4 million ounces (6.3 million ounces of silver and 55,100 ounces of gold), compared with 9.0 million ounces in Q1 2014, representing an increase of 15%. Attributable silver equivalent sales volume in Q1 2015 of 7.7 million ounces (5.7 million ounces of silver and 28,400 ounces of gold), compared with 8.1 million ounces in Q1 2014, representing a decrease of 5%. During the three month period ending March 31, 2015, payable silver equivalent ounces attributable to the Company produced but not yet delivered increased by 1.6 million ounces to approximately 6.5 million ounces. Revenues of $130.5 million in Q1 2015 compared with $165.4 million in Q1 2014, representing a decrease of 21%. Average realized sale price per silver equivalent ounce sold in Q1 2015 of $16.90 ($16.95 per ounce of silver and $1,214 per ounce of gold), compared with $20.38 in Q1 2014, representing a decrease of 17%. Net earnings of $49.4 million ($0.13 per share) in Q1 2015 compared with $79.8 million ($0.22 per share) in Q1 2014, representing a decrease of 38%. Operating cash flows of $89.1 million ($0.24 per share1) in Q1 2015 compared with $114.8 million ($0.32 per share1) in Q1 2014, representing a decrease of 22%. Cash operating margin1 in Q1 2015 of $12.44 per silver equivalent ounce compared with $15.81 in Q1 2014, representing a decrease of 21%. Average cash costs1 in Q1 2015 were $4.14 and $388 per ounce of silver and gold, respectively. On a silver equivalent basis, average cash costs1decreased to $4.46 compared with $4.57 in Q1 2014. Declared quarterly dividend of $0.05 per common share. On January 5, 2015, the Company announced that it had amended its silver purchase agreement related to Barrick Gold Corporation's ( \"Barrick\") Pascua-Lama project (\"Pascua-Lama\"), located on the border of Chile and Argentina. On February 27, 2015, the Company announced that it had amended and restated its revolving credit facility (\"Revolving Facility\"). Silver Wheatonincreased the available credit from $1 billion to $2 billion and used proceeds drawn from the Revolving Facility together with cash on hand to repay the$1 billion of debt previously outstanding under the Company's non-revolving term loan. On March 2, 2015, Silver Wheaton announced that it had acquired from Vale S.A. (\"Vale\") an additional 25% of the life of mine gold production from its Salobo mine, located in Brazil, for an upfront payment of $900 million. On March 2, 2015, the Company announced that it had entered into an agreement with a syndicate of underwriters led by Scotiabank, pursuant to which they agreed to purchase, on a bought deal basis, 38,930,000 common shares of Silver Wheaton at a price of US$20.55 per share (the \"Offering\"), for aggregate gross proceeds to Silver Wheaton of approximately US$800 million. On March 17, 2015, the Company announced that it had closed the Offering and received $800 million in gross proceeds (net proceeds of approximately$769 million after payment of underwriters' fees and expenses). Events Subsequent to the Quarter \"Silver Wheaton had a strong start to 2015, with record production in the first quarter and the addition of more gold from one of our cornerstone assets. For the first time in our history, Silver Wheaton produced over ten million silver equivalent ounces in one quarter. While the quarterly sales volumes did not reflect the record production, we recognize that this is simply a timing issue and we fully expect to see increased sales as the year progresses,\" said Randy Smallwood, President and Chief Executive Officer of Silver Wheaton. \"Our record first quarter production was driven by the recent acquisition of an additional 25% of gold from the Salobo mine in Brazil, as well as the first contributions of gold and silver from the Constancia mine in Peru. We expect both of these streams to realize further gains over the coming year, as the Salobo mine is currently ramping-up production after expanding in the middle of last year and the Constancia mine achieved commercial production on April 30th of this year. We also continue to see some very good opportunities to add additional accretive ounces to our existing portfolio. Overall, the first quarter represents a strong start to what we believe will be a prolonged period of significant organic growth for Silver Wheaton without requiring any further capital.\" Financial Review Revenues Revenue was $130.5 million in the first quarter of 2015, on silver equivalent sales of 7.7 million ounces (5.7 million ounces of silver and 28,400 ounces of gold). This represents a 21% decrease from the $165.4 million of revenue generated in the first quarter of 2014 due primarily to a 17% decrease in the average realized silver equivalent price ($16.90 in Q1 2015 compared with $20.38 in Q1 2014), coupled with a 5% decrease in the number of silver equivalent ounces sold. Costs and Expenses Average cash costs1 in the first quarter of 2015 were $4.46 per silver equivalent ounce as compared with $4.57 during the comparable period of 2014. This resulted in a cash operating margin1 of $12.44 per silver equivalent ounce, a reduction of 21% as compared with Q1 2014. The decrease in the cash operating margin was primarily due to a 17% decrease in the average silver equivalent price realized in Q1 2015 compared with Q1 2014.1 Earnings and Operating Cash Flows Net earnings and cash flow from operations in the first quarter of 2015 were $49.4 million ($0.13 per share) and $89.1 million ($0.24 per share1), compared with $79.8 million ($0.22 per share) and $114.8 million ($0.32 per share1) for the same period in 2014, a decrease of 38% and 22%, respectively. Earnings and cash flow continued to be impacted by lower gold and silver prices. Balance Sheet At March 31, 2015, the Company had approximately $88.0 million of cash on hand and $800 million outstanding under the Company's $2 billion revolving term loan. As per the Company's February 27, 2015, news release, Silver Wheaton amended its Revolving Facility by increasing the available credit from $1 billion to $2 billion and extending the term by two years, with the facility now maturing on February 27, 2020. As part of the amendment, the financial covenants were revised. The interest rate applicable to any drawings under the amended Revolving Facility remains unchanged. The Company used proceeds drawn from this amended Revolving Facility together with cash on hand to repay the $1 billion of debt previously outstanding under its nonrevolving term loan and terminated that loan. On March 2, 2015, the Company announced that it had entered into an agreement with a syndicate of underwriters led by Scotiabank, pursuant to which they had agreed to purchase, on a bought deal basis, 38,930,000 common shares of Silver Wheaton at a price of $20.55 per share (the \"Offering\"), for aggregate gross proceeds to Silver Wheaton of approximately $800 million. On March 17, 2015, the Company announced that it had closed the Offering and received $800 million in gross proceeds (net proceeds of approximately $769 million after payment of underwriters' fees and expenses). The net proceeds were used to help fund the Company's acquisition of an additional 25% gold stream from the Salobo mine. First Quarter Asset Highlights During the first quarter of 2015, attributable silver equivalent production was 10.4 million ounces (6.3 million ounces of silver and 55,100 ounces of gold), representing an increase of 15% compared with the first quarter of 2014. Operational highlights for the quarter ended March 31, 2015, are as follows: Salobo In the first quarter of 2015, Salobo produced 27,185 ounces of gold attributable to Silver Wheaton, an increase of approximately 205% relative to the first quarter of 2014 primarily due to the doubling of the percentage of gold Silver Wheaton is entitled to as detailed below and the increased throughput as a result of the expansion to 24 million tons per annum (\"Mtpa\") which commenced production mid-year 2014. On March 2, 2015, the Company amended the agreement with Vale to acquire an additional amount of gold equal to 25% of the life of mine gold production from any minerals from the Salobo mine that enter the Salobo mineral processing facility from and after January 1, 2015. This acquisition is in addition to the 25% of the Salobo mine gold production that the Company acquired pursuant to the agreement in 2013. Silver Wheaton is now entitled to a total of 50% of the life of mine gold production from the Salobo mine. Under the amended agreement, the Company paid Vale upfront cash consideration of $900 million and will pay ongoing payments of the lesser of $400 per ounce of gold (subject to an inflationary adjustment of 1% commencing as of January 1, 2017) for the full 50% of gold production or the prevailing market price per ounce of gold delivered. The additional 25% life of mine production that was processed from and after January 1, 2015, accrued retroactively to the Company. If throughput capacity is expanded above the current 24 Mpta within a predetermined period, the Company will be required to make an additional payment to Vale, relative to the 50% stream, based on a set fee schedule. Constancia As disclosed in Hudbay's first quarter of 2015 MD&A, the Constancia mine achieved commercial production on April 30, 2015. Hudbay reported that ocean shipments began in April 2015 and that the mine and concentrator are currently operating at or above design capacity. According to Hudbay, the plant is performing as designed and throughput has occasionally exceeded design due to favourable ore characteristics, with peaks of over 90,000 tonnes per day. Hudbay has indicated that as at April 30, 2015, 42,575 tonnes of copper concentrate had been produced, of which approximately 20,500 tonnes had been shipped. Hudbay continues to expect the operation to achieve steady San Dimas On August 6, 2010, Goldcorp Inc. (\"Goldcorp\") completed the sale of the San Dimas mine to Primero Mining Corp (\"Primero\"). In conjunction with the sale, Silver Wheaton amended its silver purchase agreement relating to the mine. The term of the agreement, as it relates to San Dimas, was extended to the life of mine. During the first four years following the closing of the transaction, Primero delivered to Silver Wheaton a per annum amount equal to the first 3.5 million ounces of payable silver produced at San Dimas and 50% of any excess, and Silver Wheaton received an additional 1.5 million ounces of silver per annum that was delivered by Goldcorp. According to the amended agreement, beginning on August 6, 2014, the fourth anniversary of the closing, Primero delivers a per annum amount to Silver Wheaton equal to the first 6 million ounces of payable silver produced at San Dimas and 50% of any excess, and Goldcorp's obligation to deliver supplemental silver ceased. In the first quarter of 2015, San Dimas produced 1.9 million ounces of silver, an increase of approximately 20% relative to the first quarter of 2014. This was primarily due to increased production as a result of the expansion to 2,500 tonnes per day (\"tpd\") which was completed early in 2014 and to the sharing threshold increasing to 6 million ounces1 . In addition, during the quarter, the San Dimas mill consistently operated above its nameplate capacity of 2,500 tpd with an average throughput of 2,863 tpd, a 30% increase versus Q1 2014. Importantly, the San Dimas mine maintained pace with the mill, achieving record quarterly production of 2,931 tpd, 21% higher than in Q1 20142 . Metallurgical recoveries also reverted to their historical high levels with the completion of a final leach tank, averaging 93% for silver in the quarter. Penasquito In the first quarter of 2015, the Penasquito mine produced 1.4 million ounces of silver attributable to Silver Wheaton, a decrease of approximately 29% relative to the fourth quarter of 2014 due to lower grades being mined and lower metallurgical recoveries. Goldcorp has indicated that it anticipates grades to improve throughout 2015. As disclosed in Goldcorp's first quarter of 2015 MD&A, in the first quarter of 2015, Penasquito commenced a feasibility study on the Metallurgical Enhancement Project (\"MEP\") which is the combined study to assess the feasibility of the Concentrate Enrichment Project (\"CEP\") and Pyrite Leach Penasquito sulphide plant (\"Pyrite Leach\"). The study will assess the potential for producing saleable copper concentrate (CEP) and the viability of leaching a pyrite concentrate from the zinc flotation tailings (Pyrite Leach). Successful implementation of one or both of these new process improvements has the potential to improve the overall economics and life of mine of Penasquito. The feasibility study is expected to be complete in early 2016. Barrick / Pascua-Lama In the first quarter of 2015, attributable silver production from Barrick was 0.6 million ounces, an increase of approximately 112% relative to the first quarter of 2014 primarily due to higher grades at the Veladero and Lagunas Norte mines. On January 5, 2015, the Company announced that it had amended its silver purchase agreement related to Barrick's Pascua-Lama project. The amendment entails Silver Wheaton being entitled to 100% of the silver production from Barrick's Lagunas Norte, Pierina and Veladero mines until March 31, 2018, an extension of 1  1/4  years, and extending the completion test deadline an additional 2  1/2  years to June 30, 2020. As a reminder, if the requirements of the completion test have not been satisfied by the amended completion date, the agreement may be terminated by Silver Wheaton. In such an event, Silver Wheaton will be entitled to the return of the upfront cash consideration of $625 million less a credit for any silver delivered up to that date. Sudbury In the first quarter of 2015, Sudbury produced 10,112 ounces of gold, an increase of approximately 57% relative to the first quarter of 2014 primarily due to the commencement of operations at the Totten mine as well as higher gold grades being mined. Other: Toroparu On April 22, 2015, the Company amended its early deposit precious metal purchase agreement with Sandspring Resources Ltd. (\"Sandspring\") to include the acquisition of an amount equal to 50% of the silver production from its Toroparu project (\"Toroparu\") located in the Republic of Guyana, South America. Silver Wheaton will pay Sandspring incremental upfront cash payments totaling $5.0 million for 50% of the payable silver production from Toroparu. In addition, Silver Wheaton will make ongoing payments to Sandspring of the lesser of the market price and $3.90 per payable ounce of silver delivered to Silver Wheaton over the life of Toroparu, subject to a 1% annual increase starting on the fourth anniversary of production. Sandspring is entitled to receive US$2.0 million of the incremental US$5.0 million cash payment in four equal installments over the course of 2015, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. Produced But Not Yet Delivered During the first quarter of 2015, payable silver equivalent ounces produced but not yet delivered to Silver Wheaton by its partners increased by 1.6 million ounces to approximately 6.5 million silver equivalent payable ounces at March 31, 2015, primarily related to an increase related to the Salobo gold purchase agreement. Payable ounces produced but not yet delivered to Silver Wheaton are expected to average approximately 2 to 3 months of annualized production but may vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of mining operations factors including mine ramp-up, delays in shipments, etc. About Silver Wheaton Silver Wheaton is the largest pure precious metals streaming company in the world. Based upon its current agreements, forecast 2015 estimated annual attributable production is approximately 43.5 million silver equivalent ounces1 , including 230,000 ounces of gold. By 2019, estimated annual attributable production is anticipated to increase significantly to approximately 51 million silver equivalent ounces1, including 325,000 ounces of gold. This anticipated growth is expected to be driven by the Company's portfolio of low-cost and longlife assets, including precious metal and gold streams on Vale's Salobo mine and Hudbay's Constancia project. Sherritt International Corporation (S:TSX) Sherritt International Corporation (\"Sherritt\" or the \"Corporation\") (TSX: S), a world leader in the mining and refining of nickel from lateritic ores, today reported its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2015. \"Our first quarter results are a good start to the year,\" said David Pathe, President and CEO. \"Ambatovy's ramp up has progressed steadily, allowing us to meet our 90 for 90 production milestone ahead of schedule. Across our nickel business, we had strong production with cash costs at Moa below U.S.$5.00 per pound. In addition, Ambatovy cash costs were below U.S.$6.00 per pound for the first time which supports the correlation with improving cash costs as production edges closer to design capacity. This success positions us well as nickel and oil pricing continue to be weak.\" \"In Cuba, we drilled two oil wells in the quarter, one of which is producing and one being tested. In addition, the new Cuban foreign investment law will mean lower taxes across our operations there, and we look forward to the associated benefits.\" Q1 HIGHLIGHTS Finished nickel production from the Metals division reached its highest level in our history at 9,013 tonnes. Net direct cash costs decreased to U.S.$4.36 per pound at Moa and U.S.$5.74 per pound at Ambatovy Ambatovy achieved the \"90 for 90\" production milestone ahead of schedule. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 19% to $44.2 million, primarily due to lower oil prices. Combined adjusted operating cash flow per share increased 58% to $0.19 per share. Combined administration expenses declined by 24% to $17.7 million. A reduction in statutory tax rates in Cuba generated a tax recovery of approximately $30 million recognized in the quarter and will lead to lower taxes payable going forward in all three Cuba segments. OUTLOOK AND SIGNIFICANT ITEMS We lowered production guidance in Oil and Gas to 19,000 bpd (see page 10 for full table). Nickel and oil prices remain under pressure; therefore, after a review of our capital plans, we are reducing capital guidance. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, a strike at the Ambatovy plant in Toamasina commenced in mid-April. The strike has since been resolved as announced on April 23, 2015. The strike follows a short strike at the Ambatovy mine in March. The plant operated during the strike, with a minor impact to production expected for the month of April. All amounts are Canadian dollars unless otherwise indicated. (1) For additional information see the Non-GAAP measures section of this press release. (2) Compared to the same period in the prior year. (3) Shown on Sherritt's attributable share ownership basis. Metal markets Average reference nickel prices for the first quarter of 2015 were approximately 9% lower than the fourth quarter of 2014 and similar to the average reference price in the same quarter a year ago. Nickel prices remain under pressure due to softer demand particularly from stainless steel mills combined with LME inventories rising by 5% in the quarter. The expectations of reductions in nickel pig iron production later in the year remain, with some evidence of this trend appearing in the reduced nickel ore inventory levels in China. Moa Joint Venture (50% interest) and Fort Site Adjusted EBITDA increased 161% to $18.3 million during the first quarter compared to $7.0 million in the same period in the prior year primarily due to lower fuel oil and energy prices combined with higher production and the effect of a weaker Canadian dollar as all of the sales are U.S. dollar denominated and only the Moa portion of operating costs are generally in U.S. dollars. Cash flow from continuing operations increased to $30.2 million compared to $6.3 million in the same period in the prior year primarily due to changes in working capital as well as higher Adjusted EBITDA. Finished nickel production of 4,357 tonnes (50% basis) was 20% higher than the same period in the prior year primarily due to higher mixed sulphide availability from Moa and stable refinery operations. Finished cobalt production was also 20% higher in the first quarter than in the same period a year ago. Nickel recoveries were 88% in the first quarter, in line with recoveries in the same period last year. The net direct cash cost of nickel decreased to U.S.$4.36 per pound compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to lower fuel oil prices, energy prices, mining, processing and refining unit costs, partially offset by higher sulphur and sulphuric acid prices. Lower mining, processing and refining unit costs were the result of lower labour costs and an improvement in unplanned maintenance leading to reduced maintenance costs. Capital spending was $8.1 million in the first quarter compared to $4.6 million in the same period in the prior year. Higher sustaining capital was in line with expectations. Expansion capital of $2.4 million relates to the mobilization and commencement of construction of the 2,000 tonnes per day acid plant, which will eliminate the need to import acid. Ambatovy Joint Venture (40% interest) On March 23, 2015, the Corporation announced that Ambatovy successfully achieved a production rate equivalent to 54,000 tonnes of nickel (annualized), which is approximately 90% of name plate capacity, measured over 90 days in a 100-day continuous period. While we await the official verification of this milestone by the Independent Engineer, we are pursuing the remaining four completion certificates that must be delivered to the project's senior lenders. Adjusted EBITDA of $4.3 million was higher than the prior year period of negative $4.4 million primarily due to higher production. Cash flow from continuing operations increased to $12.6 million compared to negative $21.1 million in the same period in the prior year primarily due to changes in working capital and higher Adjusted EBITDA. For the first quarter, finished nickel production was 4,656 tonnes, or approximately 79% of nameplate capacity, and finished cobalt production was 344 tonnes. Finished nickel and cobalt production were 33% and 24% higher, respectively for the first quarter compared to the same period in the prior year due to continued ramp up of operations and process control improvements achieved in the countercurrent decantation and raw liquor neutralization circuits, as well as extensive major maintenance carried out in 2014 which improved overall equipment availability leading to higher ore feed throughput. Production was negatively impacted by a two week shutdown following a hydrogen sulphide gas release incident at the plant site in Toamasina as well as a strike at the mine site in March which reduced production at the mine and curtailed ore feed to the plant. The strike was resolved at the end of the quarter. Separately, a strike at the Ambatovy plant in Toamasina commenced in mid-April. The strike has since been resolved as announced on April 23, 2015. The plant operated during the strike, with a minor impact to production expected for the month of April. The average first quarter ore throughput in the PAL circuit was approximately 77.3% of nameplate capacity. Autoclave operating hours during the first quarter were 7,436, compared to 6,740 in the comparable period last year, reflecting the improved performance of downstream circuits, partly offset by the hydrogen sulphide gas release incident and the mine strike. Nickel recovery during the first quarter was 85%, compared to 81% during the first quarter of 2014. During the quarter, the second ore thickener was commissioned and is now operating. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, planned maintenance on the fifth autoclave was completed. The net direct cash cost of nickel of U.S.$5.74 per pound decreased by 16% compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increased production and lower maintenance costs. Reductions in net direct cash costs are consistent with our expectations for the facility operating at current ore throughput levels. Capital spending for Ambatovy is focused on sustaining capital for transportation infrastructure and the tailings facility. For the first quarter, no funding was required by the Joint Venture partners. The average realized price for oil produced in Cuba decreased by $30.36 per barrel compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of lower Gulf Coast Fuel Oil No. 6 reference prices, which followed the decline in global oil prices, partly offset by a weaker Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. Adjusted EBITDA of $21.5 million in the first quarter decreased by 64% compared to the same period in the prior year due to lower average realized oil prices and increased unit operating costs. Cash flow from continuing operations decreased to $6.6 million compared to $16.1 million in the same period in the prior year due to lower Adjusted EBITDA. Gross working interest (GWI) oil production in Cuba decreased 2% to 19,719 barrels of oil per day (bopd) compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to lower than expected oil production from two of the six wells drilled to date under the Puerto Escondido-Yumuri Production Sharing Contract (PSC) extension. We expected higher initial production rates from these wells and will be monitoring production levels over the next quarter to provide a more definitive outlook. Net oil production decreased 7% due to a lower cost recovery oil allocation and the slight decrease in gross oil production. The lower cost recovery oil allocation was due to limitations on the amount of eligible expenditures that can be claimed during a quarter for cost recovery purposes under the terms of the Puerto Escondido/Yumuri PSC. Any eligible expenditures not recovered in the current quarter remain eligible for the allocation of cost recovery oil in subsequent quarters. Unit operating costs in Cuba increased by 23% in the first quarter compared to the same period in the prior year. Of the $1.56 per barrel increase in unit operating costs, the major items were an increase of approximately $0.50 per barrel related to the weaker Canadian dollar and approximately $0.30 per barrel related to higher routine maintenance, combined with lower production. Capital spending was primarily due to development drilling activities, including deployment of a second drill rig, and equipment purchases. Two new development wells were drilled and completed in Cuba during the quarter.

Teck Resourses Limited (TSE: TCK) TECK REPORTS UNAUDITED FIRST QUARTER RESULTS FOR 2015 Vancouver, BC - Teck Resources Limited (TSX: TCK.A and TCK.B, NYSE: TCK) (\"Teck\") reported first quarter adjusted profit attributable to shareholders of $64 million, or $0.11 per share, compared with $105 million or $0.18 per share in 2014. Profit attributable to shareholders was $68 million ($0.12 per share) compared with $69 million ($0.12 per share) a year ago. \"Our ongoing focus on cost management and operational performance, aided by the strong U.S. dollar, is enabling our diversified business to withstand the generally weak commodity price environment, allowing all of our operations to generate positive operating cash flows after our sustaining capital spending,\" said Don Lindsay, President and CEO. Highlights and Significant Items Profit attributable to shareholders was $68 million and EBITDA was $546 million in the first quarter. Gross profit before depreciation and amortization was $685 million in the first quarter compared with $734 million in the first quarter of 2014. Cash flow from operations, before working capital changes, was $510 million in the first quarter of 2015 compared with $470 million a year ago. We achieved record first quarter coal sales and production of 6.8 million tonnes. We have reached agreements with our customers to sell 5.5 million tonnes of coal in the second quarter of 2015 based on US$109.50 per tonne for the highest quality product and we expect total sales in the second quarter, including spot sales, to be around 6.0 million tonnes. All critical milestones are being achieved on the Fort Hills oil sands project. The partners are focused on capital discipline and are working with our contractors to take advantage of the current economic environment. In April we completed the earn-in portion of project funding with our share of capital expenditures lowering to 20% from the earn-in rate of 27.5% A falling Canadian dollar, lower oil prices and our cost reduction program have contributed to lower our U.S. dollar unit costs for our products with copper and coal unit costs falling by US$0.09 per pound and US$18 per tonne, respectively, compared to last year. First quarter production at our Pend Oreille zinc mine, which restarted in December 2014, was 6,000 tonnes and we expect to reach the full production rate of 44,000 tonnes per year in the second quarter of 2015. Our liquidity remains strong with a cash balance of $1.4 billion at April 20, 2015 and US$3.0 billion available under our revolving credit facility, which matures in 2019. Our cash balance is in line with our expectations at this point in the year and consistent with our goal of finishing the year with at least $1.0 billion in cash at existing debt levels. Earlier today, we announced an eligible dividend of $0.15 per share on our outstanding Class A common and Class B subordinate voting shares to be paid on July 2, 2015. This reduction brings our dividend payout and yields more in line with current commodity prices and outlook and ensures balance sheet strength and flexibility for future capital expenditures or other capital allocation opportunities. Overview Commodity markets continue to be challenging. Prices for steelmaking coal have fallen further since the beginning of the year and the market for steelmaking coal remains oversupplied, primarily due to indications of weakening demand in China. Copper prices dipped sharply in the quarter but rebounded substantially towards the end of the quarter with prices averaging US$2.64 per pound compared with US$3.19 per pound in the previous year. Partly offsetting the commodity price declines was a stronger U.S. dollar. The stronger U.S. dollar has a significant positive benefit on our business, as sales of our products are denominated in U.S. dollars while a significant portion of our expenses are incurred in local currencies, particularly the Canadian dollar and the Chilean peso. At current commodity prices, each one cent decline in the U.S./Canadian dollar exchange rate has an effect on our annual EBITDA of approximately $52 million, depending on sales volumes. Operationally our results have benefited from lower oil prices, the lower Canadian dollar and Chilean peso and our cost reduction program, as unit costs have fallen significantly in U.S. dollar terms. Production in coal set a record for the first quarter while zinc and copper production was also strong. Given the current economic environment, we will continue to focus our efforts on our cost reduction program and reducing our capital spending as much as possible. Our primary development project is the Fort Hills oil sands project. The construction phase of Fort Hills will require substantial investment through 2017, but is expected to provide significant cash flows, diversify our commodity mix and provide a long-life asset located in a stable jurisdiction. The restart of our Pend Oreille zinc mine is expected to benefit from improving zinc market fundamentals and will provide transportation cost savings due to our proximity to our Trail Operations. It is expected to reach design capacity for the second quarter. Turqoise Hill Resourses Ltd. (TSE: TRQ) Turquoise Hill announces financial results and review of operations for the first quarter of 2015 VANCOUVER, CANADA -Turquoise Hill Resources today announced its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2015. All figures are in US dollars unless otherwise stated. HIGHLIGHTS Oyu Tolgoi achieved a strong safety performance with no fatalities and an All Injury Frequency Rate of 0.25 per 200,000 hours worked. Beginning on January 1, 2015, Turquoise Hill began preparing its financial statement in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards. Oyu Tolgoi recorded revenue of $426.2 million in Q1'15 on sales of 167,700 tonnes of concentrate containing high gold content; concentrate sales exceeded production for Q1'15. Revenue and sales in Q1'15 reflect expected lower quarterly production and reduced head grades as well as the impact of the Lunar New Year holiday when border and customs operations were closed. Turquoise Hill reported income attributable to shareholders of $96.2 million, including a non-cash impairment reversal credit of $35.2 million related to its SouthGobi investment. Turquoise Hill generated operating cash flow of $105.3 million during Q1'15. In Q1'15, material mined increased 16.1% over Q4'14 mainly due to improvements driven by a range of productivity initiatives in the open pit partially offset by longer haul distances. Concentrator milling rates increased through Q1'15 as improvements started to take effect, particularly in the pebble crushing circuit. Open-pit development for 2015 is proceeding to schedule with higher-grade material expected to be processed by the concentrator starting in Q2'15. Turquoise Hill expects production distribution at Oyu Tolgoi to be relatively similar to 2014 with production levels significantly higher in the second half of 2015. In February 2015, Oyu Tolgoi shipped its one millionth tonne of concentrate. Significant progress has been made in discussions with the Government of Mongolia; however no formal agreement has been signed that resolves all remaining matters. Oyu Tolgoi LLC signed a Cooperation Agreement in April 2015 with its partner communities, which is required under the Investment Agreement and the Mongolian Minerals Law. On April 23, 2015, Turquoise Hill completed its divestment transaction with Novel Sunrise Investments Limited for the sale of 48,705,155 shares in SouthGobi, with a loss on disposal expected in Q2'15. On May 1, 2015, Turquoise Hill announced the expiration of its share purchase agreement with National United Resources for the proposed sale of 56,102,000 shares in SouthGobi. During Q1'15, Turquoise Hill generated $95.1 million of cash. Turquoise Hill's cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2015 were $954.2 million. FINANCIAL RESULTS In Q1'15, Turquoise Hill recorded net income attributable to shareholders of $96.2 million, comprising net income from continuing operations of $67.1 million, and net income from discontinued operations of $29.1 million, largely related to appreciation of SouthGobi's quoted stock price during the quarter. Earnings per share of $0.04 comprised $0.03 per share from continuing operations and $0.01 from discontinued operations. Operating cash flows were $105.3 million, reflecting period sales, which were particularly impacted by high by-product revenues, and further drawdown of run-of-mine inventories held at December 31, 2014. Additions to property, plant and equipment were $30.4 million in Q1'15, including approximately $27.0 million for sustaining capital activities including the tailing storage facility. Turquoise Hill's cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2015 were $954.2 million. Beginning on January 1, 2015, Turquoise Hill began preparing its financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. Given the conversion to IFRS, any financial information in this press release should be reviewed in consultation with the Company's condensed interim consolidated financial statements, in particular Notes 2 and 26 to the financial statements. Please refer to the IFRS section of this press release. OYU TOLGOI The Oyu Tolgoi mine is approximately 550 kilometres south of Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia's capital city, and 80 kilometres north of the Mongolia-China border. Mineralization on the property consists of porphyry-style copper, gold, silver and molybdenum contained in a linear structural trend (the Oyu Tolgoi Trend) that has a strike length extending over 26 kilometres. Mineral resources have been identified in a series of deposits throughout this trend. They include, from south to north, the Heruga Deposit, the Southern Oyu deposits (Southwest Oyu, South Oyu, Wedge and Central Oyu) and the Hugo Dummett deposits (Hugo South, Hugo North and Hugo North Extension). Mining of ore commenced in May 2012 and first concentrate was produced in January 2013. The Oyu Tolgoi mine has initially been developed as an open-pit operation. A copper concentrator plant, with related facilities and necessary infrastructure to support an initial throughput of 100,000 tonnes of ore per day, has been constructed to process ore mined from the Southern Oyu open pit. Long term development plans for Oyu Tolgoi are based on a 95,000-tonne-per-day underground block-cave mine. In August 2013, development of the underground mine was delayed to allow matters with the Government of Mongolia to be resolved. Further development of the underground mine is expected to commence once the following conditions are met: (1) successful resolution of the mine's shareholder matters, including the tax situation; (2) agreement of a comprehensive funding plan including project finance; (3) approval of the 2014 Feasibility Study by the Oyu Tolgoi shareholders and acceptance by the Mongolian Minerals Council; and obtaining all necessary permits for the mine's operations and development. Q1'15 performance Safety continues to be a major focus throughout Oyu Tolgoi's operations and the mine's management is committed to reducing risk and injury. For Q1'15, Oyu Tolgoi achieved a strong safety performance with no fatalities and an All Injury Frequency Rate of 0.25 per 200,000 hours worked. Revenue and concentrate sales in Q1'15 decreased 36.4% and 36.2% respectively over Q4'14 reflecting expected lower quarterly production and reduced head grades as well as the impact of the Lunar New Year holiday when border and customs operations were closed for an extended period, and lower average London Metal Exchange copper prices. The Q1'15 mix of revenue by metals is the result of inventory with higher contained gold drawn down during the quarter from concentrate produced in 2014. Despite the Lunar New Year holiday, concentrate sales volumes exceeded production for the quarter. Gross margin at 39.5% for the quarter remained broadly consistent with Q4'14. Production and delivery costs include primarily the cash costs in inventory sold as well as allocated mine administration costs. Depreciation and depletion includes the depreciation and depletion in inventory sold as well as any depreciation of assets used in the selling and delivery process, including the depreciation of capitalized production phase stripping costs. Capitalized additions to property, plant and equipment for Q1'15 were $30.4 million (Q1'14: $49.9 million) including approximately $27.0 million for sustaining activities, including the tailings storage facility. Total cash operating costs at Oyu Tolgoi in Q1'15 were $218.9 million. Following transition to IFRS, the 5% royalty payable to the Government of Mongolia, previously deducted from revenue, is reflected as a cash operating expense, and production phase stripping costs, previously included within cash operating expense, are capitalized and depreciated. Please refer the IFRS section of this press release. As a result of the change in treatment of royalty payables, the Company has updated its 2015 total cash operating guidance to approximately $1.0 billion (previously $900.0 million). During Q1'15, Oyu Tolgoi continues to improve and optimize operations in order to reduce costs across the mine's operation. Oyu Tolgoi's C1 costs per pound of copper as reported by Turquoise Hill in Q1'15 were $0.09 per pound, compared with $1.14 per pound for the full year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease is mainly driven by large by-product credits from Q1'15 revenue associated with high-grade concentrate produced in 2014. The favourable impact on C1 costs of by-product revenue and cost reduction initiatives was partly offset by the impact of lower production volumes. Oyu Tolgoi's open-pit mine has a high-grade zone containing a large proportion of gold in addition to copper; Turquoise Hill anticipates quarterly fluctuation of C1 costs as the quantity of gold in concentrates sold varies after ore from this zone is fed through the mill. Please refer the Non-GAAP Measures section of this press release for reconciliation of these metrics, including total cash operating costs, to the financial statements. Concentrate production in Q1'15 decreased 29.9% over Q4'14. Production was impacted by lower mill head grades as well as a planned shutdown to reline both SAG mills and undertake modification and improvement work. The shutdown was completed on time and with no injuries. Material mined in Q1'15 increased 16.1% over Q4'14 mainly due to improvements driven by a range of productivity initiatives in the open pit partially offset by longer haul distances. Head grades declined in Q1'15 as high-grade material from the open pit was largely processed in Q4'14. Concentrator milling rates increased through Q1'15 as improvements started to take effect, particularly in the pebble crushing circuit. On March 18, 2015, Oyu Tolgoi filed a statutory 2015 Oyu Tolgoi Feasibility Study with the Mongolian Minerals Council. Under Mongolian law, Oyu Tolgoi is required to submit an update to the feasibility study at least every five years. The 2009 Oyu Tolgoi Feasibility Study was accepted in March 2010. Funding of Oyu Tolgoi by Turquoise Hill In accordance with the Amended and Restated Shareholders' Agreement dated June 8, 2011 (ARSHA), Turquoise Hill has funded Oyu Tolgoi's cash requirements beyond internally generated cash flows by a combination of equity investment and shareholder debt. For amounts funded by debt, Oyu Tolgoi must repay such amounts, including accrued interest, before it can pay common share dividends. At March 31, 2015, the aggregate outstanding balance of shareholder loans extended by subsidiaries of the Company to Oyu Tolgoi was $6.9 billion, including accrued interest of $1.3 billion. These loans bear interest at an effective annual rate of LIBOR plus 6.5%. Subsidiaries of the Company have accrued $129.2 million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities for the withholding taxes due upon payment of the accrued interest by Oyu Tolgoi. In Q1'15, Oyu Tolgoi repaid a total amount of $150.0 million with respect to these loans, including accrued interest of $44.7 million. In accordance with the ARSHA, a subsidiary of the Company has funded the common share investments in Oyu Tolgoi on behalf of Erdenes. These funded amounts earn interest at an effective annual rate of LIBOR plus 6.5% and are repayable, by Erdenes to a subsidiary of the Company, via a pledge over Erdenes' share of Oyu Tolgoi common share dividends. Erdenes also has the right to reduce the outstanding balance by making cash payments at any time. As at March 31, 2015, the cumulative amount of such funding was $751.2 million, representing approximately 34% of invested common share equity, plus unrecognized interest thereon of $183.1 million. Operational outlook Open-pit development for 2015 is proceeding to schedule with higher-grade material expected to be processed by the concentrator starting in Q2'15. The Company expects production distribution to be relatively similar to 2014 with production levels significantly higher in the second half of 2015. Based on the current mine schedule, Oyu Tolgoi is expected to produce 175,000 to 195,000 tonnes of copper and 600,000 to 700,000 ounces of gold in concentrates in 2015. Production from the high-grade core of the southwest zone is expected to recommence in mid-2015. Sales contracts have been signed for 100% of Oyu Tolgoi's expected 2015 concentrate production. Discussions with the Government of Mongolia and project financing Turquoise Hill, Rio Tinto and the Government of Mongolia remain committed to resolving the shareholder matters and finalizing project finance to restart the underground mine development at Oyu Tolgoi. Turquoise Hill and Rio Tinto have made an offer to the Government of Mongolia to resolve the shareholder matters in a manner which the Company believes is beneficial to all stakeholders. Significant progress has been made; however no formal agreement has been signed that resolves all of the remaining matters. Further development will commence once the following conditions are met: Successful resolution of shareholder matters, including the outstanding tax assessment; Agreement on a comprehensive funding plan, including Oyu Tolgoi project finance; Approval of the 2014 Feasibility Study by all shareholders and acceptance by the Mongolian Minerals Council; and Obtaining all necessary permits for the mine's operation and development. Turquoise Hill continues to engage with the proposed project financing lender group and has kept both the international financial institutions and the commercial banks informed of the status of discussions with the Government of Mongolia. Commitments from the commercial bank consortium formally expired on September 30, 2014. Timing of any lender commitment extension requests will be determined when definitive progress or resolution has been made on shareholder matters. The lending group continues to be supportive of the Oyu Tolgoi project and current indications are that a suitable project financing package would be available upon resolution of the outstanding shareholder matters; however this is not guaranteed. While discussions continue to resolve shareholder matters, and re-start underground mine development, Oyu Tolgoi's management is focused on efficiently and safely running the open-pit mine and the processing facilities, while the underground remains in care and maintenance. Q1'15 exploration Oyu Tolgoi's exploration strategy is focused on developing a project pipeline prioritized in areas that can impact the current development of the Oyu Tolgoi orebodies, seeking low-cost development options; in particular looking for shallower targets. Historical datasets are added to and reinterpreted to enable future discovery. SOUTHGOBI - HELD FOR SALE On February 24, 2015, the Company announced that it had entered into a share purchase agreement with Novel Sunrise Investments Limited (NSI) providing for the sale of its holding of 48.7 million shares in SouthGobi, not subject to a previously announced sale transaction with National United Resources Holdings Limited (NUR), at a price of C$0.35 per common share payable in cash. The Company completed the sale on April 23, 2015 and expects to record a loss on this divestment in Q2'15. Half of the aggregate purchase price, representing C$8.5 million, was received at closing and the balance of approximately C$8.5 million will be payable on the first anniversary of closing. The carrying value of the Company's total interest in SouthGobi at March 31, 2015 was $82.7 million based on the quoted share price at that date, plus adjustments for amounts receivable from SouthGobi which eliminated on consolidation prior to divestment. Following completion of the sale to NSI, Turquoise Hill continues to own 56.1 million SouthGobi common shares, representing approximately 23.3% of the issued and outstanding SouthGobi shares. The fair value of this investment at April 23, 2015, based on the quoted share price at that date, was $38.3 million. On May 1, 2015, Turquoise Hill announced that the share purchase agreement with NUR, which provided for the sale to NUR of 56.1 million shares in the capital of SouthGobi, had expired on April 30, 2015 without the transaction contemplated thereunder having been completed. The transaction was unable to be completed as required by the terms of the share purchase agreement. Following completion of the sale to NSI, and expiry of the share purchase agreement with NUR, the Company's exposures in relation to its investment in SouthGobi include, but are not wholly limited to: factors having an impact on fair value, and ability to complete divestment of its remaining interest in the future; and possible recognition of a proportionate share of losses and liabilities of SouthGobi. CORPORATE ACTIVITIES Class action lawsuits On December 16, 2014, United States District Court Judge Lorna G. Schofield dismissed the consolidated putative securities class action lawsuit that had been filed in the Southern District of New York against the Company and certain of its officers and directors in December 2013. The lawsuit sought to recover damages that it claimed were attributable to alleged misstatements about the Company's financial performance arising from revisions to its recognition of revenue on SouthGobi's coal sales, as disclosed on November 8, 2013. The plaintiffs did not appeal Judge Schofield's dismissal by February 9, 2015 the appeal deadline. INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS The condensed interim consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2015 are the Company's first consolidated interim financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS. Due to the requirement to present comparative financial information, the effective transition date is January 1, 2014 (Transition Date). The following outlines the key IFRS transitional impacts on the Company's financial statements and the impact of the IFRS transition on systems, process, business activities and controls. Note 26 to the condensed interim consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2015 provides more detail on the key U.S. GAAP to IFRS differences, the accounting policy decisions and the application of IFRS 1 - First Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards. Financial statement presentation changes The Company has also changed the presentation of certain items in its condensed interim consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2015 as compared to its financial statements previously. Mining royalties are now included within operating expenses where previously they were netted against revenues. Accretion expense for decommissioning obligations is included within finance costs where previously it was shown separately on the face of the statement of operations; and Deferred income tax liabilities for withholding taxes on intercompany interest payments is now classified as non-current deferred income taxes where previously they were included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities as withholding tax payable. Systems, processes and business activities The Company has assessed the impact of the IFRS transition on systems and processes, including an assessment on information technology systems and internal controls and implemented changes required as a result. These changes were not significant. The Company applied its existing control framework to the IFRS changeover process. All accounting policy changes and transitional financial position impacts were subject to review by senior management and the Company's Audit Committee. Post-implementation During post-implementation, the Company will continue to monitor the changes to IFRS in future periods. The Company notes that the standard-setting bodies that determine IFRS have significant ongoing projects that could impact the IFRS accounting policies that Turquoise Hill has selected. The Company has processes in place to ensure that potential changes are monitored and evaluated. The impact of any new IFRSs and IFRIC Interpretations will be evaluated as they are drafted and published. NON-GAAP MEASURES The Company's financial results are prepared in accordance with IFRS. In addition, the Company presents and refers to the following measures (non-GAAP measures) which are not defined in IFRS. A description and calculation of these measures is given below, and may differ in some aspects from equivalent measures provided by other issuers. Cash operating costs This measure comprises Oyu Tolgoi cash operating costs, and is presented in order to provide investors and other stakeholders in the Company with a greater understanding of performance and operations at Oyu Tolgoi. The measure of cash operating costs excludes: depreciation and depletion; exploration and evaluation; charges for asset write-down (including write-down of materials and supplies inventory), and includes management services payments to Rio Tinto, and management services payments to Turquoise Hill which are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements of the Company. C1 cash costs C1 cash costs is a metric representing the cash cost per unit of extracting and processing the Company's principal metal product to a condition in which it may be delivered to customers, net of by-product credits. It is provided in order to support peer group comparability and to provide investors and other stakeholders useful information about the underlying cash costs of Oyu Tolgoi and the impact of by-product credits on the operations' cost structure. C1 cash costs is relevant to understanding Company's operating profitability and ability to generate cash flow. When calculating costs associated with producing a pound of copper, the Company includes gold and silver revenue credits as the production cost is reduced as a result of selling these by-products. Turquoise Hill's principal metal product is copper, and C1 cash costs are reported for Oyu Tolgoi only. All-in sustaining cost All-in sustaining costs (AISC) is an extended cash based cost metric, providing further information on the aggregate cash, capital and overhead outlay per unit, and is intended to reflect the costs of producing the Company's principal metal product over the life-cycle of its operations. The measure seeks to reflect the full cost of copper production from current operations and as a result development project capital is not included. AISC allows Turquoise Hill to assess the ability of Oyu Tolgoi to support sustaining capital expenditures for future production from the generation of operating cash flows. QUALIFIED PERSON Disclosure of a scientific or technical nature in this MD&A in respect of the Oyu Tolgoi mine was prepared under the supervision of Bernard Peters (responsibility for overall preparation and mineral reserves), B. Eng. (Mining), FAusIMM (201743), employed by OreWin as Technical Director - Mining and Kendall Cole-Rae (responsibility for mineral resources, geology and exploration), B.Sc. (Geology), SME (4138633), employed by Rio Tinto as Chief Adviser, Geology and Resource Estimation. Each of these individuals is a \"qualified person\" as that term is defined in NI 43-101. Forward-looking statements Certain statements made herein, including statements relating to matters that are not historical facts and statements of the Company's beliefs, intentions and expectations about developments, results and events which will or may occur in the future, constitute \"forward-looking information\" within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities legislation and \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking information and statements relate to future events or future performance, reflect current expectations or beliefs regarding future events and are typically identified by words such as \"anticipate\", \"could\", \"should\", \"expect\", \"seek\", \"may\", \"intend\", \"likely\", \"plan\", \"estimate\", \"will\", \"believe\" and similar expressions suggesting future outcomes or statements regarding an outlook. These include, but are not limited to, statements respecting anticipated business activities; planned expenditures; corporate strategies; the evolution of discussions with the Government of Mongolia; and other statements that are not historical facts. Forward-looking statements and information are made based upon certain assumptions and other important factors that, if untrue, could cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such statements or information. Such statements and information are based on numerous assumptions regarding present and future business strategies and the environment in which the Company will operate in the future, including the price of copper, gold and silver, anticipated capital and operating costs, anticipated future production and cash flows, the ability to complete the disposition of certain of its non-core assets, the ability and timing to complete project financing and/or secure other financing on acceptable terms, and the evolution of discussions with the Government of Mongolia on a range of matters including the implementation of the Investment Agreement, project development costs, operating budgets, the payment of taxes and taxation matters, management fees and Oyu Tolgoi LLC internal governance. Certain important factors that could cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements and information include, among others, copper, gold and silver price volatility, discrepancies between actual and estimated production, mineral reserves and resources and metallurgical recoveries, mining operational and development risks, litigation risks, regulatory restrictions (including environmental regulatory restrictions and liability), activities or assessments by governmental authorities, currency fluctuations, the speculative nature of mineral exploration, the global economic climate, dilution, share price volatility, competition, loss of key employees, additional funding requirements, capital and operating costs for the construction and operation of the Oyu Tolgoi mine and defective title to mineral claims or property. Although the Company has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual actions, events or results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements and information, there may be other factors that cause actions, events or results not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended. All such forward-looking information and statements are based on certain assumptions and analyses made by the Company's management in light of their experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors management believes are appropriate in the circumstances. These statements, however, are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking information or statements. With respect to specific forward-looking information concerning the construction and development of the Oyu Tolgoi mine, the Company has based its assumptions and analyses on certain factors which are inherently uncertain. Uncertainties and assumptions include, among others: the timing and cost of the construction and expansion of mining and processing facilities; the impact of the decision announced by the Company to delay the funding and development of the Oyu Tolgoi underground mine pending resolution of outstanding matters with the Government of Mongolia associated with the development and operation of the Oyu Tolgoi mine and to satisfy all conditions precedent to the availability of Oyu Tolgoi Project Financing; the approval of the underground feasibility study by Oyu Tolgoi LLC's shareholders, the impact of changes in, changes in interpretation to or changes in enforcement of, laws, regulations and government practices in Mongolia; the availability and cost of skilled labour and transportation; the availability and cost of appropriate smelting and refining arrangements; the obtaining of (and the terms and timing of obtaining) necessary environmental and other government approvals, consents and permits; the availability of funding on reasonable terms; the timing and availability of a long-term power source for the Oyu Tolgoi mine; delays, and the costs which would result from delays, in the development of the underground mine (which could significantly exceed the costs projected in the underground feasibility study and in the 2014 Oyu Tolgoi Technical Report); projected copper, gold and silver prices and demand; and production estimates and the anticipated yearly production of copper, gold and silver at the Oyu Tolgoi mine. The cost, timing and complexities of mine construction and development are increased by the remote location of a property such as the Oyu Tolgoi mine. It is common in new mining operations and in the development or expansion of existing facilities to experience unexpected problems and delays during development, construction and mine start-up. Additionally, although the Oyu Tolgoi mine has achieved commercial production, there is no assurance that future development activities will result in profitable mining operations. In addition, funding and development of the underground component of the Oyu Tolgoi mine have been delayed until matters with the Government of Mongolia can be resolved and a new timetable agreed. These delays can impact project economics. The Company's MD&A also contains references to estimates of mineral reserves and mineral resources. The estimation of reserves and resources is inherently uncertain and involves subjective judgments about many relevant factors. The mineral resource estimates contained in the MD&A are inclusive of mineral reserves. Further, mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. The accuracy of any such estimates is a function of the quantity and quality of available data, and of the assumptions made and judgments used in engineering and geological interpretation (including future production from the Oyu Tolgoi mine, the anticipated tonnages and grades that will be achieved or the indicated level of recovery that will be realized), which may prove to be unreliable. There can be no assurance that these estimates will be accurate or that such mineral reserves and mineral resources can be mined or processed profitably. See the discussion under the headings \"Language Regarding Reserves and Resources\" and \"Note to United States Investors Concerning Estimates of Measured, Indicated and Inferred Resources\" in Section 20 of the MD&A. Such estimates and statements are, in large part, based on the following: Interpretations of geological data obtained from drill holes and other sampling techniques. Large scale continuity and character of the deposits will only be determined once significant additional drilling and sampling has been completed and analyzed. Actual mineralization or formations may be different from those predicted. It may also take many years from the initial phase of drilling before production is possible, and during that time the economic feasibility of exploiting a deposit may change. Reserve and resource estimates are materially dependent on prevailing metal prices and the cost of recovering and processing minerals at the individual mine sites. Market fluctuations in the price of metals or increases in the costs to recover metals from the Company's mining projects may render mining of ore reserves uneconomic and affect the Company's operations in a materially adverse manner. Moreover, various short-term operating factors may cause a mining operation to be unprofitable in any particular accounting period; Assumptions relating to commodity prices and exchange rates during the expected life of production, mineralization of the area to be mined, the projected cost of mining, and the results of additional planned development work. Actual future production rates and amounts, revenues, taxes, operating expenses, environmental and regulatory compliance expenditures, development expenditures, and recovery rates may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates. Any significant change in these assumptions, including changes that result from variances between projected and actual results, could result in material downward revision to current estimates; Assumptions relating to projected future metal prices. The prices used reflect organizational consensus pricing views and opinions in the financial modeling for the Oyu Tolgoi mine and are subjective in nature. It should be expected that actual prices will be different than the prices used for such modeling (either higher or lower), and the differences could be significant; and Assumptions relating to the costs and availability of treatment and refining services for the metals mined from the Oyu Tolgoi mine, which require arrangements with third parties and involve the potential for fluctuating costs to transport the metals and fluctuating costs and availability of refining services. These costs can be significantly impacted by a variety of industry-specific and also regional and global economic factors (including, among others, those which affect commodity prices). Many of these factors are beyond the Company's control. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking information or statements. By their nature, forwardlooking statements involve numerous assumptions, inherent risks and uncertainties, both general and specific, which contribute to the possibility that the predicted outcomes will not occur. Events or circumstances could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those estimated or projected and expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ from these forward-looking statements are included in the \"Risk Factors\" section of the MD&A. Readers are further cautioned that the list of factors enumerated in the \"Risk Factors\" section of the MD&A that may affect future results is not exhaustive. When relying on the Company's forward-looking information and statements to make decisions with respect to the Company, investors and others should carefully consider the foregoing factors and other uncertainties and potential events. Furthermore, the forward-looking information and statements contained in the MD&A are made as of the date of this document and the Company does not undertake any obligation to update or to revise any of the included forward-looking information or statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law. The forward-looking information and statements contained in the MD&A are expressly qualified by this cautionary statement."}, {"title": "AJX AgJunction earns $523,745 (U.S.) in Q1 2015", "article": "AgJunction Inc (TSX:AJX) Shares Issued 72,322,063 Last Close 5/12/2015 $0.67 Tuesday May 12 2015 - News Release Mr. Wes Dittmer reports AGJUNCTION REPORTS 2015 Q1 RESULTS AgJunction Inc. has released financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2015. All currency amounts are expressed in U.S. dollars. Novariant merger In a press release dated March 16, 2015, AgJunction Inc. and Novariant Inc. announced that they had entered into an agreement, under which AgJunction would acquire Novariant through a merger transaction. Complete details of the terms of the transaction are set out in the agreement filed by AgJunction under its profile on SEDAR on March 26, 2015. Novariant is a premier provider of advanced steering solutions for precision agriculture. Based in Silicon Valley, Novariant's steering solutions are used today in over 60 countries. With approximately 55 employees worldwide, Novariant generated revenues of approximately $30-million in 2014. Combined, the two companies establish a pre-eminent position in automated steering and machine control technologies worldwide, combining product portfolios and OEM (original equipment manufacturing) customers and leveraging industry-leading intellectual property. As global machine manufacturers increasingly target the integration of auto-steer technologies at the factory level, the combined company will bring advanced levels of machine automation to both current and future OEM clients faster and at lower cost. Upon closing of the transaction, the combined company will have approximately 200 employees worldwide and will be headquartered at Novariant's corporate headquarters in Silicon Valley. The combined company plans to maintain additional offices in Kansas, Arizona, Canada and Australia. The transaction also brings changes at the board and management level, as outlined in the March 16, 2015, announcement. Completion of the transaction is expected late summer of 2015, subject to a number of conditions, including receipt of a permit from the California Commissioner of Corporations, approval of the shareholders of Novariant, approval of the shareholders of AgJunction and receipt of customary regulatory approvals, including the approval of the Toronto Stock Exchange. At transaction close, AgJunction shares will be issued to shareholders of Novariant in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of Novariant. After giving effect to the issuance of such AgJunction shares, AgJunction will have approximately 123.7 million fully diluted shares outstanding, of which approximately 49.5 million shares will be held by the former shareholders of Novariant, representing approximately 40 per cent of the combined company. After the transaction, directors, officers and other insiders will hold approximately 30.6 per cent of the combined company. Additional information in respect of the transaction will be forthcoming in the information circular, which will be provided to AgJunction shareholders in connection with the meeting to approve the transaction. This meeting is scheduled to occur by Aug. 31, 2015. First quarter financial review For the three months ended March 31, 2015, the company reported revenue of $12.1-million, a 19-per-cent decrease from $14.9-million in the first quarter of 2014. Lower revenue for the quarter relates largely to an overall downturn within the air product line. In the United States, net farm income has been declining since 2013, and, according to the February, 2015, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) report, a further decline of 32 per cent is forecast for 2015. Lower crop and livestock receipts are the main drivers of the 2015 decrease in net farm income. The rate of growth in U.S. farm assets is also forecast to slow in 2015 compared with recent years as a result of lower net income, leading to less capital investment and a slight decline in farmland values. \"Despite the near-term declines, we view the fundamentals of the global agriculture markets to be positive over the long term,\" said Rick Heiniger, president and chief executive officer. \"Global population growth, limited arable land and the need for increased output all contribute to a global need for a higher penetration of precision agriculture technologies such as global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and auto-steering. The momentum we are gaining within the OEM sector echoes this.\" Sales by business unit for the first quarter of March 31, 2015, and 2014 are shown in the attached table.  On March 31, 2015, AgJunction announced the sale of its agronomy services operations for $2.4-million in cash. All agronomy services business activities and related costs were transferred, effective April 1, 2015. Divesting the division is aligned with AgJunction's strategy to focus all of its resources on delivering the most accurate, innovative and reliable steering solutions. Sales by geographic region for the first quarter of March 31, 2015, and 2014 are shown in the attached table.  U.S. and Canadian combined revenues were down by 36 per cent from the first quarter of 2014, generally characterized with continuing softness in the aftermarket agricultural retail space. European revenues decreased 16 per cent due to order timing from OEM customers. Sales to Australia decreased 54 per cent due to the global downturn within the agricultural space compounded by a strengthening U.S. dollar. Sales to other markets, including South America and Asia, increased 114 per cent. Consolidated 2015 first quarter gross margin was $5.5-million, or 46 per cent of revenue, versus $6.9-million, or 46 per cent of revenue, in the first quarter of 2014. Total operating expenses fell by 11 per cent to $4.9-million, as compared with $5.5-million in the first quarter of 2014, with the reduction primarily related to several cost-saving initiatives and efficiencies realized through the restructuring period that began in late 2012. For the first quarter ended March 31, 2015, the company reported net income of $500,000, or one cent per share (basic and diluted), compared with net income of $1.3-million, or two cents per share (basic and diluted), in the first quarter of 2014. At the end of the first quarter of 2015, the company held cash of $10.8-million compared with $11.2-million at the end of 2014. Working capital was $24.1-million, up from $22.4-million at Dec. 31, 2014. At March 31, 2015, AgJunction had 72,322,063 common shares outstanding.

The rate of growth in US farm assets is also forecast to slow in 2015 compared to recent years as a result of lower net income, leading to less capital investment and a slight decline in farmland values. \"Despite the near term declines, we view the fundamentals of the global agriculture markets to be positive over the long term,\" said Rick Heiniger, President and CEO. \"Global population growth, limited arable land, and the need for increased output all contribute to a global need for a higher penetration of precision agriculture technologies such as Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and auto-steering. The momentum we are gaining within the OEM sector echoes this.\" Sales by business unit for the first quarter of March 31, 2015 and 2014 are as follows:  On March 31, 2015, AgJunction announced the sale of its Agronomy Services operations for $2.4 million in cash. All Agronomy Services business activities and related costs were transferred effective April 1, 2015. Divesting the division is aligned with AgJunction's strategy to focus all of its resources on delivering the most accurate, innovative and reliable steering solutions. Sales by geographic region for the first quarter of March 31, 2015 and 2014 are as follows:  United States and Canadian combined revenues were down by 36% from the first quarter of 2014 generally characterized with ongoing softness in the aftermarket agricultural retail space. European revenues decreased 16% due to order timing from OEM customers. Sales to Australia decreased 54% due to the global downturn within the agricultural space compounded by a strengthening US dollar. Sales to other markets, including South America and Asia, increased 114%. Consolidated Q1 2015 gross margin was $5.5 million, or 46% of revenue, versus $6.9 million, or 46% of revenue, in Q1 2014. Total operating expenses fell by 11% to $4.9 million, as compared to $5.5 million in the first quarter of 2014 with the reduction primarily related to several cost saving initiatives and efficiencies realized through the restructuring period that began in late 2012. For the first quarter ended March 31, 2015, the Company reported net income of $0.5 million, or $0.01 per share (basic and diluted), compared to net income of $1.3 million, or $0.02 per share (basic and diluted), in the first quarter of 2014. At the end of the first quarter of 2015, the Company held cash of $10.8 million compared to $11.2 million at the end of 2014. Working capital was $24.1 million, up from $22.4 million at December 31, 2014. At March 31, 2015, AgJunction had 72,322,063 common shares outstanding.

So when it comes to the ag-biotech sector, Saskatchewan and Israel are a natural fit. Israel's knowledge and innovation in agriculture and irrigation is world-renowned, Konecsni said. \"Israel is almost self-sufficient in food and they are living in a desert.\" To help foster that relationship, Innovation Saskatchewan, the Canada-Israel Industrial R & D Foundation (CIIRDF) and the Embassy of Israel in Canada co-hosted the first Saskatchewan-Israel Agritech Roundtable event in Saskatoon on Wednesday. The roundtable brought together a delegation of 10 Israeli technology companies and scientists, and leaders from more than 30 innovation-based organizations across Saskatchewan. It is the first milestone of the new Saskatchewan-Israel R & D Collaboration Program that was signed last year. The program's aim is to facilitate bilateral research that increases the research and technology development capabilities of Saskatchewan and Israel in plant and seed biology, digital agriculture and soil science. \"It's purpose is to develop meaningful research and commercial partnerships,\" Konecsni said. Israel's Ambassador to Canada, Rafael Barak, attended the event. \"As an ambassador my main task is to make this percolate,\" Barak said, \"to help make these connections between people.\" Barak said both countries have agriculture expertise and with co-operation both sides will come out ahead. \"And there is no better place to develop this relationship than Saskatchewan.\" Barak foresees five or six co-operative programs getting a start at this event. \"Hopefully in one year we will have something concrete up and running,\" he said. The Saskatchewan-Israel R & D Collaboration Program enables the joint development and commercialization of new technologies in areas of shared expertise including agriculture, clean tech, minerals, nuclear R & D and energy. Henri Rothschild, president of the Canada-Israel Industrial R & D Foundation, which manages the program, said partnerships could come in a number of different forms. \"It could be creating a consortium that would involve several companies and several academics on both sides,\" he said. For example, he said Israel has applications of information technology that can identify the best genetic features that should be included in new plants and new crops. And Saskatchewan has a wealth of research, experience and infrastructure in applying this research. Konecsni said the first step is to show Israeli companies and academics the wealth of knowledge and facilities that Saskatchewan has to offer, such as having the Canadian Light Source Synchrotron and the Sylvia Fedoruk Centre on the same campus. \"There aren't many places that have a synchrotron 200 metres from a place that is producing radio isotopes,\" he said.

(TSX:AGU) (NYSE:AGU) announced today its 2015 first quarter earnings results, with net earnings of $14-million ($0.08 diluted earnings per share) this quarter compared to $3-million ($0.02 diluted earnings per share) in the first quarter of 2014. The higher earnings were supported by strong margins and operating rates for nitrogen products in Wholesale, while some first quarter Retail earnings were pushed into the second quarter as a result of the delayed start to the spring season in the U.S. this year. Highlights:  Agrium's Board of Directors also announced today it has approved an increase to Agrium's dividend by 12 percent, or $0.38 U.S. per common share to a total dividend of $3.50 U.S. per common share on an annualized basis. Based on the closing price of Agrium's shares on the NYSE on Tuesday, May 5, 2015, this represents a dividend yield of 3.4 percent. The increased dividend is expected to be paid in quarterly installments of $0.875 U.S. and the next $0.875 U.S. per common share dividend has been declared by the Board of Directors and will be paid on July 16, 2015 to shareholders of record on June 30, 2015.(2) \"Agrium's first quarter results were impacted by a late start to the spring season in the U.S. this year. All indications are that Agrium will deliver strong second quarter results on solid crop input demand now that the spring application season is fully underway and given we have made excellent progress ramping up production from our expanded potash facility over the past month. We continue to position our operations and asset mix to support higher cash flow and capital returns over time irrespective of any short term headwinds. The increase in the dividend and recent share buy-back activity demonstrates our commitment to this strategy and to our shareholders,\" commented Chuck Magro, Agrium's President and CEO.  ADJUSTED NET EARNINGS RECONCILIATION  UPDATED 2015 ANNUAL GUIDANCE Based on our Market Outlook, Agrium expects to achieve annual diluted earnings per share of $7.00 to $8.25 in 2015 compared to our previous estimate of $7.00 to $8.50 per share. We have narrowed the guidance range primarily based on the impact of higher Chinese urea exports on global urea prices, margin pressure on seed sales and the expected impact on crop input expenditures associated with a reduction in U.S. corn acres this year. We are issuing earnings guidance of $4.75 to $5.25 diluted earnings per share for the first half of 2015 indicative of a strong spring season despite earlier weather related delays. We have reduced our estimate of nitrogen production tonnes to reflect our plan to dispose of our West Sacramento upgrade facility announced subsequent to March 31, 2015. Our estimate is now 3.5 million to 3.7 million tonnes for the year as all other facilities are in line with our previously disclosed production range. Our Retail EBITDA(3) for 2015 is now expected to be from $1.15-billion to $1.22 billion. The slight narrowing of the range from our previous estimate is due to some seed margin pressure this year, a reduction in U.S. corn acres and a slightly lower fertilizer pricing environment in 2015. We have updated our finance costs range for 2015 to $230-million to $250-million to reflect the incremental interest expense related to our $1-billion bond issuance in February 2015. Our estimates of the Canada/U.S. foreign exchange rate and NYMEX for 2015 have been narrowed from our original estimates based on current market conditions. This guidance and updated additional measures and related assumptions are summarized in the table on page 3. Guidance excludes the impact of share-based payments expense (recovery), gains (losses) on foreign exchange and non-qualifying derivative hedges. Volumetric and earnings estimates assume normal seasonal growing and harvest patterns in the geographies where Agrium operates.(4) (1) Represents diluted per share information attributable to equity holders of Agrium.

In respect of Forward-Looking Statements, please refer to the section entitled \"Forward-Looking Statements\" after the \"Market Outlook\" section of this MD&A. 2015 First Quarter Operating Results CONSOLIDATED NET EARNINGS Agrium's 2015 first quarter net earnings from continuing operations were $14-million or $0.08 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations compared to net earnings from continuing operations of $12-million or $0.08 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the same quarter of 2014.  Sales Retail sales increased by $31-million for the first quarter of 2015 compared to the same period last year primarily due to higher sales volumes for crop protection products in the U.S. and Australia and slightly higher sales for crop nutrients and seed. Wholesale sales for the first quarter of 2015 decreased compared to 2014 as a result of lower potash sales volumes attributable to lower opening inventory and lower production volumes associated with the start-up of the Vanscoy expansion project. Product purchased for resale had lower sales as a result of the strategic review in 2014 that lead to exiting portions of this business, but contributed higher gross profit during the quarter. Gross Profit Our gross profit for the first quarter of 2015 increased by $28-million compared to the first quarter of 2014. The main drivers of this variance consisted of:  Expenses General and administrative expenses decreased in the first quarter of 2015 compared to the same period last year as we began to realize reductions related to our Operational Excellence program. Share-based payments Due to a larger share price increase and stronger share performance relative to our peers during the current quarter, our share-based payments increased by $14-million compared to the same period last year. The Board of Directors approved changes to our share-based payment plan effective January 1, 2015. Refer to note 6 of our Summarized Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. Other Expenses (Income)  In the first quarter of 2015, we began to designate all of our natural gas derivatives as qualifying hedges for accounting purposes. During 2014, we designated only certain longer-term derivatives as hedges, none of which settled in 2014. We now record all gains and losses from these natural gas derivatives initially to equity, and subsequently to cost of product sold when we sell the related product. Previously, we recorded these natural gas derivative gains and losses to other expenses, resulting in the change in 2015 compared to 2014, which included natural gas derivative gains of $32-million. In the first quarter of 2015, we completed the sale of our Niota and Meredosia storage and distribution facilities resulting in a gain on sale of assets of $38-million. We also announced our intention to divest the West Sacramento nitrogen upgrade facility which will reduce capital cost, working capital and is not expected to impact net earnings. 5 May 2015 19:41 ET Press Release: Agrium's First Quarter Affected by -3- Environmental remediation and asset retirement obligation expense increased by $11-million due to an increase in our environmental remediation provision for our phosphate legacy sites. Effective Tax Rate The effective tax rate on continuing operations was 26 percent for the first quarter of 2015 compared to 29 percent for the same period last year due to an increase in income earned from low tax jurisdictions. BUSINESS SEGMENT PERFORMANCE Retail Retail reported first quarter sales of $2.3-billion, which is slightly above the $2.2-billion reported in the same quarter last year. Gross profit was $371-million in the first quarter of 2015, down from $387-million in last year's first quarter. Retail reported an EBITDA loss of $8-million compared to earnings of $17-million in the first quarter of last year. Retail's results were impacted by a late start to the spring season in the eastern and southern U.S., which has pushed North American earnings into the second quarter. International sales and gross profit were down in the current quarter as a result of lower merchandise sales and nutrient margins in Australia and weaker crop protection sales in South America. The first quarter saw a similar split between North American and International gross profit as the same period last year. Total crop nutrient sales were $911-million this quarter, up slightly from $896-million in the first quarter of 2014. A 3 percent increase in total sales volumes was partially offset by marginally lower nutrient prices in the first quarter. Higher nutrient volumes were due to strong demand in the Western U.S. and from tuck-in acquisitions over the past year. Gross profit for crop nutrients was $126-million this quarter, down marginally compared to the $128-million reported in the first quarter of 2014, while per tonne margins also declined slightly from $70 per tonne in the first quarter of 2014 to $67 per tonne this quarter. The slight reduction in margins was due to the stronger relative growth in volumes in lower margin international and Canadian markets, while nutrient margins in the U.S. were up year-over-year. Crop protection product sales were $793-million in the first quarter of 2015, compared to $730-million in the same period last year. The higher sales were attributable to increased volumes, primarily of lower margin glyphosate used for early weed control in areas where it was too wet to till. Gross profit was $108-million this quarter, compared to $105-million reported in the first quarter of 2014. Crop protection margins as a percentage of sales were 13.6 percent this quarter compared to 14.4 percent in the same period of 2014 due to a shift in sales mix to lower margin products, as well as a higher relative percentage of sales in lower margin regions such as Canada due to application delays in certain regions of the U.S. Seed sales were $308-million in the first quarter of 2015, up slightly from $298-million reported in the first quarter of last year. The increase in sales was driven by a slight increase in volumes in the U.S. this quarter as farmers prepared in advance for the spring season. This was partly offset by lower sales in Canada due to timing of purchases and the impact of the lower Canadian dollar compared to the same period last year. Gross profit was $40-million this quarter compared to $46-million for the same period last year, as competitive sales and crop mix shift impacted margins. Planted acres of corn are expected to be lower in 2015 compared to last year, and the spring delays have mainly impacted corn growing regions. These factors caused a lower percentage of higher-margin corn seed sales in the first quarter. As a result, seed margins as a percentage of sales were 13.0 percent in the first quarter of 2015, a reduction from the 15.4 percent reported in the first quarter of 2014. Sales of merchandise in the first quarter of 2015 were $142-million, compared to $186-million in the same period last year. Gross profit for this product line was $20-million this quarter, down slightly from $24-million in the first quarter of 2014. Merchandise results were impacted by lower demand and selling price for fuel in Western Canada, as well as decreased demand for fencing and water equipment in Australia. Services and other sales were $109-million this quarter, compared to the $122-million reported in the first quarter of 2014. Gross profit was $77-million in the first quarter of 2015, compared to $84-million for the same period last year. These decreases were largely due to a later than usual start to the spring application season across much of the eastern and southern U.S. and the timing of livestock shipments in Australia. Selling expenses as a percentage of sales were 18.7 percent in the first quarter of 2015 which is down from the 19.5 percent reported in the same period last year stemming from operational excellence initiatives and from the lower Canadian dollar. Retail selling expenses were $423-million for the first quarter, compared to $436-million in the same period last year. This variance was due to lower employee-related costs and the overall improvement in the cost structure of Australia, lower fuel costs for rolling stock expenses and lower depreciation charges. Wholesale Wholesale's 2015 first quarter sales were $867-million, down from the $1.1-billion reported in the same quarter last year primarily due to lower potash sales volumes and a decision to reduce the low-margin purchase for resale business. Gross profit was $234-million this quarter, compared to $171-million in the first quarter of 2014. Wholesale Adjusted EBITDA was $286-million in the first quarter of 2015 compared to $237-million reported in the same period last year. The increase in earnings was primarily due to significantly lower cost of production for our nitrogen and phosphate facilities, as a result of lower natural gas costs, improved operating rates and efficiencies and the impact of a weaker Canadian dollar on related fixed costs. Nitrogen gross profit for the first quarter of 2015 was $143-million compared to $90-million in the same quarter last year. Nitrogen production in the quarter was about 5 percent higher than the same quarter last year due to higher operating rates. Sales volumes were 761,000 tonnes, a slight decrease from the 792,000 tonnes in the same quarter last year due to lower opening inventories in the current period. Overall realized nitrogen sales prices were $414 per tonne, a $10 per tonne decrease from the same period in 2014. The decrease was due to lower urea benchmark prices, as record Chinese global urea exports in the first quarter of 2015 contributed to weakened international prices. Nitrogen cost of product sold was $226 per tonne this quarter, compared to $311 per tonne for the same period last year. The decrease was a result of significantly lower natural gas costs, a weaker Canadian dollar which lowered production costs reported in U.S. dollars and stronger operating rates and efficiencies. Average nitrogen gross margins were $188 per tonne this quarter, compared to $113 per tonne in the same period last year. As of January 1, 2015, we have designated all of our natural gas derivatives as hedges(1) , with realized gains and losses now recorded to cost of product sold (which also includes transportation and administration costs). Nitrogen cost of product sold for the first quarter of 2014 would have been $288 per tonne if realized gains from natural gas derivatives had been applied on a comparative basis. Agrium's average natural gas cost was $2.93/MMBtu this quarter ($2.52/MMBtu excluding the impact of realized losses on natural gas derivatives) compared to $4.29/MMBtu ($5.02/MMBtu excluding the impact of realized gains on natural gas derivatives) for the same period in 2014. The average U.S. benchmark (NYMEX) natural gas price for the first quarter of 2015 was $2.96/MMBtu, compared to $4.90/MMBtu in the same quarter last year. The AECO (Alberta) basis differential was a $0.74/MMBtu discount to NYMEX in the first quarter of 2015, an increase from the $0.56/MMBtu discount in the first quarter of 2014. Potash gross profit for the first quarter of 2015 was $7-million, compared to $46-million reported in the same quarter last year. Sales volumes were 185,000 tonnes this quarter compared to 428,000 tonnes in the first quarter of 2014. The decrease in sales volumes was a result of the initial ramp-up of production volumes in the quarter after completing the tie-in of the Vanscoy one million tonne expansion project in December of 2014 and very low opening inventory in 2015. Average realized potash sales prices were $361 per tonne compared to $298 per tonne in the same period last year. Both North America and international realized sales prices were 10 to15 percent higher than the same period last year combined with a higher proportion of our sales this quarter sold into the North American market. Gross margin per tonne was impacted by higher costs related to the ramp-up of production, which were allocated over lower sales volumes. This was partially offset by the impact of a weaker Canadian dollar on fixed costs in the current period compared to the same period last year. Phosphate gross profit was $45-million in the first quarter of 2015, compared to $2-million in the same quarter last year. Phosphate sales volumes were 282,000 tonnes in the first quarter of 2015, compared to 308,000 tonnes in the same quarter last year. Realized phosphate sales prices were $639 per tonne this quarter compared to $544 per tonne in the same period last year, due to strong market conditions and tight supply. Phosphate cost of product sold was $481 per tonne in the first quarter of 2015, a decrease of $55 per tonne compared to the same period last year as a result of higher production rates, lower ammonia and rock costs, fixed cost savings and the impact of the weaker Canadian dollar on fixed costs. Gross margin in the first quarter of 2015 was $158 per tonne compared to $8 per tonne in the same period last year. 5 May 2015 19:41 ET Press Release: Agrium's First Quarter Affected by -4- Wholesale's Other, which includes product purchased for resale, ammonium sulfate, Environmentally Smart Nitrogen (\"ESN(R)\", hereinafter referred to as \"ESN\") and other gross profit was $39-million this quarter compared to $33-million in the same quarter of 2014. Ammonium sulfate gross profit was $16-million this quarter, $4-million higher than same period last year due to higher realized sales prices and lower input costs. ESN gross profit was $12-million compared to $10-million in the first quarter of 2014. This increase was due to higher volumes and lower ammonia input costs partially offset by lower realized sales prices for ESN in the current quarter. Product purchased for resale gross profit for the first quarter was $3-million higher than the same period last year due to higher margins in the current period. Wholesale expenses in the first quarter of 2015 were $9-million higher compared to the same period last year. The increase was related primarily to the $32-million gain from natural gas derivatives in the first quarter of 2014 and recorded in other expenses, and an $11-million increase in environmental remediation estimates. This was largely offset by a $38-million gain on the sale of non-core Purchase for Resale terminals this quarter.  Other EBITDA for our Other non-operating business unit for the first quarter of 2015 was a net expense of $88-million, compared to a net expense of $68-million for the first quarter of 2014. The increase was due to the following:  FINANCIAL CONDITION The following are changes to working capital on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for the three-month period ended March 31, 2015 compared to December 31, 2014.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Summary of Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Below is a summary of our cash provided by or used in operating, investing, and financing activities as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:  Analysis of cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2015 Cash flows provided by operating activities decreased due to a smaller growth in accounts payable during the first quarter of 2015 compared to the first quarter of 2014 as a result of softer market conditions and outlook on fertilizer pricing. 5 May 2015 19:41 ET Press Release: Agrium's First Quarter Affected by -5- Other key changes in our cash flows in the first quarter of 2015 were capital expenditures and financing. We incurred capital expenditures of $318-million for our Vanscoy potash facility ramp-up and our Borger nitrogen expansion project and we repaid short-term debt of $1.2-billion primarily from the proceeds of the issuance of $1-billion of debentures. Dividend payments were $109-million for the three months ended March 31, 2015.  Our investing capital expenditures decreased in the first three months of 2015 compared to the first three months of 2014 due to the completion of the tie-in of our Vanscoy potash facility expansion in the fourth quarter of 2014, partially offset by increased expenditures relating to the Borger nitrogen expansion project. We incurred investing capital expenditures amounting to $197-million and $121-million for the Vanscoy facility ramp-up and the expansion of the Borger nitrogen facility, respectively. We expect the remaining capital spending to approximate $900-million to $1-billion in 2015. Short-term Debt Our short-term debt of $265-million at March 31, 2015 is outlined in note 5 of our Summarized Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our short-term debt decreased by $1.3-billion during the three months ended March 31, 2015, which primarily increased our unutilized short-term financing capacity to $2.6-billion as at March 31, 2015. Capital Management During the quarter, we issued $550-million of 3.375 percent debentures due March 15, 2025 and $450-million of 4.125 percent debentures due March 15, 2035. The debentures were issued under our base shelf prospectus, which permits issuance in Canada and the U.S. of up to $2.5-billion of common shares, debt and other securities less the offering price of securities issued between the 2014 filing date of the base shelf prospectus and May 2016. Issuance of further securities under the base shelf prospectus requires filing a prospectus supplement and is subject to availability of funding in capital markets. Our revolving credit facilities require that we maintain specific interest coverage and debt-to-capital ratios, as well as other non-financial covenants as defined in our credit agreements. We were in compliance with all covenants at March 31, 2015. NORMAL COURSE ISSUER BID On January 22, 2015, the Toronto Stock Exchange (\"TSX\") accepted Agrium's notice of intention to make a normal course issuer bid (\"NCIB\") whereby Agrium may purchase up to 7,185,866 common shares on the TSX and New York Stock Exchange during the period from January 26, 2015 to January 25, 2016. From April 1, 2015 to May 5, 2015, we purchased approximately 712,000 shares at an average share price of $105 for total consideration of $75-million. There were no share repurchases during the three months ended March 31, 2015. Shareholders can obtain a copy of the NCIB notice submitted to the TSX from Agrium without charge upon request. OUTSTANDING SHARE DATA Agrium had 143,029,081 outstanding shares at May 5, 2015. At that date, under our stock option plans, shares expected to be issued for options outstanding were negligible.  The agricultural products business is seasonal in nature. Consequently, comparisons made on a year-over-year basis are more appropriate than quarter-over-quarter comparisons. Crop input sales are primarily concentrated in the spring and fall crop input application seasons. Crop nutrient inventories are normally accumulated leading up to each application season. Our cash collections generally occur after the application season is complete. ADDITIONAL IFRS AND NON-IFRS FINANCIAL MEASURES Certain financial measures in this MD&A are not prescribed by IFRS. We consider these financial measures discussed herein to provide useful information to both management and investors in measuring our financial performance and financial condition. In general, an additional IFRS financial measure is a measure relevant to understanding a company's financial performance that is not a minimum financial statement measure mandated by IFRS. A non-IFRS financial measure generally either excludes or includes amounts not excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS. Non-IFRS financial measures are not recognized measures under IFRS and our method of calculation is unlikely to be directly comparable to that of other companies. These non-IFRS measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. The following table outlines our additional IFRS financial measure, its definition and how management assesses such measure.  The following table outlines our non-IFRS financial measures, their definitions and usefulness, and how management assesses each measure.  5 May 2015 19:41 ET Press Release: Agrium's First Quarter Affected by -6-  RECONCILIATIONS OF ADDITIONAL IFRS AND NON-IFRS FINANCIAL MEASURES  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES We prepare our financial statements in accordance with IFRS, which requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates in applying accounting policies. For further information on the Company's critical accounting estimates, refer to the section \"Critical Accounting Estimates\" in our 2014 annual MD&A, which is contained in our 2014 Annual Report. Since the date of our 2014 annual MD&A, there have not been any material changes to our critical accounting estimates. CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES The accounting policies applied in our Consolidated Interim Financial Statements for the three months ended March 31, 2015 are the same as those applied in our audited annual financial statements in our 2014 Annual Report, with the exception of changes in accounting estimates described in note 9 of our Summarized Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the three months ended March 31, 2015. BUSINESS RISKS The information presented in the \"Enterprise Risk Management\" section on pages 64 - 68 in our 2014 Annual Report and under the heading \"Risk Factors\" on pages 22 - 31 in our 2014 Annual Information Form has not changed materially since December 31, 2014. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended March 31, 2015 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PUBLIC SECURITIES FILINGS MARKET OUTLOOK Record global crop production in 2014 and a sizeable Southern Hemisphere crop this year has weighed on international crop prices. The start of the spring application season in North America was delayed due to wet weather across the southern and eastern United States but seeding rates started to catch up in late April, and as of early May, were above the historical average. Drier conditions in the Northern Plains and Western Canada are expected to support strong seeded acreage and related crop input demand in these regions this year compared to recent history. This is particularly important for our Wholesale nitrogen sales and Canadian Retail operations. California is in a drought situation, which is expected to reduce acreage of some row crops this year, but high fruit and vegetable prices have supported crop input demand. U.S. corn acreage expectations have decreased slightly over the past month as a result of the delayed spring season in the Southern and Eastern U.S. If U.S. crop yields come in at or below trend levels this year we expect crop prices to firm up in the second half of 2015. The late start to the season in the Southern and Eastern U.S., combined with lower crop prices, resulted in delays in decisions regarding seeding and crop protection product use, pushing sales into the second quarter. Some growers have been more discerning regarding genetic traits and in some cases have selected older, lower-priced varieties. The later planting season is expected to support demand for retail services in the second quarter as growers focus on getting the crop inputs in place in a compressed season. Global crop nutrient demand was relatively strong in late 2014 and early 2015 as buyers purchased product ahead of the Northern Hemisphere spring season. This led to comfortable inventory levels heading into the spring season and has contributed to recent weakness in global nutrient pricing. The significant decline in the value of most non-U.S. currencies relative to the U.S. dollar has lowered the cost of production for many non-U.S. producers and raised the cost of crop inputs in some local currencies. However, overall the lower currencies have been a net benefit for growers in these regions due to higher crop prices in local currencies. China exported just over four million tonnes of urea in the first quarter of 2015, more than double the volume exported in the same period of 2014. Exports were supported by strong import demand from the United States and India. Ukrainian urea production and exports increased over the past few months, further adding prilled urea supplies to global trade. In recent weeks, Chinese nitrogen producers have resisted further price declines, indicating that urea prices are near the cost-based floor level and that the pace of Chinese exports is expected to slow relative to 2014 levels in the coming months. The delay in concluding Chinese and Indian potash supply agreements resulted in other potash buyers postponing purchases which pressured global potash prices in the first quarter of 2015. The North American potash market was also impacted by the delayed spring and higher offshore potash imports this year. Global phosphate demand has slowed in recent weeks, which has put some pressure on international and domestic pricing. Brazilian phosphate demand has begun relatively slow in 2015, but domestic deliveries improved in March and the import pace is expected to increase in the coming months. Analysts expect that Indian potash and phosphate demand will increase again in 2015.

Summarized Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the three months ended March 31, 2015 (Millions of U.S. dollars, unless otherwise stated) (Unaudited) 1. Corporate Information Corporate information Agrium Inc. (\"Agrium\") is incorporated under the laws of Canada with common shares listed under the symbol \"AGU\" on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX). Our Corporate head office is located at 13131 Lake Fraser Drive S.E., Calgary, Canada. We conduct our operations globally from our Wholesale head office in Calgary and our Retail head office in Loveland, Colorado, United States. In these financial statements, \"we\", \"us\", \"our\" and \"Agrium\" mean Agrium Inc., its subsidiaries and joint arrangements. Agrium operates two business units:  Additional information on our operating segments is included in note 2. Seasonality in our business results from increased demand for our products during planting seasons. Sales are generally higher in spring and fall. Basis of preparation and statement of compliance 2.Operating Segments  5 May 2015 19:41 ET Press Release: Agrium's First Quarter Affected by -11-  5 May 2015 19:41 ET Press Release: Agrium's First Quarter Affected by -12-  5 May 2015 19:41 ET Press Release: Agrium's First Quarter Affected by -13-  During the three months ended March 31, 2015, we issued $550-million of 3.375 percent debentures and $450-million of 4.125 percent debentures due March 2025 and March 2035, respectively. The debentures were issued under our base shelf prospectus, which permits issuance in Canada and the United States of common shares, debt and other securities up to $2.5-billion, less the offering price of securities issued between the 2014 filing date of the base shelf prospectus and May 2016. Issuance of further securities under the base shelf prospectus requires filing a prospectus supplement and is subject to the availability of funding in capital markets. 6. Share-based Payments In December 2014, the Board of Directors approved changes to the Stock Option Plan applicable to awards granted subsequent to January 1, 2015. Share-based payments granted to officers in Canada will consist of performance share units (\"PSUs\") and stock options without cash-settled tandem stock appreciation rights. The Stock Option Plan provides for settlement through the issuance of common shares. We determine the fair value of stock options on their grant date using the Black-Scholes model. Eligible non-officer employees will receive PSUs and restricted share units (\"RSUs\"). All PSU awards will include an additional performance metric based on free cash flow per share. RSU awards entitle the holder to receive the value of a common share plus accumulated dividends at the end of the three-year vesting period. We settle RSU awards in cash, with fair value determined using the Black-Scholes model. During the three months ended March 31, 2015, we recorded $45-million (2014 - $31-million) of share-based payments expense. We granted the following share-based compensation awards to officers and employees.  7. Financial Instruments Commodity price risk Natural gas derivative financial instruments outstanding (notional amounts in millions of MMBtu)  For our natural gas derivatives designated in hedging relationships, the underlying risk of the forward contracts is identical to the hedged risk, and accordingly we have established a hedge ratio of 1:1. Due to a strong correlation between AECO future contract prices and our delivered cost, we did not experience any ineffectiveness on our hedges, and accordingly we have recorded the full change in the fair value of natural gas forward contracts designated as hedges to other comprehensive income. Currency risk Foreign exchange derivative financial instruments outstanding (notional amounts in millions of U.S. dollars)  5 May 2015 19:41 ET Press Release: Agrium's First Quarter Affected by -14-  There have been no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements in the three months ended March 31, 2015 or March 31, 2014. We do not measure any of our financial instruments using Level 3 inputs. 8. Additional Information Property, plant and equipment At the end of 2014, we completed a major turnaround to tie in the expansion project at our Vanscoy potash facility. The assets related to the expansion project became available for use during the three months ended March 31, 2015 resulting in the transfer of $2.6-billion from assets under construction to buildings and improvements, and machinery and equipment. During the three months ended March 31, 2015, we added $197-million to assets under construction at our Vanscoy potash facility to facilitate the ramp-up of annual capacity by one million tonnes and $121-million to assets under construction at our Borger Nitrogen facility.  Normal course issuer bid In January 2015, the Toronto Stock Exchange accepted our Normal Course Issuer Bid (\"NCIB\"). Under the NCIB, we may purchase for cancellation up to 5 percent of our currently issued and outstanding common shares until January 25, 2016. The actual number of shares purchased will be at Agrium's discretion and will depend on market conditions, share prices, Agrium's cash position and other factors. From April 1, 2015 to May 5, 2015, we purchased 711,648 shares at an average share price of $105.39 for total consideration of $75-million. 9. Significant Accounting Policies Except as described below, the accounting policies applied in these interim financial statements are the same as those applied in our 2014 Annual Report. Changes in Accounting Estimates As at January 1, 2015, we changed the method of depreciation for the Vanscoy potash facility mining and milling assets from the straight-line basis to the units of production basis. These assets will be depreciated based on the shorter of estimates of reserves or service lives. The change in method of depreciation reflects our expectations of changes in the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits of the assets based on a review of our Vanscoy potash facility. In December 2014, the Vanscoy potash facility completed a major turnaround and recommenced production in an expanded facility that added approximately 50 percent to its existing capacity. The change in estimate is accounted for prospectively. The current and expected reduction in depreciation expense is 2015 - $32-million and 2016 - $12-million. As at January 1, 2015, based on a review of the expected timing of future expenditures, we revised our estimate for decommissioning costs of our nitrogen assets. The revision in estimate decreased our asset retirement obligation provision by $55-million and decreased our property, plant and equipment by $55-million. The current reduction in depreciation and accretion expense for the three months ended March 31, 2015 is $1-million. The expected reduction in depreciation and accretion expense is $4-million in each of the years 2015 through 2018. Investor/Media Relations: Agrium Inc.

PAUL, MN, April 27, 2015 /CNW/ - Thank you for your warm welcome. What a pleasure to be here in Minneapolis-St. Paul and to have this opportunity to talk about innovation exchange between Canada, Minnesota and the entire Upper Midwest region. But first, let me offer best wishes on behalf of all Canadians, who have such deep and enduring ties to this part of the United States. I myself am an example of this and have a number of fond memories of and connections to Minnesota and the Twin Cities. In fact, one of my formative experiences from my youth began right here in Minneapolis when I was in grade 9, or a freshman as you say here. I travelled here from my hometown in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, to take part in a tour that ended with a visit to the United Nations in New York. It was an early example of what I like to call \"the diplomacy of knowledge\" in action. But I'll come back to that theme later. Fast forward to another Minnesota connection: my later recruitment to Harvard by a man named Don Peddie, who lived here and worked for the Star Tribune. And then there's my old friend, Soo neighbour and hockey teammate Lou Nanne, whom you all know and who is so proud to call this city home. And rightly so--this is the State of Hockey, after all! These are just a few examples of the remarkable people-to-people ties that exist between Canadians and Americans in general, and Canadians and Minnesotans in particular. The same is true for the entire Upper Midwest region and the Canadian provinces of Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Ontario. These truly are the heartlands of our respective countries, so it's no exaggeration to say the quality of our relationship here goes a long way towards determining the quality of the overall Canada-U.S. relationship. Let me highlight a few specifics as to just how strong our relationship is. Let me talk about Canada and Minnesota. Without a doubt, this is a vitally important state for Canada. We have a shared border, shared waterways, a similar climate and environment. We have close energy ties, educational ties, agricultural ties and trade ties. Our histories and cultures are closely linked, to the extent that many Canadians think of Minnesota as the 11th province! Dare I say that many Minnesotans think of Canada as simply a natural extension of the state? Perhaps that has something to do with all the Lake Winnipeg walleye you eat here! Or the fact that you make your Cheerios with Canadian oats! But seriously, folks, let me talk about Canada-Minnesota trade for a moment. It exceeds a remarkable $20 billion annually, which means that Canada exports more to Minnesota than we do to the UK, Japan or Mexico. This is most impressive, given Canada's status as a trading nation. And Canada is by far Minnesota's largest export customer. We buy more Minnesota products than your next three largest foreign markets combined. Let me give just a few examples of our economic interdependence. Canadian Pacific, based in Calgary, Alberta, employs about 1,300 people in this state and has its U.S. headquarters in this city. The Mosaic Company, headquartered in Plymouth, owns one of the largest potash mines in Saskatchewan--and that's saying something! RBC Wealth Management, from Toronto, has its American headquarters in this city, and in fact my friend, Lou Nanne, who I mentioned earlier, is a leader with RBC. I'm so pleased that its president, John Taft, is with us today. Toronto-based Thomson Reuters employs almost 6,700 Minnesotans in Eagan. That's a truly impressive number of jobs. I could go on. So, with all this good and encouraging news, where do we go from here? I think the answer is simple: we go further. Let me rephrase: we must go further. By that I mean, we have to look at our relationship and reflect on what's working well and what needs work, and move towards an even broader, more vigorous engagement. If you remember anything of what I say today, remember this: I'd like all of you to think of my visit to Minnesota as a threshold moment, or to use another vigorous metaphor: a trampoline opportunity. Let this mark the beginning of an even richer and more dynamic phase in the relationship between Canada and Minnesota and the Upper Midwest states. It's so important that we succeed in strengthening our ties in this part of the continent. Why? Because it's becoming increasingly clear that regions will be key factors in our well-being and prosperity in the years to come. Indeed they already are. Why are regions important? They're important because in spite of our ability to communicate instantaneously around the world, talent and capital still need a place to call home. And they still tend to gather in clusters, or \"innovation ecosystems,\" as they're sometimes called. Creating these kinds of innovation clusters can lead to all kind of good things, economically and socially. Without a doubt, the Upper Midwest and its Canadian neighbours share geographical and climatic features that make for a regional ecosystem in the environmental sense. So why not conceive of this as an ecosystem when it comes to learning and innovating and prospering together? I want to return now to something I mentioned earlier: the concept of \"the diplomacy of knowledge.\" I had a taste of it with a group of high school students catching the bus in Minneapolis and heading off to visit the United Nations for one week. That trip was eye-opening, and I learned a lot--the same way a kid from the States would learn a lot about Canada on a visit to northern Ontario! What is the diplomacy of knowledge? Well, it's just a way of saying how we stand to gain so much when we form partnerships in learning, in innovation, in business and culture and society. It's about our ability and our willingness to work together, across disciplines and across borders, to share knowledge, expertise and resources to improve our lives. There are of course many great examples of how this is occurring already. In fact, just this morning, I participated in a discussion at the University of Minnesota on teaching and research partnerships between Canadian and American schools. What is true of Canada and the Upper Midwest in learning is true of Canada and the United States as a whole. Almost 30,000 Canadians are studying in American schools, while about 12,000 American students were studying in Canada at last count. This is one of the statistics I really love, because each of those students will have a lifelong connection to their host country--just as I have. It certainly worked that way for me, and for many members of my family. Let me share another number, on academic publishing. This is an area where Canadians are very strong partners. Almost half of the science and engineering articles published by Canadians are internationally co-authored, and by far our most common partners on these papers are U.S. researchers. There are many reasons why Canadians are such great collaborators in learning and innovation, but I'll just list four of them: First, Canadians believe deeply in the value of working together and learning from one another. We came to this belief early and out of necessity: as in Minnesota and the Upper Midwest, our climate and geography can be challenging, to say the least. The first Europeans were wholly dependent on their willingness to work together and to learn from Aboriginal peoples. Second, Canada has tried to make quality education more affordable to all. Because of this, generations of Canadians have had a better chance of overcoming barriers such as discrimination, poverty and social immobility. We have tried to ensure a level playing field, and I know that this is something people here care about, too. This is, after all, the home of the fabled Minnesota Miracle! The third characteristic that Canada possesses that makes it a great partner in learning is our success in combining accessible education and excellence. It's not a case of \"either/or,\" but rather of \"both/and.\" Fourth, new Canadians are encouraged to retain and celebrate their culture and language, while embracing the values of Canada. This approach fosters social harmony and makes our country more outward-looking and global. Fundamentally, Canada's approach is an inclusive one. It's not perfect, of course, and we struggle to reconcile our differences like any other society. But most Canadians are remarkably open and willing to work across borders, cultures and disciplines, and that includes when looking south to our American friends and neighbours. Later this afternoon, I'll be taking part in another discussion, this one on Canada-U.S. agricultural innovation. I'm looking forward to this discussion, because I know how important agriculture and agricultural innovation are to both of our countries. The Midwest, together with the Canadian prairie provinces to Minnesota's immediate north, is among the most productive agricultural regions in the world. In this sphere as well, we are trading and collaborating. In 2013, Minnesota-Canada bilateral trade in agriculture reached about $2.1 billion, and Canada is the top market for this state's agriculture and agri-food exports. Despite this great record, we must do more to innovate in order to meet the pressures of growing populations and finite land and resources. We have a great deal to gain from working together on this. This region is emerging as a national hub for agricultural innovation. I'm aware of the research, development and investment being done in areas including crop genetics, animal science, precision agriculture and bioscience. This is creating the potential for breakthroughs in food security and safety, energy independence and resource preservation. Let me tell you that Canada can be a strong partner for this region. From Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada's world-class research centres in places like Saskatoon, Lethbridge and Winnipeg, to the multitude of agriculture-focused venture capital firms popping up across the country, Canada rivals the Upper Midwest in its dedication to agricultural innovation. Together, we can achieve so much. Joint efforts between Canada and the Upper Midwest would help people in this region and increase North American competitiveness overall. I am encouraged by the idea of an innovation \"corridor\" connecting the Upper Midwest and Canada. That's the kind of imagination and initiative we need in order to create a true regional innovation ecosystem. I say imagination because a region is much more than simply a geographic or political entity. A region is a social construct that requires people to think, feel and act in a shared way. And to be frank, I think that's a bit of a challenge for both Canadians and Americans, not only because we're separated by an international boundary line, but because we still tend to imagine our countries in terms of an east-west orientation rather than a north-south one. In this case, we need to think north-south, and we need to act on it. One major reason why we need to act is because we live in a dynamic, rapidly changing world and we need to compete. To give just one example I've seen from my international visits as governor general, southeast Asia is thinking in north-south terms with the building of a high-speed rail network running from Hong Kong all the way down to Indonesia, with tunnels connecting Malaysia and Indonesia--a 21st century Silk Road. It's expected that this extensive rail network will transform the politics, culture and economy of Asia in a manner similar to the interstate highway system's effect on the United States in the mid-20th century. But you don't need me to tell you the competition is fierce out there! Canadians and Americans likewise need to redouble our efforts to forge new links and partnerships. In some ways, I think our great friendship has perhaps allowed us to become complacent, which is exactly what we cannot afford to be in this hyper-connected, rapidly changing world. Let me close with an image of my vision of the diplomacy of knowledge in action, borrowed appropriately enough from the third president of these United States, Thomas Jefferson. President Jefferson used the image of a burning candle to illustrate his Enlightenment values and the importance of sharing knowledge and working together. The candle symbolizes not only enlightenment, but also the transmission of learning from one person to another. We could also say from one country to another. And it's important to keep in mind that when you light your unlit candle from the flame of my lit candle, my light is not diminished, it is enhanced. The sharing of knowledge collectively enlightens us. Now, having stood up to be seen and spoken up to be heard, let me take my grandmother's advice and sit down to be appreciated! Thank you for your time and attention and for being contributors to the precious relationship between Canada and Minnesota. I wish you the very best. David Johnston   SOURCE Government House"}, {"title": "Keeping startups here can be tricky business", "article": "No matter how exciting the startup community may be in Winnipeg, the elusive secret to success continues to be finding enough local startup cash to keep the new companies going - and keep them in Winnipeg. Not every angel investor or venture capital fund requires they be in close physical proximity to the client companies - but many do. One active adviser to the startup community said recently, \"When was the last time you heard about a company landing a round of financing for more than $250,000?\" The point being that companies need more than that to get off the ground and while the number of angel investors is growing, it is clearly not enough to keep up with demand. Since there are very few companies that will relocate to Winnipeg, a key element of economic growth and job growth in the city is the evolution of startups into growing companies that employ ever more skilled people (some who will need to be recruited from out of town). Those are the companies that will stay in Winnipeg and become the employers in the new economy. Farmers Edge, a precision farming-technology company, has landed two senior rounds of financing from venture capital firms as far away as Silicon Valley and has not had to leave Winnipeg. Over the years, there have been examples (not that many) of companies that started here but were forced to move to follow the money. Most recently, the mobile app developer for contractors, Joist, moved to Toronto where it found the financial backers it needed. In the past, companies such as IMRIS and Novadaq felt the need to relocate for better access to capital. Despite that scenario, there exists an active startup scene in Winnipeg that may or may not be busier than any other city in North America. Organizers of the Tuesday's Fundica Roadshow startup pitch event indicated it was harder finding qualified applicants to participate in Winnipeg than in most of the other 10 cities across the country that hold similar events. Still, there was vibrancy was on display Tuesday, where judges (including your's truly) heard pitches from seven excellent examples of new enterprises. Exigence Technologies Inc. was the winner. It is the poster child for the startup ecosystem that exists in the city. It was created by former University of Manitoba MBA students led by Zach Wolff and Sheri Governo, who developed a business plan around an anti-microbial technology developed by Song Liu, an associate professor of polymer chemistry at the University of Manitoba. The company now operates out of the Eureka Project, the business incubator at the U of M that offers a host of operating services for companies getting off the ground. Exigence gained access to the technology through the U of M's technology transfer office under a new initiative that is attempting to allow more commercialization of academic discoveries. It means partners do not have to negotiate dense legal agreements before they know whether there is a market for the technology, let alone the possibilities of royalty payments. In less than a year, Wolff, Governo and a growing team have raised about $250,000 and leveraged another $1 million or so in research funding. Its next-generation microbe-fighting compound draws bacteria or virus microbes in like a magnet and then eliminates them through a combination of their novel molecule and old, reliable chlorine. Its unique properties include extremely fast action, the ability to be recharged and the current understanding it does not promote bacterial resistance. The company is already in advanced partnership discussions with two of the three largest chemical companies in the world, even while it is still applying for regulatory approval in the U.S. There's much work to begin and it is still at a stage where it could go either way, but Wolff and Governo are not being mocked when they say they believe the company could be worth $100 million in five or six years. Whether they are still in Winnipeg by that time may well be determined by the source of the capital they ultimately raise. martin.cash@freepress.mb.ca"}, {"title": "Agrium Announces Release Dates for First Quarter 2015 Results and Conference Call", "article": "CALGARY, AB --(Marketwired - April 21, 2015) - Agrium Inc.

Dr. Duncan conducts research at Niagara College as the Industrial Research Chair in Precision Agriculture and Environmental Technologies, as awarded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC). He carries with this weighty title a five-year mission that may seem just as onerous: develop technology-based tools to enhance one of the world's most fundamental but often taken-for-granted professions: farming. Dr. Duncan is working with the farming community, Ontario government researchers, University of Guelph researchers and a number of farm consulting SMEs to develop a standardized approach to precision agricultural practices for Ontario farmers. Dr. Duncan has been building technology for agriculture since 2006 when his research interests switched back to that of his graduate student days at McGill. The term PrAgMatic (Precision Agriculture automatic) was coined around 2006 as a catchall for the technology being developed, which included sensor networks to measure temperature and humidity across a vineyard; Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) technology to assess why parts of a vineyard yield better wine than other parts; and a web-based portal that scraped Canadian and U.S. weather radar and weather data sites to build up insights on how weather was affecting crops. Out of all this work, the most promising elements were the ideas related to how topography affects crop quality. A fortunate meeting with government researcher Doug Aspinall in 2007 put the research focus onto the idea that farm field topography affects crop yield. Aspinall became a mentor to nearly a dozen students who have worked with the group since that year. While the promise of this technology is great, the sheer complexity of the problem will take some years to sort out. Another chance meeting, with Rick Willemse of Yellow-Gold Farms, further focused the effort onto grain yields and the idea of variable rate fertilizer technology. Around that time Dr. Duncan did a TEDx talk called \" Seeing double green,\" which outlines the promise of variable rate technology being able to increase farm profits while greatly reducing the environmental impact of farming. Other recent work for the research team, which includes students, graduates and grower collaborators and partnerships with OMAFRA, has involved establishing and employing the information gleaned from decades of farm yield data collected by farmers who adopted GPS capable farm equipment early on. Data sets from as early as 1996 are providing insight on farming practice today. \"As fate would have it, I accidentally invented a new way of looking at things which turned out to be really powerful,\" Duncan recently noted of his research into how to classify management zones within farm fields based on the historical yield data. Another piece of the technology puzzle is called LandMapR, which works with digital elevation maps to determine hydrology and landform classes to help farmers new to precision agriculture adopt precision practices. Dr. Duncan's group found that the deep historical yield data matched well with the farm field topography data processed through LandMapR. If you are thinking you haven't seen any of this fancy gadgetry when travelling past the farmers' fields, orchards or vineyards that are still plentiful in Niagara, think again. Most modern tractors are equipped with RTK/GIS/GPS technology and several fields in locations throughout the peninsula contain remote sensors for field-specific weather inputs like rain and heat units. One of the next major steps for the team is the development of an online portal for grain farmers, which will eventually be made available via the Grain Farmers of Ontario. The science and products will continue to evolve as the portal will play the double role of production portal (making maps) and research portal (using the incoming data to gain new insights).

Now, he is also looking to the heavens for satellite imaging to boost his crop. Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants to promote a \"per drop, more crop\" approach to farming to make better use of scarce water, and aims to have a new satellite crop monitoring system working in time for the peak of this year's monsoon in July. Using remote analysis to assess soil moisture and crop development has the potential to cut input costs and raise yields, say experts, in a country of 1.25 billion where half of workers make a living from agriculture. Under the scheme, farmers would be able to access advisories on their mobile phones to help them to choose seed varieties, apply the right fertilisers or time irrigation 'shots', though some are sceptical about how effective the plan will be given natural or other obstacles. \"I hope to cut at least a tenth of input cost with the help of the 'satellite god',\" said Singh, 55, who farms less than a hectare of rapeseed and hopes to use savings to educate his two grandchildren. By his own admission, Singh doesn't know how much to water his crops, the right fertiliser mix - or even the right crop to plant given the land's soil type. After last year's landslide poll victory, Modi's government rolled out a national Soil Health Card scheme modeled on an initiative he launched as chief minister of Gujarat to help farmers plant crops suited to their farmland. In addition, satellite analysis can assess vegetation cover down to field level, helping to determine how a crop is developing and whether it has been harmed by pests or needs more water. \"The idea is to integrate information under the Soil Health Card with satellite images to raise productivity,\" said N. Chattopadhyay, a weather department official who is involved in the project. PRECISION FARMING, INDIAN STYLE The approach seeks to apply 'precision' farming methods pioneered in North America that use geo-location technology to help farmers micro-manage exactly how much seed, fertiliser or pesticide they apply to their fields. In countries such as the United States and Canada unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, are also used to overfly farms to map soil and crops accurately. The next-best option is satellite analysis, more affordable for India, that uses a method called Normalized Vegetation Difference Index assess how well a crop is developing. Chattopadhyay said the analysis can be provided to farmers on a near real-time basis and could also be used for impact assessment after natural hazards like floods. India can use its own geostationary satellites, but some see obstacles to its plans including a need to check findings on the ground or the risk of cloud obscuring images. \"Don't be under any illusion that the remote sensing based crop mapping technique will be a penance for all problems in the farm sector,\" said B.C. Barah, a New Delhi-based agriculture economist. FROM THE TOP India's top bureaucrat Ajit Seth has urged wider use of remote sensing to benefit farmers, many of whom live a precarious existence on tiny plots of land. Just over half of India's nearly 200 million hectares of arable land is rainfed, leaving farmers at the mercy of an often uncertain the monsoon. The remaining arable is under irrigation, which the government plans to expand by a tenth over three years. The loss of more than half of a crop can trigger government payments to farmers, of $72 per hectare for rainfed areas and $144 for irrigated lands. India is also preparing to use satellite based crop forecasts to develop insurance for farmers. Currently, insurance products cover primarily crop loans and exclude farm activities.

Bob and Diane Devolder and their daughter, Lisa Devolder, run Devolder Farms, which has grown from a soybean seed business to include building grain storage, drying and handling equipment, and offering a precision agriculture service. The farm business has been named industry of the year and will be formally recognized by the Chatham-Kent Chamber of Commerce during its 127th annual Business of Excellence Awards event on March 26 in Chatham. The Devolder family appreciates the recognition. \"It s kind of nice to know there's a lot of people in the community supporting us,\" said Lisa, who is business manager. Devolder Farms began in 1988 when the family decided to expand from growing crops to becoming involved in the soybean seed business. \"We wanted access to the new-e st varieties . . . so we got involved in pedigree seed production,\" said Bob. He said they were able to make connections in the seed industry, which led to where the business is at today, growing the latest soybean varieties and technologies. Devolder Farms cont racts thousands of acres -which is increasing this year -to bring in soybean seed and package it for distribution through the DeKalb seed dealer network. \"We've been fortunate to be one of the first in Canada to grow new soybean technologies, such as Roundup Ready soybeans,\" Bob said. He added the business will be rolling out a new Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybean platform. But the Devolder family knows you can't sit still for too long in agriculture. \"The majority of growth has happened within the last five to 10 years,\" Lisa said, citing the expansion into building grain handling, storage and drying equipment in 2005. She said the most recent expansion was about ago year ago when the business got into precision agriculture. \"That's also spurred growth, spurred our employment . . . we've doubled the amount of full-time positions we've had in the last five years, and we've tripled the seasonal positions we've had in the last five years, and it continues to grow,\" Lisa said. She said precision agriculture has a lot of different aspects to it. Devolder offers Precision Planting products and services that allows a farmer to fine-tune their planter and assess some of things they do prior to planting seeds so \"you're maximizing the most potential you can get out of the crops that you're planting,\" Lisa said. Bob added: \"As they saying goes, They're not making any more farm land,' so we have to get the most out of every acre that we produce.\" As for what's next for the family farm business, Bob said, \"we certainly pride ourselves in looking to the future.\" He added the business is focused on knowing where the new technologies are going and being able to intercept the next technology wave. But despite the rapidly changing playing field in agriculture, one constant remains for the Devolder family -their love of farming. \"It's just who we are,\" Diane said. \"We all grew up in farming all our lives, so to be involved in it the way we are is very satisfying. \"It just feels very comfortable for us,\" she added. \"I wouldn't think of doing anything else.\" ellwood.shreve@sunmedia.ca"}, {"title": "Drones in 2015: No longer just pies in the sky", "article": "Eight years ago, Dave Kroetsch couldn't find a buyer for his drones. \"When we started this in 2007, no one even knew what a drone was,\" Kroetsch says. Drones had been used by the military, he notes, and some universities were doing experiments with them, but the average person hadn't heard of the new technology. Fast forward to 2015, and drones are becoming an inevitable part of our lives. In recent years, as the technology has developed and prices dropped, drones have become far more commonplace and are as varied as the applications they're used for: from toy drones for hobbyists to commercial drones used in farming. Aeryon's heavy-duty drones are now used for industrial use. They have military applications, such as tactical awareness and surveillance, but are also used in public-safety initiatives, such as fire management, crowd control and search-and-rescue missions; and large-scale commercial applications, including pipeline monitoring and precision agriculture. A drone on a budget Twelve years ago, when USC first started out, people were talking about drones for purely military purposes, Baillie says. \"The technology was very expensive and very difficult to use,\" he says, noting the regulations at the time were also difficult to navigate. Battery, camera and GPS technology, as well as the smartphone revolution, \"have come together at a great time,\" Kroetsch says. A simple Phantom toy drone from DaJiang Innovations (DJI) costs around $1,000. A Parrot drone, used primarily for recreational purposes, retails for about half of that. Transport Canada, the government agency tasked with promoting a secure transportation environment, is also helping commercial drones get in the air. To keep the skies safe, it's working to ensure drone operators steer clear of commercial airplanes. To this end, Transport Canada authorities have differentiated between model aircraft, which don't need to be regulated, and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or commercial drones. A model aircraft is characterized as being under 35 kilograms and used solely for hobby purposes, explains spokeswoman Roxane Marchand. In order fly commercially, operators must apply for a Special Flight Operation Certificate (SFOC), detailing their safety and security plans, and have their drone insured. In 2010, Transport Canada established a UAV Working Group, which includes key members of the industry, to create a new regulatory framework to ensure drone operators are trained and that the drones meet safety standards. In 2010, the agency issued just 66 SFOCs to individuals or businesses seeking to operate drones commercially. As of Sept. 15 of last year, Transport Canada had issued 1,020 such certificates. Ideas no longer pies in the sky When it comes to uses for commercial drones today, the sky is literally the limit. Retail giants such as Amazon are seeking approval in the United States to initiate outdoor research into drone delivery systems. Their program, titled Prime Air, has an ambitious goal: getting a package into customers' hands in 30 minutes or less using drones. \"One day, seeing Prime Air vehicles will be as normal as seeing mail trucks on the road,\" Amazon touts on its website. In Canada, businesses are getting just as creative: McCain Foods has a drone equipped with cameras that capture a bird's-eye view of their potato crops in New Brunswick. In a joint project with Resson Aerospace, McCain operates the drone above its fields, and Resson takes the data and analyzes it to improve efficiency and asses crop health. The 2014 season was their second using a drone. In a recent Cirque du soleil performance entitled Sparked, a repairman's lamps come to life and enter a majestic dance with him. The lamps are, in fact, computer-programmed drones. \"We thought it was very interesting to divert this object and bring poetry, magic, whimsy to it,\" said Welby Altidor, who was Cirque du soleil's project lead in creating Sparked. But the real magic came from the drones' computer programming, which synchronized all the movements, allowing for a fluid and harmonious flight. Accuas Inc, a Salmon Arm, B.C., land-surveying company, was an early adopter, putting drones to use since 2007 to conduct aerial surveys and to map terrain. The company uses drones in a number of industries in which land surveying is necessary but difficult, including agriculture, oil-and-gas and waste management. Kaspi Films, a small company based in the Greater Toronto Area, offers professional cinematography and photography services using drones."}, {"title": "Early spring ahead for farmers", "article": "No, I don't mean daylight savings. I mean I can t remember as mild a winter as we've seen this year. The coffee-shop reminisces about the winter of 1988... I was in Grade 3 that year, and all I remember was the Olympic craze. Lots of things in agriculture have progressed since then, and especially in the last few years, technology advancements have been embraced by many producers. Even without all the snow that we've been used to in years past, our soil moisture levels are great. Last year, that was our saving grace around the immediate Strathmore area as we received 4-5\" of in-season precipitation in places and we still came up with a just less than average crop. There's enough water in the soil to get our crops off to a great start, so pending average precipitation (usually around 8\"), we should be in for a decent yielding year. Other things to expect this year is more technology adoption. Precision Farming in our business has grown substantially in the last 2 years, and I predict that trend will continue. It's getting very impractical (outside of investment pur-p oses) to purchase land that will support itself solely on farming income. As land prices increase, the only way to make more grain is to do a better job of it and reallocating resources into areas that need them more than the ones that don't. Not that long ago, this \"Variable Rate Technology\" was pretty rough and challenging to manage. Every year, it gets a little easier and with better measurement and accurate yield mapping, we can make better decisions. Data, Data, Data... farmers are inundated with information and consumers are demanding to know where their food is coming from. I think this is a healthy and positive trend that will do a couple of things. Informing the consumer about what our industry does is important. We feed people, plain and simple. We are primary producers that live off the land and if the weather doesn t cooperate, well, there's always next year... hopefully! It should also make producers a little more responsible to being a steward of the land and the environment if more eyes are watching them. The use of UAV s (drones) is something we will be trying this year. Sensory technology has exponentially improved in the last 2 years, and it's not slowing down. It's been on the cover of every magazine and paper the last few months, for good reason. We'll be able to collect very specific data inseason to make quick, practical decisions on a square foot basis. As always, I'm very optimistic about the year ahead.

A new $150-million venture-capital fund is looking to invest in companies just like yours. \"All I can say to Canadians in the ag-tech industry is, 'Put your thinking caps on and let's talk,' \" said Michael Raymont, CEO of AVAC Ltd., one of the companies behind the new Finistere Ventures FVII Fund. \"We have the money, and we're looking for opportunities as quick as we can.\" The U.S./Canadian partnership will be managed by San Diego-based Finistere Ventures, in partnership with Calgary-based AVAC Ltd. It has completed its first closing with Bayer CropScience as one of the prime investors and is looking to raise more funds. (Another, as yet unnamed, multinational corporation is also a lead investor in the fund.) Raymont's AVAC Ltd. is a long-standing Alberta venture-management group that's now veering into the more conventional private-sector venture-capital field. It believes there are plenty of opportunities in Canada. While the fund does not have a cap on how much it invests in Canada, neither does it have a minimum requirement. The basic thinking behind the fund is an increasing population - expected to hit 10 billion people worldwide by 2050 - needs to be fed from an arable land base that is not increasing. \"You have to grow more stuff on the same amount of land,\" Raymont said. \"Really, it is a pretty obvious conclusion... The only way you can do that is with technology.\" Jerry Caulder, a pioneer in agricultural biotechnology and chairman of Finistere Ventures, said, \"The timing for a new fund coincides with the new wave of innovation needed to create the next Green Revolution in agriculture.\" The Finistere Ventures FVII Fund is looking to invest in companies where, Raymont said, the science has matured to the point it is no longer the main risk factor. But it will also provide seed or pre-series-A financing of $2 million to $3 million without looking for co-investors. As well, the fund's strategy is to lead subsequent series-A rounds in the $6-million to $12-million range, where it would take one-third to one-half and look to syndicate the rest. The fund wants to invest in companies that have the potential to grow to $300 million to $500 million in value in the fund's six-year investment cycle. \"We're looking for aggressive, knowledgable management and big-market opportunities rather than niche markets,\" Raymont said. He said he already has a list of 50 to 60 companies in Canada and a couple of potential game-changers the fund is very seriously interested in. AVAC has already raised about $20 million for the fund and is looking to raise another $20 million-plus, but there is no guarantee it will be able to invest in Canadian companies, let alone any in Manitoba. Raymont made it clear while there are good new ag-tech companies in Canada, prospects are not nearly as attractive as they are in the U.S. \"There are lots with potential (in Canada), but many do not quite have the get-up-and-go, the drive... something, the twinkle, is (often) missing,\" he said. One Manitoba ag-tech company, Farmers Edge, scored a recent victory with a venture round from the blue-chip Silicon Valley firm Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield and Byers late last year.

(TSX:AGU) (NYSE:AGU) announced today consolidated net earnings from continuing operations of $70-million for the fourth quarter of 2014, compared with net earnings from continuing operations of $110-million in the fourth quarter of 2013. The 2014 fourth quarter results included pre-tax share-based payments expense of $25-million ($0.16 diluted earnings per share) and net losses on foreign exchange and derivative positions of $31-million in aggregate ($0.20 diluted earnings per share). The fourth quarter also included a one-time non-recurring tax gain of $7-million ($0.05 diluted earnings per share). Excluding these items, net earnings from continuing operations would have been $115-million ($0.77 diluted earnings per share). On an annual basis, 2014 net earnings from continuing operations were $798-million ($5.51 diluted earnings per share), down from 2013 net earnings from continuing operations of $1.08-billion ($7.31 diluted earnings per share). 2014 net earnings were $720-million ($4.97 diluted earnings per share), compared to $1.06-billion ($7.20 diluted earnings per share) in 2013. Free cash flow was $746-million in 2014 and free cash flow per share was $5.18. 'Agrium once again benefited from the strength of its competitive advantages and diversity, delivering solid fourth quarter earnings across the Company, despite some headwinds in agricultural markets. We undertook downtime to refresh and expand our potash and nitrogen facilities this quarter, which impacted Wholesale earnings in the short term but will drive higher future capacity and utilization rates. Agrium's Retail distribution business demonstrated its operational stability in this environment and achieved record earnings again this year, reporting improvements across all target metrics and with EBITDA surpassing $1.1-billion. Nutrient sales this quarter were impacted by a shortened fall application window due to the late harvest and early onset of winter in the U.S., but this will support demand for the coming spring season.' commented Chuck Magro, Agrium's President and CEO. 'For 2015, Agrium is focused on executing our strategy and delivering on our operational excellence targets, including ramping up production at Vanscoy, completing the Borger nitrogen expansion and continuing to grow Retail earnings. The recently announced increase to our target dividend payout ratio and share buy-back program is an illustration of our conviction in the strength of our business and future earnings and cash flow generation capability for the company', concluded Mr. Magro.

Sales Sales decreased by $162-million for the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to the same period last year. Wholesale sales for the fourth quarter decreased as a result of lower potash and nitrogen sales volumes compared to the fourth quarter of 2013 due to an extended outage to complete the tie-in at our Vanscoy potash facility and an outage at our Redwater nitrogen facility. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in the realized selling price for phosphate compared to fourth quarter of 2013, consistent with benchmark pricing. Gross Profit Our gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2014 was $732-million, a decrease of $8-million compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. The main drivers of this variance consisted of: Retail's gross profit increased by $28-million to $614-million for the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to the fourth quarter of 2013 due to higher rebates from suppliers on crop protection products and increased services and other revenues related to higher livestock export contracts. Wholesale's gross profit decreased by $42-million to $130-million for the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to the fourth quarter of 2013 primarily as a result of lower sales volumes due to an extended outage to complete the tie-in at our Vanscoy potash facility and an outage at our Redwater nitrogen facility and increased potash and nitrogen cost of product sold. Expenses General and administrative expenses decreased by $13-million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Cash general and administrative expenses decreased by $8-million during the quarter primarily due to a decrease in payroll expense of $5-million. Share-based payments decreased by $3-million due to a lower share price increase during the quarter compared to the same period last year. During the fourth quarter of 2013, we recorded a purchase gain of $257-million from the Viterra acquisition and goodwill impairment of $220-million in Retail-Australia. No goodwill impairment or purchase gain was recorded in 2014. Earnings from associates and joint ventures decreased by $27-million in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to the same period last year due to unscheduled plant outages at our Profertil facility in the fourth quarter of 2014 coupled with the fourth quarter of 2013 having a recovery of $14-million related to a reversal of a gas surcharge provision. Other Expenses Other expenses increased by $13-million during the fourth quarter of 2014 primarily due to losses on commodity derivatives not designated as hedges due to declining natural gas prices partially offset by a $5-million decrease in potash profit and capital tax related to lower potash production tax accrual in the fourth quarter of 2014. Effective Tax Rate The effective tax rate on continuing operations was (4) percent for the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to 24 percent for the same period last year due to the recognition of a previously unrecognized tax asset. Excluding the recognition of a one-time previously unrecognized tax asset of $7-million, the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2014 would have been 6 percent. BUSINESS SEGMENT PERFORMANCE Retail Retail reported fourth quarter sales of $2.1-billion, which is in line with the $2.1-billion reported in the same quarter last year. Gross profit was a record $614-million in the fourth quarter of 2014, a 5 percent increase from last year's fourth quarter of $586-million. Retail also reported a record EBITDA of $181-million, up $15-million from the fourth quarter of last year. Retail's international operations supported these record results with higher margins and EBITDA compared to the same period last year. As well, our solid results were achieved in a lower global crop price environment, a late harvest this fall and an early arrival of winter across much of the U.S. compared to last year. This resulted in a shortened application window this fall that reduced demand for nutrients and delayed grower seed commitments this quarter; however, this was offset by strong results for crop protection products. On a full year basis, EBITDA reached a record $1.1-billion in 2014, surpassing last year's record of $957-million. Total crop nutrient sales were $972-million this quarter, down slightly from $1.1-billion in the fourth quarter of 2013. The reduction in sales was due to a 14 percent decline in nutrient volumes in the U.S. this quarter, relative to the fourth quarter of 2013 related to unfavorable weather during the fall nutrient application season. Gross profit for crop nutrients was $156-million this quarter, a decrease of $22-million compared to the $178-million reported in the fourth quarter of 2013. Selling prices for crop nutrients were similar to the fourth quarter of 2013, although per tonne margins declined from $92 per tonne in the fourth quarter of 2013 to $87 per tonne this quarter partly due to a change in the geographic and product mix of the nutrients sold, where a larger percentage of total product sold was outside of the higher profit margin U.S. market. Total crop nutrient margins as a percentage of sales were 16 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014, slightly below the 17 percent reported in the same quarter last year. Crop protection product sales were $552-million in the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to $511-million in the same period last year. Higher sales were seen late in the fourth quarter, particularly wholesale sales to dealers. Gross profit was $260-million this quarter, compared to $205-million reported in the fourth quarter of 2013. Crop protection margins as a percentage of sales were 47 percent this quarter compared to 40 percent in the same period of 2013. Much of the increase in margins was due to higher rebates during the quarter from achievement of certain sales measures with several significant North American suppliers coming later in the year compared to the same period in 2013. Seed sales were $91-million in the fourth quarter of 2014, down slightly from the $95-million reported in the fourth quarter of last year. Gross profit was $50-million this quarter, down from $60-million reported in the same period last year. The reduction in sales revenue and gross profit was primarily due to a decrease in planted winter wheat acres and lower supplier rebates this quarter. Seed margins as a percentage of sales were 55 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014, a reduction from the 63 percent reported in the fourth quarter of 2013. Sales of merchandise in the fourth quarter of 2014 were $211-million, compared to $228-million in the same period last year. Gross profit for this product line was $30-million this quarter, similar to the fourth quarter of 2013. Margins on merchandise sales this quarter were 14 percent, a one percent increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. The lower sales and increase in overall margins as a percent of sales was primarily due to exiting the low-margin wool export business in Australia as well as the implementation of a SKU (stock keeping unit) reduction program for general merchandise in Australia. Services and other sales were $231-million this quarter, compared to the $216-million reported in the fourth quarter of 2013. Gross profit was $118-million in the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to $113-million for the same period last year. The increase was due to strong livestock exports from Australia during the quarter. Selling expenses as a percentage of sales was 25 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014 which is up marginally from the 24 percent reported in the same period last year. Retail selling expenses were $514-million for the fourth quarter, compared to $504-million in the same period last year. This variance was due to additional businesses purchased since the fourth quarter of 2013, as well as a higher benefit accrual for U.S. employees. On an annual basis, our operating coverage ratio declined to 72 percent this year compared to 73(1) percent in 2013 due to our continued focus on Retail's Operational Excellence targets during 2014. Wholesale Wholesale's 2014 fourth quarter sales were $897-million, down from the $1.0-billion reported in the same quarter last year. Gross profit was $130-million this quarter, compared to $172-million in the fourth quarter of 2013. Wholesale Adjusted EBITDA was $150-million in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to $237-million reported in the same period last year. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to the planned downtime at the Vanscoy potash facility to tie-in the one million tonne potash expansion project and lower ammonia sales volumes resulting from the earliest winter season in the U.S. in over ten years. This was partially offset by stronger results for phosphate. Nitrogen gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2014 was $113-million compared to $129-million in the same quarter last year. Nitrogen sales volumes were 879,000 tonnes, a decrease from the 907,000 tonnes in the same quarter last year. The decrease was primarily due to lower ammonia sales volumes which were impacted by the unusually early onset of winter in the U.S. and downtime at our Redwater nitrogen facility to replace the waste heat boiler within the quarter. Realized sales prices and benchmark prices for most nitrogen products were similar to last year, although urea prices were higher year over year. Nitrogen cost of product sold was $331 per tonne this quarter, slightly above the $314 per tonne reported in the fourth quarter of 2013. Cost of product sold per tonne was impacted by extended maintenance work at the Redwater facility related to the planned replacement of the waste heat boiler this quarter. Average nitrogen gross margins were $128 per tonne this quarter, compared to $144 per tonne in the same period last year. Reference made to Retail metrics includes adjustments for one-time items reported in 2013. See Supplemental Information 5 accompanying the fourth quarter financial statements. Agrium's average natural gas cost included in cost of product sold (which includes transportation and administration costs) was $3.47/MMBtu this quarter ($3.62/MMBtu including the impact of realized losses on natural gas derivatives), compared to $3.51/MMBtu for the same period in 2013 ($3.39/MMBtu including the impact of realized gains on natural gas derivatives). Derivative gains or losses not designated as hedges are included in other expenses and not in cost of product sold, thus are not part of the calculation of gross profit. The average U.S. benchmark (NYMEX) natural gas price for the fourth quarter of 2014 was $3.94/MMBtu, compared to $3.63/MMBtu in the same quarter last year. The AECO (Alberta) basis differential was a $0.77/MMBtu discount to NYMEX in the fourth quarter of 2014, an increase from the $0.62/MMBtu discount in the fourth quarter of 2013. Potash gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2014 was a loss of $50-million, compared to a profit of $39-million reported in the same quarter last year. Sales volumes were 19,000 tonnes this quarter compared to 344,000 tonnes in the fourth quarter of 2013. The decrease in sales volumes was a result of the Vanscoy mine being out of production for the majority of the fourth quarter to complete the planned tie-in of the one million tonne expansion project. The tie-in was completed and the mine recommenced production in late December 2014. Realized sales prices for potash in North America were $375 per tonne compared to $353 per tonne in the same period last year as all current sales volumes were in the domestic market, which is consistent with a similar increase in benchmark pricing. Gross margin per tonne was impacted by high ongoing costs related to the tie-in activities, which were allocated over very low sales volumes. Phosphate gross profit was $37-million in the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to a loss of $4-million in the same quarter last year. Phosphate sales volumes were 305,000 tonnes in the fourth quarter of 2014, a 7 percent increase from 285,000 tonnes in the same quarter last year due to strong operating rates and good regional demand. Realized phosphate sales prices were $656 per tonne this quarter compared to $560 per tonne in the same period last year, which is consistent with a similar increase in benchmark pricing. Phosphate cost of product sold was $534 per tonne in the fourth quarter of 2014, a decrease of $42 per tonne compared to the same period last year as a result of improved operating rates and efficiencies at the Redwater facility and lower fixed costs per tonne at both the Redwater and Conda facilities. Gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2014 was $122 per tonne compared to a negative $16 per tonne in the same period last year. Ammonium sulfate, Environmentally Smart Nitrogen ('ESN', hereinafter referred to as 'ESN') and other gross profit was $27-million this quarter compared to $14-million in the same quarter of 2013. Ammonium sulfate gross profit was $14-million this quarter, $4-million higher than same period last year due to higher sales volumes and realized sales prices. ESN gross profit This increase is due to higher realized sales prices and lower production costs in the current quarter. Purchase for resale gross profit for the fourth quarter was $9-million higher than the same period last year due to higher margins in the current period. Wholesale expenses in the fourth quarter of 2014 were $46-million compared to $13-million in the same period last year. The increase is a result of $15-million in natural gas derivative losses in the current quarter (2013 - $3-million gain) largely due to the recent decline in North American natural gas forward curve prices as well as lower realized income from our equity investments in 2014 partly due to a reversal of a gas surcharge provision in 2013. Other EBITDA for our Other non-operating business unit for the fourth quarter of 2014 was a net expense of $78-million, compared to a net expense of $94-million for the fourth quarter of 2013. The decrease was primarily due to a $9-million decrease in general and administrative expenses related to lower share-based payments and payroll expenses and $13-million non-recurring Viterra acquisition costs incurred in 2013. OUTSTANDING SHARE DATA Agrium had 143,729,524 outstanding shares at January 31, 2015. At that date, under our stock option plans, shares expected to be issued for options outstanding were negligible. The agricultural products business is seasonal in nature. Consequently, comparisons made on a year-over-year basis are more appropriate than quarter-over-quarter comparisons. Crop input sales are primarily concentrated in the spring and fall crop input application seasons. Crop nutrient inventories are normally accumulated leading up to each application season. Our cash collections generally occur after the application season is complete. ADDITIONAL IFRS AND NON-IFRS FINANCIAL MEASURES Certain financial measures in this news release are not prescribed by IFRS. We consider these financial measures discussed herein to provide useful information to both management and investors in measuring our financial performance and financial condition. In general, an additional IFRS financial measure is a measure relevant to understanding a company's financial performance that is not a minimum financial statement measure mandated by IFRS. A non-IFRS financial measure generally either excludes or includes amounts not excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS. Non-IFRS financial measures are not recognized measures under IFRS and our method of calculation may not be directly comparable to that of other companies. These non-IFRS measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. MARKET OUTLOOK Prices for most major grains and oilseeds increased in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to the end of the third quarter of 2014, but remained below year ago levels due to the record global production in 2014. Between September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2014, corn, wheat and soybean prices increased by 24 percent, 23 percent and 12 percent respectively, despite a decreasing commodity price environment. Prospective 2015 grower cash margins have moved back up to historical average levels, which we expect to support normal levels of crop input demand in 2015. North American corn and total seeded acreage is expected to decline slightly in 2015; however, this will be dependent on the final size of the South American crop, where weather conditions have been volatile so far this growing season. The lower crop price environment has had some dampening impact on the crop input market. However, we expect growers will continue to optimize use of crop inputs, including high quality seed offerings, to ensure they maintain crop yield potential and remain competitive. The delayed 2014 harvest in the U.S. combined with historically early arrival of winter weather narrowed the window for application of post-harvest herbicides and crop nutrients. Under our current North American acreage projections, we expect domestic nitrogen, phosphate and potash demand to be slightly lower in 2014/15, but we anticipate that spring demand will be strong as a result of relatively low fall applications. Global urea demand has been supported by unseasonably strong Indian urea import purchases in the first quarter of 2015. U.S. urea import demand has also been strong, as offshore urea imports were up almost 50 percent in the July through December 2014 period compared to the relatively slow import pace from a year ago. China exported a record 13.6 million tonnes of urea in 2014 and we expect similar export volumes in 2015. The change in the Chinese export tariff to a flat rate year round will likely spread the volumes out more evenly throughout the year, leading to a higher proportion of first half exports and lower proportion of second half exports than has been typical in recent years. We expect the combination of more adequate urea supplies in North America and increased first half export supplies from China will lead to less seasonal volatility in urea prices in 2015. The global potash market has been relatively stable in recent months. Tightened export supplies resulting from the flooding of a major Russian mine have been partly offset by uncertainty over Chinese potash supply agreements for 2015. We anticipate relatively tight supply and demand conditions in the first half of 2015 due to low beginning inventories in North America, capacity constraints in Canada resulting from ramp-up of brownfield expansions and expected strong North American potash demand this spring. The phosphate market started the year off with some improvement to market conditions due to relatively strong demand and reduced productive capacity primarily in North America. Brazil imported record volumes of phosphate and other nutrients in 2014, in spite of lower commodity prices. While Brazilian imports are projected to decline slightly from 2014 levels due to expected lower crop area and prices, they are anticipated to remain at historically high levels.
