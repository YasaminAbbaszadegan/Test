[{"title": "They shot a movie once, in my hometown", "article": "Film and television production in Manitoba this year is expected to top $250 million! That includes Flag Day, a Sean Penn movie, that's underway in Winnipeg. And the biggest project in the province right now is Tales From The Loop that's being shot in Morden. The Amazon Prime series could mean years of filming in that community. Morden mayor Brandon Burley says they were looking for someplace that looks like 1980's Sweden. But he points out the main reason the series is being filmed here is the now permanent provincial film tax credit. SPICES NOT SPRAYS Dr. Cass Ingram is a big believer in using more natural ways to battle bugs. It's been too cold for mosquitoes but ticks have been around for a while now. Ingram recommends a product called Herbal Protec-X to keep ticks away, it con-tains stuff like geranium, rosemary, cumin and juniper. He says you can even spray it on a baby! And then if you've been bitten by a tick, he says try extra strength Oreganol on the bite and also take it orally. Good luck this summer keeping the pests away! FARM FEMMES I've been talking a lot on my radio show this week about artificial intelligence. Two sisters, Karen Hildebrand and Teresa Vallotton, who grew up on a farm southwest of Winnipeg are now offering day camps for kids wanting to learn about AI in agriculture. For more, go to farmfemmes.com. I asked Karen to look into her crystal ball and tell me how AI is going to change farming over the next 20 or 30 years. She believes there will be entire fleets of autonomous tractors and other equipment. She says her camps are a great way to get the next generation ready for the digital farming wave. MOM = 2.5 JOBS Don't forget about Mom this weekend, it's Mother's Day! And if anyone deserves a day, it's her. According to a new survey of 2,000 moms with school-aged children, they have many different roles ... the top three are meal planner, chef and cleaner. The survey also says moms put in almost 100 hours a week and if paid properly, they'd bring in six figures. Happy Mother's Day! NEW FOODS I found out about a couple new foods this week. The first was Cheese Tea, basically it's hot or cold tea topped with cheese. The trend started in Taiwan and China and is now starting to show up in North America. It's usually made of cream cheese blended with condensed milk to create a frothy topping tasting either sweet or salty. It actually sounds kind of yummy. But this other one, not so much. A shop in South Africa has created Maggot Ice Cream. It's pressed from the larvae of black soldier flies. The grub ice cream is apparently more eco-friendly. OK, sure but what does it taste like?!

First quarter 2019 financial summary versus first quarter 2018: - Revenue was $14-million versus $15.8-million; - Gross margin at 41.1 per cent compared with 43 per cent; - Operating expenses were down 27 per cent to $5.7-million from $7.8-million; - Net income improved to $100,000 or nil per share, versus a net loss of $1-million or one cent per share; - Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization increased to $600,000 versus a loss of $500,000. Management commentary \"During the first quarter of 2019, the agriculture market continued to face uncertainties related to higher tariffs and lower grain prices, while also still feeling the effects of the devastating weather that impacted millions of acres of crops earlier this year,\" said Dave Vaughn, president and chief executive officer of AgJunction. \"While farmers continue to experience headwinds beyond their control, we remain committed to providing affordable auto-steering solutions that reduce input costs while increasing crop yields, which can bolster a farmer's profitability, particularly during challenging times like these. \"We are pleased that our efforts to align our cost base with our reduced revenues in order to produce long-term profitability are showing progress,\" Mr. Vaughn continued. \"This continued with our April announcement of the future closing of our facilities in Fremont and Brisbane. With the previous divestiture of non-core businesses and our tight focus on our hands-free farm initiative, the consolidation of our operations under one roof not only reduces our cost structure but improves internal communication and collaboration. \"Looking forward, we remain committed to working closely with our OEM and VAR partners in providing innovative auto-steering technologies to complement the precision farming solutions they sell to customers around the world,\" Mr. Vaughn said. \"We also will continue to aggressively market the Wheelman lineup of auto-steering solutions to farmers in the United States, especially those with less than 1,000 acres that can benefit from our solutions the most. \"As farmers continue to recover from the devastating weather and market uncertainties,\" Mr. Vaughn concluded, \"we believe they will look to our products and our partners' solutions to help them plant, grow and harvest with greater efficiency, adopting new technologies that they previously would not have considered and which we are delivering in a much simpler and lower cost package than has been available in the past.\" First quarter 2019 financial results Total revenue in the first quarter of 2019 was $14-million compared with $15.8-million in the first quarter of 2018. The decline was primarily driven by the sale of the Outback and Satloc businesses in September, 2018, and November, 2018, respectively, partially offset by an increase in sales related to the bulk purchase order. Gross profit in the first quarter of 2019 was $5.8-million compared with $6.8-million in the first quarter of 2018. Gross margin was 41.1 per cent compared with 43 per cent in the first quarter of 2018. The margin decline was primarily related to a previously identified performance issue of a single model of high-volume product which is produced under an original equipment manufacturer supply agreement. The issue has now been resolved and shipments of the product have begun again in Q2 2019. Total operating expenses in the first quarter of 2019 declined to $5.7-million compared with $7.8-million in the first quarter of 2018, primarily driven by a decrease in employee compensation costs and assisted by an accounting change which requires deferral of development costs. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses declined to 40.8 per cent compared with 49.6 per cent in the first quarter of 2018. Net income in the first quarter of 2019 increased to $100,000 or nil per share, compared with a net loss of $1-million or one cent per share in the first quarter of 2018. The improvement was driven by the aforementioned decrease in total operating expenses. EBITDA in the first quarter of 2019 increased to $600,000 compared with a loss of $500,000 in the first quarter of 2018. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the first quarter of 2019 totalled $20.1-million compared with $21.4-million at the end of 2018. Working capital was $26.2-million compared with $26.7-million at the end of 2018. The company continues to operate debt free and has access to an unutilized $3-million line of credit.

By Rachel Cernansky If we are going to cope with a changing climate and exploding global population, nearly everything about life needs to shift- including how people grow and eat food. That's the conclusion of the EAT-Lancet Commission, a group of scientists recommending a new approach for \"planetary health.\" We rated human progress to see how things are shaping up. Increase crop diversity D Today three quarters of the world's food comes from just 12 plant and five animal species-even though there are more than 300,000 known edible plants. This leaves the food supply vulnerable to climate change. Seed banks around the world store hundreds of thousands of species, but not enough are being planted. Fabrice DeClerck, coauthor of the EAT-Lancet Commission report, says markets, policies, and technologies to address the situation are all missing. Increase seafood production C Wild catches are exhausted, but the world needs more supply-particularly of farmed oysters and other bivalves. Norway has been making progress on sustainable salmon farming, but new aquaculture technologies are still in their infancy. What happens when antibiotic use is increased? Where does feed come from? What happens if genetically modified fish escape into wild populations? Nobody is quite sure. Eat less meat C A more plant-based diet will set the baseline for some of these other changes, and reduce greenhouse-gas emissions at the same time. But while companies like Impossible and Beyond Meat are expanding the appeal of plant foods, it's a shift that is constrained mainly by culture, political will, and personal preference rather than technology. Boost underused crops D+ Corn, soy, wheat, and rice dominate global agriculture- and research. We need more development and production of underused crops like fruits and nuts, with a focus on improved varieties that have higher yields and resistance to disease and pests. Brent Loken, the commission's director of science translation, says we must increase production of legumes by 200%, nuts and seeds by 150%, and fruits by up to 75%. Cut food waste C+ An estimated 50% of Canada's food gets discarded, typical of many Western countries. Systems to monitor food and tell consumers when it's safe or unsafe to eat could help. Restaurants could also reduce waste by identifying and responding to customer eating patterns. Change fertilizer use F Bard College environmental physics professor Gidon Eshel says, \"We are as far from where we need to be as we can possibly be.\" US farms, especially, need to drastically reduce fertilizer use, while farms in many other areas around the world- where yields are a fraction of what they could be - need to use more. Precision agriculture technologies under development can help farmers pinpoint the right amounts, but it's still too expensive for many. Reduce food loss D Lots of food is destroyed in production or transportation, before it is sold or eaten. While little food is wasted by consumers in rural areas of the developing world, poor storage and infrastructure can cause produce to spoil or become infested with pests or mold. Optimize land use D+ Growing more food is crucial, but much of the world's land is difficult to farm today. Research could focus on improving these tough environments. For example, large-scale mapping of soil characteristics could uncover areas that hold more promise for food production and spot those better suited to conservation. Optimizing where we grow is an \"absolute necessity,\" says Loken: \"You've got to select the right crop, plant it at the right time, in the right place.\" Use less water in agriculture D Farmers need to make the most out of every drop. Out go the massive and inefficient crop sprinklers in favor of micro-irrigation systems that reduce water use by, for example, dripping directly into the roots of plants. After that, we need to get smarter about what crops are grown where. \"Better crop-environment matching would make big gains here,\" says DeClerck. Improve trade policy F Strong local food systems can be important, but if everybody grows their own food \"we're in big trouble,\" says Loken, because that essentially guarantees an increase in destructive practices such as deforestation. The world will benefit from trade policies that encourage regions best suited for food production to supply areas where agriculture poses greater risks to ecosystems or the global environment."}, {"title": "BGRD Braingrid provides further Data Intelligence disclosure", "article": "Braingrid Ltd (CSE:BGRD) Shares Issued 47,337,752 Last Close 4/30/2019 $0.12 Tuesday April 30 2019 - News Release Mr. Doug Harris reports BRAINGRID LIMITED PROVIDES CORPORATE UPDATE Braingrid Ltd. has provided this corporate update. Product and service platform transition The company announced on April 17, 2019, the launch of a new program initiative called Braingrid Data Intelligence (BDI). The BDI program provides regular analytical reports to customers on data collected from sensors provided by Braingrid and other third parties. Braingrid's highly trained data science team analyzes data that customers do not have the time or in-house expertise to do, thereby providing recurring cost-efficient reports on valuable statistics. Currently, there are six reports available dealing with anomaly analysis in temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, powdery mildew and spider mite scores, and vapour pressure deficit chart analytics. More reports are currently in development. This transition from focusing primarily on sensors to offering customers valuable cultivation information they can act on still relies on Braingrid's real-time sensor platform, providing enhanced visibility on yield variances and predictive pathogen outbreaks. It is anticipated that eventually these reports will be expanded to deal with other cost-driving challenges facing the agriculture sector, such as energy consumption. In addition to analytic reports and sensor equipment, the company is now offering access to its in-house data science team on an hourly rate basis to allow customers a way to achieve deep learning on millions of data points. Current and new customer response to Braingrid's new BDI program has been exceptional. Investment rescission As disclosed in the company's listing statement, in October, 2018, MGX Minerals Inc. purchased 812,500 units (consisting of common shares and common share purchase warrants of Braingrid) of Braingrid Corp. (exchanged for 1,625,000 common shares of Braingrid Ltd. on completion of the transaction with Match Capital) for a total consideration of $650,000 with the consideration to be satisfied through the issuance of one million common shares in the capital of MGX at a deemed issue price of 65 cents. Although the company delivered the certificates for the securities underlying the units to MGX, it did not receive the one million common shares of MGX that were to be issued to pay for such securities despite repeated assurances that such certificates would be delivered. MGX has rescinded the transaction, and the 1,625,000 common shares and common share purchase warrants have been returned for cancellation. As set forth in the company's listing statement, the company had intended to dispose of the shares of MGX on the market on an if and when needed basis, and the rescission of the transaction has reduced the cash available for the company to operate as planned. The company is currently reviewing potential financing sources to address this shortfall in anticipated funds. Further details regarding any potential financing will be provided once known. Staff changes The transition of product positioning to data analytics has caused a shift in the development needs for product software. As a result, the company has laid off a certain number of employees to streamline its operations and focus on its new initiatives. The company appreciates and thanks the employees who are no longer with the firm and wishes them the best in their future endeavours. R2G On May 16, 2018, the company entered into a strategic alliance agreement with R2G Global LLC and Rent2Grow Canada Inc. R2G intended to deploy franchised grow facilities throughout North America, allowing individuals to safely and cost-effectively grow their legal limit of four plants in a four-foot-by-four-foot smart pod. Braingrid's role was to provide controls and monitoring for the pods. The agreement required purchases over a three-year period, the first year set to occur prior to May 15, 2019, for 1,500 to 3,000 pods. R2G encountered partnership difficulties, which, in turn, caused financial challenges culminating in the failure of the venture to raise its required funds. As a result, the company will be terminating the agreement, and Braingrid is considering its options for the recovery of damages. The loss of these sales over the three-year period during which the agreement was to run will have a material impact on the company's projected revenues, which may or may not be recovered with new sales initiatives, some of which are described in this update. The technology developed for R2G remains with Braingrid as valuable hardware and software that can be redeployed in other products. The company is also exploring financing opportunities with the industrial research assistance program (IRAP), leading to commercialization of a new/updated product. Integration partners In addition to a long-standing relationship with Canada's market leader Ample Organics, the company has, during the last two months, announced new integration relationships with A&L Laboratories, Cannabis OneFive, Scanit, Isolocity and TRAK. These relationships are valuable to customers since all information is shown in one place. Equally important, Braingrid is able to analyze customer data generated from various third party systems to gain deeper learning to achieve better crop yields and avoid pathogen risks. Integration relationships also foster new business for Braingrid and its partners once new customers learn about these efficiencies. Braingrid expects to continue to build these relationships and plans to announce new integrations throughout North America. New business partnership Braingrid is in discussions with a seed-to-sale company (USCO), based in the United States, with customers in over 20 states and a dozen countries. The parties are negotiating a letter of intent to enter into a long-term business partnership, whereby USCO will use its extensive sales network to promote Braingrid's products and services in the United States to bolster their existing offerings. Braingrid currently has two U.S. customers and considers the U.S. to be the next large market for expansion of its global products and services. About Braingrid Ltd. Braingrid is a global technology company committed to the best long-term interests of growers in the precision agriculture industry. The company provides valuable cultivation analytics by capturing real-time environmental data using its technology platform. Braingrid is committed to increase grower's revenues by improving yield and reducing grow risks, such as pathogens. Braingrid also provides the cannabis industry with powerful technology solutions, together with its integration partners, in quality management, laboratory testing, pathogen detection and energy conservation.

This was the substance of the message delivered by La Coop federee's Chief Executive Officer, Gaetan Desroches, to the Chambre de commerce du Montreal metropolitain (CCMM). \"Our fellow citizens are increasingly concerned about the quality of the food they consume, about sustainable development and preserving the environment. And we should be happy about that. The big question is: how to feed ourselves within a sustainable agriculture and agri-food ecosystem? Profound changes will have to happen out in the field and also in the coherence of the consumer's discourse,\" said Mr. Desroches in front of an audience that brought together business people and industry players. With a direct and indirect contribution of $4 billion to Canada's gross domestic product (GDP), and with the 35,000 full-time jobs that it generates, La Coop federee intends to exercise its leadership in the ongoing transformation occurring in this sector of the economy which accounts for 9% of Quebec's total exports. The chief executive officer also cautioned his audience about the culture of mistrust that has developed in recent times towards researchers and research. \"This culture of mistrust could put a damper on research. It would be a shame to remain complacent when we need, more than ever, to develop vocations, especially amongst the younger generation. The debate about the future of our food and our agriculture often sparks strong emotions. We need to regain confidence in the advances resulting from science and technology. Quebec does not have the luxury of abandoning R&D,\" said Mr. Desroches. To support his remarks, Mr. Desroches reviewed Agriculture 4.0 -the technological advances that have marked the agricultural world in recent years. Farmers can now assess the performance of their fields in real time thanks to data transmission systems or sensors installed on their equipment. This ranges from drones flying over fields to map areas that need fertilizer to land-based sensors that measure precipitation and humidity, air and soil temperatures. These advances accelerate the process of growing crops that can produce more while using fewer resources, or that are resistant to drought, heat or cold."}, {"title": "Government of Canada supports growth of the digital agriculture industry in Manitoba", "article": "Manitoba's agricultural industry is well positioned to seize global market opportunities through the design and adoption of digital technologies.

(\"Asterion\" or the \"Company\"), announces that, further to its news release dated February 4, 2019, the Company's wholly-owned Australian subsidiary (\"Asterion Australia\") has entered into a land purchase agreement dated April 16, 2019 (the \"Land Purchase Agreement\") with Wagners Properties Pty Ltd (\"Wagners\" or the \"Vendor\") for the purchase (the \"Property Purchase\") of approximately 75 hectares (185 acres) of farmland located in South East Queensland, Australia (the \"Property\"). The Company plans to use the Property to construct and house approximately 40 hectares (99 acres) of cutting-edge, secure, purpose-built greenhouses for the production of high-quality organic medicinal cannabis (the \"Production Facility\"). Land Purchase, Infrastructure and Site Preparation Under the terms of the Land Purchase Agreement, Asterion Australia is required to pay a series of non-refundable deposits to the Vendor upon the occurrence of certain Property development milestones. The closing the Property Purchase and the payment of the final purchase price instalment is expected to occur on or about October 14, 2021 or such earlier date as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties. The Property is located near the regional hub of Toowoomba, Queensland in close proximity to the Toowoomba Wellcamp Airport, which provides access to Queensland's only dedicated 747-F international freighter service. Pursuant to a separate infrastructure services agreement (the \"Infrastructure Services Agreement\") to be entered into between the parties, the Vendor has agreed to construct certain services infrastructure to the external boundary of the Property in locations approved by Asterion (Australia), including water supply, data connections and a new access road and bridge over Westbrook Creek, which runs between the Wellcamp Airport and the Property (collectively, the \"Services Infrastructure\") at a cost in excess of AUD $5 million. The Vendor has also agreed to incur the cost of a substation to supply power to Asterion's facility at a cost that will be in excess of AUD $6 million. Stephen Van Deventer further stated, \"We would like to thank Wagners for their hard work and assistance in helping us select the appropriate piece of land from their portfolio for this significant and innovative project which has recently received Major Project Status from the Australian Government.\" John Wagner, director of Wagners, stated, \"We are delighted to be a party to the development of this project, it fits our long term strategy as Australia's premier logistics hub, especially for high value exports, and compliments the area surrounding the airport as a major centre for innovation and education.\" Prior to the closing of Land Purchase Agreement, Asterion's engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contractor will identify the Site Preparation work required to prepare the site for the Production Facility. The Site Preparation will be contemplated under a separate definitive agreement (the \"Works Contract\"). Production Facility The Production Facility is expected to be developed in three stages: the first two stages each consisting of a 10-hectare (25 acre) greenhouse facility and the final stage being comprised of two 10-hectare (25 acre) greenhouse facilities, with each stage to include ancillary buildings. The Production Facility is planned to be automated and powered by renewable energy and is expected to have annual cannabis production capacity of approximately 500,000 kg. The Production Facility is anticipated to include full extraction and processing equipment, as well as a research and development facility for the development of next generation cannabis products. Asterion intends for the Production Facility to materially advance the agricultural science of medical cannabis and, to that end, the Production Facility is expected to utilize state-of-the-art plant tissue culture (PTC) technology with the aim of eliminating the need for mother plants, providing a greater cultivation footprint, increasing efficiency, lowering costs and yielding disease-free plantlets.

This was the substance of the message delivered today by La Coop federee's Chief Executive Officer, Gaetan Desroches, to the Chambre de commerce du Montreal metropolitain (CCMM). \"Our fellow citizens are increasingly concerned about the quality of the food they consume, about sustainable development and preserving the environment. And we should be happy about that. The big question is: how to feed ourselves within a sustainable agriculture and agri-food ecosystem? Profound changes will have to happen out in the field and also in the coherence of the consumer's discourse,\" said Mr. Desroches in front of an audience that brought together business people and industry players. An economic engine With a direct and indirect contribution of $4 billion to Canada's gross domestic product (GDP), and with the 35,000 full-time jobs that it generates, La Coop federee intends to exercise its leadership in the ongoing transformation occurring in this sector of the economy which accounts for 9% of Quebec's total exports. \"The industry must reinvent itself in order to adopt the principles of sustainable development. We all know this. However, we are living in an interdependent world where La Coop federee, producers, consumers, and distributors have to play a meaningful role to bring these principles to life,\" said Desroches. The chief executive officer also cautioned his audience about the culture of mistrust that has developed in recent times towards researchers and research. \"This  culture of mistrust could put a damper on research. It would be a shame to remain complacent when we need, more than ever, to develop vocations, especially amongst the younger generation. The debate about the future of our food and our agriculture often sparks strong emotions. We need to regain confidence in the advances resulting from science and technology. Quebec does not have the luxury of abandoning R&D,\" said Mr. Desroches. Agriculture 4.0 To support his remarks, Mr. Desroches reviewed the technological advances that have marked the agricultural world in recent years. Farmers can now assess the performance of their fields in real time thanks to data transmission systems or sensors installed on their equipment. This ranges from drones flying over fields to map areas that need fertilizer to land-based sensors that measure precipitation and humidity, air and soil temperatures. These advances accelerate the process of growing crops that can produce more while using fewer resources, or that are resistant to drought, heat or cold. \"Let's take up the challenge of making progress in research and science and make sure that consumers make the right choices,\" said Desroches. About La Coop federee Founded in 1922, La Coop federee is the largest agri-food enterprise in Quebec, the only pan-Canadian agricultural cooperative and the 24th largest agri-food cooperative in the world. It represents more than 120,000 members, agricultural producers and consumers, who are grouped together in nearly 60 cooperatives spread out across several Canadian provinces.

Many of us still have a romantic view of farmers surveying rolling hills and farm kids cuddling calves, but our food in Canada increasingly comes from industrial-scale factory farms and vast glass and steel forests of greenhouses. While the social and environmental consequences of agrifood industrialization are fairly well understood, issues around digital technology are now just emerging. Yet, technology is radically transforming farms and farming. And while different in scale and scope, technology is playing a growing role in small and organic farming systems as well. In reality then, your friendly local farmer will soon spend as much time managing their digital data as they will their dairy herd. The milking apron is being replaced by the milking app. The Canadian government is investing heavily in climate-smart and precision agricultural technologies (ag-tech). These combine digital tools such as GPS and sensors with automated machines like smart tractors, drones and robots in an attempt to increase farm profits while reducing pesticide and fertilizer use. GPS mapping of crop yields and soil characteristics help to cut costs and increase profits, so while seeds still grow in soil, satellites are increasingly part of the story. There's no doubt that ag-tech may be promising for governments, investors and corporations, but the benefits are far less clear for farm owners and workers. There is little research on the potential social impacts of ag-tech specifically, so a group of researchers at the University of Guelph conducted a study to figure out some of the likely impacts of the technological revolution in agriculture. While changes in agriculture show promise for increasing productivity and profits and reducing pesticides and pollution, the future of farming is not all rosy. Corporate control of many agricultural inputs - seeds, feed, fertilizers, machinery - is well documented. Agricultural land is also increasing in cost and farms are getting bigger and bigger. It is likely that digital agriculture will exacerbate these trends. We're especially interested in what farm work will look like as the digital revolution unfolds. While rising costs are always a concern for producers and consumers, we have two main concerns about how the digital revolution is changing farm work in particular. First, who owns all of the data being produced in precision agriculture? Farm owners and workers produce data that has massive potential for commercial exploitation. However, just who gets to harvest the fruits of this digital data labour is unclear. Should it flow to those who produce it? Should it be something that we own collectively? Unfortunately, if smart farms are anything like smart cities, then it looks like corporate control of data could tighten. Second, it's very likely that ag-tech will lead to an even more sharply divided labour force. So-called \"high-skilled\" managers trained in data management and analysis will oversee operations, while many ostensibly \"lower-skilled\" jobs are replaced. Remaining on-the-ground labourers will find themselves in working conditions that are increasingly automated, surveilled and constrained. For instance, in fruit and vegetable greenhouses inputs are increasingly being controlled remotely, but migrant workers still do much of the planting and harvesting by hand. And, they do so under conditions of severe physical and social immobility. There is a wealth of research documenting the vulnerable position of migrant agricultural workers from coast to coast in Canada and elsewhere. If we don't direct it in a humane way, the digital revolution in agriculture is likely to heighten these vulnerabilities. Our food system is built on centuries of Indigenous land theft, dislocation and the suppression of Indigenous foodways while relying heavily on exploitable (Indigenous, migrant and racialized) labour. Across North America, farm workers have long been excluded from basic labour laws, legal status and the right to unionize. And now, increased productivity often relies on increased exploitation -just ask anyone working in a FoxConn factory. As a result, our current food system is rife with exploitative practices, from production through to distribution, with racialized immigrants bearing the brunt. Meanwhile, there is evidence that automation tends to negatively impact already marginalized workers. The digital revolution in agriculture has a double edge. Smart farms bring promise, but automation in agricultural production and distribution will eliminate many jobs. Our concern is that the suite of jobs that remain will only deepen economic inequities - with more privileged university graduates receiving the bulk of the wellpaid work, while further stripping physical labourers of their power and dignity. There is no magic pill, but our governments do have options. Policy and legislation can shift the path of ag-tech to better support vulnerable farm workers and populations. In doing so, the looming issue of land ownership and repatriation must be addressed in Canada, with Indigenous nations at the head of the table alongside marginalized workers and farmers. Supporting pathways to farming and permanent residency for migrant workers, as well as training for digital skill-building can help to close more immediate gaps. We need to ready ourselves for how radical transformations in food production and distribution will impact land prices, property rights and working conditions. Our folksy view of farming is due for an update.

(\"PreveCeutical\") (CSE: PREV) (OTCQB: PRVCF) (FSE: 18H), announce today that Asterion's wholly-owned Australian subsidiary, Asterion Australia Pty Ltd, has been awarded Major Project Status for Asterion's Toowoomba Medicinal Cannabis Project (the \"Toowoomba Project\" or the \"Facility\") by the Australia Federal Government. Asterion's CEO, Stephen Van Deventer, welcomed the announcement by the Australian Federal Industry, Innovation and Science Minister, Hon Karen Andrews MP, and stated: \"Asterion chose Australia to develop the world's largest medicinal cannabis glasshouse because of the Australian Government's ambition to become the world's largest exporter of cannabis products for medicinal purposes, as announced by the Australian Federal Health Minister Hon Greg Hunt MP in January 2018.\" Mr. Van Deventer continued: \"Asterion looks forward to working with the Federal and Queensland Governments and the Toowoomba Council throughout the development process, to deliver the largest and most technically advanced glasshouse in the world to the south eastern Queensland community and to deliver the finest quality in medical cannabis products to patients.\" Major Project Status recognises the strategic significance of the Toowoomba Project to Australia, and provides coordination and facilitation support as well as a single-entry point to a coordinated approvals process. In order for the Toowoomba Project to have been considered for Major Project Status, it had to meet the Major Project Status requirements, including an estimated investment of AUD $50 million or more, strategic significance to Australia and certain Australian government approvals. The project proponent must also have the financial resources to complete the approvals process and the project must have reasonable commercial viability. Toowoomba Project The Toowoomba Project will be located on 75 hectares in Toowoomba adjacent to the Wellcamp Airport. The Facility is expected to be built to European Union Good Manufacturing Practices for medicinal products (EU-GMP) standards and, when complete, is planned to include a 40 hectare (4.3 million square feet) state-of-the-art glasshouse for cultivation and processing, in addition to a research centre and manufacturing facility, including administration and staff facilities. The Toowoomba Project is expected to be among the largest glasshouse facilities globally. The Facility is also expected to have the most advanced glasshouse cultivation technologies, including AI and robotics, and set new benchmarks in productivity, control, product quality and consistency. The Facility is anticipated to employ a state of the art security systems and implement best practice procedures to ensure the physical security of production and shipping, as well as traceability of products after shipment. A three-stage establishment plan for the Toowoomba Project is expected to be implemented commencing in the last quarter of 2019, with a total capital cost in the approximate amount of $450 million. A total daily direct workforce of an estimated 800 workers will be employed with an additional 300 part time and shift-based positions. These positions range from semi-skilled workers through to scientists undertaking advanced research in both medicines and horticulture. It is estimated that annual production from the Facility will be approximately 500,000 kg of medicinal cannabis product, having an export value in excess of $1 billion, with approximately 20,000 plants harvested per day. Research and Development Asterion is working with PreveCeutical and UniQuest Pty Limited on the development of new medical applications for cannabis in both preventative and treatment applications.

(TSX:UR) (\"UrtheCast\" or the \"Company\") today announces financial results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2018. 2018 Financial Results     Revenue for the fiscal year 2018 was $15.6 million compared to $40.4 million in 2017. Earth observation revenue of $9.4 million in 2018 increased by $1.6 million compared to the previous year, primarily due to recognizing the first tranche of revenue associated with the previously announced multi-million dollar consortium contract with the European Space Agency. Revenue from engineering and value-added services was $6.2 million in 2018 and declined by $26.4 million compared to 2017, primarily due to a change in the expected completion date of one of our customer contracts. Operating costs of $79.8 million in 2018 included approximately $7.9 million of certain non-recurring expenses, including severance, bad debt expense, and costs relating to a special committee of the board, which has since been discontinued. Fixed operating costs, excluding these one-time expenses, have been reduced by approximately $5.0 million, or 14%, year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA, excluding one-time costs, was negative $15.8 million in 2018 compared to negative $1.6 million in 2017. The decrease was largely attributable to lower revenue and was partly offset by approximately $5.0 million of lower fixed operating costs, as described above, and a $5.2 million decrease in variable costs. The net loss in 2018 was $83.3 million, which increased compared to the net loss of $31.8 million in 2017. Current year results were impacted by $54.5 million of adjustments required for accounting purposes that are substantially non-cash, including $20.4 million of asset impairment charges, a $5.5 million reversal of deferred tax assets, and a significant portion of the $28.6 million of net finance costs. Donald Osborne, CEO of UrtheCast, commented, \"The results this past quarter continue to reflect the major restructuring that is underway at UrtheCast. As expected, we saw a number of one-time costs as well as significant non-cash charges in the fourth quarter. We have also started to see a reduction to our fixed cost base and have taken a number of other important steps to strengthen the business, including acquiring Geosys, a world-leader in geoanalytics in the agriculture industry, and commencing a 13-year services contract with Geosys' former parent company, Land O'Lakes, which will generate more than US$10 million of annual revenue for UrtheCast. Additionally, we are in advanced discussions to sell the assets of our Deimos operations. The proceeds from this sale will be used to reduce our debt and improve working capital. We believe that these measures, among others, will unlock value for our shareholders by putting UrtheCast in a position to start delivering positive EBITDA during 2019 and ultimately by enabling us to secure financing and move into the build-phase of the transformational UrtheDaily Constellation.\" Outlook & Going Concern We refer you to the Company's consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 and the related Management's Discussion & Analysis for further details relating to the Company's liquidity position.

The voluntary program certifies nutrient service providers in the Western Lake Erie Basin and across Ontario that apply or make recommendations on fertilizers in accordance with 4R Nutrient Stewardship principles which refers to using the Right Source of nutrients at the Right Rate, at the Right Time and in the Right Place. Program participants must go through an independent, third-party audit of 37 standards to demonstrate they not only understand 4R principles, but also follow them. We are committed as a co-operative to the 4R Nutrient Stewardship program and very honoured to be only one of two retailers in Canada to achieve certified status, says John Nooyen, AGRIS Co-operative board president. Our board of directors unanimously adopted and supports the 4R Nutrient Stewardship Program and we proudly display our own AGRIS 4R Nutrient Stewardship Pledge at each of our locations. Now that Cottam has achieved certified status, we are planning to have the rest of our locations certified too, added Nooyen. Becoming 4R certified was a way for us to provide added value to our grower customers, says Alex Michinski, Essex area manager with AGRIS Co-operative. Because the program gives us the tools to provide growers with 4R `best management practices` they can be confident in, added Michinski. AGRIS has demonstrated a proud history of providing both leadership and environmental stewardship. In 2017 AGRIS Co-operative was presented with the prestigious Environmental Respect Award from DuPont, which recognizes environmental stewardship and sustainability through employee training, education, product safety, waste minimization and emergency response readiness. In 2016 AGRIS Co-operative was presented with the 4R Nutrient Stewardship Ag Retailer of the year award by the Canadian Association of Agri-Retailers.

This award recognizes crop sales specialists for their work with farmers, using the 4Rs approach to nutrient stewardship, assisting growers with fertilizer management and implementing a nitrogen monitoring program. In 2015 AGRIS Co-operative started doing Farmland Health Checkup as part of a pilot project introduced through The Ontario Soil and Crop Improvement Association. This program has a certified crop advisor working together with the farmer and looking at best management practices on specific fields on their farm. Using 4R Nutrient Stewardship, we can help our customers fully realize the benefits of this program with responsible and effective and profitable planning, says Jim Campbell, AGRIS Co-operative general manager. If we can help farmers to optimize crop yields and make sustainable contributions to Canadas agri-food sector, its a win for everyone, Campbell added. The 4R Certification Program is funded and guided under a 4R Ontario Steering Committee comprised of a diverse set of stakeholders from industry, government, conservation authorities and grower organizations including Fertilizer Canada, the Ontario Agri Business Association (OABA), Grain Farmers of Ontario (GFO), the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA), the Ontario Federation of Agriculture (OFA) and the Christian Farmers Federation of Ontario (CFFO) and Conservation Ontario. OABA congratulates AGRIS Co-operative Ltd. for being one of the first to have a crop retail location certified under the 4R program in Ontario. These certifications are indicative of the commitment and leadership being shown by crop retailers across the province in bringing 4R Nutrient Stewardship to Ontario farms, says Dave Buttenham, chief executive officer, Ontario Agri Business Association.

Recently MarketsInsider noted, \"Marijuana appears to be the fastest-growing job sector in the US, adding 64,389 full-time legal cannabis jobs in 2018, according to a new report from the cannabis website Leafly and the consultancy Whitney Economics, representing a 44% increase in total positions, which rose to 211,000.\" \"And that's not counting jobs indirectly related to the marijuana industry, like lawyers, accountants, security consultants, media companies, and marketing firms. With those included, the report said, there were 296,000 payrolls in the sector last year.\" One sector getting a major boost from cannabis is solar, due in part to the high energy requirements of indoor grow facilities and the cannabis industry as a whole. Village Farms International, Inc. (TSX:VFF) (OTCQX:VFFIF) first realized the advantages of solar in 2016, when they, SolarCity and MP2 Energy agreed to build a 2 megawatt solar array adjacent to Village Farm's 30 acre Permian Basin Division greenhouse in Monahans, Texas. The solar system provides the facility with nearly all of its daytime electricity needs, and will generate more than 82 million kilowatt-hours of power over the life of the system. SinglePoint (OTC: SING), a technology and investment company with a focus on acquiring companies that will benefit from the injection of growth capital and technology integration in the mobile payments, ancillary cannabis services and blockchain solutions, recently announced signing an asset purchase agreement to acquire Direct Solar and AI Live Transfers. The two companies are providing what has been described as 'the Lending Tree Model for solar business.' With the proposal of The Green New Deal, solar is at the forefront of every conversation and will continue to be top of mind as the nation grows through an \"energy shift\" to renewable resources such as solar. According to Zion Market Research, the global Solar Panel Market accounted for USD $30.8 Billion in 2016 and is expected to reach USD $57.3 billion by 2022 growing at a CAGR of 10.9% between 2017 and 2022. Cannabis producer FSD Pharma Inc. (CSE: HUGE) (OTC: FSDDF) and Solarvest BioEnergy Inc., a technology company which has developed an algal-based flexible production platform capable of producing health products, recently announced that they have signed a non-binding letter of intent to enter into a definitive agreement in which Solarvest would conduct research using its algal expression technology to develop pharma-grade cannabinoids. The Parties would make mutual investments into one another and Solarvest would grant FSD Pharma an exclusive license over a subset of the Project Cannabinoids and certain royalty rights over all of the other Project Cannabinoids. \"If successful, this could dramatically disrupt current cannabis cultivation methods for medical purposes. It could reduce the majority of time, space and costs associated with cannabis cultivation for medical purposes, specifically cannabis with GMP Certification. We are very pleased to collaborate with Solarvest on the development of promising alternative methods of cannabinoid production using algal technology\" said Zeeshan Saeed, President and Founder of FSD Pharma. \"We have been impressed by Solarvest's management knowledge and operations and believe that future commercial production of cannabinoids using their algal-based production platform combined with our proposed investment in Solarvest have the potential to create significant value for our shareholders.\" Braingrid Limited (CSE:BGRD) (OTC:BGRDF), a global provider of affordable, scalable and easy-to-deploy sensor platforms for precision agriculture is adopting solar in a different way, having announced the first commercial deployment of its innovative, self-powered Sentroller S precision agriculture technology at Canadian licensed producer WeedMD Inc.'s modern greenhouse facility, located in Strathroy, Ontario. Sentroller S brings all the great features of Braingrid's original Sentroller platform to cultivators including quick installation, online dashboards and reports, as well as email alarm notifications. This allows growers the peace of mind that their cannabis crops are safe and thriving. The self-powered Sentroller S uses a solar panel that enables an even quicker install and limitless possibilities for sensor placement. This true wireless freedom helps cultivators monitor growing conditions where it matters - in and around the plant canopy where power connections are not often available. With more cultivation and processing facilities going into construction every week, the high energy demands placed on energy grids, or the need for microgrid solutions are expected to have a huge influence on the solar energy sector. Continued in part 2 of this serie,s we look at how not only solar, but many other ancillary sectors are being boosted by rapid growth in the cannabis sector.

Management commentary \"Two thousand eighteen was a transformative year for AgJunction as we shifted our entire focus to providing autosteering solutions that are effective, easy to use and affordable for all farmers,\" said Dave Vaughn, president and chief executive officer of AgJunction. \"To deliver on this objective, we introduced our revolutionary new Wheelman product in the third quarter. This product delivers a complete and affordable autosteering system designed to be installed by a farmer in less than one hour and is powered by our proprietary Whirl software, which precisely steers farming equipment while providing data to better inform farmers on improving efficiency practices. \"Given our sharpened focus, we sold our Outback Guidance and Satloc businesses in the latter half of 2018 to ensure all our resources were being dedicated to providing farmers with the most affordable and highest-quality autosteering solutions. We also licensed a portion of our technology to Hemisphere GNSS and Raven Industries earlier in the year as the commercialization of our extensive patent portfolio remains an important component of our strategy going forward. \"During the fourth quarter, several headwinds and uncertainties remained in the worldwide agriculture market, given higher tariffs and lower grain prices. Amid these market challenges, it has become imperative for all farms to have the necessary tools to remain profitable. Autosteering is the foundation of precision agriculture and is a critical device necessary to reduce input costs and increase crop yields. It is our goal to provide millions of small farms with an inexpensive solution to bolster harvest profitability. \"In effort to expand our offerings to more farmers, in the fourth quarter, we signed a long-term agreement with Mahindra, the world's largest tractor company by volume. This agreement gives Mahindra access to our world-class engineering team and technology while providing AgJunction the opportunity to significantly expand into Asia and other strategic markets through Mahindra's supply chain and extensive global presence. \"Looking to 2019, we will continue to benefit from the bulk purchase order, announced in March, 2018, through the end of the second quarter. We also remain committed to marketing the new lineup of Wheelman products launched in early February, 2019, and will continue to invest in R&D [research and development] to enhance our portfolio of products available to all farmers at an affordable price.\" Fourth quarter 2018 financial results Total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2018 increased 73 per cent to $17.1-million, compared with $9.9-million in the fourth quarter of 2017. This was primarily driven by an increase in sales in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region associated with the previously disclosed bulk purchase order. Gross profit in the fourth quarter of 2018 increased 37 per cent to $5.3-million, compared with $3.9-million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Gross margin was 30.9 per cent, compared with 38.9 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2017. The margin decline was primarily due to a lower-margin mix of products associated with the bulk purchase order. Total operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2018 improved to $4.4-million, compared with $6.8-million in the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily driven by the capitalization of development costs and a decrease in employee compensation costs. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses declined significantly to 26 per cent, compared with 69.2 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2017 due to the increase in revenue. Net income in the fourth quarter of 2018 increased significantly to $3.1-million, or three cents per share, compared with a net loss of $2.7-million, or two cents per share, in the fourth quarter of 2017. The improvement was driven by the aforementioned increase in revenue, along with the decrease in total operating expenses. EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2018 increased to $3.7-million, compared with negative $2.5-million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the fourth quarter of 2018 totalled $21.4-million, compared with $13.9-million at the end of 2017. Working capital was $26.7-million, compared with $20.3-million at the end of 2017. The company continues to carry no debt and has access to its full $3-million line of credit. Full-year 2018 financial results Total revenue in 2018 increased 38 per cent to $64.5-million, compared with $46.8-million in 2017. This was driven by an increase in sales in the EMEA region associated with the bulk purchase order. Gross profit in 2018 increased 25 per cent to $23.8-million, compared with $19.4-million in 2017. Gross margin was 36.9 per cent, compared with 41.5 per cent in 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a lower-margin mix of products sold versus the prior period. Total operating expenses in 2018 increased slightly to $25.7-million, compared with $25.4-million in the prior year, primarily due to greater R&D costs associated with the company investing in improving and developing new products. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses in 2018 improved to 39.8 per cent, compared with 54.2 per cent in 2017. Net income in 2018 improved to $1.5-million, or one cent per share, compared with a net loss of $2.7-million, or two cents per share, in 2017.

(TSX: AJX) (\"AgJunction\" or the \"Company\"), the Autosteering Company(TM), is reporting financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2018. All currency amounts are expressed in U.S. dollars. Fourth Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights vs. Fourth Quarter 2017  Full Year 2018 Financial Highlights vs. 2017  Management Commentary \"2018 was a transformative year for AgJunction as we shifted our entire focus to providing autosteering solutions that are effective, easy-to-use and affordable for all farmers,\" said Dave Vaughn, president and CEO of AgJunction. \"To deliver on this objective, we introduced our revolutionary new Wheelman(TM) product in the third quarter. This product delivers a complete and affordable autosteering system designed to be installed by a farmer in less than one hour and is powered by our proprietary Whirl(TM) software, which precisely steers farming equipment while providing data to better inform farmers on improving efficiency practices. \"Given our sharpened focus, we sold our Outback Guidance(R) and Satloc(R) businesses in the latter half of 2018 to ensure all our resources were being dedicated to providing farmers with the most affordable and highest-quality autosteering solutions. We also licensed a portion of our technology to Hemisphere GNSS and Raven Industries earlier in the year as the commercialization of our extensive patent portfolio remains an important component of our strategy going forward. \"During the fourth quarter, several headwinds and uncertainties remained in the worldwide agriculture market given higher tariffs and lower grain prices. Amid these market challenges, it has become imperative for all farms to have the necessary tools to remain profitable. Autosteering is the foundation of precision agriculture and is a critical device necessary to reduce input costs and increase crop yields. It is our goal to provide millions of small farms with an inexpensive solution to bolster harvest profitability. \"In effort to expand our offerings to more farmers, in the fourth quarter we signed a long-term agreement with Mahindra, the world's largest tractor company by volume. This agreement gives Mahindra access to our world-class engineering team and technology, while providing AgJunction the opportunity to significantly expand into Asia and other strategic markets through Mahindra's supply chain and extensive global presence. \"Looking to 2019, we will continue to benefit from the bulk purchase order, announced in March 2018, through the end of the second quarter. We also remain committed to marketing the new lineup of Wheelman products launched in early February 2019 and will continue to invest in R&D to enhance our portfolio of products available to all farmers at an affordable price.\" Fourth Quarter 2018 Financial Results Total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2018 increased 73% to $17.1 million compared to $9.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. This was primarily driven by an increase in sales in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region associated with the previously disclosed bulk purchase order. Gross profit in the fourth quarter of 2018 increased 37% to $5.3 million compared to $3.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Gross margin was 30.9% compared to 38.9% in the fourth quarter of 2017. The margin decline was primarily due to a lower margin mix of products associated with the bulk purchase order. Total operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2018 improved to $4.4 million compared to $6.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily driven by the capitalization of development costs and a decrease in employee compensation costs. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses declined significantly to 26.0% compared to 69.2% in the fourth quarter of 2017 due to the increase in revenue. Net income in the fourth quarter of 2018 increased significantly to $3.1 million or $0.03 per share, compared to a net loss of $2.7 million or $(0.02) per share in the fourth quarter of 2017. The improvement was driven by the aforementioned increase in revenue, along with the decrease in total operating expenses. EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2018 increased to $3.7 million compared to $(2.5) million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the fourth quarter of 2018 totaled $21.4 million compared to $13.9 million at the end of 2017. Working capital was $26.7 million compared to $20.3 million at the end of 2017. The Company continues to carry no debt and has access to its full $3.0 million line of credit. Full Year 2018 Financial Results Total revenue in 2018 increased 38% to $64.5 million compared to $46.8 million in 2017. This was driven by an increase in sales in the EMEA region associated with the bulk purchase order. Gross profit in 2018 increased 25% to $23.8 million compared to $19.4 million in 2017. Gross margin was 36.9% compared to 41.5% in 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a lower margin mix of products sold versus the prior period. Total operating expenses in 2018 increased slightly to $25.7 million compared to $25.4 million in the prior year, primarily due to greater R&D costs associated with the Company investing in improving and developing new products. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses in 2018 improved to 39.8% compared to 54.2% in 2017. Net income in 2018 improved to $1.5 million or $0.01 per share, compared to a net loss of $2.7 million or $(0.02) per share in 2017. EBITDA in 2018 increased to $3.4 million compared to $(1.0) million in 2017.

Did you know that greenhouse gas is not actually gas coming from a greenhouse? It is a series of gases like methane and carbon dioxide, which act as a shield that traps heat in the Earth's atmosphere, much like the way a greenhouse retains heat. About 30 per cent of Canada's agricultural land is too hilly, rocky, cold, or wet to produce crops. But it can support grazing livestock, which don't compete with people for food grains. In all, about 80 per cent of the feed consumed by cattle, sheep, goats, and horses could not be eaten or digested by humans. Pork represents more than 40 per cent of total meat consumed and is the world's most widely eaten meat. Animals convert low-energy and otherwise indigestible plant matter into nutrient and protein rich food, while returning organic matter (manure) to the soil. This is the original recycling program. Agriculture includes science, technology and engineering. It is the genetics work used to improve the seeds and the animals that farmers purchase. It is the development, design, production and sales of everything farmers use - tractors, equipment, buildings, fertilizer and more. Soil is made of three things - sand, silt and clay. On their own, each has its benefits and challenges, but when mixed together to what is called a loam soil, they create a perfect growing environment for plants. The texture of the soil, how it looks and feels, depends upon the amount of each one in that particular soil. In all provinces across Canada, a voluntary program called the Environmental Farm Plan is helping farmers audit their operations for environmental concerns, as well as helping them set goals and timetables for improvements. In Ontario, around 70 per cent of our farmers have participated and have invested over $600 million in onfarm environmental improvements over the last 20 years. If you drove your car from Charlottetown, P.E.I., to Vancouver, B.C., you would use 540 litres of ethanol, produced from one-third of an acre of corn land, which is about the size of a Canadian football field. And with ethanol being a form of renewable energy, it emits less carbon dioxide than gasoline. Did you know that 100 acres of soybeans can produce enough soymilk for 500,000 people? Soybeans are an important ingredient for the production of crayons. One acre of soybeans can produce 82,368 crayons. Elevators in the Statue of Liberty use a soybean-based hydraulic fluid. Many farmers today rely on precision agriculture through satellite-controlled guidance through GPS on their tractors and equipment to manage their fieldwork, including planting, nutrient and crop protection application, and harvesting. It helps reduce fuel consumption, and helps farmers ensure more efficient use of nutrients, seeds, and crop protection products. Agriculture is so amazing and so quickly changing. The next five to 10 years will bring monumental changes to the farming world. --Think about this - Man's way leads to a hopeless end but God's way leads to an endless hope."}, {"title": "AJX AgJunction to release fiscal 2018 results March 21", "article": "AgJunction Inc (TSX:AJX) Shares Issued 119,085,010 Last Close 3/6/2019 $0.69 Thursday March 07 2019 - News Release Mr. Dave Vaughn reports AGJUNCTION SETS FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2018 CONFERENCE CALL FOR THURSDAY, MARCH 21, 2019, AT 11:00 A.M.

Analyst Sid Rajeev gives Agrios Global Holdings (CSE: AGRO) (FSE: 0SA) (OTCQB: AGGHF) a buy rating and a fair value estimate of $0.65 per share, a premium of 62.5% to the $0.40 closing price on January 15th, the day the report was issued. Agrios, an agricultural technology, services, and property management company, provides property and equipment on a lease basis, along with agronomy services, drawing on its proprietary technology to enhance the crop yields and quality of cannabis growers. Cannot view this video? Visit: The company owns a dedicated production facility in Shelton, Washington and has leased the canopy space to a Tier 3 cannabis producer. The 70,000 square-foot Shelton Facility consists of 30,000 square-feet of canopy growing space, 20,000 square-feet of processing space, with the remaining 20,000 square-feet dedicated to office, storage, mechanical and delivery space. Agrios uses a unique yield-enhancing cultivation technology known as aeroponics, whereby the plants grow without the use of soil, with their roots exposed, which are sprayed with a nutrient rich mist. This technology was first used by NASA to produce food in zero-gravity environments. In addition to the cost effectiveness and yield enhancing benefits of aeroponics, by collecting and analyzing a substantial number of data points per minute, from each cannabis plant, Agrios is able to quantify and measure every stage in the plant's life-cycle, from seed to sale. As a result of the integration of data science into its cultivation processes, Agrios reports that its crops exhibit average THC potency of 21.4%, well above the 14 to 15% average currently reported in Washington State. When fully operational, the Shelton facility has an implied yield of 183 grams per square-foot of growing canopy area, compared to Fundamental's estimated industry average of 120 grams per square-foot. Sid Rajeev, Fundament Research Analyst, stated: \"The economic potential of a precision agriculture technology such as aeroponics is vast, and not limited to a single high-value crop such as cannabis. Though the company's current operations are in the cannabis space, we expect that success at the company's current facility may result in expansion to other jurisdictions. We estimate the addressable precision agriculture market that the company could access with their aeroponics technology could be as large as $115 billion globally.\" Agrios does not directly operate the Shelton facility, nor does it derive income directly from the sales of cannabis, generating revenue from the tenant covering leasing fees on property and equipment, management/consulting fees, and royalty fees on its unique aeroponic technology.

Senator Cornyn and I worked on 300 million dollars for permanent mandatory funding to create a vaccine bank and we also have a new animal disease preparedness and response program. How is USDA coming along on these - is there any kind of plans to deploy them on a timeline?\" Klobuchar asked. Secretary Perdue responded: \"Undersecretary Ibach has been on top of this, even before the appropriations there in developing this strategy called a three legged stool. It deals with working our early discovery and detection with network labs all across there, working with our partners in the state and both the Mexico and Canada.

I was overruled by the Acting Administrator yesterday, who based on his confirmation hearings and his vote today I think has committed once again to drive his troops in order to get that done by June 1st and we'd encourage that.\" Klobuchar added: \"Well that's good news, and I bet your words were helpful trying to get it done.\" The 2018 Farm Bill includes several of Klobuchar's priorities, including provisions to create an animal disease vaccine bank and disaster response program, promote precision agriculture and broadband deployment, and provides more coverage and more flexible tools for dairy producers, and invest in renewable energy programs including the Rural Energy for America Program (REAP). Klobuchar introduced several bills and amendments to the 2018 Farm Bill that were included in the final text, including provisions to: * Invest in renewable energy by continuing mandatory funding levels for programs in the Energy Title ($625 million in mandatory funding over ten years); * Permanently authorize and provide $300 million in mandatory funding over ten years for an animal disease and disaster response program and a foot and mouth disease (FMD) vaccine bank to help to adequately address risks to animal health, livestock export markets, and industry economic stability, based on her legislation with Senator John Cornyn (R-TX); * Promote precision agriculture and target broadband deployment to the nation's farms and ranches, based on Klobuchar and Senator Roger Wicker's (R-MS) Precision Agriculture Connectivity Act; * Increase acreage in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) to 27 million acres and further expand and incentivize land transitions to beginning farmers, based on Klobuchar and Senator John Thune's (R-SD) Conservation Program Improvement Act; * Reduce the incentives to convert native sod to crop production by closing a loophole that allows certain non-insured, non-annual crops to circumvent the \"Sodsaver\" provision, based on Klobuchar and Senator John Thune's (R-SD) American Prairie Conservation Act; * Increase the caps on Farm Service Agency (FSA) loans to ensure farmers have access to capital and further target loans to beginning farmers and ranchers; * Encourage cross boundary management of forests to protect water resources, enhance wildlife habitat, restore forest health, and strengthen local economies, based on Klobuchar and Senator Steve Daines' (R-MT) Empowering State Forestry to Improve Forest Health Act; * Provide more coverage and more flexible tools for dairy farmers by allowing operations to cover margins up to $9.50 (previously there were no options at $8.50, $9.00, or $9.50) and allows each dairy operation that participated in the Margin Protection Program in 2014 - 2017 to receive a repayment of a portion of premiums paid over that time period as either a 50% direct refund or a 75% credit toward future premiums ($58 million in refunds). The repayment provision is based on an amendment that Klobuchar included in the Senate version of the bill; * Includes a mandated USDA report on Agriculture and Conservation Data that lays the groundwork for future administrative or legislative action, based on Klobuchar and Senator John Thune's (R-SD) Agriculture Data Act. As a senior member of the Senate Agriculture Committee and a 2014 Farm Bill Conference Committee member, Klobuchar successfully pushed for key provisions in the last Farm Bill - including measures to support rural development projects, conservation programs, agricultural research, and the Rural Energy for America Program (REAP)."}, {"title": "Ag AI is here, but will we ever be ready for the risks?", "article": "It's not whether autonomous tractors are possible, it's the liability if something goes wrong When it comes to precision agriculture, nothing looms larger in the discussions over implementation than the potential for autonomous implements. From the driverless tractor to the highly disruptive DOT, which replaces the tractor altogether, it's widely believed that agriculture is on the tipping point of rapid uptake of this kind of technology. But is it really? For farmer and inventor Brian Tischler, the question isn't whether autonomous tractors are possible or useful -- it's how to overcome the liability risk if something goes wrong. Tischler told farmers attending the recent CropConnect conference in Winnipeg that building one's own self-driving vehicle is possible with about $1,000 of open-source software. He's among a few farmers on the Canadian Prairies to have done it. That feat, along with a few YouTube videos, including one of him skiing behind his driverless tractor, has made the Mannville, Alta., farmer a popular presenter on the winter meeting circuit over the past couple of years. He and his wife, Arvel, work with two business partners to operate Genetic Potential Ltd., a mixed farm raising cattle and multiple crops. Tischler does hardware development and programming as a hobby, making programs such as AgOpenGPS freely available through open-source hubs. He says it's his way of giving back. However, Tischler cautioned that being able to do something with technology isn't the same as saying you should do it. \"Is it cool? Yes. Is it possible? Yes. Question is, should we? That's the real question,\" he told about 200 farmers attending the session. There are lots of compelling reasons why autonomous implements could be helpful in agriculture, including more efficient use of human resources, better precision and even safety. The sensors and guidance systems in use today are much less likely to fail than humans who can tire, become distracted and make poor judgment calls. And unlike self-driving cars, farming takes place in low-traffic places with few people around. However, a human accidentally driving over someone with a tractor is viewed differently than an autonomous tractor hitting someone. In his view, that's the main reason why major farm equipment manufacturers are reluctant to bring autonomous machines to market, though they've had the capability since the 1990s. It's also why driverless cars are still hotly debated. \"Your insurance company is going to puke,\" he warned farmers who might be considering trying this at home. \"I've talked to my insurance company. I've spoken to a lawyer. It's obvious; you're responsible. The manufacturer is responsible if something goes wrong, everyone gets sued and it will destroy you. That's it.\" Tischler cited airbags made by the Japanese company Takata. While airbags have saved hundreds of thousands of lives worldwide, a series of incidents in which people were killed by defective airbags made at one of the company's plants prompted global recalls and put the company out of business. He said the safety mechanisms on driverless vehicles can't just be about shutting down software if something goes wrong, they must be able to address a scenario in which something as simple as the clutch fails to engage. \"This is definitely not a case of replacing a driver with a remote control. It has to be able to think and drive its surroundings electronically and mathematically and react and keep safe and keep out of trouble,\" he said. \"It's got to work and it's got to be proven to be working.\" He noted self-driving cars have the potential to reduce the number of people killed in traffic accidents -- the equivalent today of a 737 crashing every hour. \"But if they take one life because it is self-driving, that's the end of that company, which is irony at its best,\" he said. \"So, it is the same in agriculture. \"The technology is there and the software is there -- the question is, should we? And how much trouble are we going to get into?\" It's a dilemma. The potential for artificial intelligence has far surpassed our human abilities to do things better, faster and safer. Yet, despite layer upon layer of safeguards, life will never be risk-free. Laura Rance is editorial director of Glacier FarmMedia.

The innovation centre was asking SDG to contribute $500,000 over 10 years to help support the expansion of its Ontario Emerging Jobs Institute. If it doesn't get enough community support, it could jeopardize its attempt to get millions in government grants. The pitch went over like a lead balloon. Councillors said they felt the presentation was extremely lacking in data, a business plan with concrete goals, or guarantees the money would be spent properly. \"I have nothing against the innovation centre, but I have concerns about who they are, what they are doing, and why they are doing it. I'm not clear on what measurables they are going to have ... I'm not sure if there will be any reporting on where those dollars are going,\" warned SDG CAO Tim Simpson. Several councillors shared Simpson's misgivings and seemed inclined to reject the request. In the end, council decided to accept a proposal by Coun. Carma Williams that would give the innovation centre one instalment of $50,000, but agreed any more funding would require a much more solid presentation next year. Couns. Bryan McGillis, Dave Smith and Tony Fraser voted against. \"There's an economic development opportunity that they have put in front of us that can help lead us in a direction that we need to go. Unfortunately, I agree their proposal was weak,\" said Williams. \"But if they are unsuccessful in getting this federal funding, the project will stop and all their work will have been for nothing.\" Martha Woods from the Eastern Ontario Training Board and Lesley Thompson from the Cornwall and the Counties Community Futures Development Corp. came to make the case for the contribution, starting off by highlighting several local companies are busing in workers to fill chronic labour shortages, or are deciding not to expand their operations in Cornwall because of the lack of skilled workers. \"Olymel, for example, is busing in between 100 and 120 people every day from Gatineau to Montreal. We have Single Point Access wants to expand into the Waterloo region because they can't find the right talent locally. We have Ross Video, which has moved their computer design operations to Ottawa because they couldn't find the right people,\" said \"This is just the tip of the iceberg; every company has some kind of issue with finding skilled labour.\" The Ontario Emerging Jobs Institute was announced in January and proposes to fix the region's labour gaps by bringing entire industries (digital, agriculture, entrepreneurship, logistics, transport and aerospace) together into consortiums to design their own education curricula to train people for the specific jobs they have trouble filling. That training would then be offered by other institute partners, such as St. Lawrence College or the Nav Centre. After getting a seed grant from the Province of Ontario in 2018, the idea has caught the attention of the federal government, which invited it to \"very quickly\" submit an application for grant money amounting to up to $5 million until 2023. The deadline for the application was Tuesday. ahale@postmedia.com twitter.com/alan_s_hale"}, {"title": "Robot builder wants to put Canada on the map; has developed an autonomous robot for precision agriculture applications", "article": "Sougata Pahari is a numbers kind of person. There are the numbers, for instance, that drew him to Canada -two million fresh water lakes, more than the rest of the world combined; 9,000 trees per Canadian, the most in the world; Canada's top 10 rankings on the World Happiness Index and the Prosperity Index. \"I made a list of all countries where I could see a future and Canada came consistently on top,\" said Pahari, who grew up on farms in India and Nigeria and studied materials engineering in Italy. The number Pahari now keeps in mind is 55, the average age of Canadian farmers, an age where things get harder. \"That's the right time for farmers to start investing in automation so they can continue doing what they love for a longer duration,\" said Pahari. Co-founder and chief executive of Korechi Innovations Inc., a company he launched in Ontario just three months after he arrived in Canada in March 2016, Pahari has developed an autonomous robot he thinks will appeal to an agriculture sector looking to reduce labour requirements. \"It is not designed to completely replace labour, it is meant to augment capabilities so a single person can do a lot more,\" he said. Dubbed RoamIO, the dual tracked robot has the capacity to carry 300 kilograms and pull l 1,500 kilograms. Running on battery power alone, the robot can operate e for four hours. It can also be equipped with a gas-powered electric generator that will extend its run time to 24 hours before e needing to be refuelled. \"You can literally leave it and come back this time tomorrow and it will still be running. Top it up with another five gallons of gasoline and it will continue working,\" said Pahari. The guidance system for RoamIO is separate from the Internet, which makes it almost impossible for someone to hack the system, he said. Pahari said the robot can be adapted to a wide variety of agricultural applications, including mowing, seeding, spreading fertilizer, aerating soils and soil mapping. \"It has an intuitive easy to use software interface where you can put in the shape of your field, choose which direction and how far apart, depending on the size of your implement, and then you can just hit go.\" Korechi is looking at expanding the robot's capabilities with the addition of visual sensors that could detect crop diseases. While RoamIO performs some of the functions of a tractor, it has the advantage of low soil compaction, less than two pounds per square inch when it is fully loaded, Pahari said. Pahari calculates that an orchard or vineyard operator just using the robot for mowing, fertilizing and aerating would realize a return on investment in two seasons. For a golf course, the payback would be just one year, he said. His startup company sold its first unit to Niagara College and is looking for investment to scale up. \"We believe there is a big space for this. The need for robotics in agriculture is definitely there and we want to be pioneers. We want to put Canada on that map,\" he said."}, {"title": "CropConnect captures farming's fertile future", "article": "Roaming the hallways and meeting rooms of this week's CropConnect Conference in Winnipeg offered an interesting snapshot of the state of farming in this province. CropConnect is a two-day conference put on by a consortium of nine commodity groups that decided a few years back it was getting too hard to jostle for space on farmer calendars for their annual meetings. After all, farmers who grow canola also grow other crops, and there are only so many meetings one can handle -- especially with many farmers also engaged in off-farm work. By pooling their resources, these groups are able to bring in a better lineup of guest speakers and get more people out to a free lunch during their required annual business sessions. Plus, anyone working as a professional agronomist in this industry must demonstrate that they are continuously learning in order to maintain their credentials. They can attend sessions at an event like this and pick up \"certified crop adviser\" credits. The first thing that confronted me walking in the door was the sea of young faces at the sold-out event. Granted, in agriculture, \"young\" is a relative term. The average age of farmers in Canada is 55. But the 2016 Census of Agriculture captured some subtle shifts in farm demographics that suggest the pace of intergenerational transfer is starting to pick up. Farmers under the age of 35 now make up 9.1 per cent of the farm operators in Canada, up from 8.2 per cent in 2011. Along with the increase in proportion, their absolute numbers increased by about three per cent, the first increase since 1991. It's clear that many of them find this event, with its mix of intel and entertainment, a good way to spend a couple of days during the cold winter months. While there are more women than ever before working in the sector, it's still pretty much a man's game, judging from the turnout at an event like this. Precision and digital farming topics are getting lots of traction as farmers begin to grasp the vast potential. However, a couple of sessions during the jam-packed agenda at the conference strayed from the usual banquet of upbeat, how-to and take-charge presentations. One was a session on mental health, a topic that has loomed large on conference agendas since a group formed the non-profit Do More Agriculture Foundation to raise awareness about mental health issues among farmers. As with the rest of society, mental health issues can fly below the radar of those surrounding a person who is suffering. What makes it more problematic in rural communities is that people are often isolated geographically and socially. Farming culture tends to play up the notion of strong and independent types -- which makes those experiencing depression less willing to risk being seen as weak. The other was a session with a lawyer spelling out what rural property owners can and cannot do when it comes to protecting themselves from trespassers and thieves. The much-publicized confrontation in a Saskatchewan farmyard in 2016 that left one person dead and a farmer charged with second-degree murder left a deep imprint in the minds of people on both sides of the incident. In that case, a jury acquitted the farmer. But those attending this session were cautioned against using force to deter invaders unless they feel their lives are in danger. \"I think there are a lot of misconceptions out there when it comes to protecting property,\" lawyer Lisa LaBossiere told the packed meeting room. There's no question farmers feel vulnerable, again because they often live isolated from support services. Managing their day-to-day operations involves huge investments in \"stuff\" such as tools, implements and vehicles that thieves like to target. Keeping their things secure is secondary only to protecting their families from criminal elements who are increasingly brash. It seems the trends of consolidation and growth that have made farming an attractive business for young people to consider have also made the farm a lonelier place to be. It gives new meaning to the notion of tough times on the farm. Laura Rance is editorial director at Glacier FarmMedia.

The new lineup from AgJunction includes the Wheelman Pro and Wheelman Flex powered by the Whirl (TM) app. Starting at just $3995, each Wheelman comes with everything a farmer needs for easy installation and operation (install kit, IMU, smart antenna, universal cable), at no additional cost. And, the Wheelman Flex offers an additional benefit allowing farmers to easily move and use the autosteer system between other equipment, further reducing the overall cost of outfitting a farming operation with autosteering. The Whirl app, the brains behind Wheelman autosteering, is a free download for iOS and Android devices. Whirl allows farmers to use their existing smart devices (phone, tablet, etc.) as the display, eliminating the need to buy a custom display, which can easily cost up to $8,000. \"We believe that all farmers should prosper, and with autosteering, farmers can reduce input costs and increase yields,\" said Jeff Morris, AgJunction chief marketing officer. \"Farmers that have invested in Precision Ag equipment continue to experience lower cost and higher yields, helping them cope with the effects of higher tariffs and lower grain prices. With the new Wheelman lineup, our mission is to bring the benefits of Precision Ag, currently available to only the largest farm operations, to the millions of smaller farms around the world.\" \"I've been in the market for a guidance system for my 1978 tractor for a period of time. All the major brands were more expensive than I wanted to spend on that old tractor,\" said Chris Denton, who farms near La Denton, Kentucky. \"When I discovered Wheelman could be purchased for half the money and I could install it right out of the box, I was sold!\" Farmers attending this year's National Farm Machinery Show in Louisville, Kentucky, can see a demo of Wheelman at work. It will be on display at the Machinery Pete Update on Thursday, February 14 at 10 a.m. in South Wing B 105 of the convention center.

Although Weber was one of the first exhibitors to take part in the Precision Ag Conference when it was established five years ago in London, Ontario, the award came as a complete surprise to him. According to wife Bernice Weber, the Builders Award is in recognition of those that are early cutting-edge entrepreneurs that embrace innovations that enhance the agricultural sector. \"They recognize someone who was an early adopter of new technology or new ways of thought in agriculture,\" Bernice said. \"Felix has had a consistent history of that... he's very good at analyzing what's out there and what's effective for the industry.\" The Precision Ag Conference began five years ago in response to the growth occurring in the Precision Agriculture sector spurred by dramatic technological advances, and industry innovation. From the first year of around 150 attendees, the 2019 Farms.com Precision Agriculture Conference & Ag Technology Showcase has expanded to move to the London Convention Centre welcoming more than 450 attendees and expanding the tradeshow, increasing networking opportunities for agri-businesses, farm retailers and farmers interested in how precision agriculture will impact their bottom line and productivity on their farm. \"I'm always interested in checking out something new when I see a value behind it,\" Felix said. \"You're looking at if there's an opportunity to bring value and look into the research.\" President and founder of Ag Business & Crop Inc. since 2005, Felix has been involved with GIS and geomatics in agriculture and other industries for years. Initially as a consultant, Weber was an early adopter of new technologies while researching for effective ways to monitor crops using aerial imagery, and has since become the distributor for senseFly products, one of the top drone manufacturers in the world. \"I am grateful for the recognition of Farms.com and the Precision Ag Conference with this award,\" Weber said. \"It is through the teamwork of valued collaborators such as Steve Redmond from Redmond Agronomic Services that we can continue to bring innovative products and services to the Agricultural sector in Ontario and across Canada. I am truly humbled by this recognition from my peers.\" Ag Business & Crop Inc. works with clients across the country in agricultural and commercial enterprises that use precision agriculture tools and drones, and has been involved with educational institutions assisting with various research projects. This is not the first time that Ag Business & Crop Inc. has been recognized for outstanding achievement, as the business was recognized in the Globe and Mail Small Business Challenge as one of the ten top regional winners across Canada in 2016. Felix is also the first internationally trained agrologist to achieve the Technical Agrologist designation from the Ontario Institute of Agrology, and has been recognized by representatives from both the provincial and federal governments for his expertise in the agricultural sector."}, {"title": "Nutrien Demonstrates Resilience in a Quarter Impacted by Weather Challenges; Expects Higher Earnings Again in 2019", "article": " Nutrien Ltd. (Nutrien) announced today its 2018 fourth-quarter results, with net earnings from continuing operations of $296 million(1) ($0.48(2) per share). Fourth-quarter adjusted net earnings was $0.54 per share(3) and adjusted EBITDA(3,4) was $932 million. 2018 adjusted net earnings was $2.69 per share and adjusted EBITDA was $3.94 billion. For a description of adjusted net earnings and adjusted EBITDA, please see page 2 and 32. \"Nutrien delivered excellent operational and strategic results in 2018, and we see further opportunities for significant earnings growth and business improvement in 2019. We delivered a 32 percent increase in earnings, exceeded Merger synergy targets and received $5.3 billion in net proceeds from the sale of equity investments. We remain focused on prudent capital allocation, having already returned $2.8 billion to shareholders, while investing in our global retail network and maintaining a strong balance sheet. Our results this quarter demonstrate the resilience in our earnings and cash flow, given this was one of the wettest fall seasons in the US in over 100 years. For 2019, we expect strong crop input demand in the first half of the year due to the limited application window in the fall of 2018, a recent improvement in crop prices and higher corn acres in the US,\" commented Chuck Magro, Nutrien's President and CEO. HIGHLIGHTS  ADJUSTED NET EARNINGS RECONCILIATION  MARKET OUTLOOK Agriculture and Retail  Potash  Nitrogen  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Nutrien Demonstrates Resilience in a Quarter -2- Phosphate  FINANCIAL OUTLOOK AND GUIDANCE Based on the market factors detailed above, we are issuing 2019 adjusted net earnings guidance of $2.80 to $3.20 per share and adjusted EBITDA guidance of $4.4 to $4.9 billion. Our guidance incorporates the impact of the IFRS 16 - Leases standard which we expect to increase adjusted EBITDA by approximately $225 million, with the largest impact in Nitrogen and Retail. In addition, we anticipate the implementation of this standard could increase finance costs by approximately $30 million. Potash sales volumes are expected to range between 13.0 to 13.4 million tonnes and Potash EBITDA between $1.8 to $2.0 billion. Retail EBITDA is expected to range between $1.3 to $1.4 billion. Nitrogen sales volumes are forecast between 10.6 to 11.0 million tonnes and Nitrogen EBITDA between $1.3 to $1.5 billion. In 2019, ammonium sulfate will be reclassified to the Nitrogen segment, resulting in an approximately $50 million increase in Nitrogen EBITDA. Phosphate EBITDA is expected between $0.2 to $0.3 billion with the reclassification of ammonium sulfate. Depreciation and amortization is expected to range from $1.8 to $1.9 billion including the impact of higher depreciation from the IFRS 16 - Leases standard (approximately $200 million) and from the fair valuing of Agrium's assets (approximately $350 million). We anticipate an effective tax rate of 24 to 26 percent, which is up slightly compared to the 2018 rate excluding the New Brunswick impairment, due to announced changes from some foreign tax authorities, most notably in the US. Excluded from adjusted net earnings per share and adjusted EBITDA are integration and synergy costs ($50 to $75 million) and share-based compensation. The impact of the incremental depreciation and amortization resulting from the fair valuing of Agrium's assets is no longer excluded from guidance. All annual guidance numbers, including those noted above, are outlined in the table below:  (a) Potash and nitrogen sales tonnes include manufactured product only. Nitrogen sales tonnes exclude ESN(R) and Rainbow products. FOURTH-QUARTER RESULTS The comparative figures throughout this release are the historical combined results of legacy Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc. (PotashCorp) and Agrium Inc. (Agrium) for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and are considered to be non-IFRS measures. For International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) purposes, the comparative amounts are the results of PotashCorp, which is the accounting acquirer. Compared to the IFRS figures, period over period changes are primarily the result of the merger involving Agrium and PotashCorp. Refer to the Selected Non-IFRS Financial Measures and Reconciliations and Supplemental Information section. Consolidated  Nutrien's fourth-quarter net earnings from continuing operations totaled $296 million, up from the $93 million loss in the fourth quarter of 2017. This year's quarter was supported by strong operational results, higher total crop nutrient sales volumes and prices, as well as, the continued benefit of synergy realization. Total gross margin improved 25 percent, excluding the impact of a $276 million non-cash impairment in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to our Phosphate and Sulfate segment. Earnings this quarter were impacted by an extremely wet and cold fall season in the US which limited crop nutrient and crop protection application. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $88 million this quarter, in part due to the merger-related purchase price allocation (PPA) impact. Retail  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Nutrien Demonstrates Resilience in a Quarter -3-  Potash  Nitrogen  Overall gas costs were slightly lower than the fourth quarter of last year, despite an increase in NYMEX gas prices. This was due to lower AECO prices and the lower realized derivative impact in the fourth quarter of 2018 versus 2017.

The Company's investment in Israel Chemicals Ltd. (\"ICL\") was classified as held for sale at December 31, 2017 and the divestiture of all equity interests in ICL was completed on January 24, 2018. (See Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements)  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Nutrien Demonstrates Resilience in a Quarter -7-  1. Significant Accounting Policies On January 1, 2018, Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc. (\"PotashCorp\") and Agrium Inc. (\"Agrium\") combined their businesses in a transaction by way of a plan of arrangement (the \"Merger\") by becoming wholly owned subsidiaries of a new parent company named Nutrien Ltd. (collectively with its subsidiaries, known as \"Nutrien\" or \"the Company\" except to the extent the context otherwise requires). Nutrien is the world's largest provider of crop inputs and services. The Company's accounting policies are in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (\"IFRS\"). The accounting policies and methods of computation used in preparing these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are consistent with those used in the preparation of Nutrien's first quarter 2018 unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements (\"first quarter financial statements\"). PotashCorp is the acquirer for accounting purposes, and as a result, figures and related notes for 2017 and prior reflect the historical operations of PotashCorp. The financial statements and related notes of Nutrien in 2018 and beyond reflect the consolidated operations of Nutrien. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Nutrien and its subsidiaries; however, they do not include all disclosures normally provided in annual consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the Company's first quarter financial statements. The Company's annual consolidated financial statements for 2018 will include additional information under IFRS in its Annual Report in February 2019. In management's opinion, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments necessary to present fairly such information. 2. Business Combinations As described in Note 1, PotashCorp and Agrium combined their businesses in a merger of equals. Further information relating to the merger of equals was previously described in Note 2 of the Company's first quarter financial statements. The Company engaged independent valuation experts to assist in determining the fair value of certain assets acquired, liabilities assumed and related deferred income tax impacts. The final fair value that was allocated to Agrium's assets and liabilities based upon fair values is as follows:  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Nutrien Demonstrates Resilience in a Quarter -8-  2. Business Combinations (continued) Retail Acquisitions During the year, the Retail segment acquired 53 farm centers in North America and Australia and companies operating within the digital agriculture, proprietary products, and agricultural services business. Benefits of the acquisitions include expansion of geographical coverage for the sale of crop input products, increased customer base and workforce, continued growth in the digital agricultural field and synergies between Nutrien and the acquired businesses. The values allocated to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities based upon fair values were as follows:  3. Segment Information The Company has four reportable operating segments: Retail, Potash, Nitrogen, and Phosphate and Sulfate. The Retail segment distributes crop nutrients, crop protection products, seed and merchandise and provides services directly to growers through a network of farm centers in North and South America and Australia. The Potash, Nitrogen, and Phosphate and Sulfate segments are differentiated by the chemical nutrients contained in the products that each produces. In 2019, the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker under IFRS reassessed product groupings and decided to evaluate the performance of sulfate products as part of the Nitrogen segment, rather than the Phosphate and Sulfate segment; therefore, future comparative figures will be restated for the change in the composition of the segments, which will result in an increase in the Nitrogen segment and a decrease in the Phosphate and Sulfate segment. For the year ended December 31, 2018, this change will be approximately $121, $42, and $69 in sales, gross margin and earnings (loss) from continuing operations before finance costs, income taxes and depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\"), respectively.  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Nutrien Demonstrates Resilience in a Quarter -9-  5. Income Tax (Expense) Recovery A separate estimated average annual effective income tax rate was determined for each taxing jurisdiction and applied individually to the income (loss) from continuing operations for each jurisdiction.  The actual effective tax rate on ordinary earnings for the three months ended December 31, 2018 increased compared to the same period last year due to significantly higher earnings in high tax rate jurisdictions. The actual effective tax rate on ordinary earnings for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 increased compared to the same period last year. The impairment of the New Brunswick property, plant and equipment during third-quarter 2018 resulted in a 48 percentage point increase in the actual effective tax rate. In addition, there were significantly higher earnings in high tax rate jurisdictions in 2018 compared to 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2017, a deferred tax recovery of $187 was recorded as a result of a federal income tax rate decrease pursuant to US tax reform legislation. In the fourth quarter of 2017, a deferred tax expense of $68 was recorded to reflect Saskatchewan government legislation that reversed a provincial income tax rate decrease legislated earlier in the year. A $68 deferred tax recovery had been recorded in the second quarter of 2017 to reflect that rate decrease.  6. Discontinued Operations The Company's investments in Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile S.A. (\"SQM\"), ICL and Arab Potash Company (\"APC\") were classified as held for sale and as discontinued operations in December 2017, due to regulatory requirements to dispose of these investments in connection with the Merger. (MORE TO FOLLOW) Nutrien Demonstrates Resilience in a Quarter -10- As of December 31, 2018, the Company completed all required divestitures as outlined below:  8. Share Capital Share repurchase program On February 20, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program of up to five percent of the Company's outstanding common shares over a one-year period through a normal course issuer bid. On December 14, 2018, the normal course issuer bid was increased to permit the repurchase of up to eight percent of the Company's outstanding common shares. Purchases under the normal course issuer bid will be made through open market purchases at market price as well as by other means as may be permitted by applicable securities regulatory authorities, including private agreements. Purchases of common shares commenced on February 23, 2018 and will expire on the earlier of February 22, 2019, the date on which the Company has acquired the maximum number of common shares allowable or the date on which the Company determines not to make any further repurchases. The following table summarizes the Company's share repurchases:  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Nutrien Demonstrates Resilience in a Quarter -11- As of February 5, 2019, an additional 5,617,962 common shares were repurchased for cancellation at a cost of $281 and an average price per share of $49.98.  8. Share Capital (continued) Anti-dilutive shares The diluted weighted average shares calculation excluded 658,000 stock options and 137,000 equity-settled performance share units for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, due to their anti-dilutive effect. 9. Comparative Figures As described in Note 1, the comparative figures are PotashCorp only. To conform with Nutrien's new method of presentation, comparative figures were reclassified as follows, with no impact to net earnings.  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Nutrien Demonstrates Resilience in a Quarter -12-  10. Subsequent Events As of January 1, 2019, the Company adopted I FRS 16 \"Leases\" which will result in approximately $1 billion of leases being brought on the balance sheet as \"right of use assets\" and an equal amount recognized for lease obligations. The expected impact on net earnings is minimal, based on leases currently outstanding, as the adoption of the standard is expected to result in a decrease in lease expenses of $225 (cost of goods sold \"COGS\" of $145 and selling expenses and general and administrative expenses of $80), an increase in depreciation and amortization of $190 (COGS of $130 and selling expenses and general and administrative expenses of $60), and an increase in finance costs of $30. The expected impact on EBITDA is an increase of $225. On February 5, 2019, Nutrien announced the planned acquisition of Actagro, LLC, a developer, manufacturer and marketer of environmentally sustainable soil and plant health products and technologies for an estimated purchase price of $340. Closing of the transaction is subject to US regulatory approval and is expected to be completed in the first half of 2019.  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Nutrien Demonstrates Resilience in a Quarter -13-  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Nutrien Demonstrates Resilience in a Quarter -14-  The Company uses both IFRS and certain non-IFRS measures to assess operational performance, to evaluate liquidity and financial strength, as a valuation measurement and/or as a component of employee remuneration. Non-IFRS measures are a numerical measure of a company's performance, that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS. In evaluating these measures, investors should consider that the methodology applied in calculating such measures may differ among companies and analysts. Management believes these non-IFRS measures provide transparent and useful supplemental information to investors in order that they may evaluate Nutrien's financial performance using the same measures as management. These non-IFRS financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, nor superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. The following outlines the Company's non-IFRS financial measures, their definitions, why management uses each measure and contains reconciliations to the most directly comparable measure under IFRS. Adjusted net earnings (and the related per share amounts) Most directly comparable IFRS financial measure: Net earnings (loss) from continuing operations and net earnings (loss) per share. Definition: Net earnings (loss) from continuing operations before purchase price allocation (\"PPA\"), impairment, Merger and related costs, share-based compensation, Curtailment Gain and dividend income from discontinued operations net of tax. Why the Company uses the measure and why it is useful to investors: Focuses on the performance of the Company's day-to-day operations excluding the effects of non-operating items. The reconciliation of adjusted net earnings (and the related per share amounts) is included on page 2. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Potash Adjusted EBITDA Most directly comparable IFRS financial measure: Net earnings (loss) from continuing operations. Definition: EBITDA is calculated as net earnings (loss) from continuing operations before finance costs, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as net earnings (loss) from continuing operations before finance costs, income taxes and depreciation and amortization, impairment, Merger and related costs, share-based compensation and Curtailment Gain. Why the Company uses the measure and why it is useful to investors: As a valuation measurement, it excludes the effects of items that primarily reflect the impact of long-term investment and financing decisions, rather than the performance of the Company's day-to-day operations, and as a measure of the Company's ability to service debt and to meet other payment obligations.  Free cash flow Most directly comparable IFRS financial measure: Cash provided by operating activities. Definition: Cash provided by operating activities less sustaining capital expenditures, cash provided by operating activities from discontinued operations and changes in non-cash operating working capital. Sustaining capital expenditures include the cost of replacements and betterments for the Company's facilities.

(MORE TO FOLLOW) Nutrien Demonstrates Resilience in a Quarter -16- Definition: The combined historical results for Nutrien were calculated by adding the historical IFRS financial statements prepared by PotashCorp and Agrium and then eliminating intercompany transactions and reclassifying line items to conform with Nutrien's financial statement presentation. This combined historical information does not include, among other things, estimated cost synergies, adjustments related to restructuring or integration activities, adjustments related to the PPA and the impact of discontinued operations. Why the Company uses the measure and why it is useful to investors: It provides a measure of what the combined results may have been had the Merger been completed on January 1, 2017. The combined historical information may differ from the Nutrien pro forma earnings presented in the Company's business acquisition report dated February 20, 2018 as the pro forma information therein required certain adjustments under applicable securities laws and accounting standards that the Company believes do not provide as useful a measure as the combined historical financial information. The primary differences in the statement of earnings were the pro forma finance costs were reduced by the amortization of the change in carrying amount of Agrium's debt resulting from the PPA adjustments and the pro forma other expenses were adjusted to remove any Merger-related costs. There were no comparable adjustments in the combined historical financial results of PotashCorp and Agrium. Refer to the Appendix starting on page 33 of the Company's first quarter financial statements for the Nutrien combined historical statements of earnings and EBITDA for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017.

In appointing Bernadette Jordan as rural economic development minister earlier this month, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has corrected -- at least in theory -- a grievous error in judgment by the previous government. The Harper Conservatives axed the Rural Secretariat, the last manifestation of a federal focus on the specific needs of rural Canada, in 2013. In reality, however, governments have for a long time paid lip service to policy designed to help rural Canada thrive. Rural development was historically treated as an offshoot of agricultural policy, a flawed logic that hearkens back to the day when one in three Canadians lived on farms. It was assumed that a development good for agriculture is also good for the rural economy, which is not necessarily the case. The needs of rural Canada have decoupled from agriculture as that industry consolidated around fewer and larger farms that require fewer people to operate. That, in turn, reduced and consolidated the number of service centres needed, and the people they employ to support the industry in rural communities. So arguably, the growth of agriculture has been to the detriment of rural communities on the Prairies, a point underscored by the reality that most of the commodities produced are exported for processing elsewhere, usually closer to points of consumption. Even the under-resourced Rural Secretariat was housed within Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, where it could do little more than bear witness to rural decline in the context of these macro forces. It could also be argued that, given the need for many farm families to have off-farm jobs to support their incomes, a strong rural economy is more important to agriculture than it is to rural economic health. These places between large centres are home to nearly one-third of this country's population and the resource-based sectors they house produce 27 per cent of the national gross domestic product. Yet they struggle to maintain even basic infrastructure in the face of declining population and a shrinking tax base. Farmers protest when municipalities look to land taxes as a means to keep the roads maintained and the schools open. Attracting new economic activity is constrained by poor internet and sometimes even inadequate cellphone services. These deficits in communications infrastructure are also hampering the adoption of precision agriculture technology that can help the farm economy succeed in the global context. Ultimately, what all this adds up to is a shortage of people -- which are a fundamental requirement to having a healthy economy. Whereas many cities struggle to meet the infrastructure and service needs of their growing populations, many rural communities are increasingly challenged to provide services for their dwindling numbers. On top of that, these regions and the primary industries they support are on the front lines of climate change -- which puts its own pressures on infrastructure due to flooding and severe weather events. The new minister will reportedly work out of Infrastructure Canada and, according to a statement from Trudeau, \"She will also take action to bring high-speed internet to more rural households and businesses, and work with municipalities, provinces, territories and Indigenous partners to meet the unique and diverse infrastructure needs of rural communities.\" In a report filed to the House of Commons in November, federal auditor general Michael Ferguson called out the federal government for not moving fast enough to deliver broadband connectivity to rural regions. It's costly: approximately $6.5 billion to achieve the target of 50-100 Mbps across the country, and upwards of $50 billion to provide unlimited upload and download speeds via fibre optics. But is it an expense or an investment? Just imagine what this country would look like today if the government led by Sir John A. Macdonald back in 1885 allowed cost to stand in the way of completing a national railroad. Would there even be a Canada? Jordan's appointment and her marching orders send a hopeful signal to rural communities. We can only hope the new minister gets the resources she needs to meet the portfolio's challenges head-on.

One such important discussion was on \"INDIAN DIASPORA'S ROLE IN CAPACITY BUILDING OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN INDIA\". The experts emphasized on making artificial intelligence (AI), a supplementing tool for service of humanity instead of taking away and replacing the human role itself. Experts also focussed on building strong fundamentals in maths as it is the very building block of computing in general and developing AI in particular. Experts from USA, Canada and Australia also said there is a huge potential in Sanskrit language to be used in advance computing and paving way for AI. Ritesh Tandon from CRISIL USA advised that since India has a huge challenge in the field of food distribution among it's people, the adapted AI may come handy in the field. While Suresh Upmadharan said India can use Artificial intelligence and drones to mitigate deforestation and seeding the barren lands to turn it into green fields. He elaborated such advances being made in US through his company. Several delegates of PBD 2019 were more than willing to share their technology and expertise to help the farming sector in a big way. As most of the Indian farmers can not afford to purchase the advance equipment related to \"Precision Agriculture\", which has become routine in developed countries, venture capitalists and firms expressed willingness to do it for farmers on a large scale through Government of India sponsorship.

Called the Seed Advisor, The Climate Corporation's system uses historical performance data from a farm, as well as soil information and imagery, to rank the best hybrids to plant and create a seeding rate prescription. It was tested on more than 100,000 acres in Iowa, Illinois and Minnesota and 2018. Trials in 2017 saw a six bushel per acre increase versus what the farmer would have planted without Seed Advisor recommendations. In both testing years, more than 80 per cent of farmers using the technology realized a benefit, The Climate Corporation said. \"As we understand the genetics that can best fit for those types of environments we can actually predict a better outcome using the algorithm to position the right products on the right acre,\" said Denise Hockaday, Canada business lead for The Climate Corporation. Hockaday said the company anticipates introducing the product to Canada after further rigorous testing of the system is complete. \"It is not a matter of if, it is a matter of when,\" Hockaday said in an interview. While the system will provide a ranking of the best hybrids to use, it will still be up to the farmer and their agronomist or seed dealer to make the final decision, she said. \"At the end of the day if the farmer wants to tailor it a little bit or wants to tweak it with their dealer, they absolutely have the ability to do that.\" Testing in the U.S. in 2019 will be expanded to include Wisconsin, Indiana and Missouri. A commercial launch of Seed Advisor in the U.S. is anticipated for the fall of 2019, pending harvest results. The Climate Corporation said it is also researching the use of predictive seed selection in soybeans. \"We have entered the next phase of digital farming, and predictive seed selection and placement is only the beginning,\" Mike Stern, chief executive officer for The Climate Corporation and head of Digital Farming at Bayer, said in a statement announcing the 2018 test results."}, {"title": "U of L study the first to examine the use of precision agriculture in irrigation farming in Alberta", "article": "Given the importance of irrigation to the southern Alberta economy, two University of Lethbridge economists wanted to know if agricultural producers who irrigate are using precision agriculture technologies. Drs. Lorraine and Chris Nicol have conducted the first study in Alberta examining the adoption of precision agriculture in irrigation farming. Their survey shows users are reducing farm inputs and seeing positive economic benefits as a result. Last fall, they conducted a survey of irrigators in the Taber Irrigation District (TID) to find out the extent to which precision agriculture technologies are being adopted, the types of tools being used and the satisfaction with the technologies. They also looked at those who didnt use precision agriculture technologies and their reasons for not adopting. Twenty-seven per cent of irrigators in the TID participated in the survey. Based on the data collected, 81 per cent of irrigators have adopted some form of precision agriculture, at an average of five technologies per irrigator. Overall, those who have adopted are very satisfied with the technologies and almost all plan on using even more technologies in the future, says Lorraine. Among non-adopters, most said their operations were too small to justify the high investment costs. Precision agriculture involves parsing fields into small parcels based on variability, allowing more precise application of irrigation water, fertilizer, chemicals and seed compared to conventional methods. The study identified 20 technologies including auto-steering equipment, variable rate fertilizer and irrigation application, soil-moisture monitoring, terrain mapping and analysis, unmanned aerial vehicle mapping, satellite imagery and various data management tools, for example. Precision agriculture has fundamentally changed the way farming is done and it has the potential to reduce costs and increase profits for farmers. Precision agriculture is also critical for sustainable agriculture. Using less fertilizer and less irrigation water, for example, helps lessen run-off and conserve water, so its also better for the environment, says Chris. The TID, one of 13 irrigation districts in the region, has one of the highest concentrations of specialty crops, including potatoes, sugar beets, canola seed, beans, peas, corn, sunflowers and onions. These inputs are vital to processing industries as well as the confined feedlot industry in the region. The TID consists of 115 to 120 irrigation producers who irrigate more than 80,000 acres. Its irrigation infrastructure also supplies water to several communities and many individuals. The survey showed that, under precision agriculture, crop yields have increased an average 20 per cent and yearly crop quality has increased by an average of 16 per cent. Yearly reductions in irrigation water, fertilizer, herbicides and pesticides have ranged between 14 and 24 per cent. Non-adopters consist entirely of farms of less than 2,000 acres. Those irrigators generally cited the smaller size of their operations, high investment costs and incompatibility of machines as the main reasons for not adopting. These results suggest irrigators are embracing precision agriculture and experiencing the benefits, says Lorraine. This also has positive implications for economic and community development, as well as environmental stewardship. The study was funded by a grant from the Alberta Real Estate Foundation."}, {"title": "MIL-OSI Europe: Text adopted - Union's authorisation procedure for pesticides - P8_TA-PROV(2019)0023 - Wednesday,

disrupting properties of glyphosate'(22) , published on 7 September 2017, - having regard to the opinion of the Risk Assessment Committee (RAC) of the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) on the classification of glyphosate, of 15 March 2017, - having regard to Scientific Opinion 5/2018 of the Scientific Advice Mechanism (SAM) on the EU authorisation processes of plant protection products, of June 2018(23) , - having regard to the report from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 1185/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 concerning statistics on pesticides (COM(2017)0109), - having regard to the implementation plan on increasing low-risk plant protection product availability and accelerating integrated pest management implementation in Member States, drawn up by the Expert Group on Sustainable Plant Protection and endorsed by the Council on 28 June 2016, - having regard to the report of the UN Human Rights Council Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food, of 24 January 2017, on global pesticide use in agriculture and its impact on human rights, - having regard to Article 13 of the TFEU, which states that when formulating and implementing the Union's policies, in particular concerning its internal market, full regard should be paid to the welfare requirements of animals, since animals are sentient beings, - having regard to Directive 2010/63/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2010 on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes(24) , - having regard to the Special Eurobarometer 442 survey of March 2016, which states that 89 % of EU citizens agree that the Union should do more to promote greater awareness of the importance of animal welfare internationally and 90 % of EU citizens agree that it is important to establish high animal welfare standards, - having regard to the fact that Parliament receives numerous petitions from concerned citizens exercising their rights under Articles 24 and 227 of the TFEU and Article 44 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, calling for an end to animal testing in Europe and worldwide and for the establishment of international animal welfare standards, - having regard to the Commission proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the transparency and sustainability of the EU risk assessment in the food chain (COM(2018)0179)(25) , - having regard to the Commission's ongoing REFIT evaluation of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, - having regard to Rule 52 of its Rules of Procedure, - having regard to the report of the Special Committee on the Union's authorisation procedure for pesticides (A8-0475/2018), General considerations A. whereas the purpose of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 ('the Regulation') is to ensure a high level of protection of both human and animal health and the environment and to improve the functioning of the internal market through the harmonisation of the rules on the placing on the market of plant protection products, while improving agricultural production; B. whereas the EU authorisation procedure for plant protection products is one of the most stringent in the world; whereas in the light of the concerns raised by several stakeholders about the assessment of glyphosate, the Special Committee on the Union's authorisation procedure for pesticides (PEST) aims to identify areas that can be further improved with regard to the Union authorisation procedure for plant protection products, by providing recommendations that it considers to be necessary in order to ensure the achievement of a high level of protection of both human and animal health and the environment; C. whereas the precautionary principle is an overarching principle for Union policy, as laid down in Article 191 of the TFEU; whereas the Regulation, as provided for in Article 1(4) thereof, is underpinned by the precautionary principle; whereas the risk management decision, as provided for in Article 13(2), must comply with the conditions of the precautionary principle as laid down in Article 7(1) of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002; whereas Article 7(2) of Regulation 178/2002 provides that measures adopted on the basis of the precautionary principle must be proportionate; D. whereas concerns have been raised by several stakeholders about the assessment of glyphosate, in particular as to whether an independent, objective and transparent assessment has taken place, whether the classification criteria of Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 have been properly applied, whether relevant guidance documents have been properly used and whether the approval criteria and the precautionary principle have been properly applied; E. whereas under Article 4(3) of the Regulation, a plant protection product, consequent on application consistent with good plant protection practice and having regard to realistic conditions of use, must, inter alia, have no immediate or delayed harmful effects on human health, including that of vulnerable groups, and must have no unacceptable effects on the environment; F. whereas the evaluation of the implementation of the Regulation has revealed that the objectives of protecting human and animal health and the environment are not being fully achieved and that improvements could be made in order to achieve all the objectives of the Regulation; G. whereas it is of the utmost importance to fully implement the Regulation in all Member States; H. whereas the work of the national competent authorities involved in the approval and authorisation processes is often delayed; whereas it has been found that national competent authorities involved in the approval and authorisation process are in some cases understaffed and underfunded; whereas in addition to delays to assessment work, the lack of resources risks impacting the quality of the assessments, for both active substances and plant protection products; I. whereas the independence of the risk assessment forms the basis for trust in the Regulation and in EU food law; J. whereas the decision-making process has been found to be lacking in transparency throughout the procedure, from lack of public access to the full studies and raw data through to the risk management stage; K. whereas the right of access to documents held by EU institutions, including EU agencies, is an important right, exceptions to which are to be interpreted narrowly; points to the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union, according to which transparency and access to documents contribute to greater legitimacy of EU agencies in the eyes of citizens and to ensuring EU agencies are more accountable to citizens in a democratic system(26) ; L. whereas Commission Regulation (EU) No 283/2013 setting out the data requirements for active substances should be regularly updated to take into account current scientific and technical knowledge; whereas the Commission Communication in the framework of the implementation of Commission Regulation (EU) No 283/2013 of 1 March 2013 setting out the data requirements for active substances(27) remains the most comprehensive source of guidance documents and test guidelines, although several of the documents listed may have been superseded and should be updated; whereas the methodologies used for the scientific assessment of active substances, in the form of guidance used by EFSA and Member States, do not always reflect the current state of scientific and technical knowledge as required by Article 4 of the Regulation; whereas some key tests are either not included in the risk assessment or recent scientific methods are missing (as in the cases of up-to-date ecotoxicological tests for soil organisms and assessment of environmental concentration and residues in dust, wind, air and water); M. whereas the updated bee guidance used by EFSA in its recent review of three neonicotinoids has not yet been formally adopted; whereas the guidance on soil organisms currently used by EFSA dates from 2002; N. whereas guidance translates the requirements of legislation into practical steps, explaining what must be done, while test guidelines specify the test protocols that must be followed for data generation, explaining how tests must be done; O. whereas the widespread use, and prophylactic use when inappropriate, of plant protection products is of concern; P. whereas the use of plant protection products for desiccation (i.e. the treatment of the actual crop plant prior to harvest in order to accelerate its ripening and facilitate its harvesting) is inappropriate; Q. whereas the use of plant protection products in areas used by the general public or by vulnerable groups is inappropriate; R. whereas according to the data compiled by the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), the EU used 368 588 tonnes of pesticides in 2016, accounting for 11,8 % of global consumption; S. whereas according to the FAO the use of pesticides in the EU has been on an upward trend since 2009; whereas the trend is, however, very different across Member States, ranging from a sharp increase in some of them to a steep fall in others; whereas the total volume of pesticide active substances sold in 16 EU Member States increased by 1,6 % from 2011 to 2016; T. whereas until 2018, 493 active and basic substances have been approved; U. whereas the Commission report on the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 1185/2009 highlights the deficiencies of statistics on pesticide use and the lack of knowledge about the use of specific active substances; V. whereas according to the 2016 European Union report on pesticide residues in food(28) , published by EFSA in 2018, 96,2 % of the samples were within the limits permitted by EU legislation; W. whereas there is a lack of public knowledge about hazard and risk and acceptable and unacceptable hazards and risks, and about the level of compliance with maximum residue level (MRL) values across Europe; X. whereas authorisation decisions on newly developed active substances and plant protection products are invariably made under uncertainty regarding real-life impacts; whereas there is a lack of monitoring post-authorisation; whereas data are missing on exact quantities of each plant protection product applied, on the implementation and effectiveness of mitigation measures, and on the potential harmful effects on human and animal health and the environment; Y. whereas the lack of data concerns the real-life impacts of active substances, safeners, synergists and co-formulants and their metabolites, as well as formulations and mixtures of products; whereas, therefore, the full impact of pesticides on human and animal health as well as on the environment is not properly known; Z. whereas the pilot project 'Environmental monitoring of pesticide use through honey bees' has not been implemented yet, despite its inclusion in the Union budget for the financial years 2017 and 2018; AA. whereas one of the aims of the 7th General Union Environment Action Programme to 2020 is for chemicals to be produced and used in ways that lead to the minimisation of significant adverse effects on human health and the environment, and whereas there is still uncertainty about the full impacts on human health and the environment of the combined effects of different chemicals; AB. whereas Article 4(3) of the Regulation provides that plant protection products 'shall have no immediate or delayed harmful effect on human health... taking into account known cumulative and synergistic effects where the scientific methods accepted by the Authority to assess such effects are available'; whereas Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 provides that 'known cumulative and synergistic effects' must be considered 'when the methods to assess such effects are available'; AC. whereas such methodologies are now available and a pilot assessment, looking at the cumulative effects of exposure to pesticides in food on the human nervous and thyroid systems, is expected to be finalised by EFSA by the end of 2019; AD. whereas there is currently no legal obligation to test active substances for their developmental neurotoxicity (DNT), examples of which include causing autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and dyslexia; whereas developmental toxicity and neurotoxicity studies are required and may trigger studies with ad hoc study design to address specific concerns; whereas in this context, EFSA is working on an ongoing project to develop non-animal alternatives for screening DNT effects; AE. whereas there is concern that the implementation of the Regulation, with regard to the use of animals in testing for hazard identification and risk assessment, is not in line with the 3Rs principle (replacement, reduction and refinement) of Directive 2010/63/EU on animal experiments, as Commission Regulations (EU) No 283/2013 and (EU) No 284/2013, as well as corresponding guidance, have not been updated since their adoption, despite the availability of validated alternative tests and technologies; AF. whereas testing for effects on human health involves the use of animals and therefore does not necessarily accurately predict human reactions; AG. whereas there is a need to speed up the development and validation of new non-animal methodologies that provide information on the underlying mechanisms of human toxicity, including the pathways that lead to adverse outcomes in humans; AH. whereas many third-country agricultural products have a lower level of protection of human and animal health and the environment with regard to the authorisation and use of plant protection products; whereas there is a need to ensure that the EU level of protection is not undermined by imports of agricultural products from third countries; AI. whereas illegally imported plant protection products are in circulation and use within the EU, posing a potential threat to public health and constituting unfair competition vis-a-vis plant protection products that are subject to an authorisation procedure in accordance with the current EU legislation; Application for approval of active substances AJ. whereas concern in terms of transparency and conflicts of interest has been raised by several stakeholders about the right of applicants to choose the Rapporteur Member State (RMS) upon first application for approval of an active substance; AK. whereas concern in terms of transparency and conflicts of interest has furthermore been raised by several stakeholders over the fact that the RMS given responsibility by the Commission for the renewal of an assessment report may be the same one which did the initial draft assessment report; AL. whereas for new active substances, only 11 out of 28 Member States have been chosen as RMSs by applicants since the entry into force of the Regulation, which illustrates that there are significant differences concerning expertise and staffing; AM. whereas France, the Netherlands, Germany and the UK have dealt with about 80 % of all dossiers; whereas Brexit will have a significant impact on the workload of other Member States; AN. whereas Article 8(1) of the Regulation requires the applicant to provide a summary dossier, which should include inter alia the summaries and results of tests and studies for each point of the data requirements, including an assessment of all information submitted; AO. whereas concern has been raised by several stakeholders concerning the evaluation approach as established by law, and in particular over who should produce the scientific studies and evidence for the evaluation of active substances, who should provide scientific peer-reviewed literature and who should assess the studies; AP. whereas Article 8(5) of the Regulation requires the applicant to add scientific peer-reviewed open literature on the active substance and its relevant metabolites to the dossier; AQ. whereas for new active substances, normally only data from regulatory studies generated by the applicant are available; AR. whereas risk assessment must be based on all relevant available scientific evidence; whereas scientific peer-reviewed open literature provides important complementary information to the studies based on Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) provided by applicants, and can include findings that alert evaluators to adverse effects that are not seen by standard testing; AS. whereas the principles of GLP have been developed by the OECD to ensure that a study was carried out as prescribed by a particular test method to prevent fraudulent practices; whereas the EU has adopted these principles through Directive 2004/10/EC, which requires Member States to ensure that laboratories carrying out safety studies on chemical products comply with the OECD Principles of GLP and with Directive 2004/9/EC, which lays down the obligation of Member States to designate the authorities responsible for GLP inspections in their territory; AT. whereas, as reported by the Commission in 2015, all Member States have transposed the GLP Directives and have established functioning national GLP compliance monitoring programmes; AU. whereas the OECD test guidelines ensure that research is reproducible, consistent and uniform and enable regulators to assess the quality and relevance of a study, to ensure the methodological validity of a study and to facilitate mutual acceptance of data among Member States; Draft assessment by the Rapporteur Member State (RMS) AV. whereas pursuant to Article 11(2) of the Regulation 'the rapporteur Member State shall make an independent, objective and transparent assessment in the light of current scientific and technical knowledge'; AW. whereas it has been found that different Member States, when acting as RMS, use different practices when it comes to referencing the applicant's summaries of peer-reviewed literature; whereas it is a fundamental rule that any scientific work should clearly indicate statements made by others by using quotation marks; AX. whereas Parliament acknowledges the debate over the literature review in the risk assessment report on glyphosate by the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR); whereas concerns have been raised by several stakeholders that important assessment elements in the draft risk assessment report on glyphosate were taken from the application, without being clearly indicated as references; EFSA opinion on draft assessment reports and ECHA classification of active substances AY. whereas the credibility of the Union authorisation system for plant protection products strongly depends on public trust in EFSA, which provides the scientific opinions that are the basis for decisions with regard to food safety in Europe; whereas the decreasing public trust in EFSA is a concern; AZ. whereas currently about two thirds of national experts working for EFSA come from only six Member States; BA. whereas according to Article 4(1), second subparagraph of the Regulation, the assessment of the active substance must first establish whether the approval criteria set out in points 3.6.2 to 3.6.4 and 3.7 of Annex II are satisfied (= 'cut-off criteria'); whereas one of these cut-off criteria concerns the classification of a substance as a carcinogen (category 1A or 1B) in accordance with the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008; BB. whereas the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified glyphosate as probably carcinogenic to humans (Group 2A) according to its nomenclature (equivalent to category 1B in Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008); whereas after reviewing the available information, including the IARC assessment, EFSA and ECHA, the European agencies responsible for providing scientific assessments which form the basis for EU risk management decisions, concluded that no classification as carcinogenic was warranted pursuant to the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008; BC. whereas while IARC based its conclusion on published literature in accordance with its working principles, EFSA and ECHA additionally used unpublished studies submitted by the applicant according to Article 8 of the Regulation as the core basis of their evaluation and additionally had access to the relevant raw data; BD. whereas several other competent authorities around the world, including those of the US, Canada, New Zealand, Australia and Japan, have subsequently finalised new assessments of glyphosate and concluded that it is not carcinogenic; whereas glyphosate is still under review by the US Environmental Protection Agency, whose draft ecological risk assessment clearly states that there is potential for effects on birds, mammals, and terrestrial and aquatic plants; BE. whereas, as shown by a comparison carried out by EFSA in 2017 of 54 pesticides that had been assessed under both the EU and IARC systems, in 14 cases the EU classification was more conservative (and thus stricter) than IARC, in 11 cases (glyphosate and 10 other active substances) less strict, and in 29 cases equivalent; BF. whereas concern has been and is still being raised by several stakeholders over the opinions by EFSA and ECHA concerning their conclusions in favour of not classifying glyphosate as carcinogenic; BG. whereas it was unfortunately not possible to resolve this controversy in the Special Committee; BH. whereas in October 2017, the Commission declared the European Citizens' Initiative 'Ban glyphosate and protect people and the environment from toxic pesticides' admissible; whereas over one million citizens called on the Commission to propose to the Member States the introduction of a ban on the use of glyphosate, to reform the approval procedure for pesticides and to set mandatory reduction targets at EU level for the use of pesticides; BI. whereas the so-called Monsanto Papers and the recent judgment by the Superior Court of the State of California in case Dewayne Johnson v Monsanto (case No CGC-16-550128) and subsequent appeal have raised concerns about the independence and conflicts of interest in the evaluation process of glyphosate; Commission approval of active substances BJ. whereas the Regulation lays down a six-month deadline for the Commission, from the EFSA conclusions to the presentation of a draft regulation; BK. whereas the decision to renew the approval of glyphosate did not contain legally binding risk mitigation measures at Union level; whereas the Commission decided to adopt a specific recommendation in the approval conditions that Member States, when granting authorisations for glyphosate-containing plant protection products, should pay particular attention to the risk to terrestrial vertebrates; whereas a high long-term risk was found for almost all uses of glyphosate for non-target terrestrial vertebrates, including mammals and birds; BL. whereas ECHA concluded that glyphosate causes serious eye damage and is toxic to aquatic life with long-lasting effects; BM. whereas it is not clear under what conditions the Commission and the Member States consider a risk to be unacceptable for the environment; BN. whereas the fact that the Commission, with the support of the Member States, approves active substances found by EFSA to pose high risks to the environment and biodiversity is a concern, given that according to Article 4(3)(e) of the Regulation a plant protection product must have no unacceptable effects on the environment; BO. whereas the European Ombudsman, in her decision in case 12/2013/MDC of 18 February 2016, stated that submission of confirmatory information should not concern data requirements which existed at the time of the submission of the application in relation to the assessment of risks to health and for which adequate guidance documents were available; BP. whereas confirmatory data are generally not subject to the same scientific scrutiny or assessment as data submitted in the original application as they are not subjected systematically to an EFSA peer review; whereas the European Ombudsman, in her 2016 decision, invited the Commission to consider whether, from now on, all confirmatory information should be systematically subject to an EFSA peer review and whether the guidance documents should be amended accordingly; BQ. whereas, based on the follow-up report submitted by the Commission in February 2018 with regard to ten active substances examined in the context of the Ombudsman's inquiry, the confirmatory data procedure has led to two active substances, haloxyfop-P and malathion, that would otherwise have been restricted, remaining on the market for an extended period of time; BR. whereas data gaps in the case of low-risk biological pesticides primarily occur because the data requirements are designed for chemical plant protection products, and are thus unsuitable for low-risk biological ones; BS. whereas despite the risks identified by EFSA in its conclusions on active substances, the Commission often leaves risk mitigation measures to the Member States, notwithstanding the possibility granted to it under the Regulation to impose them at EU level; whereas this approach was condemned by the European Ombudsman in her decision in case 12/2013/MDC; BT. whereas it is appropriate that Member States decide on risk management measures with regard to concerns that are specific to their situation; BU. whereas there is a lack of availability of low-risk plant protection products; whereas only ten substances are approved as low-risk active substances out of a total of almost 500 available on the EU market; whereas the lack of availability of low-risk plant protection products makes integrated pest management implementation and development more difficult; whereas this lack of availability is caused by the lengthy evaluation, authorisation and registration process; BV. whereas nowadays, advanced techniques such as precision farming and robotics may be used for the accurate monitoring and elimination of weeds or harmful insects at an early stage; whereas advanced techniques are still underdeveloped in the European Union and require the support of the Union and the Member States; Authorisation of plant protection products by Member States BW. whereas plant protection products should be thoroughly assessed in accordance with current scientific and technical knowledge prior to their authorisation; whereas understaffing and/or underfunding may result in over-reliance on the assessment conducted for the approval of the active substances in the context of decisions for plant protection products; BX. whereas the procedure for authorisation of plant protection products, and in particular the data requirements for risk assessment, should take into account the actual use of plant protection products; BY. whereas, when granting authorisation to plant protection products, particular attention should continue to be paid to the risk for 'vulnerable groups'; whereas the Regulation defines vulnerable groups as persons needing specific consideration when assessing the acute and chronic health effects of plant protection products; whereas these include pregnant and breastfeeding women, the unborn, infants and children, the elderly, and workers and residents subject to high pesticide exposure over the long term; BZ. whereas Article 25 of the Regulation requires safeners and synergists to be subject to the same approval procedure as active substances, for inclusion on a positive list; whereas the Commission has not yet approved any safeners or synergists; CA. whereas Article 27 of the Regulation requires the Commission to include, in Annex III, a negative list of unacceptable co-formulants; whereas the Commission has not yet adopted the negative list of co-formulants, but has stated its intention to do so by the end of 2018; whereas this delay is unacceptable in view of the impact of these substances; whereas certain Member States have developed their own negative lists of co-formulants, in the absence of such a list at Union level; CB. whereas the absence of these EU lists makes the thorough risk assessment of plant protection products more difficult; CC. whereas concern has been raised with regard to the zonal system, and in particular the delays in the procedure and the frequent full or partial re-evaluations of applications in the context of mutual recognition, arising from the differing national requirements of evaluation models of Member States in the same zone; whereas the aim of the procedure of mutual recognition by Member States was to simplify procedures and increase trust among the Member States; whereas the application of the mutual recognition procedure is regarded as an important tool to increase work sharing and ensure compliance with deadlines while guaranteeing optimum protection, and is important for the functioning of the internal market; CD. whereas the Commission is working on an IT system, the Plant Protection Products Application Management System (PPPAMS), which will be accessible to the public and will facilitate the mutual recognition system; CE. whereas there is currently no overview of all plant protection products authorised in the EU, as Member States are not obliged to systematically inform the Commission about their decisions on authorisation; CF. whereas Commission Regulation (EU) No 283/2013 requires studies on long-term toxicity to be carried out; whereas Commission Regulation (EU) No 284/2013 currently requires toxicological studies on operator, bystander and resident, as well as worker exposure, several long-term and chronic toxicology studies for animals, and studies on fate and behaviour in soil, water and air, including route and degradation in air and transport via air, but not on the long-term toxicity of plant protection products; CG. whereas Member States are working on setting up a comparative assessment of plant protection products with substitution candidates; whereas the objective is to replace such products with safer plant protection products and non-chemical methods such as those defined in Directive 2009/128/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 establishing a framework for Community action to achieve the sustainable use of pesticides(29) ; CH. whereas recent reports have highlighted significant declines in biodiversity with regard to birds and insects, in particular bees and other pollinators; whereas, in the last 27 years, a decline of over 75 % in total flying insect biomass in protected areas has been observed(30) ; whereas agricultural intensification (e.g. pesticide usage, year-round tillage, increased use of fertilisers and frequency of agronomic measures), which was not incorporated in that analysis, may form a plausible cause; whereas agricultural intensification has been associated with an overall decline in biodiversity in plants, insects, birds and other species; whereas biodiversity and robust ecosystems are of fundamental importance, particularly bees and other pollinating insects, to ensure a healthy and sustainable agricultural sector; CI. whereas the ban on all outdoor uses of three neonicotinoids (imidacloprid, clothianidin and thiamethoxam) is welcome; whereas these bans should not be undermined by undue Article 53 derogations; CJ. whereas other systemic plant protection products should be restricted as much as possible, including for seed treatment, if they pose a danger to human health and the environment; CK. whereas the use and identified cases of emergency authorisations granted under Article 53(2) of the Regulation are increasing within the EU; whereas some Member States use Article 53 significantly more than others; whereas the recent EFSA evaluation of the emergency authorisations of three neonicotinoids concluded that in some cases those authorisations were in line with the provisions set out in the legislation, while in other cases those conditions were not met; CL. whereas systematic delays in the authorisation processes could also lead to an increasing use of emergency authorisations; whereas recourse to Article 53 derogations for minor uses to address special situations other than actual emergencies is not viable or appropriate; whereas EFSA should investigate the effect of substitution as well as the availability of non-chemical methods; CM. whereas special attention should be given to plant protection products for minor uses, as there is currently little economic incentive for companies to develop such products; CN. whereas since the entry into force of the Regulation, the Commission has only once used the possibility to request an opinion from EFSA under Article 53(2); General observations 1. Considers that, although the EU has one of the most stringent systems in the world, both the Regulation as such and its implementation need to be improved for it to achieve its purpose; 2. Takes note of the Commission's ongoing REFIT evaluation of the Regulation; 3. Stresses the importance of ensuring independent, objective and transparent scientific assessment of active substances and plant protection products; 4. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to allocate sufficient resources and appropriate expertise to the assessment of active substances and plant protection products and to ensure independent, objective and transparent assessment in light of current scientific and technical knowledge; 5. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to ensure full and uniform application of the hazard-based cut-off criteria for active substances that are mutagenic, carcinogenic or toxic for reproduction, or that have endocrine-disrupting properties; 6. Calls on the Commission and the Member States in their role as risk managers to duly apply the precautionary principle when, following an assessment of the available information, the possibility of harmful effects on health is identified but scientific uncertainty persists, by adopting provisional risk management measures necessary to ensure a high level of protection of human health; 7. Urges the Commission to communicate systematically on how this principle has been taken into account and how the risk management decision has been made; 8. Welcomes the recommendation of the Scientific Advice Mechanism that the Commission facilitate a broader discussion throughout society in order to establish an EU-wide shared vision for sustainable food production, including the role of plant protection products therein; believes that such considerations should take into account, among other factors, quality, safety, availability and affordability of food for consumers, fair income for, and long-term sustainability of, agricultural production, climate change, and the short-term and long-term risks and benefits to human and animal health and the environment associated with different scenarios for the use of plant protection products, including integrated pest management and a non-use scenario; 9. Considers that, within the EU system, greater attention should be paid to the widespread use, and prophylactic use when inappropriate, of plant protection products and the effects thereof on human health, animal health and the environment, as well as to the build-up of resistance in the target organism; 10. Stresses the importance of full implementation of Directive 2009/128/EC, given its link to the authorisation system, in particular the provisions with regard to integrated pest management and adequate training for farmers therein; points out that Parliament's ongoing work on this matter may be referred to for further details; 11. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to ensure consistency of purpose between the approval of active substances and authorisation of plant protection products under this Regulation and the purpose of Directive 2009/128/EC; 12. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to no longer approve active substances or plant protection products for desiccation; 13. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to no longer allow the use of plant protection products in areas used by the general public or by vulnerable groups, as defined in Article 12(a) of Directive 2009/128/EC; 14. Calls on the Commission to introduce specific measures for the effective protection of vulnerable groups into the Regulation, in order to, without delay or derogation, put an end to the application of pesticides over long distances in the vicinity of schools, childcare facilities, playing fields, hospitals, maternity hospitals and care homes; 15. Calls on the Commission to take the necessary action to ensure that sales statistics concerning pesticides are publicly available per active substance and per Member State, and that pesticide use statistics are further improved so as to provide full information for the environmental risk assessment as well as the comparative assessment under the Regulation; 16. Calls for the creation of an effective post-market vigilance system to systematically monitor the real-life impacts of the use of plant protection products on human and animal health and on the environment as a whole, including in the long term; stresses that post-market vigilance for plant protection products should ensure effective data collection and communication among all stakeholders, and be transparent and publicly accessible; calls on EFSA and ECHA to develop harmonised guidelines for effective post-market vigilance in this field; 17. Calls on the Commission to develop a standardised EU-wide IT platform or database to support the sharing of post-market monitoring data, and considers that post-market monitoring data and other available monitoring data should be used in the authorisation process; 18. Calls on the Commission to accelerate the implementation of the pilot project 'Environmental monitoring of pesticide use through honey bees', which will, inter alia, allow the implementation of EU legislation in terms of pesticide application and authorisation to be evaluated; 19. Calls on the Commission to conduct an epidemiological study on the real-life impacts of plant protection products on human health; 20. Calls on the Commission to further develop and implement approaches to address the combination effects of chemicals by promoting integrated and coordinated assessment across all relevant EU laws; 21. Welcomes EFSA's ongoing project to model DNT effects, but considers this to be insufficient until there is a legal requirement for active substances and other pesticide components to be assessed for DNT effects as part of the authorisation process; calls, therefore, on the Commission to assess the options to ensure that active substances and other components in plant protection products are assessed for DNT effects, fully taking into account reliable animal-free human-focused mechanistic methods for DNT hazard assessment; 22. Considers it essential that research and innovation continue to be developed in the Union, and therefore calls for Horizon Europe, other Union financial instruments and the Member States to provide sufficient funding to promote:  23. Calls on the Commission to consider the importance of a regulatory framework that encourages innovation and research in order to develop better and safer plant protection products and alternatives; 24. Recalls that access to safe and efficient plant protection is essential to enable farmers to prevent naturally occurring food-borne contaminants such as carcinogenic mycotoxins, which put the safety of our food at risk; 25.

The Post's Emily Jackson writes that the new rules include stiff penalties for reckless aircraft operation and stricter rules for recreational pilots while maintaining flexibility for commercial uses like precision agriculture or forestry surveying. Transport Canada on Wednesday unveiled the new regulations for remotely piloted aircraft systems, also known as unmanned aerial vehicles and commonly referred to as drones, after 1-1/2 years of consultations. Both government and industry recognized the need for new rules. Reckless and negligent drone operators can pose major hazards to commercial airlines, such as the drone sightings that forced Gatwick Airport to suspend flights for days, resulting in Christmas travel madness. Closer to home, there have been dozens of drone sightings near airports, with one close call in Ottawa in 2016 that resulted in two fighter jets being sent to track down the rogue unmanned aircraft. The new system will require both recreational and commercial drone operators to pass an on-line exam to get a pilot certificate and register their drones."}, {"title": "Drone industry embraces safety rules amid popularity of machines", "article": "Canada's burgeoning drone industry welcomed the government's new drone safety regulations, which include stiff penalties for reckless aircraft operation and stricter rules for recreational pilots while maintaining flexibility for commercial uses like precision agriculture or forestry surveying.

The new system will require both recreational and commercial drone operators to pass an online exam to get a pilot certificate (for a $10 fee) and register their drones (this will cost $5). It will cost $28.4 million to implement over the next decade, according to amendments published in the Canada Gazette. Maximum penalties for breaking the rules will be $5,000 for individuals and $25,000 for corporations."}]
