[{"title": "Farmers Edge putting down roots worldwide", "article": "At an investment forum in Winnipeg last fall, a handful of agri-tech venture capital investors from across North America knowingly nudged each other and agreed out loud precision-farming technologies was just too crowded and competitive to be a comfortable fit for them to invest in. Wade Barnes, CEO of Winnipeg-based Farmers Edge, is up to the challenge of showing them how ill-advised that position will be for them. Farmers Edge has been around since 2005 and has grown with the precision agriculture and independent data-management business to be able to refer to itself as a global leader. Since the fall, Farmers Edge announced another round of venture capital investment totalling $58 million, with add-on investments from its initial Silicon Valley backer, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers , along with the multibillion-dollar Japanese conglomerate Mitsui & Co., Ltd . and Osmington, Inc., the private investment vehicle of David Thomson , co-owner of the Winnipeg Jets and one of the richest men in the world. Barnes, who is a mixture of down-home Prairie farm boy - he grew up on a farm near Birtle - and visionary entrepreneur, does not even try to pass himself off as a tech-industry darling. He said, only half-jokingly, he used to need one of his board members, Anita Wortzman, to translate what the VCs were saying to him and what he was saying to them. Barnes likes to talk about how Farmers Edge can beat the likes of Monsanto and DuPont Pioneer - which he says are really the only other competitors that matter in the precision-farming industry - because at Farmers Edge, they are not afraid to get their boots dirty. Precision farming uses big data to develop predictive modelling down to the exact field level that will let farmers make more money by becoming much more targeted in how they plant, harvest, apply fertilizer and operate their machines. But the thing about it is the data are really not that big yet. The business is only a few years old. That means there's still not enough data to make the algorithms effective enough to generate the targeted predictive models that will always get the results the farmers are looking for. But it is getting better and better. Barnes says, \"There are a lot of promises being made about the future. But the real true value will come in a year or two, when suddenly you can start doing very accurate predictive modelling like what a crop is going to yield even before it comes off the field.\" So with that being the setup, it means the more acres you have, the better your algorithms will be in generating the most accurate models and the more successful your precision-farming company will be. Monsanto , which pole-vaulted itself into the business in 2013 with the US$930-million acquisition of startup company Climate Corp . in 2013, talks about the potential of servicing one billion acres. Barnes says it's like a land rush among the competitors to sign up as many acres as possible first. Farmers Edge is on pace to hit 7.5 million to eight million acres by the end of the year, putting the company at around $25 million in annual revenue. Monsanto is way ahead. In addition to some venture capitalists, there are plenty of other farming experts who are skeptical of precision-farming's promises. Barnes is not unaware of that skepticism, which is why the company is using its fresh capital to expand into the U.S., Brazil, Australia and eastern Europe to sign up acres as fast as it can, likely growing its employee count to 300 by the end of the year. Because if Farmers Edge's promises do come true, those farmers won't want to switch. Playing the role of a Prairie farm boy in the ag-tech world, which requires hundreds of millions of dollars to compete in, did not seem like a good idea at first. Even Barnes' champions at Kleiner Perkins were keen to inject some Silicon Valley smarts into the operation. For example, Barnes said he was being encouraged to recruit a chief technology officer from the tech heartland, but Barnes liked a smart computer science professor from the University of Lethbridge: Kevin Grant, who grew up on a farm in Saskatchewan and was already doing some business with Barnes. When Netflix tried to recruit him, the Kleiner Perkins guys backed off. Farmers are protective of their independence, and another hurdle big data has to overcome is their reluctance to let the big input companies such as Monsanto get too much of their info. That's another reason the Prairie farm boy profile works for Farmers Edge. martin.cash@freepress.mb.ca"}, {"title": "AJX AgJunction loses $9.13-million (U.S.) in 2015", "article": "AgJunction Inc (TSX:AJX) Shares Issued 123,405,391 Monday March 28 2016 - News Release Mr. Dave Vaughn reports AGJUNCTION REPORTS Q4 2015 RESULTS AND PROVIDES POST-MERGER UPDATE AgJunction Inc. has released its financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended Dec. 31, 2015. All currency amounts are expressed in U.S. dollars. AgJunction also announces the adoption of an advance notice bylaw and approval by the board of directors of AgJunction of an amended and restated shareholder rights plan agreement. Postmerger update AgJunction's mission is to become one of the world's leading original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and value-added reseller (VAR) supplier for automated steering and machine control technology for precision agriculture. During the fourth quarter of 2015, AgJunction successfully completed a merger with Novariant Inc., strengthening its position within the OEM precision guidance and machine control markets. The combined organization is differentiated by its ability to deliver application-specific technology to precision agriculture customers worldwide. The merger resulted in internal changes, including leadership changes at the board and management levels, and structural changes allowing for the merger of both companies. Leadership team In addition to the appointment of Dave Vaughn as the president and chief executive officer, the company has attracted and retained a strong leadership team focused on innovation and intellectual property, with a deep understanding of regional requirements for new product introduction. Bob Barjesteh has been appointed vice-president of intellectual property (IP) and general counsel. Mr. Barjesteh is managing the company's substantial patent portfolio and leading AgJunction's IP team. AgJunction's IP portfolio is a strategic asset, and an area of focus and continued investment. In addition, Kevin Monk joined the company as vice-president of global marketing to lead marketing initiatives and develop go-to-market strategies for the combined company. Mr. Monk is leading the integration of the company's product road map to position AgJunction as the industry's supplier of choice. Further, AgJunction is pleased to announce the appointment of Mike Manning as senior vice-president and chief financial officer of the company effective April 1, 2016. Mr. Manning has been the interim senior vice-president and chief financial officer of the company since July 7, 2015. Global presence Combined, the company has a larger global presence with 160 employees worldwide. The company maintains executive offices in Fremont, Calif., and corporate headquarters and finance offices in Hiawatha, Kan. A global presence is maintained with research and development (R&D) facilities in Scottsdale, Ariz.; Brisbane, Australia; Fremont, Calif.; and Hiawatha, Kan., with worldwide sales and support presence in the Unites States, Canada, Europe, South America and China. AgJunction maps to its customers' locations and scales to the customer base, surrounding them with critical sales, product and engineering teams. Customer pursuit, retention and care are paramount to AgJunction's go-to-market strategy. Patents and intellectual property AgJunction believes that its diverse intellectual property portfolio is among the broadest and most diverse in the precision steering and machine control market. Foundational and key patents are built around the core elements of guidance, auto steering, mapping, task control, GNSS and machine control, with many patents valid past 2025. A key strength of patent IP is that it provides attractive security and protection for partners who integrate AgJunction solutions. Products AgJunction designs, manufactures and markets innovative and cost-effective technology products for ground- and air-based agriculture applications. The precision solutions offered by AgJunction help end-users gain efficiency and decrease costs, resulting in higher returns to the customers' bottom line. With the completion of the merger, the company offers customers a broader and differentiated product suite. Existing products will maintain their respective branding. AgJunction's engineering teams are working on complementary technologies around automated steering and machine control solutions, including sensor fusion and control with an interoperable solutions architecture. OEM, VAR and after-market retail sales Reliable auto steering is a prerequisite to precision agriculture successfully increasing productivity in the field. A strategic market shift is under way, as machine manufacturers worldwide increasingly integrate auto-steer technologies at the factory level. Globally, AgJunction partners with leading OEMs in each region to integrate its solutions into their machines. VAR customers integrate AgJunction technology into their solutions to provide a complete system for after-market customers. AgJunction also provides a leading solution directly to the end-user through its Outback and Satloc product lines. State of the agriculture market In February, 2016, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) reported that both net cash and net farm income are forecast to decline for the third consecutive year. Net farm income is forecast to be $54.7-billion in 2016, down 2.5 per cent from the 2015 forecast level. The 2016 forecast for net farm income would be the lowest since 2006 and drop 56 per cent from the record high of $123.3-billion in 2013. AgJunction management views the fundamentals of its global agriculture markets to be neutral to slightly down in 2016 versus 2015. However, management believes that globally, there are currently pockets of opportunity. In the long term, management believes that worldwide market demand driven by population growth, limited arable land and a relatively low global penetration of precision agriculture technologies will lead to favourable conditions for the company's products. The company continues to experience increased activity in China as the Chinese government increased its support for the sector. In recent press conference comments, China's Agriculture Minister Han Changfu discussed China's need to focus on supply-side reform, especially in corn, because of bumper harvests and surplus grain stockpiles. Mr. Han indicated that increasing farmer incomes will be a government priority over the next five years, with a focus on agricultural industrialization, cutting costs and improving technology. AgJunction is providing core technology to Chinese partners resulting in Chinese-manufactured solutions which qualify for the government assistance programs. \"The industry forecast for 2016 remains challenging for companies in the agriculture space,\" said Dave Vaughn, AgJunction's chief executive officer. \"Due to this and to duplication of resources identified after the merger, at the end of 2015 we embarked on a pro-active reduction in work force to decrease our operating costs for 2016. Coinciding with our internal focus on operating costs and efficiencies, our external focus in 2016 is to leverage the synergies created by the merger, reducing costs and increasing customer satisfaction to return to profitable growth. The precision agriculture industry continues to evolve at an increased rate, and, as a combined company, we believe we are uniquely positioned to support this high pace of innovation and technology integration with current and anticipated new product offerings for both end-users and farm equipment manufacturers.\" Fourth-quarter financial review AgJunction's consolidated 2015 fourth-quarter results are presented as a combined entity. However, because the merger was completed after the start of AgJunction's fourth quarter, the financial results in this fourth-quarter financial report include only 77 days of Novariant's operations versus the full 92 days of AgJunction's operations. The comparative fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, 2014, does not include Novariant's operations. For the three months ended Dec. 31, 2015, the company reported revenue of $11.6-million, a 17-per-cent increase from $10.0-million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Of the $11.6-million, $8.4-million or 72 per cent was contributed by AgJunction, and $3.2-million or 28 per cent was contributed by Novariant. Year-over-year fourth-quarter revenues for AgJunction (excluding Novariant) declined 15 per cent as the company's combined end-markets continued to experience general softness globally. Total revenue in the Americas region for the quarter was up 14 per cent from 2014 as a result of the acquisition of Novariant. In other regions, sales increased 52 per cent in Asia Pacific (APAC) to $900,000, and 15 per cent in Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) to $5.4-million. The OEM and VAR business is a core focus of the recently merged entity, and new partners were signed during the fourth quarter. Special operating result analysis and expense detail of Q4 2015 Due to the timing of the completion of the merger with Novariant in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the integration of the two companies, management has included additional information in the associated tables that will not be provided in future reporting of financial results. The associated table shows AgJunction and Novariant as stand-alone entities and on a consolidated basis.  The associated table lists certain items impacting net income (loss) in Q4, which related to the acquisition of Novariant or related restructuring, which had a one-time impact on results. The unusual decrease in gross margin was largely attributable to over $600,000 of higher cost of goods sold relating to Q4 sales of Novariant inventory, whereby that inventory had been written up to fair value at acquisition as part of standard purchase accounting processes. Also contributing to the gross margin decrease in Q4 was $300,000 of inventory writedowns related to overlapping product lines between the merged companies. There is an additional $300,000 fair value write-up of Novariant inventory from purchase accounting processes on the balance sheet as of Dec. 31, 2015, which will impact first-quarter 2016 results. Total impact to gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2015 related to the merger, restructuring and other items denoted in the associated table was $1.1-million. Excluding these non-recurring items, gross profit in the fourth quarter of 2015 would have been approximately $3.9-million or 34 per cent of sales. In addition to the non-recurring items detailed above, gross margin was impacted by an additional $500,000 of obsolescence reserve, $300,000 of warranty costs and approximately $500,000 in lower margins related to low sales volume in Q4. These items had an impact of $1.3-million or an additional 10 percentage points on gross margin after adjusting for the above non-recurring expenses.  Standard operating expense analysis of Q4 2015 Total operating expenses were $7.8-million in the fourth quarter, up $3.1-million or 65 per cent from $4.7-million in the fourth quarter of 2014, with $1.3-million of the increase a result of continuing operating expenses picked up from the fourth-quarter merger with Novariant, but also including non-recurring charges totalling approximately $1.5-million, detailed above. In the course of postmerger integration activities, duplicate resources were identified. Accordingly, on Dec. 30, 2015, the company announced a reduction targeted at 20 per cent of its work force. This restructuring is expected to reduce annual operating costs by approximately $3.3-million going forward, with a related one-time restructuring charge of $500,000 incurred in December, 2015. General and administrative expenses were $3.2-million, and included non-recurring $600,000 in increased compensation costs of key management personnel, $400,000 in Novariant merger-transaction-related costs and $400,000 in restructuring costs. Research and development expense of $2.9-million was 81 per cent or $1.3-million higher in the fourth quarter of 2015, of which approximately $800,000 was attributable to Novariant departmental expenses, $400,000 was related to lower capitalization of research and development costs, and $100,000 was related to restructuring costs. Sales and marketing expenses of $1.7-million were 21 per cent higher than the fourth quarter of 2014. AgJunction has capitalized certain development costs over the last several years, as required under international financial reporting standards (IFRS) rules when specific requirements are met. IFRS accounting rules require that the completed project costs be amortized over the expected life of the intangible asset. The major projects being worked on were completed in 2015, and a thorough analysis of all intangible assets was completed in the fourth quarter. AgJunction determined the recoverability of these research and development intangibles was not probable, which resulted in an impairment of $4.7-million, the full amount that was on the books for these intangible assets. For the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, 2015, the company reported a net loss of $9.9-million, or nine cents per share, compared with a net loss of $16.5-million, or 23 cents per share, in the fourth quarter of 2014. The $9.9-million net loss for the quarter would have been about $2.6-million without the $4.7-million intangible impairment, and the $2.6-million of acquisition-related and other one-time expenses detailed above. 12-month financial review For the year ended Dec. 31, 2015, total revenue was $39.0-million, representing a 13-per-cent decrease from $44.8-million in 2014. Gross margin for the year was $14.8-million, or 38 per cent, versus $20.3-million, or 45 per cent, in 2014. The $5.5-million decrease resulted partly from decreased revenue, partly from acquisition-related items, and partly from an inventory writedown and increase in the inventory allowance taken in the fourth quarter. Total operating expenses were $20.6-million in 2015, down by 2 per cent or $400,000 from $21.0-million in 2014. Operating expenses were lower throughout 2015 primarily due to decreases in engineering head count, the sale of the agronomy services business, decreases in project spending, and an increase in capitalized research and development. R&D expenditures of $6.7-million declined from $7.1-million in 2014, representing a decrease of $400,000 or 6 per cent. Sales and marketing expenses were $5.4-million in 2015, down by 13 per cent or $800,000 from $6.2-million in 2014, due to reduced spending on external advertising. General and administrative expenses for 2015 were $8.4-million compared with $7.7-million in 2014, representing an increase of $700,000 or 9 per cent. As reported in 2014, the company incurred litigation costs of $1.8-million relating to a lawsuit the company brought against a competitor believed to be infringing on the company's proprietary software; however, the current year also had significant legal costs related to the Novariant acquisition and other legal costs surrounding legal reviews of combined company synergies. Net of transaction specific costs in 2014 and 2015, the remaining difference of $600,000 relates to increased compensation costs of key management personnel, of which $600,000 is non-recurring. For the year, AgJunction realized a loss from continuing operations of $9.1-million or 11 cents per share (basic and diluted) in 2015 compared with a loss from continuing operations of $16.7-million or 23 cents per share (basic and diluted) in 2014. In 2014, the company recognized a goodwill impairment of $15.9-million. In October, 2015, the company issued 49,291,026 common shares as consideration in the acquisition of Novariant representing $24.9-million. In 2016, the company recognized an impairment charge to intangible assets of $4.7-million. As of March 28, 2016, AgJunction has 123,405,391 common shares outstanding and 6,969,823 stock options outstanding. Directors, officers and other insiders directly or indirectly hold or represent approximately 28 per cent of the outstanding common shares. On Dec. 31, 2015, the company held cash of $13.0-million, which included $1.6-million of the $3.6-million acquired in the merger with Novariant. This compares with cash held of $11.2-million at the end of 2014. Working capital was $26.7-million, up from $22.4-million at Dec. 31, 2014. Advance notice bylaw Like many other public companies, the board has approved the bylaw, which includes, among other things, a provision that requires advance notice to the company in circumstances where nominations of persons for election to the board are made by shareholders of the company other than pursuant to: (i) a proposal made in accordance with Section 136(1) of the Business Corporations Act (Alberta) or (ii) or a requisition of the shareholders made in accordance with Section 142(1) of the act. Among other things, the bylaw fixes a deadline by which holders of record of common shares of AgJunction must submit director nominations to the corporate secretary of the company prior to any annual or special meeting of shareholders, and sets forth the specific information that a shareholder must include in the written notice to the corporate secretary of the company for an effective nomination to occur. No person will be eligible for election as a director of the company unless nominated in accordance with the provisions of the bylaw. In the case of an annual general meeting of shareholders, notice to the corporate secretary of the company must be made not less than 30 nor more than 65 days prior to the date of the annual general meeting of shareholders; provided, however, that in the event that the annual general meeting of shareholders is to be held on a date that is less than 50 days after the date on which the first public announcement of the date of the annual meeting was made, notice by the nominating shareholder may be made not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the notice date. In the case of a special meeting (which is not also an annual general meeting) of shareholders called for the purpose of electing directors (whether or not called for other purposes), notice to the corporate secretary of the company must be made not later than the close of business on the 15th day following the day on which the first public announcement of the date of the special meeting of shareholders was made. The bylaw is effective, and in full force and effect as of the date hereof. In accordance with the terms of the bylaw, the bylaw will be put to shareholders of the company for approval at its annual general and special meeting of shareholders that will be held on Thursday, May 26, 2016. If the bylaw is not confirmed at the shareholders meeting by ordinary resolution of shareholders, the bylaw will terminate, and be of no further force and effect following the termination of the shareholders meeting. The full text of the bylaw will be available on AgJunction's SEDAR profile or upon request by contacting the corporate secretary of the company at 785-742-5149 or by e-mail at MManning@agjunction.com. Amended and restated shareholder rights plan agreement The board has also approved the amended agreement, which will be placed before shareholders for approval at the company's upcoming shareholders meeting. If the amended agreement is approved by the shareholders of AgJunction at such meeting, the amended agreement will be effective until the close of business of the annual general meeting of shareholders of AgJunction held in 2019, unless it is reconfirmed at such meeting or it is otherwise terminated in accordance with its terms. The amended agreement was approved by the board in response to the proposed legislative changes to Canada's takeover bid regime, including the Canadian Securities Administrators notice dated Feb. 25, 2016, \"Amendments to the Take-Over Bid Regime -- Amendments to Multilateral Instrument 62-104 -- Take-Over Bid and Issuer Bids and Changes to National Policy 62-203 -- Take-Over Bids and Issuer Bids,\" and the consequential amendments, which are expected to be effective May 9, 2016. In view of these proposed legislative changes as set forth in the CSA notice, under the terms of the amended agreement, it is proposed that the definition of a permitted bid be increased from 60 days to 105 days. Furthermore, it is proposed that provisions be added to make it clear that if the company determines to announce that it is reducing a proposed bid period to a shorter period of at least 35 days, the shorter period would apply to all contemporaneous bids, and if the company announces a friendly transaction, the minimum deposit period for all contemporaneous bids would automatically be reduced to 35 days. In originally adopting the shareholder rights plan agreement, the board considered the then-existing legislative framework governing takeover bids in Canada. The directors believed such legislation did not provide sufficient time to permit shareholders to consider a takeover bid, and make a reasoned and unhurried decision with respect to a bid, or give the board sufficient time to develop alternatives for maximizing shareholder value. Shareholders also may have felt compelled to tender to a bid even if the shareholder considers such bid to be inadequate out of a concern that failing to tender may result in a shareholder being left with illiquid or minority-discounted common shares. While the legislative changes address many concerns related to unequal treatment of securityholders, there remains the possibility that control of an issuer may be acquired pursuant to private agreements in which a small group of securityholders disposes of securities at a premium to market price, which premium is not shared with the other securityholders. The current shareholder rights plan agreement of the company addresses this concern, as does the amended agreement. The full text of the amended agreement will be available in AgJunction's information circular for the shareholders meeting, which will be mailed to shareholders.

Of the $11.6 million, $8.4 million- or 72%- was contributed by AgJunction and $3.2 million- or 28%- was contributed by Novariant. Year-over-year fourth quarter revenues for AgJunction (excluding Novariant) declined 15% as the Company's combined end-markets continued to experience general softness globally. Total revenue in the Americas region for the quarter was up 14% from 2014 as a result of the acquisition of Novariant. In other regions, sales increased 52% in Asia Pacific (APAC) to $0.9 million and 15% in Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) to $5.4 million. The OEM and VAR business is a core focus of the recently merged entity and new partners were signed during the fourth quarter. Special Operating Result Analysis and Expense Detail of Q4 2015 Due to the timing of the completion of the merger with Novariant in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the integration of the two companies, management has included additional information in the following tables that will not be provided in future reporting of financial results. The table shows AgJunction and Novariant as stand-alone entities and on a consolidated basis.  28 Mar 2016 17:00 ET Press Release: AgJunction Reports Q4 2015 Results -2-  The table below lists certain items impacting net income (loss) in Q4 which related to the acquisition of Novariant or related restructuring, which had a one-time impact on results. The unusual decrease in gross margin was largely attributable to over $0.6 million of higher cost of goods sold relating to Q4 sales of Novariant inventory whereby that inventory had been written up to fair value at acquisition as part of standard purchase accounting processes. Also contributing to the gross margin decrease in Q4 was $0.3 million of inventory write-downs related to overlapping product lines between the merged companies. There is an additional $0.3 million fair value write up of Novariant inventory from purchase accounting processes on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 which will impact Q1 2016 results. Total impact to gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2015 related to the merger, restructuring and other items denoted below was $1.1 million. Excluding these non-recurring items gross profit in the fourth quarter of 2015 would have been approximately $3.9 million or 34% of sales. In addition to the non-recurring items detailed above, gross margin was impacted by an additional $0.5 million of obsolescence reserve, $0.3 million of warranty costs, and approximately $0.5 million in lower margins related to low sales volume in Q4. These items had an impact of $1.3 million or an additional ten percentage points on gross margin after adjusting for the above non-recurring expenses.  Standard Operating Expense Analysis of Q4 2015 Total operating expenses were $7.8 million in the fourth quarter up $3.1 million or 65% from $4.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 with $1.3 million of the increase a result of ongoing operating expenses picked up from the fourth quarter merger with Novariant, but also including non-recurring charges totaling approximately $1.5 million, detailed above. In the course of post-merger integration activities, duplicate resources were identified. Accordingly, on December 30, 2015 the Company announced a reduction targeted at 20% of its work force. This restructuring is expected to reduce annual operating costs by approximately $3.3 million going forward with a related one-time restructuring charge of $0.5 million incurred in December 2015. General and administrative expenses were $3.2 million and included non-recurring $0.6 million in increased compensation costs of key management personnel, $0.4 million in Novariant merger transaction related costs, and $0.4 million in restructuring costs. Research and development expense of $2.9 million was 81% or $1.3 million higher in the fourth quarter of 2015 of which approximately $0.8 million was attributable to Novariant departmental expenses, $0.4 million was related to lower capitalization of research and development costs, and $0.1 million was related to restructuring costs. Sales and marketing expenses of $1.7 million were 21% higher than the fourth quarter of 2014. AgJunction has capitalized certain development costs over the last several years, as required under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) rules when specific requirements are met. IFRS accounting rules require that the completed project costs be amortized over the expected life of the intangible asset. The major projects being worked on were completed in 2015, and a thorough analysis of all intangible assets was completed in the fourth quarter. AgJunction determined the recoverability of these research and development intangibles was not probable, which resulted in an impairment of $4.7 million, the full amount that was on the books for these intangible assets. For the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2015, the Company reported a net loss of $9.9 million, or ($0.09) per share, compared to a net loss of $16.5 million, or ($0.23) per share, in the fourth quarter of 2014. The $9.9 million net loss for the quarter would have been about $2.6 million without the $4.7 million intangible impairment and the $2.6 million of acquisition related and other one-time expenses detailed above. Twelve Month Financial Review For the year ended December 31, 2015, total revenue was $39.0 million representing a 13% decrease from $44.8 million in 2014. Gross margin for the year was $14.8 million, or 38%, versus $20.3 million, or 45%, in 2014. The $5.5 million decrease resulted partly from decreased revenue, partly from acquisition related items, and partly from an inventory write-down and increase in the inventory allowance taken in the fourth quarter. Total operating expenses were $20.6 million in 2015, down by 2% or $0.4 million from $21.0 million in 2014. Operating expenses were lower throughout 2015 primarily due to decreases in engineering headcount, the sale of the Agronomy Services business, decreases in project spending, and an increase in capitalized R&D. R&D expenditures of $6.7 million declined from $7.1 million in 2014 representing a decrease of $0.4 million or 6%. Sales and marketing expenses were $5.4 million in 2015, down by 13% or $0.8 million from $6.2 million in 2014, due to reduced spending on external advertising. General and administrative expenses for 2015 were $8.4 million compared to $7.7 million in 2014 representing an increase of $0.7 million or 9%. As reported in 2014, the Company incurred litigation costs of $1.8 million relating to a lawsuit the Company brought against a competitor believed to be infringing on the Company's proprietary software, however the current year also had significant legal costs related to the Novariant acquisition and other legal costs surrounding legal reviews of combined company synergies. Net of transaction specific costs in 2014 and 2015, the remaining difference of $0.6 million relates to increased compensation costs of key management personnel, of which $0.6 is non-recurring. For the year, AgJunction realized a loss from continuing operations of $9.1 million or ($0.11) per share (basic and diluted) in 2015 compared to a loss from continuing operations of $16.7 million or ($0.23) per share (basic and diluted) in 2014. In 2014, the Company recognized a goodwill impairment of $15.9 million. In October 2015, the company issued 49,291,026 common shares as consideration in the acquisition of Novariant representing $24.9 million. In 2016, the Company recognized an impairment charge to intangible assets of $4.7 million. As of March 28, 2016, AgJunction has 123,405,391 common shares outstanding and 6,969,823 stock options outstanding. Directors, officers, and other insiders directly or indirectly hold or represent approximately 28% of the outstanding common shares. On December 31, 2015, the Company held cash of $13.0 million which included $1.6 million of the $3.6 million acquired in the merger with Novariant. This compares to cash held of $11.2 million at the end of 2014. Working capital was $26.7 million, up from $22.4 million at December 31, 2014. Advance Notice Bylaw Like many other public companies, the Board has approved the Bylaw, which includes, among other things, a provision that requires advance notice to the Company in circumstances where nominations of persons for election to the Board are made by shareholders of the Company other than pursuant to: (i) a \"proposal\" made in accordance with section 136(1) of the Business Corporations Act (Alberta) (the \"Act\"); or (ii) or a requisition of the shareholders made in accordance with section 142(1) of the Act. Among other things, the Bylaw fixes a deadline by which holders of record of common shares of AgJunction must submit director nominations to the Corporate Secretary of the Company prior to any annual or special meeting of shareholders and sets forth the specific information that a shareholder must include in the written notice to the Corporate Secretary of the Company for an effective nomination to occur. No person will be eligible for election as a director of the Company unless nominated in accordance with the provisions of the Bylaw. In the case of an annual general meeting of shareholders, notice to the Corporate Secretary of the Company must be made not less than 30 nor more than 65 days prior to the date of the annual general meeting of shareholders; provided, however, that in the event that the annual general meeting of shareholders is to be held on a date that, is less than 50 days after the date (the \"Notice Date\") on which the first public announcement of the date of the annual meeting was made, notice by the nominating shareholder may be made not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the Notice Date. 28 Mar 2016 17:00 ET Press Release: AgJunction Reports Q4 2015 Results -3- In the case of a special meeting (which is not also an annual general meeting) of shareholders called for the purpose of electing directors (whether or not called for other purposes), notice to the Corporate Secretary of the Company must be made not later than the close of business on the fifteenth (15th) day following the day on which the first public announcement of the date of the special meeting of shareholders was made. The Bylaw is effective and in full force and effect as of the date hereof. In accordance with the terms of the Bylaw, the Bylaw will be put to shareholders of the Company for approval at its annual general and special meeting of shareholders that will be held on Thursday, May 26, 2016 (the \"Shareholders Meeting\"). If the Bylaw is not confirmed at the Shareholders Meeting by ordinary resolution of shareholders, the Bylaw will terminate and be of no further force and effect following the termination of the Shareholders Meeting. Amended and Restated Shareholder Rights Plan Agreement The Board has also approved the Amended Agreement, which will be placed before shareholders for approval at the Company's upcoming Shareholders Meeting. If the Amended Agreement is approved by the shareholders of AgJunction at such meeting, the Amended Agreement will be effective until the close of business of the annual general meeting of shareholders of AgJunction held in 2019, unless it is reconfirmed at such meeting or it is otherwise terminated in accordance with its terms. The Amended Agreement was approved by the Board in response to the proposed legislative changes to Canada's take-over bid regime, including the Canadian Securities Administrators Notice dated February 25, 2016 Amendments to the Take-Over Bid Regime -- Amendments to Multilateral Instrument 62-104 -- Take-Over Bid and Issuer Bids and Changes to National Policy 62-203 -- Take-Over Bids and Issuer Bids (the \"CSA Notice\") and the consequential amendments, which are expected to be effective May 9, 2016 (the \"Legislative Changes\"). In view of these proposed Legislative Changes as set forth in CSA Notice, under the terms of the Amended Agreement, it is proposed that the definition of a \"Permitted Bid\" be increased from 60 days to 105 days. Furthermore, it is proposed that provisions be added to make it clear that if the Company determines to announce that it is reducing a proposed bid period to a shorter period of at least 35 days, the shorter period would apply to all contemporaneous bids, and if the Company announces a friendly transaction, the minimum deposit period for all contemporaneous bids would automatically be reduced to 35 days. In originally adopting the shareholder rights plan agreement, the Board considered the then existing legislative framework governing take-over bids in Canada. The directors believed such legislation did not provide sufficient time to permit shareholders to consider a take-over bid and make a reasoned and unhurried decision with respect to a bid or give the Board sufficient time to develop alternatives for maximizing shareholder value. Shareholders also may have felt compelled to tender to a bid even if the shareholder considers such bid to be inadequate out of a concern that failing to tender may result in a shareholder being left with illiquid or minority-discounted common shares. While the Legislative Changes address many concerns related to unequal treatment of security holders, there remains the possibility that control of an issuer may be acquired pursuant to private agreements in which a small group of security holders disposes of securities at a premium to market price, which premium is not shared with the other security holders. The current shareholder rights plan agreement of the Company addresses this concern, as does the Amended Agreement. The full text of the Amended Agreement will be available in AgJunction's information circular for the Shareholders Meeting, which will be mailed to shareholders.

(\"Silver Wheaton \" or the \"Company\") (TSX:SLW) (NYSE:SLW) is pleased to announce that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Silver Wheaton (Caymans) Ltd. (\"SWC\"), has entered into a definitive Early Deposit Precious Metals Purchase Agreement (the \"Cotabambas Early Deposit Agreement\") with Panoro Minerals Ltd . and its wholly owned subsidiary Panoro Trading (Cayman) Ltd. (\"Panoro\") in respect of the Cotabambas project located in Peru. SWC will be entitled to purchase 100% of the silver production and 25% of the gold production from the Cotabambas project until 90 million silver equivalent ounces attributable to SWC have been delivered, at which point the stream would drop to 66.67% of silver production and 16.67% of gold production for the life of mine. Under the Cotabambas Early Deposit Agreement, SWC will pay a total cash consideration of US$140 million plus an ongoing production payment of the lesser of: i) US$5.90 for each silver ounce and US$450 for each gold ounce (both subject to a 1% annual inflation adjustment starting in the fourth year after the completion test is satisfied) and ii) the prevailing market price. Once certain conditions have been met, SWC will advance US$14 million to Panoro, spread over up to nine years. In 2016, SWC anticipates making advanced payments of between US$2 million and US$4 million to Panoro. Following the delivery of a bankable definitive feasibility study, environmental study and impact assessment, and other related documents (collectively, the \"Feasibility Documentation\"), and receipt of permits and construction commencing, SWC may then advance the remaining deposit or elect to terminate the Cotabambas Early Deposit Agreement.

Barrick Gold Corporation (TSE: ABX) - Barrick Announces Final Results and Settlement of $750 Million Debt Tender Offer - 21/3/2016 TORONTO, March 21, 2016 -- Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:ABX)(TSX:ABX) (\"Barrick\" or the \"company\") announced today the final results and settlement of its $750 million cash tender offer (the \"Tender Offer\") for specified series of outstanding notes (the \"Notes\"). The terms and conditions of the Tender Offer were described in an offer to purchase (the \"Offer to Purchase\") and the related letter of transmittal (the \"Letter of Transmittal\"), each dated February 22, 2016. On February 17, 2016, Barrick announced its intention to reduce its total debt by at least $2 billion by the end of 2016. The Tender Offer is in furtherance of this debt reduction target. The Tender Offer The Tender Offer commenced on February 22, 2016. Barrick, Barrick North America Finance LLC and Barrick (PD) Australia Finance Pty Ltd (together, the \"Offerors\") offered to purchase for cash the series of Notes set out in the tables below for an aggregate purchase price (including principal and premium) of up to $750,000,000 (the \"Maximum Tender Amount\"), plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes from the last applicable interest payment date up to, but not including, the Settlement Date (as defined below). The amount of a series of Notes accepted for purchase in the Tender Offer was based on the order of priority (the \"Acceptance Priority Level\") for such series of Notes as set forth in the tables below, with 1 being the highest Acceptance Priority Level and 7 being the lowest Acceptance Priority Level.

Barrick Gold Corporation (TSE: ABX) - Barrick Announces Appointment of Rob Krcmarov as Executive Vice President, Exploration and Growth, and Creation of Growth Committee - 17/3/2016 TORONTO, March 17, 2016 -- Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:ABX)(TSX:ABX) (Barrick or the \"company\") today announced that Rob Krcmarov , currently Senior Vice President, Global Exploration, has been elevated to the position of Executive Vice President, Exploration and Growth, and will become a member of Barrick's Executive Committee, a group of the company's most senior partners. Mr. Krcmarov is a seasoned mining industry leader with nearly 30 years of experience in geology and exploration. For the past 10 years, he has led a global team of geoscientists and exploration professionals at Barrick who are responsible for the discovery of a number of the largest gold deposits in recent decades, including Lagunas Norte and Goldrush, in addition to Alturas, an equally promising new discovery in Chile. Mr. Krcmarov joined Barrick in 2001 with the merger of Homestake Mining Company and was appointed Vice President, Global Exploration in 2005. He holds a Bachelor of Science (Honors) degree from the University of Adelaide and a Master's degree in Economic Geology from the University of Tasmania . In conjunction with the release of the company's 2015 year-end results, we outlined a base case for our business that involves the pursuit of three strategic goals over the next five years. The first is a profound commitment to the idea that in the 21st century, our core business is building partnerships of real depth and trust with host governments, local communities, NGOs, indigenous people, and others. The second goal is to produce the leading margins in the industry by operating in a way that is gold-price agnostic, such that we can generate and grow free cash flow per share in virtually any foreseeable gold price environment. The third goal is superior portfolio management that prioritizes growing free cash flow over growing ounces. Planning for and managing this future growth is critical. Achieving it relies on many groups working together, including Mine Exploration, Global Exploration, Business Development, our Reserves and Resources team, and Finance. It also requires close collaboration with our General Managers and Executive Directors. To support this effort, we are creating a new Growth Committee at the most senior levels of the company. Serving on this committee will be Rob Krcmarov , Kevin Thomson, Senior Executive Vice President, Strategic Matters, and Catherine Raw, who will become Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer immediately following the company's Annual Meeting of Shareholders on April 26. The Growth Committee will evaluate strategies to optimize the development of our existing reserves and resources while adding new resources through exploration. It will also play a central role in assessing external acquisitions and earn-in opportunities, all with the objective of growing free cash flow per share over the long-term. The Committee will serve as a central clearing house to ensure strategic alignment and appropriate coordination of all major growth initiatives across the company. Latest Research Overview of Geothermal Energy Resources in Quebec (Canada) Mining Enviroments Jasmin Raymond, Rene Therrien, Ferri Hassani Abstract Rising energy costs, as well as environmental concerns, are driving engineering innovation to reduce energy consumption while remaining competitive, diversify energy supplies and reduce carbon emissions. In that context, geothermal energy represents an alternative to common energy sources. Low-temperature geothermal energy associated with mine sites is gaining acceptance as an economically attractive option for both active mines and nearby communities. Recent studies assessing the geothermal potential of various mining environments have shown promising results. These studies assessed closed and active underground mines as well as flooded open pits and mine waste dumps. Various ground source heat pump designs exist for these systems to exchange geothermal energy using either ground, surface or close-loop water. Different types of mining environments therefore host significant geothermal resources that are readily exploitable with today's technologies. Research and demonstration projects undertaken in the province of Quebec have illustrated the benefits associated with the exploitation of geothermal energy in mining environments. For example, the geothermal energy extraction potential of the flooded underground Gaspe Mines, near Murdochville in eastern Quebec, was estimated at 765 kW. This sustainable ground load is calculated for a pumping rate of 0.049 m3 /s, mwith a production temperature of 6.7 degC and a return temperature of 3 degC. In another project, a surface water heat pump system using water flooding a quarry was developed at Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville in southern Quebec. The system is used to heat and cool 36 apartments in a condominium complex, having a total surface of 6 039 m2 . Research also began at the South dump of the Doyon Mine in the Abitibi region of Quebec to evaluate the technical feasibility of geothermal energy exchange at mine waste dumps. Thermal energy resources contained in the South Dump and the underlying basement are estimated at 1,678,417 GJ from temperature profiles measured in 2007. Additional feasibility studies that recently started at flooded underground mines of British-Colombia, Ontario and the Northwest Territories indicate substantial energy savings. Canada is blessed with abundant natural resources; it hosts a large number of active and closed mines and it is therefore a prime target for developing geothermal energy associated with mine sites. Several research initiatives are expected to further contribute to develop geothermal energy in Canadian mining environments. The Industry Mining Facts Minerals and metals are the building blocks of the computers and smartphones we rely on, of the vehicles and public transit that get us places, of the buildings where we live and work, and of green technologies that help make the world a more sustainable place. Just as we as individuals depend on mining to support our daily lives, Canada relies on the industry to keep the economy humming. Mining is one of Canada's most important economic sectors and a major job creator. A major employer: Approximately 380,000 people across Canada work in the mining and mineral processing industries. Mining is the largest private sector employer of Aboriginal peoples in Canada on a proportional basis, and employment is poised to increase. Canada has one of the largest mining supply sectors globally with more than 3,400 companies supplying engineering, geotechnical, environmental, financial and other services to mining operations. Those who work in mining enjoy the highest wages and salaries of all industrial sectors in Canada with an average annual pay exceeding $110,000, which surpassed the average earnings of workers in forestry, manufacturing, finance and construction by a range of $31,000 to $46,000 for those sectors. An economic engine: Mining contributed $54 billion to Canada's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2013. The industry accounted for 19.6% of the value of Canadian goods exports in 2013. Canada's value of mineral production was nearly $43.6 billion in 2013. The mining industry's payments to Canadian federal and provincial governments total $71 billion in taxes and royalties over the last decade (2003-2012). A global leader: Thanks to its rich geology, Canada is one of the largest mining nations in the world producing more than 60 minerals and metals. Canada ranks in the top five countries in the global production of 11 major minerals and metals: First in potash Second in uranium and cobalt Third in aluminum and tungsten Fourth in platinum group metals, sulphur and titanium Fifth in nickel and diamonds 57% of the world's public mining companies are listed on the TSX and TSX-Venture Exchanges. Together, the two exchanges handled 48% of global mining equity transactions in 2013, and accounted for 46% of global mining equity capital for that year. Globally, Canada is recognized for its leadership in safety and sustainability. Mining companies in Canada were the first in the world to develop an externally-verified performance system for sustainable mining practices with the creation of MAC's Towards Sustainable Mining initiative in 2004. Leading Companies Agnico Eagle Mines Limited Agnico Eagle 's mission is to run a high quality, easy to understand business, that generates superior long-term per share returns for our shareholders, creates a great place to work for our employees, and that is a leading contributor to the well-being of the communities in which we operate. Agnico Eagle Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Results - Strong Operational Performance Yields Record Annual Production; Updated Amaruq Mineral Resources and Initial Mineral Resources Declared at El Barqueno and the Sisar Zone at Kittila February 10, 2016 Stock Symbol: AEM (NYSE and TSX) (All amounts expressed in U.S. dollars (\"$\" or \"US$\") unless otherwise noted) TORONTO, Feb. 10, 2016 /PRNewswire/ - Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (NYSE:AEM, TSX:AEM) (\"Agnico Eagle \" or the \"Company\") today reported a quarterly net loss of $15.5 million, or a net loss of $0.07 per share for the fourth quarter of 2015. This result includes a non-cash foreign currency translation loss on deferred tax liabilities of $8.6 million ($0.04 per share), various mark-to-market adjustment losses of $5.0 million ($0.02 per share), unrealized losses on financial instruments of $3.3 million ($0.01 per share), non-cash foreign currency translation losses of $1.3 million ($0.01 per share), non-cash stock option expense of $3.6 million ($0.02 per share) and non-recurring gains of $2.4 million ($0.01). Excluding these items would result in adjusted net income of $3.9 million ($0.02 per share) for the fourth quarter of 2015. In the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company reported a net loss of $21.3 million or a net loss of $0.10 per share. Fourth quarter 2015 cash provided by operating activities was $140.7 million ($112.6 million before changes in non-cash components of working capital), this compares to cash provided by operating activities of $164.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 ($151.6 million before changes in non-cash components of working capital). The decrease in cash flow before changes in working capital during the current period was largely due to a tax adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2015. \"In 2015, our operations continued to perform well, which allowed us to do better on both our production and cost guidance for the fourth consecutive year. Despite a volatile gold price environment, we doubled our exploration spending, continued to advance our pipeline of development projects, and reduced our net debt by approximately $190 million,\" said Sean Boyd , Agnico Eagle's Chief Executive Officer. \"Over the next three years, we are forecasting stable annual production and costs, which should allow us to continue to invest in our existing mines, maintain funding levels at our key exploration projects, advance our development pipeline in Nunavut at a steady and measured pace and maintain our history of continuous dividend payments to shareholders,\" added Mr. Boyd. Fourth quarter and full year 2015 highlights include: Guidance exceeded for fourth consecutive year - Payable production1 in 2015 was 1,671,340 ounces of gold at total cash costs2 per ounce on a by-product basis of $567, compared to guidance of 1,650,000 ounces at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $600. All-in sustaining costs per ounce3 (\"AISC\") on a by-product basis for 2015 were $810, compared to guidance of $850 per ounce Stable production and costs expected through 2018 - Average annual production from 2016 to 2018 is forecast to be approximately 1.53 million ounces of gold. Production for 2016 is forecast to be between 1.525 and 1.565 million ounces of gold with total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of between $590 and $630 per ounce. AISC for 2016 are forecast to be between $850 and $890 per ounce. Costs were calculated using a US$/C$ exchange rate of 1.30, EURO$/US$ exchange rate of 1.10 and a US$/MXP exchange rate of 16.00 Increased gold reserve grades at key mines, significant increase in year-end 2015 gold resources, slight decline in gold reserves after mining depletion - Gold reserve grades increased at the LaRonde, Canadian Malartic, Goldex and La India mines. Measured and indicated mineral resources were up 1%, while inferred mineral resources increased by 23%. Mineral reserves declined by only 5% (0.9 million ounces) to 19.1 million ounces due to mine depletion of approximately 1.8 million ounces Gold resources increased by 67% at Amaruq - Inferred mineral resources at Amaruq now total 3.3 million ounces (16.9 million tonnes grading 6.05 grams per tonne (\"g/t\") gold). The 2016 Phase 1 drill program (approximately 75,000 metres) is now underway with a focus on expanding and upgrading mineral resources and outlining a second open pit deposit Initial inferred gold resources declared at El Barqueno and the Sisar Zone at Kittilla - At El Barqueno, initial inferred mineral resources are estimated to be 0.61 million ounces (19.7 million tonnes grading 0.96 g/t gold), while at Kittila the recently discovered Sisar Zone contains inferred mineral resources of 0.65 million ounces (3.4 million tonnes grading 5.91 g/t gold) Moderate 2016 capital spending preserves production optionality in Nunavut - Expenditures at Amaruq are designed to expand and upgrade the gold resources and outline a second source of open pit ore for the project. Planned spending levels at Meliadine for 2016 are expected to be sufficient to keep critical path elements moving forward. However, decreased spending as compared with previous internal forecasts is expected to delay the potential project start-up by approximately one year to 2020 Improved financial flexibility - In 2015, net debt was reduced by $190 million, further strengthening the Company's investment grade balance sheet A quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share declared New Three-Year Guidance Plan - Stable Production and Cost Profile The Company is announcing its production and cost guidance for 2016 through 2018. The Company expects average annual production of approximately 1.53 million ounces of gold over the next three years with a stable cost profile. Highlights from the new production and cost guidance for 2016 through 2018 include: In 2016, payable production is expected to be between 1.525 million and 1.565 million ounces of gold. Total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis in 2016 are expected to be between $590 and $630 using a US$/C$ exchange rate assumption of 1.30. Previous guidance for 2016 (from the February 2015 forecast) was 1.60 million ounces. The change from previous guidance is primarily due to the expansion of the Vault pit, which increased overall production from Meadowbank but deferred ounces from 2016 to 2017 and 2018, thereby extending the mine life Consolidated AISC for 2016 are expected to be between $850 and $890 per ounce. In 2017 and 2018, the Company's goal is to reduce AISC below this range The estimated production level in 2017 is currently forecast to be approximately 1.55 million ounces of gold (up from 1.50 million ounces in its February 2015 forecast), while production in 2018 is forecast to be approximately 1.50 million ounces of gold. However, the Company is evaluating potential optimizations and opportunities (none of which have yet been approved for construction) at a number of existing operations to further enhance the production profile in 2018 and beyond. These include: LaRonde optimization potential Bousquet Zone 5 Lapa Zone 8 - Upper mine and Zulapa 7 - Deep 2 Zone Goldex optimization potential Increased throughput from Deep Zone 1 Potential for accelerated development of Deep Zone 2 Potential development of the Akasaba West satellite deposit Kittila optimization potential Upper Rimpi Zone development Potential development of the new Sisar Zone Mexican optimization potential Satellite zones at Pinos Altos and Creston Mascota Potential to expand reserves at La India Development Pipeline Expected to Provide Further Production Growth in 2019 and Beyond The Amaruq and Meliadine projects in Nunavut, the El Barqueno project in Mexico, the Odyssey Zone and near pit/underground opportunities at Canadian Malartic (these opportunities are near or below the existing mining infrastructure) and a possible expansion of the LaRonde mine at depth have the potential to further add to the Company's production profile in 2019 and beyond. Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Financial and Production Highlights In the fourth quarter of 2015, strong operational performance continued at the Company's mines. Payable production in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 422,328 ounces of gold compared to 387,535 ounces in the fourth quarter of 2014. A detailed description of the production and cost performance of each mine is set out below. Total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis for the fourth quarter of 2015 were $547 compared to $662 per ounce for the fourth quarter 2014. The decrease in total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis in the fourth quarter of 2015 is mainly due to higher production levels at the LaRonde, Canadian Malartic, Meadowbank, Kittila, Pinos Altos and Creston Mascota mines and favourable foreign exchange rates. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the average value of the Canadian dollar, Euro and Mexican Peso were 10%, 7%, and 17% lower, respectively, than the Company's 2015 currency price assumptions (see February 11, 2015 news release). For the full year 2015, the Company recorded net income of $24.6 million, or $0.11 per share. In 2014, Agnico Eagle recorded net income of $83.0 million, or $0.43 per share. Compared with the prior year, 2015 earnings were affected by lower realized gold and silver prices (down 8% and 14%, respectively, period over period) and increased exploration expenses (up 97%, period over period). In 2015, exploration drilling yielded a significant increase in inferred mineral resources at the Amaruq project in Nunavut, an initial inferred mineral resource at the El Barqueno project in Mexico and a maiden inferred mineral resource at the Sisar Zone at Kittila. The decrease in realized gold and silver prices and increase in exploration expenses were partially offset by higher gold production and favourable foreign exchange rates. For the full year 2015, cash provided by operating activities was $616.2 million ($660.0 million before changes in non-cash components of working capital). This represents a decrease over 2014, when cash provided by operating activities totalled $668.3 million ($624.4 million before changes in non-cash components of working capital). The decrease was primarily due to increased inventory positions. For the fourth consecutive year, Agnico Eagle has reported annual gold production in excess of annual guidance. The Company's payable production for the full year 2015 was 1,671,340 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $567, compared to guidance of 1,650,000 ounces at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $590 to $610. In 2014, full year production was 1,429,288 ounces at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $637. The improvement in gold production in 2015 was a result of strong operating results from all of the mines, particularly Canadian Malartic as a result of the full year inclusion of production, LaRonde as a result of the higher grades from mining in more gold rich areas of the lower areas of the mine (below the 215 level), Goldex due to better productivity, increased throughput at Kittila from the ramp up of the mill expansion, increased stacking capacity at La India, and higher grades from Pinos Altos. The decrease in total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis in 2015 was primarily due to higher gold production for 2015, strong cost control initiatives at all of the mines and the positive effect of foreign exchange rates. For the full year 2015, the average value of the Canadian dollar, Euro and Mexican Peso were 5%, 4%, and 18% lower, respectively than the Company's 2015 currency price assumptions (see February 11, 2015 news release). AISC for 2015 on a by-product basis was $810 per ounce, which is below the previous 2015 guidance between $840 and $860 per ounce. The lower AISC is primarily due to lower than forecast total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis in 2015 and a reduction in sustaining capital expenditures through a strong emphasis on sustaining capital expenditure controls. Quarterly Dividend Declared Agnico Eagle 's Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.08 per common share, payable on March 15, 2016 to shareholders of record as of March 1, 2016. Agnico Eagle has now declared a cash dividend every year since 1983. Liquidity - Existing Cash and Credit Facility Provide Flexibility Cash and cash equivalents and short term investments decreased to $131.6 million at December 31, 2015, from the September 30, 2015 balance of $208.1 million partly as a result of using cash to repay outstanding balances on the Company's credit facility. The outstanding balance on the Company's $1.2 billion credit facility was reduced from $350 million at September 30, 2015 to $265 million at December 31, 2015, resulting in availability under its credit lines of approximately $935 million, not including the $300 million accordion facility. Total capital expenditures made by the Company in the fourth quarter of 2015 were $133.0 million, including $22.2 million at Meliadine, $20.0 million at Pinos Altos, $18.0 million at Meadowbank, $18.0 million at Kittila, $16.7 million at LaRonde, $13.6 million at Canadian Malartic (50% basis), $13.6 million at Goldex, $7.9 million at La India, $2.6 million at Creston Mascota and $1.0 million at Lapa. Total capital expenditures for the full year 2015 were $449.8 million including $67.3 million at LaRonde, $66.7 million at Meliadine, $65.2 million at Meadowbank, $61.8 million at Pinos Altos, $56.4 million at Kittila, $48.8 million at Goldex, $43.4 million at Canadian Malartic (50% basis), $23.4 million at La India, $6.5 million at Lapa and $4.2 million at Creston Mascota. Total sustaining capital expenditures made by the Company in the fourth quarter of 2015 were $90.4 million, including $18.0 million at Meadowbank, $16.7 million at LaRonde, $15.1 million at Kittila, $13.6 million at Canadian Malartic (50% basis), $11.4 million at Pinos Altos, $7.9 million at La India, $4.1 million at Goldex, $2.6 million at Creston Mascota and $1.0 million at Lapa. Total sustaining capital expenditures for the full year 2015 were $305.1 million including $67.3 million at LaRonde, $65.2 million at Meadowbank, $45.7 million at Kittila, $41.6 million at Canadian Malartic (50% basis), $35.5 million at Pinos Altos, $23.4 million at La India, $15.7 million at Goldex, $6.5 million at Lapa, and $4.2 million at Creston Mascota. Three-Year Guidance Plan Outlines a Stable Production and Cost Profile The Company is announcing its production and cost guidance for 2016 through 2018. The Company expects average annual production of approximately 1.53 million ounces over the next three years with a stable cost profile. Various internal projects at current operating mines have the potential to add incremental production in 2018, while Amaruq, Meliadine and El Barqueno are expected to add significant production starting in 2019 to 2020. However, the Company continues to take a prudent and measured approach to development while maintaining financial flexibility. In 2016, payable production is expected to be between 1.525 million and 1.565 million ounces of gold. Total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis in 2016 are expected to be in a range from $590 and $630 using a US$/C$ exchange rate assumption of 1.30. Previous production guidance for 2016 (from the February 2015 forecast), was 1.60 million ounces. The change in production compared to the previous 2016 guidance is primarily due to the decision to proceed with the expansion of the Vault pit at Meadowbank (thereby extending the mine life). With the Vault extension, the production forecast at Meadowbank was reduced in 2016, but increased for 2017 and 2018. Consolidated AISC for 2016 are expected to be between $850 and $890 per ounce using a US$/C$ exchange rate assumption of 1.30. Near-term Mine Optimization Projects Could Potentially Enhance 2018 Production Over the next three years (2016 through 2018) annual production is forecast to average approximately 1.53 million ounces. The estimated production level in 2018 is currently forecast to be approximately 1.50 million ounces. However, the Company is evaluating potential optimizations and opportunities (none of which have yet been approved for construction) at a number of existing operations to further enhance the Company's production profile in 2018 and beyond. LaRonde Optimization In 2003, the Company acquired the Bousquet gold property from Barrick Gold . The property adjoins the LaRonde mining complex to the east and hosts the Bousquet Zone 5, which previous operators had partly exploited by open pit. The Company is evaluating the potential to initially mine the Bousquet Zone 5 from a depth of 90 to 330 metres below surface via an underground ramp. This portion of the deposit contains indicated mineral resources of approximately 566,000 ounces of gold (9.3 million tonnes grading 1.90 g/t gold) and inferred gold mineral resources of approximately 109,000 ounces of gold (1.47 million tonnes grading 2.31 g/t gold). The mining method is likely to be similar to that employed at Goldex, and processing could utilize excess capacity from the Lapa circuit at LaRonde. Dewatering of the old pit is underway and permit applications to collect a bulk sample will be submitted shortly. An internal technical study is expected to be completed by the end of 2016. At the Lapa mine two areas (Zone 8 East - Upper mine and the Zulapa 7- Deep 2 Zone) have been identified through exploration (see Lapa mine discussion) as areas that could potentially support future mining activity. Further exploration and internal studies are underway to look at synergies with other production opportunities such as the Bousquet Zone 5. In addition, Canadian Malartic Corporation (\"CMC\", owned 50% by Agnico Eagle and 50% by Yamana Gold Inc . \"Yamana\") is continuing to explore the Pandora project, which adjoins the Lapa mine to the west (for additional details see the Canadian Malartic section of this news release). Should the exploration efforts be successful, Pandora could potentially have synergies with the other opportunities currently being evaluated at the Lapa mine. Goldex Optimization At present, the Goldex mill has about 25% excess capacity (rated capacity is 8,000 tpd, but forecast to process approximately 6,400 tpd in 2016). As such, the Company is evaluating opportunities to potentially increase throughput from the Deep 1 Zone, and the potential to mine a portion of the Deep 2 Zone. These opportunities, and the potential development of the Akasaba West deposit (see below), could enhance production levels or extend the current mine life and reduce operating costs. In January 2014, Agnico Eagle acquired the Akasaba West gold-copper deposit from Alexandria Minerals. Located less than 30 km from Goldex, the Akasaba West deposit could create flexibility and synergies for the Company's operations in the Abitibi region by utilizing extra milling capacity at both Goldex and LaRonde, while reducing overall costs. Akasaba West currently hosts a probable mineral reserve of 141,000 ounces of gold and 24,557 tonnes of copper (4.76 million tonnes grading 0.92 g/t gold and 0.52% copper). Permitting and technical studies are ongoing with the goal of moving the project towards a production decision in late 2016 or early 2017. Kittila Optimization Previous drilling on the Rimpi Zone at Kittila has outlined a significant zone of mineralization with potentially wider widths and better grades than those currently being mined. The main underground ramp at Kittila is being extended to reach the Rimpi Zone, and it is also providing further underground drill access to test for additional depth extensions of the Rimpi, Suuri, Roura and the newly discovered Sisar mineralized zones. In addition, a surface ramp is being driven into the Rimpi Zone (now at a depth of 190 metres below surface) for production purposes and to provide a second egress for the Suuri ramp system. It will serve as the main haulage route from the deeper portions of both Rimpi and Suuri and potentially the Sisar Zone. In 2015, a new sub-parallel zone of mineralization (Sisar Zone) was recognized by exploration drilling from the underground ramp being driven towards the deeper portion of the Rimpi Zone. Additional drilling through year-end 2015 continued to yield favourable results (see Kittila mine discussion in this news release) at Sisar, and an initial inferred mineral resource of approximately 651,000 ounces of gold (3.4 million tonnes grading 5.91 g/t gold) has been announced (see \"Detailed Mineral Reserve and Mineral Resource Data (as at December 31, 2015)\" below). In 2016, additional drilling is planned to infill and further expands the Sisar mineralization. Given that the Sisar Zone is located approximately 200 metres directly east of the exploration ramp (at a depth of approximately 800 metres below surface), Sisar could potentially provide an additional source of underground ore to the Kittila mill with relatively little additional underground development. With the potential for higher mill capacity (approximately 20%) through ongoing optimization, development of the Rimpi and Sisar zones could result in increased future production levels and reduced operating costs at Kittila. Mexican Opportunities At Pinos Altos and Creston Mascota, the Company continues to evaluate the sequencing of additional satellite zones, which could provide additional ore to the Pinos Altos complex. This drill data is being incorporated into preliminary studies along with metallurgical testing and geotechnical data in order to better optimize the development potential of remaining satellite resources including Sinter and Bravo. During 2015, higher grade mineralization was encountered at the bottom of the Creston Mascota pit. Work is underway to understand the potential impact of this mineralization on the pit design and production planning. At La India, additional drilling was carried out in 2015 with a focus on extending mineralization in the Main Zone and the La India Zone, and conversion of sulfide mineralization into mineral reserves and mineral resources. In addition, drilling was also carried out on a portion of the El Realito property. The 2015 exploration program and new ore model resulted in a 28% increase in mineral reserves, and a 21% increase in measured and indicated mineral resources (see \"Detailed Mineral Reserve and Mineral Resource Data (as at December 31, 2015)\" below). The Company is looking at near pit potential for further mineral reserve expansion and will consider opportunities to increase production at La India based on the success of that program. Development/Expansion Projects in the Abitibi, Nunavut and Mexico Expected to Provide Longer-term Growth Opportunities beyond 2019 The expansion and development projects set out below, which have not yet been approved for construction, have the potential to add to the Company's production profile in 2019 and beyond. Amaruq - Expanding the Mineral Resource Base and Locating a Second Open Pit Deposit is the Key Focus in 2016 The 100% owned Amaruq property consists of 114,760 hectares of Inuit and federal crown land. Agnico Eagle acquired its initial interest in April 2013 pursuant to a mineral exploration agreement with Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated. In 2015, a $37.7 million exploration program (378 drill holes totalling approximately 108,000 metres) was carried out at the Amaruq project, which is located approximately 50 kilometres northwest of the Meadowbank mine in Nunavut. A large portion of last year's drill program was focused on the Whale Tail Zone, where drilling has outlined up to five mineralized lenses along a strike length of 2.3 kilometres and to a depth of up to 600 metres below surface. Mineralization at Whale Tail remains open in all directions. Significant mineralization has also been outlined in the IVR area. As a result of the 2015 exploration program, the inferred mineral resource at Amaruq increased by approximately 67% compared to the inferred mineral resource of 2.0 million ounces of gold (see the Company's August 19, 2015 news release for comparison) to 3.3 million ounces of gold (16.9 million tonnes grading 6.05 g/t gold) at December 31, 2015 (for additional details see the mineral reserve and mineral resource discussion in this news release). The first phase of a planned 75,000 metre drill program (costing approximately $19 million) began with two drills in early February 2016. The goals of this program are to infill and expand the known mineral resource areas and test other favourable targets (for additional details see the exploration section below). A mineral resource update is expected in the second half of 2016. In late 2015, the Company received approvals for the construction of an all-weather access road linking the Amaruq access site to the Meadowbank mine. In 2016 the Company expects to carry out additional engineering and begin road preparation from the Vault pit at Meadowbank. The Company expects to ultimately develop Amaruq as a satellite operation to Meadowbank, with the potential to begin production in 2019. Given that the initial mineral resource grade at Amaruq is well in excess of the mineral reserve grade at Meadowbank, the Company believes that there is good potential for Amaruq to have similar annual output to Meadowbank in its peak production years. Permitting activities and engineering studies for the construction of an initial open pit mine and an underground exploration ramp at Amaruq are ongoing. Meliadine - Moderate 2016 Capital Expenditures Preserves Production Optionality Located near Rankin Inlet, Nunavut, Canada, the Meliadine project was acquired in July 2010, and is one of Agnico Eagle 's largest gold projects in terms of mineral resources. The Company owns 100% of the 111,757 hectare property. The updated technical study for Meliadine released last year (see March 12, 2015 news release) forecast average annual production of approximately 350,000 ounces at a life-of-mine total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of approximately $531 over a nine-year mine life. The study used a gold price of C$1,495 per ounce (as compared to a current spot price of approximately C$1,657 per ounce on February 8, 2016). The technical study was based on extracting only the 3.3 million ounces of gold in proven and probable mineral reserves at December 31, 2014 (13.9 million tonnes of ore grading 7.44 g/t gold), which is all contained in the Tiriganiaq and Wesmeg deposits. At December 31, 2015, the Meliadine property hosted 3.4 million ounces of proven and probable mineral reserves (14.5 million tonnes of ore grading 7.32 g/t gold), 3.31 million ounces of measured and indicated mineral resources (20.8 million tonnes of ore grading 4.95 g/t gold), and 3.55 million ounces of inferred mineral resources (14.7 million tonnes of ore grading 7.51 g/t gold). In addition, there are numerous other known gold occurrences in the 80-kilometre-long greenstone belt that require further evaluation. The capital budget for 2016 is $96 million with activities focused on further underground development (approximately 3,000 metres), detailed engineering and procurement, construction of essential surface infrastructure and acquisition of a used camp facility. The goal of the 2016 capital program is to ensure that the project remains on track for a potential 2020 production start-up, which is approximately a one year delay from previous expectations. Internal studies are ongoing to evaluate the potential to extract additional ounces of gold from the Tiriganiaq and Wesmeg/Normeg deposits that could potentially extend the mine life, increase annual production and improve the project economics and the after-tax internal rate of return. These studies are expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2016. On October 5, 2015, the Nunavut Water Board issued the permit (License B) for Meliadine pre-development work. License A, which is required for production activities, is expected to be granted in the second quarter of 2016. The timing of future capital expenditures on the Meliadine project beyond 2016 and the determination of whether to build a mine at Meliadine are subject to approval by Agnico Eagle 's Board of Directors which will be based on prevailing market conditions and outcomes of the various potential scenarios being evaluated. El Barqueno - Initial Mineral Resource Announced, Significant Drilling Planned in 2016 The El Barqueno property in Jalisco State, Mexico covers a land position with known strike extent for mineralization larger than both the La India and Pinos Altos properties combined. Previous property owners outlined several mineralized zones through surface exploration and diamond drilling. In 2015, the Company completed approximately 69,500 metres of drilling at a cost of $17 million on the El Barqueno property. The primary focus of the 2015 program was to define the limits of the Azteca-Zapoteca, Angostura and Pena de Oro prospects, and delineate an initial mineral resource estimate for these deposits. Several other prospects were also under evaluation. Based on the 2015 exploration results and previous work programs, the Company has estimated initial total inferred in-pit mineral resources of approximately 0.61 million ounces (19.7 million tonnes grading 0.96 g/t gold) from the Azteca-Zapoteca, Angostura and Pena de Oro areas to open-pit mineable depths. An additional 11,000 metres of drilling has been completed since the estimation of the inferred mineral resource. Further details on the El Barqueno inferred mineral resource can be found in \"Detailed Mineral Reserve and Mineral Resource Data (as at December 31, 2015)\" below. In 2016, Agnico Eagle plans to carry out a $13 million exploration program to further expand and infill the known mineral resource areas and evaluate other prospective targets such as: Olmeca, Zapote, Mixteca, El Rayo, and Pilarica. At present there are 14 drills operating on the project. While it is too early to estimate the full extent of the mineral resources and the number of deposits with economic potential at El Barqueno, the Company has the experience of developing cost-efficient mining operations in Mexico and increasing their size through successful exploration as well as metallurgical innovation. This body of knowledge will be applied as El Barqueno continues to be explored and studied. Agnico Eagle believes that El Barqueno ultimately has the potential to be developed into a series of open pits utilizing heap leach processing, similar to the Creston Mascota and La India mines. Conceptual design studies and additional metallurgical testing are underway at El Barqueno with a goal of potentially starting operations in 2019. Canadian Malartic - Odyssey Zone and Near Pit Opportunities Could Provide Future Production Upside At the Canadian Malartic mine (owned 50% by Agnico Eagle and 50% by Yamana), exploration programs are planned to evaluate a number of near pit/underground targets at the mine and further define the extent of the mineralization at the Odyssey Zone (which is located to the east of the Canadian Malartic open pit). Both of these opportunities could provide new potential sources of ore for the Canadian Malartic mill. In 2016, the Canadian Malartic block model will be reviewed to further define the potential of a number of near pit/underground targets and a 60,000 metre drill program has been proposed to further evaluate the extent of the mineralization at Odyssey. For additional details on these opportunities, see the Canadian Malartic section of this news release. LaRonde - Studies Ongoing to Evaluate Potential to Mine Below a Depth of 3.1 Kilometres Studies are continuing to assess the potential to extend the mineral reserves and carry out mining activities between the 311 and 371 levels at LaRonde. At present, the mineral reserves extend to the 311 level, which is 3.1 kilometres below the surface. Drilling is ongoing to further expand the known mineral resource between the 311 and 341 levels. Additional holes are also being drilled to evaluate the extent of the mineralization down to the 371 level (a depth of 3.7 kilometres below the surface). In 2016, the focus of drilling will be on mineral resource expansion and mineral resource to mineral reserve conversion in the western portion of the LaRonde orebody. 2016 Exploration Program and Budget - Main Focus on Amaruq, El Barqueno and the Sisar Zone at Kittila A large component of the 2016 exploration program will be focused on the Amaruq project near the Meadowbank mine in Nunavut, the El Barqueno project in Jalisco State, Mexico and the Sisar Zone at the Kittila mine in Finland. These exploration programs are designed to infill and expand known deposits and test other favourable target areas. The goal is to delineate mineral reserves and mineral resources that can supplement the Company's existing production profile. The 2016 Amaruq drill program commenced earlier this month with two drills testing targets in the Mammoth Lake area. Eventually the Company expects to have eight to ten drills operating with a focus on infilling and expanding the known mineralized zones, testing other nearby targets with a focus on developing a second source of open pit ore and further evaluation of regional target areas. The initial 2016 exploration program contemplates approximately 75,000 metres of drilling with a budget of approximately $19 million. The 2016 program also includes engineering studies and permitting activities for the construction of an initial open pit mine and an underground exploration ramp. Exploration expenditures at El Barqueno in 2016 are budgeted at $13 million for mineral resource development, conversion and regional exploration. There are currently 14 drills on the property working to define the limits of the known prospects and test new target areas such as: Olmeca, Zapote, Mixteca, El Rayo, and Pilarica. El Barqueno's gold-silver deposits could potentially be developed into a series of open pits utilizing heap leach processing, similar to Creston Mascota and the La India mines. In 2016, approximately $5 million will be spent on further deep drilling at Kittila (which includes the Sisar Zone). The goal of this program is to expand and upgrade the mineral resources and evaluate the potential to possibly develop the Sisar Zone as a new mining horizon at Kittila. Depreciation Guidance Agnico Eagle expects its 2016 depreciation and amortization expense to be in the range of $630 to $660 million. General & Administrative Cost Guidance Agnico Eagle expects 2016 general and administration expense to be between $70 and $80 million, excluding share based compensation. In 2016, share based compensation is expected to be between $20 and $25 million including stock option expense (which is a non-cash item) of between $18 and $22 million, which is consistent with previous years. Please see the supplemental financial data section of the Financial and Operating Database on the Company's website for additional historical financial data. Tax Guidance for 2016 For 2016, the jurisdictional tax rates are expected to be: Canada - 40% to 50% Mexico - 35% to 40% Finland - 20% The Company's overall tax rate is expected to be between 40% and 45%. Gold Reserves Decrease Slightly to Approximately 19.1M Ounces, Reserve Grade Increased at Key Operations To estimate the 2015 year-end mineral reserves, the Company continued to use conservative assumptions: $1,100/ounce gold and $16/ounce silver, US$/C$, EUR/US$ and US$/MPX exchange rates of 1.16, 1.20 and 14.00, respectively for all mines and projects, other than Lapa, Meadowbank, Creston Mascota and the Santo Nino pit at Pinos Altos. Due to the shorter mine life of these mining operations, the Company used exchange rate assumptions for US$/C$ and US$/MXP of 1.30 and 16.00, respectively (other assumptions unchanged). At year-end 2015, the Company's proven and probable mineral reserves (net of 2015 production) totaled 251 million tonnes of ore grading 2.37 g/t gold, containing approximately 19.1 million ounces of gold. This is a decrease of approximately 0.9 million ounces of gold (5%) compared with a year earlier. The decrease in the Company's mineral reserves is largely due to the 1,671,340 ounces of payable gold production in 2015 (1,910,000 ounces of in-situ gold mined), partially offset by successful conversion of measured and indicated mineral resources to mineral reserves at several operations. Highlights from the December 31, 2015 Mineral Reserve Statement include: Increased mineral reserve grades at LaRonde (5.31 g/t gold versus 5.20 g/t gold), Canadian Malartic (1.08 g/t gold versus 1.06 g/t gold), Goldex (1.61 g/t gold versus 1.49 g/t gold), and La India (0.90 g/t gold versus 0.85 g/t gold) At Goldex, the mineral reserves almost doubled to 668,000 ounces of gold with an 8% increase in the mineral reserve grade At the Akasaba project, initial mineral reserves of 141,000 ounces of gold are reported (4.8 million tonnes grading 0.92 g/t gold and 0.52% copper) At La India, the mineral reserves increased by 28% (188,000 ounces) to 867,000 ounces of gold (30.0 million tonnes of ore grading 0.90 g/t gold and 4.23 g/t silver) Comparison of assumptions used to estimate mineral reserves and the gold price in local currencies in 2013, 2014 and 2015 The Company's overall mineral reserve gold grade has decreased slightly to 2.37 g/t from 2.40 g/t. This is the result of a reduction in the cut-off grades at each operation because of a slight increase of the assumed gold price when converted to local currencies (shown in the table above). Agnico Eagle has one of the highest mineral reserve grades among its North American peers. In the Northern Business, gold contained in mineral reserves decreased by 726,000 ounces (4%) in 2015; during the year this business segment produced 1,319,301 ounces of gold (1,451,000 ounces of in-situ gold mined). The largest mineral reserve increase in the Northern Business was at the Goldex mine, where the amount contained in mineral reserves increased by 328,000 ounces of gold (96%), year-over-year, to 668,000 ounces of gold, with an 8% increase in the mineral reserve grade to 1.61 g/t gold from 1.49 g/t gold. The increase is largely due to the successful conversion of mineral resources to mineral reserves, mainly in the D Zone as well as in the M and E zones. These are the initial D Zone probable mineral reserves (354,000 ounces of gold in 6.3 million tonnes of ore grading 1.75 g/t gold), related to the approval of mining the Deep 1 project announced in the Company's news release dated July 29, 2015. This increase was offset by the 2015 production of 115,426 ounces of gold (123,000 ounces of in-situ gold mined). At the nearby Akasaba project, initial probable mineral reserves reported are 141,000 ounces of gold (4.8 million tonnes grading 0.92 g/t gold and 0.52% copper), the result of conversion of indicated mineral resources to mineral reserves. Canadian Malartic had the largest decline in mineral reserves; its mineral reserves decreased by 466,000 ounces of gold, mainly due to 2015 gold production of 285,809 ounces (322,000 ounces of in-situ gold mined). The remainder of the decline was due to a slight reduction in the pit shells related to the incorporation of the 5% net smelter return royalty payable to Osisko Gold Royalties Ltd . and the termination of the Gouldie open pit. All numbers shown for Canadian Malartic reflect Agnico Eagle 's 50% ownership in the mine. The decrease in the Meadowbank mine's mineral reserves by mine depletion was partially offset by the conversion of mineral resources to mineral reserves for the Vault pit extension, announced in the Company's news release dated July 29, 2015. At Kittila, the mining depletion was partially offset by successful conversion of mineral resources to mineral reserves. In the Southern Business, the gold contained in mineral reserves decreased by approximately 175,000 ounces (7%) in 2015. This business segment had production of 352,039 ounces of gold (459,000 ounces of in-situ gold mined) in 2015. There was a large increase at the La India mine where the gold mineral reserves increased by 28% (188,000 ounces) to 867,000 ounces of gold (30.0 million tonnes of ore grading 0.90 g/t gold and 4.23 g/t silver) compared with a year ago. The mine depletion was more than offset by the addition of new oxide reserves and by conversion of sulphide mineral resources to mineral reserves in the Main pit, the result of successful metallurgical investigations in 2015 and field-proven experience with the North Zone sulphide material. The 304,000-ounce decline in mineral reserves at Pinos Altos was due to 2015 production of 192,974 ounces of gold (205,000 ounces of in-situ gold mined) as well as a change to the Cerro Colorado block model based on information gained from geological mapping and mining development. It is the Company's goal to maintain its global mineral reserves at approximately 10 to 15 times its annual gold production rate. The current mineral reserves are within this range when compared to the Company's projected annual 2016 production rate. In addition to gold, Agnico Eagle 's proven and probable mineral reserves include by-product metals of approximately 55 million ounces of silver at the Pinos Altos, LaRonde, La India and Creston Mascota mines (68.2 million tonnes of ore grading an average of 25.0 g/t silver), plus 147,927 tonnes of zinc and 43,357 tonnes of copper at the LaRonde mine (18.2 million tonnes of ore grading 0.81% zinc and 0.24% copper) and 24,557 tonnes of copper at the Akasaba project (4.8 million tonnes grading 0.52% copper). At a gold price of $1,200 per ounce (leaving all other assumptions unchanged), there would be an approximate 5.4% increase in the gold contained in proven and probable mineral reserves. Conversely, using a gold price of $1,000 (leaving all other assumptions unchanged), there would be an estimated 5.4% decrease in the gold contained in proven and probable mineral reserves. Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources Grow by Approximately 1%, While Inferred Mineral Resources Increase by Approximately 23% Highlights from the December 31, 2015 Mineral Resource Statement include: Measured and indicated mineral resources now total approximately 309 million tonnes of ore grading 1.52 g/t gold, or approximately 15.1 million ounces of gold. This represents an increase of approximately 1% over the 2014 estimate Inferred mineral resources total approximately 230 million tonnes of ore grading 2.24 g/t gold, or approximately 16.5 million ounces of gold. This represents an increase of approximately 23% over the 2014 estimate At Amaruq, inferred mineral resources increased by approximately 67% to 3.3 million ounces of gold (16.9 million tonnes grading 6.05 g/t gold) There was a 43% increase (approximately 533,000 ounces of gold) in inferred mineral resources at Kittila, which includes initial mineral resources in the Sisar Zone discovered in 2015 An initial inferred mineral resource of 608,000 ounces of gold and 3.7 million ounces of silver (19.7 million tonnes grading 0.96 g/t gold and 5.78 g/t silver) was estimated at the El Barqueno project in Mexico At Canadian Malartic, the approach of tripling the cut-off grade of the out-pit mineral resources had the effect of removing 343,000 ounces from the measured and indicated mineral resources, leaving 625,000 ounces (12.8 million tonnes of ore grading 1.51 g/t gold) in measured and indicated mineral resources. The same approach resulted in removing 344,000 ounces from the inferred mineral resource base, leaving 213,000 ounces (4.5 million tonnes of ore grading 1.47 g/t gold) of inferred mineral resources. The cut-off grade used for the calculation of mineral resources at Canadian Malartic is now similar to that used at Goldex The Company's measured and indicated mineral resources now total approximately 309 million tonnes of ore grading 1.52 g/t gold, or 15.1 million ounces of gold. This represents approximately a 1% increase in ounces and a slight increase in grade over the December 2014 measured and indicated mineral resource (see the April 30, 2015 news release for comparison). Two of the Kirkland Lake properties of CMC (50% owned by Agnico Eagle ) reported increased indicated mineral resources: the Upper Beaver project increased by 179,000 ounces of gold to 901,000 ounces (4.4 million tonnes grading 6.36 g/t gold), while the Amalgamated Kirkland (\"AK\") project reported initial indicated mineral resources of 133,000 ounces of gold (0.63 million tonnes grading 6.51 g/t gold) (these amounts represent Agnico Eagle 's 50% interest). Measured and indicated mineral resources at Kittila increased by 198,000 ounces of gold. La India's measured and indicated mineral resources increased by 143,000 ounces of gold. These increases were offset by the successful conversion drilling from inferred mineral resources at several of the operations, particularly Akasaba and Meadowbank. At Canadian Malartic, the gold in all mineral resource categories declined as the result of adjusting the approach to the out-pit material (adjacent to or below the pit outline) throughout the property. The approach of tripling the cut-off grade of the out-pit mineral resources had the effect of removing 343,000 ounces from the measured and indicated mineral resources, leaving 625,000 ounces (12.8 million tonnes of ore grading 1.51 g/t gold) in measured and indicated mineral resources. The same approach resulted in removing 344,000 ounces from the inferred mineral resource base, leaving 213,000 ounces (4.5 million tonnes of ore grading 1.47 g/t gold) of inferred mineral resources. The cut-off grade used for the calculation of mineral resources at Canadian Malartic is now similar to that used at Goldex. All data shown for Canadian Malartic represent Agnico Eagle 's 50% ownership. The Company's inferred mineral resources now total 230 million tonnes of ore grading 2.24 g/t, or approximately 16.5 million ounces of gold. This represents an increase of 23% or approximately 3.1 million ounces of gold in inferred mineral resources (see the Company's April 30, 2015 news release for comparison). The largest part of this increase is the significant updated inferred mineral resource of 16.9 million tonnes grading 6.05 g/t gold (approximately 3.3 million ounces of gold) at the higher-grade Amaruq discovery, which is 50 kilometres from the Meadowbank mine in Nunavut. This is an increase of 1.8 million ounces of gold compared with a year ago. Approximately 56% of the Amaruq mineral resources are near-surface. A portion of the 2015 exploration program at Amaruq involved drill testing portions of the Whale Tail deposit from the north to the south to gain a better understanding of the geological controls on the mineralization. This drilling led to the modelling of thicker, but slightly lower grade zones of mineralization, which resulted in a modest decline in the grade of the inferred mineral resources reachable by open pit. As at December 31, 2015, an initial inferred mineral resource of 608,000 ounces of gold and 3.7 million ounces of silver (19.7 million tonnes grading 0.96 g/t gold and 5.78 g/t silver) was estimated at the El Barqueno project in Mexico. This maiden mineral resource consists of inferred mineral resources from the Azteca-Zapoteca, Angostura and Pena de Oro zones based on preliminary open pit designs. Exploration drilling at depth was responsible for a 43% increase (approximately 533,000 ounces of gold) in inferred mineral resources at Kittila, which includes initial mineral resources in the Sisar Zone, which was discovered in 2015. More details about Sisar can be found in the Kittila operations section of this news release. The Upper Beaver and AK properties in the Kirkland Lake area (50% owned by Agnico Eagle ) also reported increased inferred mineral resources, the result of new drilling programs on these projects. The Upper Beaver project increased inferred mineral resources by 136,000 ounces of gold to 659,000 ounces (3.45 million tonnes grading 5.94 g/t gold), while the AK project reported initial inferred mineral resources of 203,000 ounces of gold (1.19 million tonnes grading 5.32 g/t gold) (in each case, representing Agnico Eagle 's 50% interest). Successful conversion drilling at depth at the Goldex mine resulted in approximately 329,000 ounces of gold from the inferred mineral resource category to mineral reserves. NORTHERN BUSINESS REVIEW ABITIBI REGION, QUEBEC Agnico Eagle is currently Quebec's largest gold producer with a 100% interest in three mines (LaRonde, Goldex and Lapa) and a 50% interest in the Canadian Malartic mine. These mines are located within 50 kilometres of each other, which provides operating synergies and allows for the sharing of technical expertise. LaRonde Mine - Increased Tonnage From Lower Mine Drives Record Quarterly Production The 100% owned LaRonde mine in northwestern Quebec achieved commercial production in 1988. The LaRonde mill processed an average of 6,128 tpd in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared with an average of 5,847 tpd in the corresponding period of 2014. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$94 in the fourth quarter of 2015, lower than the C$97 per tonne experienced in the fourth quarter of 2014. Throughput in the 2014 period was lower and costs were higher due to the ten days of unscheduled shutdown related to a production hoist drive failure at shaft #4 (the internal winze) in December 2014. Milling performance for the full year 2015 was approximately 6,141 tpd, compared to 5,713 tpd in 2014. Throughput in the 2014 period was lower due primarily to the planned shutdowns for the installation of new hoist drives to replace obsolete production and service hoist equipment in the Penna shaft. Minesite costs per tonne for the full year 2015 were approximately C$99, unchanged from C$99 per tonne in 2014. LaRonde's total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis were $510 in the fourth quarter of 2015 on payable production of 73,161 ounces of gold. This compares with the fourth quarter of 2014 when total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis were $590 on production of 59,316 ounces of gold. The decrease in total cash costs per ounce in the 2015 period was largely due to higher production (due to higher gold grades from the lower mine area and the improved recoveries from the CIP circuit) and favourable foreign exchange rates. For the full year 2015, LaRonde's total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis were $590 on gold production of 267,921 ounces. This compares to total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $668 on gold production of 204,652 ounces in 2014. The higher production and lower costs in the 2015 period are primarily due to the reasons outlined above. In 2015, the LaRonde mine also produced approximately 3,501 tonnes of zinc (67% less than in 2014), 0.9 million ounces of silver (28% less than in 2014), and 4,941 tonnes of copper (1% less than in 2014) as by-products to the gold production. These totals are consistent with the change in the metals mix as the mine goes deeper and becomes more gold rich as opposed to zinc/silver rich in the upper levels. In 2016, approximately 89% of production is expected to come from the lower mine area (below the 248 level). In 2015, work was completed on the installation of the coarse ore conveyor system that extends from the 293 level to the crusher on the 280 level. The new conveyor was commissioned in the fourth quarter and a new ore pass and silo designed to feed the conveyor system are expected to be commissioned in the second quarter of 2016. This new conveyor should help improve mining flexibility and reduce congestion in the deeper portions of the mine. Studies are ongoing to assess the potential to extend the mineral reserve base and carry out mining activities between the 311 and 371 levels at LaRonde. At present, the mineral reserve base extends to the 311 level, which is 3.1 kilometres below the surface. In 2015, exploration drilling focused on the eastern portion of the LaRonde orebody down to the 371 level. As underground development progresses to the west, a key exploration focus in 2016 will be drill testing the western portion of the LaRonde orebody from the 311 to the 371 level. The Company is also evaluating the potential to develop and mine the Bousquet Zone 5 on the adjoining Bousquet property. Previous property owners had partly exploited the Bousquet Zone 5 by open pit and underground, and Agnico Eagle is evaluating the potential to initially mine the Bousquet Zone 5 from a depth of 90 to 330 metres below surface via an underground ramp. The mining method is likely to be similar to that employed at Goldex, and processing could utilize excess capacity from the Lapa circuit at LaRonde. Dewatering of the old pit is underway and permit applications to collect a bulk sample will be submitted shortly. An internal technical study is expected to be completed by the end of 2016. Canadian Malartic Mine - Annual Records Set for Ounces Produced and Tonnes Milled In June 2014, Agnico Eagle and Yamana acquired all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Osisko Mining Corporation (\"Osisko\") and created the Partnership. The Partnership owns and operates the Canadian Malartic mine in northwestern Quebec through a joint management committee. Each of Agnico Eagle and Yamana has an indirect 50% ownership interest in the Partnership. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Canadian Malartic mill processed an average of 52,780 tpd (on a 100% basis) compared with an average of 53,232 tpd in the corresponding period of 2014. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$25 (C$21.76 excluding royalties) compared to the C$21 (C$19.32 excluding royalties) per tonne experienced in the fourth quarter of 2014. In the 2015 period, throughput was lower and costs were higher primarily due to a longer than planned mill shutdown in December 2015. During this shutdown additional costs were incurred to repair the eccentric at the crusher and for the alignment of the ring gear at the #2 ball mill. The average stripping ratio in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 1.86 to 1.0. For the full year 2015, the Canadian Malartic mill processed an average of 52,300 tpd compared with an average of 51,248 tpd in 2014 (on a 100% basis). Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$23 (C$20.24 excluding royalties) compared to the C$22 (C$19.76 excluding royalties) per tonne experienced in 2014. The 2014 tonnage and costs are not considered to be representative as they only reflect the period from the acqusition date of June 16 through December 31. For the fourth quarter of 2015, Agnico Eagle 's share of production at the Canadian Malartic mine was 72,872 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $606. This compares with the fourth quarter of 2014 when total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis were $684 on production of 66,369 ounces of gold. Production was higher in the 2015 period primarily due to higher grades. Costs in the 2015 period were lower due to lower costs for fuel and explosives, increased production and favourable foreign exchange rates, partially offset by higher shutdown costs for the planned mill maintenance. For the full year 2015, Agnico Eagle 's share of production at the Canadian Malartic mine was 285,809 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $596. This is in contrast with production from June 16 to December 31, 2014, which only included 143,008 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $701 from Canadian Malartic. Future Opportunities - Continuing to Look to Further Optimize Operations Since acquiring the mine in June 2014, the Partnership has been looking at a variety of ways to optimize the operations. In parallel with the Barnat permitting (see below), the Partnership is currently working on the permitting necessary for improving the efficiency and environmental performance of the existing mobile crusher. At this point, milling levels are expected to be approximately 53,000 tpd through year-end 2016. Several other opportunities have been identified to further optimize productivity, including: Improvements to SAG mill liners in order to reduce the number of major shutdowns to three from four Higher North Zone performance with the purchase of an additional remote control production back hoe. This should result in higher grade ore being brought to the mill Cost savings opportunities: primarily on explosives and contractors Ongoing continuous improvement projects Ounce reconciliation with the block model continues to be positive (approximately 5% higher) and is an opportunity to provide additional production flexibility going forward. Permitting activities for the Barnat extension and deviation of Highway 117 are continuing on schedule. An Environmental Impact Assessment (\"EIA\") for this project was submitted in February 2015. A second series of questions from the Quebec government was received by the Partnership in December 2015, and final responses were submitted in January 2016. Public hearings are expected to be held later in 2016. Granting of final permits is expected to occur after the completion of the public consultation process. In parallel, the Partnership is currently working on permitting for improving the efficiency and environmental performance of the existing mobile crusher. Odyssey and Near Pit Targets Could Provide Future Production Upside At the Canadian Malartic mine, exploration programs are planned to evaluate a number of near pit/underground targets at the mine and further define the extent of the mineralization at the Odyssey zone (which is located to the east of the Canadian Malartic open pit). Both of these opportunities could provide new potential sources of ore for the Canadian Malartic mill. At Odyssey, 44 holes (a total of 35,870 metres) were drilled in 2015. Exploration to date has outlined two mineralized zones: Odyssey North and Odyssey South. Odyssey North has been traced from a depth of 550 to 1,200 metres below the surface and along approximately 1,500 metres of strike length. Odyssey South is approximately 200 to 550 metres below surface with an approximate strike length of 1,500 metres. Gold occurs along the margins of a porphyry body in both zones. Plan and three dimensional views of the Odyssey mineralization are shown below. [Plan View Showing Odyssey Zones and Near Pit/Underground opportunities at Canadian Malartic] In 2016, the Canadian Malartic block model will be reviewed to further define the potential of the near pit targets and a 60,000 metre drill program has been proposed to further evaluate the extent of the mineralization at Odyssey. CMC Exploration Activities - Pandora and Kirkland Lake are focus areas In addition to joint, indirect ownership of the Canadian Malartic mine, Agnico Eagle and Yamana are also jointly exploring a portfolio of properties in the Kirkland Lake area and the Pandora and Wood-Pandora properties in the Abitibi region of Quebec. Agnico Eagle and Yamana, indirectly through Canadian Malartic Corporation (CMC) each hold a 50% interest in the Kirkland Lake and Pandora properties, while the Wood-Pandora property is a joint venture between Globex Mining Enterprises Inc . (50%) and CMC. In 2015, approximately 960 metres of underground drifting was carried out on the Pandora project from a track drift developed from the Lapa mine. In addition, 34 surface holes (a total of 19,200 metres) and 13 underground holes (a total of approximately 7,900 metres) were drilled to test the C Zone and Branch Zone targets. Results have been encouraging, and additional underground development and 10,400 metres of drilling is planned in 2016. The proposed budget for Pandora in 2016 (100% basis) is approximately C$4.1 million. In Kirkland Lake, a total of approximately C$7.4 million (100%) was spent in 2015. This work included 58 drill holes (a total of 15,140 metres) on the AK, Upper Canada, Skead-MacGregor and Northland properties. In addition, an Airborne Gravity survey was completed. This new drilling has been incorporated into a new mineral resource estimate for the AK property which is included in Agnico Eagle 's December 31, 2015 mineral reserve and mineral resource update (see \"Detailed Mineral Reserve and Mineral Resource Data (as at December 31, 2015)\" below). The proposed budget for Kirkland Lake in 2016 (100% basis) is approximately C$5.2 million. This program will include 3,000 metres of drilling and further data compilation. Lapa - Strong 2015 Performance, Limited Mine Life in 2016 but Exploration Could Provide Additional Upside The 100% owned Lapa mine in northwestern Quebec achieved commercial production in May 2009. The Lapa circuit, located at the LaRonde mill, processed an average of 1,478 tpd in the fourth quarter of 2015. This compares with an average of 1,760 tpd in the fourth quarter of 2014. The reduced throughput in the 2015 period was largely due to lower mill availability resulting from electrical and mechanical issues with the Lapa ball mill. Minesite costs per tonne were C$111 in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to the C$109 realized in the fourth quarter of 2014. Costs in the 2015 period were higher due to the reasons above. Milling performance for the full year 2015 was approximately 1,534 tpd compared to 1,750 tpd in 2014. Throughput in the 2015 period was lower primarily due to downtime related to repairs carried out on the Lapa ball mill in the third and fourth quarters. Full-year minesite costs in 2015 were C$117 per tonne, higher than the C$107 in 2014. Costs were higher in 2015 largely due to the reasons outlined above. Payable production in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 19,929 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $620. This compares with the fourth quarter of 2014, when production was 25,611 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $607. In the 2015 period, production was lower and costs were higher due to a combination of lower throughput and lower grades compared to the 2014 period. For the full year 2015, payable production was 90,967 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $590. The prior year production was 92,622 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $667. Production in 2015 was lower due to lower throughput, while costs were lower primarily due to favourable foreign exchange rates. Under the current life of mine plan, Lapa is only expected to operate until early into the fourth quarter of 2016. Two areas (Zone 8 East - Upper mine and the Zulapa 7 - Deep 2 Zone) have been identified through exploration as areas that could potentially support future mining activity post 2017. However, additional exploration is required, and any potential production from these areas would likely require synergies with other production opportunities such as the Bousquet Zone 5 or the Pandora project. The LaRonde mine has now assumed responsibilities for the management and administration of the Lapa mine and progressive transfers of Agnico Eagle personnel from Lapa are now underway throughout the Company. Goldex - Record Underground Ore Hoisting in Q4 2015, Trend Could Continue into 2016 The 100% owned Goldex mine in northwestern Quebec began operation in 2008 but mining operations in the original orebody, the Goldex Extension Zone (\"GEZ\"), were suspended in October 2011. In July 2012, the M and E satellite zones were approved for development. Mining operations resumed on the M and E satellite zones in September 2013. Mining operations at GEZ remain suspended. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Goldex mine had record underground ore hoisting of 7,273 tpd. Although not currently built into the 2016 production forecast, the Company believes that there is potential for continued strong underground performance in 2016. Should this performance be sustainable, the Company will evaluate the potential to increase mill throughput (current mill capacity is approximately 8,000 tpd). The Goldex mill processed an average of 6,213 tpd in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to 6,251 tpd in the fourth quarter of 2014, which was similar to prior-year levels. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$31 in the fourth quarter of 2015, lower than the C$34 per tonne experienced in the fourth quarter of 2014. The 2015 decrease in costs over the prior-year period is primarily due to the strong underground performance outlined above. For the full year 2015, the Goldex mill averaged 6,336 tpd, which compares to 5,799 tpd in the corresponding period of 2014. The higher throughput in the 2015 period was largely due to accelerated mining levels compared to the 2014 period. Full-year minesite costs per tonne in 2015 were C$33, the same in 2014. Payable production in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 27,646 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $513. This compares with the fourth quarter of 2014, when production was 29,463 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $583. Production in the 2014 period was higher due to slightly higher grades and marginally more ore processed compared to the 2015 period. Costs were lower in the 2015 period due to lower unit costs and favourable exchange rates as compared to the same period in 2014. For the full year 2015, payable production was 115,426 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $538. The prior year production was 100,433 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $638. Production in 2015 was higher and costs were lower than in 2014 due to higher tonnage, grade and recoveries. Rehabilitation of the surface ramp has been completed which provides increased operational flexibility. This ramp also provides access to the M2 and M5 satellite zones for conversion drilling and development later this year. The exploration ramp into the DX Zone (the top of the Deep Zone) has reached the 120 level, which is the proposed bottom of the Deep 1 development phase. Underground development in the Deep 1 Zone will now shift to excavation of the various sublevels needed for mining development and excavation of the conveyor ramp. Studies are underway to evaluate the potential to increase throughput from the Deep 1 Zone, and the potential to mine a portion of the Deep 2 Zone, both of which could enhance production levels or extend the current mine life at Goldex and reduce operating costs. In January 2014, Agnico Eagle acquired the Akasaba West gold-copper deposit from Alexandria Minerals. Located less than 30 km from Goldex, the Akasaba West deposit could potentially create flexibility and synergies for the Company's operations in the Abitibi region by utilizing extra milling capacity at both Goldex and LaRonde, while reducing overall costs. Permitting and technical studies are ongoing with the goal of moving the project towards a production decision in late 2016 or early 2017. FINLAND AND SWEDEN Agnico Eagle 's Kittila mine in Finland is the largest primary gold producer in Europe and hosts the Company's largest mineral reserves. Exploration activities continue to expand the mineral resources and studies are underway to evaluate the potential to cost-effectively increase production. Kittila - Strong Mining Performance in Q4 2015 and Available Mill Capacity Provide Potential for Increased Future Production The 100% owned Kittila mine in northern Finland achieved commercial production in 2009. The focus at Kittila in 2015 was on improving mill reliability. Several projects were carried out in the fourth quarter of 2015 which appear to have improved maintenance performance. With further optimization, the Company believes that there is potential for improved mill availability, which could lead to higher throughput levels (possibly up to 20% higher) in the future. The Kittila mill processed an average of 4,100 tpd in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the 3,980 tpd in the fourth quarter of 2014. The underground performed very well in the fourth quarter resulting in record average daily throughput of 4,750 tpd in December 2015. Minesite costs per tonne at Kittila were approximately EUR80 in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to EUR75 in the fourth quarter of 2014. Costs increased in the fourth quarter of 2015 due to the increased usage of consumables, higher contractor costs and increased underground development costs when compared with the 2014 period. For the full year 2015, the mill processed an average of 4,011 tpd, as compared with 2014 when the mill processed an average of 3,168 tpd. The increase in throughput was a result of the completion of the mill expansion at the end of September 2014. For the full year 2015, the minesite costs per tonne were EUR76, compared to EUR78 in 2014. The slight decrease in minesite costs per tonne in the 2015 period are primarily due to efficiencies related to increased mill capacity. Fourth quarter 2015 payable production at Kittila was 44,279 ounces of gold with total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $747. In the fourth quarter of 2014, the mine produced 43,130 ounces at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $809. The higher production and lower costs in the 2015 period were a result of the completion of the mill expansion which continues to ramp-up to design capacity and favourable exchange rates. For the full year 2015, payable production from Kittila was 177,374 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $709. In 2014, the mine produced 141,742 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $845. The lower production in 2014 was largely due to the planned mill shutdown in September 2014 to tie-in the expansion. The lower total cash costs per ounce in the 2015 period are largely due to increased production and favourable foreign exchange rates. Previous drilling on the Rimpi Zone at Kittila has outlined a significant zone of mineralization with potentially wider widths and better grades than those currently being mined. The main underground ramp at Kittila is being extended to reach the deeper portions of the Rimpi Zone and it is also providing further underground drill access to test for additional depth extensions of the Rimpi, Suuri, Roura and the newly discovered Sisar mineralized zones. In addition, a surface ramp is being driven into the Rimpi Zone (now at a depth of 190 metres below surface) for production purposes and to provide a second egress for the Suuri ramp system. It will serve as the main haulage route from the deeper portions of both Rimpi and Suuri and, potentially, the Sisar Zone. At the Kuotko deposit, located approximately 15 kilometres north of Kittila, approximately 7,300 metre of drilling was completed in 2015. New mineralized zones have been identified outside of the known mineral resource areas. Metallurgical testing is also ongoing and studies are being carried out to assess the viability of mining the deposit as a satellite open pit. In 2015, a new zone of mineralization, known as the Sisar Zone, was discovered by exploration drilling from the underground ramp being driven towards the deeper portion of the Rimpi Zone. The Sisar Zone is located to the east of the main Kittila ore zone, and in close proximity to existing underground infrastructure. The Sisar Zone could potentially provide an additional source of underground ore to the Kittila mill with relatively little additional underground development, should further drilling outline an economic deposit. This new zone is discussed in further detail below. Inferred mineral resources at Kittila as of December 31, 2015 include the initial inferred mineral resources reported for the Sisar zone. As the table below sets out, 37% (approximately 651,000 ounces of gold) of the current inferred resources at Kittila are within the Sisar zone. Note that all of the inferred resources at Kittila, including Sisar, are above 1,400 metres depth. Meliadine - Moderate 2016 Capital Expenditures Preserves Production Optionality Located near Rankin Inlet, Nunavut, Canada, the Meliadine project was acquired in July 2010, and is one of Agnico Eagle 's largest gold projects in terms of mineral resources. The Company owns 100% of the 111,757 hectare property. In 2015, capital expenditures at Meliadine were approximately $67 million with a focus on additional ramp development, permitting, camp operation and completion of an updated National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\"NI 43-101\") technical study (see news release dated March 12, 2015). In 2015, approximately 2,084 metres of underground development were completed, with the ramp now extending to a vertical depth of approximately 300 metres below the surface. The technical study was based on extracting only the 3.3 million ounces of gold in proven and probable mineral reserves at December 31, 2014 (13.9 million tonnes of ore grading 7.44 g/t gold), which is all contained in the Tiriganiaq and Wesmeg deposits. At December 31, 2015, the Meliadine property hosted 3.4 million ounces of proven and probable mineral reserves (14.5 million tonnes of ore grading 7.32 g/t gold), 3.31 million ounces of measured and indicated mineral resources (20.78 million tonnes of ore grading 4.95 g/t gold), and 3.55 million ounces of inferred mineral resources (14.71 million tonnes of ore grading 7.51 g/t gold). In addition, there are numerous other known gold occurrences in the 80-kilometre-long greenstone belt that require further evaluation. The updated technical study forecast average annual production of approximately 350,000 ounces at a life-of-mine total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of approximately $531 over a nine year mine life. The study used a gold price of C$1,495 per ounce (as compared to a current spot price of approximately C$1,657 per ounce on February 8, 2016). The capital budget for 2016 is $96 million with activities focused on further underground development (approximately 3,000 metres), detailed engineering and procurement, construction of essential surface infrastructure, and acquisition of a used camp facility. The goal of the 2016 capital program is to ensure that the project remains on track for a potential 2020 production start-up, which is approximately a one year delay from previous expectations. Internal studies are ongoing to evaluate the potential to extract additional ounces of gold from the Tiriganiaq and Wesmeg/Normeg deposits, which could potentially extend the mine life, increase annual production, and improve the project economics and the after-tax internal rate of return. These studies are expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2016. In July 2015, the Kivalliq Inuit Association and Agnico Eagle signed the Inuit Impact Benefit Agreement (\"IIBA\") for the Meliadine gold project. The IIBA addresses protection of Inuit values, culture and language, protection of the land, water and wildlife, provides financial compensation to Inuit over the mine life and contains provision for training, employment and contracting. On October 5, 2015, the Nunavut Water Board issued the permit (License B) for Meliadine pre-development work. License A, which is required for production activities, is expected to be granted in the second quarter of 2016. The timing of future capital expenditures on the Meliadine project beyond 2016 and the determination of whether to build a mine at Meliadine are subject to approval by Agnico Eagle 's Board of Directors, which will be based on prevailing market conditions and outcomes of the various potential scenarios being evaluated. Acquisition of New Properties in Nunavut Agnico Eagle is currently studying options and alternatives in Nunavut to capitalize on the large and growing mineral resource in the region. As part of this initiative, the Company has staked in 2015 new claims totaling 68,012 hectares on properties to the west-northwest of the project, on the continuation of the greenstone belt that hosts the Meliadine deposits. In summer 2015, an airborne VTEM magnetic and electromagnetic survey was flown over the new properties. A field crew initiated prospecting and sampling of areas with geophysical signatures typical of iron formation-hosted Archean/Proto-Proterozoic deposits, similar to those recognized at Meadowbank, Amaruq and Meliadine projects. Close to 800 rock samples have been collected from the properties. Initial results have identified a 2-kilometre-long structure from which 21 rock samples returned values above 1.0 g/t gold including seven values in excess of 10.0 g/t gold, with a maximum value of 42.0 g/t gold. The new properties appear to be geologically similar to the Meadowbank, Meliadine and Amaruq projects where the Company's exploration team has demonstrated the effectiveness of a systematic exploration approach and the strong mineral potential of this part of Nunavut. Assembling and analyzing the data collected this summer will assist in preparing a drill program for 2016 to further investigate the higher potential areas on the new properties. SOUTHERN BUSINESS REVIEW Agnico Eagle's Southern Business operations are focused in Mexico. These operations have been the source of growing precious metals production (gold and silver), stable operating costs and strong free cash flow since 2009. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the Mexican operations had record quarterly silver production of approximately 745,000 ounces. Pinos Altos - Shaft Commissioning Scheduled for H1 2016 The 100% owned Pinos Altos mine in northern Mexico achieved commercial production in November 2009. The Pinos Altos mill processed 4,940 tpd in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to 5,466 tpd per day processed in the fourth quarter of 2014. During the fourth quarter of 2015, approximately 146,200 tonnes of ore were stacked on the leach pad at Pinos Altos, compared to 131,000 tonnes in the comparable 2014 period. Mill throughput in the 2015 period was negatively impacted by cold weather conditions and a higher percentage of clay in the ore. Minesite costs per tonne at Pinos Altos were $44 in the fourth quarter of 2015, lower than the $48 in the fourth quarter of 2014. The difference in minesite costs per tonne was largely attributable to variations in the proportion of heap leach ore to milled ore and open pit ore to underground ore and routine fluctuations in the waste to ore stripping ratio in the open pit mines. In addition, the 2015 costs were favourably impacted by lower energy and fuel costs. For the full year 2015, the Pinos Altos mill processed an average of 5,462 tpd, compared to 5,350 tpd processed in 2014. In 2015, approximately 384,700 tonnes of ore were stacked on the leach pad at Pinos Altos, compared to approximately 567,800 tonnes in 2014. Minesite costs per tonne at Pinos Altos for the full year period in 2015 were approximately $45 compared to approximately $48 in 2014, with the difference due to the reasons mentioned above. Payable production in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 44,496 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $417. This compares with production of 40,669 ounces at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $597 in the fourth quarter of 2014. Higher production in 2015 is largely due to higher grades processed compared to the same period last year. The decrease in the year over year total cash costs per ounce is largely due to higher silver production and favourable foreign exchange rates compared to the prior year period. For the full year 2015, Pinos Altos produced 192,974 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $387. This is in contrast to 2014 when the mine produced 171,019 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $533. The higher ounces produced and decrease in the cash costs per ounce on a year-over-year basis is largely due to the reasons mentioned above. The $106 million Pinos Altos shaft sinking project remains on schedule for completion in early 2016, with full commissioning expected during the first half of 2016. When the shaft is completed, it will allow better matching of the future mining capacity with the mill capacity at Pinos Altos once the open pit mining operation begins to wind down as planned over the next several years. Creston Mascota - Record Annual Tonnes Stacked The Creston Mascota heap leach has been operating as a satellite operation to the Pinos Altos mine since late 2010. Approximately 529,000 tonnes of ore were stacked on the Creston Mascota leach pad during the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to approximately 550,800 tonnes stacked in the fourth quarter of 2014. In the 2015 period, crusher throughput was slightly lower due to cold weather conditions which created minor ore handling issues. Minesite costs per tonne at Creston Mascota were $13 in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $14 in the fourth quarter of 2014. Costs were slightly lower in the 2015 period due to lower fuel consumption, favourable fuel price variance and lower equipment rental charges. For the full year 2015, approximately 2,098,800 tonnes of ore were stacked on the Creston Mascota leach pad, compared to approximately 1,793,800 tonnes stacked in the full year 2014. In the 2015 period, additional ore was encountered outside the block model, which resulted in more tonnes being stacked in the first half of the year compared to the 2014 period. Minesite costs per tonne at Creston Mascota were $12 for the full year 2015, compared to $16 in 2014. The increase in tonnes stacked in the 2015 period resulted in lower costs compared to the 2014 period. Payable production at Creston Mascota in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 13,933 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $445. This compares to 12,989 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $556 during the fourth quarter of 2014. Production was higher in the 2015 period due to higher grades. Costs in the 2015 period were lower primarily due to increased production and favourable exchange rates. Payable production for the full year 2015 totaled 54,703 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $430, compared to 47,842 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $578 in 2014. The higher production in 2015 is primarily due to more tonnes stacked at slightly higher grades. Costs were lower in the 2015 period primarily due to more ounces produced and favourable exchange rates. In fourth quarter of 2015, work on the Phase 4 leach pad advanced with construction activities focused on earthworks, drainages, peripheral roads and water diversion channels. Overall, the project is 50% constructed with full completion expected later in 2016. As reported in the Company's July 29, 2015 news release, infill drilling has encountered higher grade mineralization at the Creston Mascota deposit. In the fourth quarter of 2015, five holes totaling approximately 600 metres were completed which showed structural continuity of the mineralization down dip. Work is underway to evaluate the impact of these results on the pit design and production planning. La India - Increased Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources at Year-End 2015 The La India mine in Sonora, Mexico, located approximately 70 kilometres from the Company's Pinos Altos mine, was acquired in November 2011 through the purchase of Grayd Resources Inc., which held a 56,000 hectare land position in the Mulatos gold belt. Commissioning of the mine commenced ahead of schedule in the third quarter of 2014. Design, permitting, construction and start-up of the La India mine were completed within 22 months of the acquisition. In 2014, the mine reported 3,180 ounces of pre-commercial production, and commercial production was declared as at February 1, 2014. Approximately 1,439,500 tonnes of ore were stacked on the La India leach pad during the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to approximately 1,426,700 tonnes stacked in the fourth quarter of 2014. Minesite costs per tonne at La India were $8 in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to $9 in the fourth quarter of 2014. The slightly lower costs in the 2015 period are primarily due to lower costs for fuel, consumables and labour. For the full year 2015, approximately 5,371,400 tonnes of ore were stacked on the La India leach pad compared to approximately 4,773,200 tonnes stacked in the full year 2014. Minesite costs per tonne at La India were $9 for the full year 2015, compared to $8 in 2014. The increase in tonnes stacked in the 2015 period reflects a full year of stacking versus 11 months (the commercial production period) in 2014. Costs were slightly higher due to higher maintenance and contractor costs. Payable production at La India in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 23,432 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $485. This compares to 23,273 ounces at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $496 during the fourth quarter of 2014. Costs were slightly better in the 2015 period due to favourable foreign exchange rates. Payable production for the full year 2015 totaled 104,362 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $436, compared to 75,093 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $487 in 2014. The higher production in 2015 is primarily due to more ore tonnes stacked compared to the 2014 period. Costs were lower in the 2015 period due to more ounces produced and favourable foreign exchange rates. In the fourth quarter of 2015, construction for the leach pad expansion (earthworks and liner installation) was finished within budget and haul road construction and preparation activities for the start-up of mining at the Main Zone pit were also completed. Additional drilling was carried out at La India in 2015, with a focus on extending mineralization in the Main Zone and the La India Zone and conversion of sulfide mineralization into mineral reserves and mineral resources. In addition, drilling was also carried out on a portion of the El Realito property. The 2015 exploration program resulted in a 28% increase in mineral reserves, and a 21% increase in measured and indicated mineral resources (see \"Detailed Mineral Reserve and Mineral Resource Data (as at December 31, 2015)\" below). With the increased mineral reserves and mineral resources, the Company is undertaking studies consider the potential for expanding production at the mine. El Barqueno - Drilling Continues with a Focus on Mineral Resource Delineation and Defining New Target Areas Agnico Eagle has a 100% interest in the El Barqueno project. The 32,840-hectare property is in the Guachinango gold-silver mining district, Jalisco State, Mexico, approximately 150 kilometres west of the state capital of Guadalajara. It consists of three blocks of land: the original El Barqueno package (El Barqueno I, II and III) acquired from Cayden Resources in November 2014, and two adjacent blocks acquired from Soltoro Limited in June 2015 (El Rayo and El Tecolote). The Company last reported on this project in a news release dated October 28, 2015. The El Barqueno project contains a number of known mineralized zones and several prospects that require further evaluation. The project was a major exploration focus for the Company in 2015, with a total of 279 holes (a total of 69,522 metres) drilled in the $17 million exploration program. Using these results, an initial inferred mineral resource at El Barqueno is being reported in this news release: 19.7 million tonnes grading 0.96 g/t gold and 5.78 g/t silver (containing 608,000 ounces of gold and 3.7 million ounces of silver) at the Azteca-Zapoteca, Angostura and Pena de Oro zones. Exploration expenditures at El Barqueno in 2016 are budgeted at $13 million for mineral resource development, conversion and regional exploration. There are currently 14 drills working to define the limits of the known prospects and test new target areas such as: Olmeca, Zapote, Mixteca, El Rayo and Pilarica. The project's gold-silver deposits could potentially be developed into a series of open pits utilizing heap leach processing, similar to Creston Mascota and the La India mine.

Agrium reports strong fourth quarter results TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 09, 2016 CALGARY, ALBERTA--(Marketwired - Feb. 9, 2016) - ALL AMOUNTS ARE STATED IN U.S.$ Agrium Inc. (TSX:AGU) (NYSE:AGU) announced today 2015 fourth quarter net earnings from continuing operations of $200-million ($1.45 diluted earnings per share), compared to $70-million ($0.46 diluted earnings per share) in the fourth quarter of 2014. The increased net earnings were driven by strong performance from our Wholesale business unit, which achieved reduced cost of production and higher overall sales volumes for all three nutrients. Retail's fourth quarter earnings were also higher than last year, despite the wet weather in the U.S. during the fall application season. On an annual basis, 2015 net earnings from continuing operations were $988-millon ($6.98 diluted earnings per share) compared to $798-millon ($5.51 diluted earnings per share) in 2014. Highlights: Fourth quarter adjusted net earnings of $209-million or $1.52 per share (see page 2 for adjusted net earnings reconciliation)1, the second highest fourth quarter results on record. Our results include an $18-million restructuring expense ($0.10 per share) associated with the portfolio review and cost reduction measures undertaken, which was not included in the adjusted net earnings reconciliation on page 2. Wholesale's fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA2 of $372-million demonstrates improved nitrogen and potash production performance, delivering higher sales volumes and significantly lower production costs. The Canpotex proving run for the Vanscoy expansion was highly successful. We demonstrated our nameplate capacity within a year of mechanical completion, which increased our allocation to 10.3 percent of total Canpotex shipments starting in 2016. Retail EBITDA2 was higher than the same quarter last year as a result of strong year-end rebates for crop protection products and seed as well as lower operating expenses as a result of cost reduction initiatives implemented in 2015. On an annual basis, Retail U.S. normalized comparable store sales was up 2 percent versus a 2 percent decline in 2014. On an annual basis, 2015 free cash flow3 increased to $1.2-billion, or $8.59 per share, compared to $841-million, or $5.85 per share in 2014. Agrium has announced a 2016 annual guidance range of $5.50 to $7.00 diluted earnings per share (see page 3 for further details). \"Agrium achieved a strong finish to 2015, despite lower nutrient prices and challenging commodity markets. A key differentiator for the company was our integrated strategy, which helped provide stability in our earnings. We also benefited from the proactive steps we took to further strengthen the company over the past year, including a renewed focus on execution and controlling our controllables. These benefits flowed through to our bottom line, helped us to generate $8.59 of free cash flow per share and drive increased returns to shareholders, while still investing in future earnings growth,\" commented Chuck Magro, Agrium's President and CEO. Quarter effective tax rate of 20 percent used for adjusted net earnings and per share calculations. These are non-IFRS measures which represent net earnings adjusted for certain income (expenses) that are considered to be non-operational in nature. We believe these measures provide meaningful comparison to the earnings of other companies by eliminating share-based payments expense (recovery), gains (losses) on foreign exchange and related gains (losses) on non-qualifying derivative hedges and significant non-operating, non-recurring items. These should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS and may not be directly comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. EBITDA is earnings (loss) from continuing operations before finance costs, income taxes, depreciation and amortization while Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA before finance costs, income taxes, depreciation and amortization of joint ventures.

We remain focused on Operational Excellence and our growth strategy, controlling what we can in order to reduce our cost position, while continuing to optimize and grow our more stable Retail operations,\" added Mr. Magro. MARKET OUTLOOK The macroeconomic environment has continued to be challenging for commodities, resulting in many commodities trading at multi-year lows in early 2016. While agricultural commodities are driven by unique supply and demand fundamentals, prices have not escaped the general negative sentiment toward commodities. In addition to this, the prices of most crops have been pressured by another year of high global crop yields in 2015, allowing the global inventories of many major grains and oilseeds to increase. Furthermore, the strength in the U.S. dollar relative to most other global currencies has increased the competitiveness of non-U.S. growers, which has led to lower than expected U.S. grain and oilseed exports and added pressure on prices. Despite the weak macroeconomic environment, we expect growers within North America and other major agricultural markets will plant historically high crop acreage again in 2016, supporting robust crop input demand. In the U.S., growers are expected to increase overall crop acreage, including a one to three million acre increase in corn area, as significant crop acreage was lost in 2015 due to excess moisture in parts of the U.S. Corn Belt. Outside of the U.S., the weakness in domestic currencies has led to relatively attractive domestic crop prices, which is expected to support planted acreage. Analysts project that North American corn, soybean, cotton and canola acreage could increase in 2016 if weather cooperates, which is supportive of overall seed demand, but like 2015, growers may be more discerning in trait selection to optimize for yield depending on field locations. Crop protection prices are expected to be relatively stable and we expect that lower year-over-year cash rents and significantly lower fuel and crop nutrient prices will provide support for North American crop input expenditures in 2016. Crop nutrient prices have declined over the past few months, driven by a combination of supply and demand factors. The fall application season in the U.S. was expected to be supported by the relatively early end of the harvest season; however the same warm weather that supported a rapid harvest delayed fall ammonia applications because soil temperatures were too high. Following the warm start, the ability of growers to apply nutrients was constrained by persistent wet weather. November 2015 was the wettest November in the U.S. since 1985 and December 2015 was the wettest December on record in addition to being the warmest. The combination of wet and warm weather meant that application equipment could not get into the field to apply crop nutrients, resulting in below-expected fall applications. The lower than expected fall applications left crop nutrient inventories at higher than expected levels throughout the supply chain and pressured prices of all crop nutrients. The combination of expected increase in U.S. corn acreage and the poor fall application season is anticipated to result in strong U.S. crop nutrient demand in the first half of 2016. Based on expected crop acreage, North American crop nutrient demand is expected to increase by 1 to 3 percent in 2015/2016, but phosphate and potash demand may fall below that range as volumes lost due to the poor fall season may not be fully made up in the first half of 2016. Global urea prices have declined significantly below the cost of production of the high-cost Chinese producers. Even so, Chinese urea production has remained surprisingly strong. While Chinese urea production has not declined as much as expected, Chinese urea exports declined by 26 percent year-over-year in the second half of 2015. Chinese urea costs have declined due to lower coal prices and the weakened yuan, but costs have not declined as much as urea prices. As a result of the continued price weakness and increased non-Chinese urea supplies, Chinese urea exports are projected to decline from 2015 levels to between 12.5 and 13.5 million tonnes in 2016. We expect that the combination of poor Chinese urea profitability and strong North American demand will support urea prices entering the spring season. Chinese phosphate supplies have also pressured that market. Chinese diammonium phosphate and monoammonium phosphate exports reached a record 10.6 million tonnes in 2015 and are expected to remain relatively flat in 2016. On the demand side, the Brazilian market for crop nutrients continued to fall short of expectations in late 2015 as credit constraints and the weak value of the Brazilian real pressured demand for all nutrients. Given that these challenges remain, we expect 2016 Brazilian import demand for all products to remain relatively flat to 2015. The below-average Indian monsoon and weak rupee value pressured demand for phosphate and potash in late 2015, while 2015 urea imports set a record, all of which has led to building inventories and the belief that Indian import demand will be relatively low to start 2016. Global potash markets have been under pressure recently due to a combination of factors, including the sizeable shift in global currencies, a build-up of global inventories due to strong shipments earlier in the year, Indian demand impacted by the below average monsoon and buyers delaying purchases due to the current price uncertainty. We anticipate solid potash demand in global markets in 2016, with global shipments expected to come in between 58 to 60 million tonnes in 2016, relative to the 58.5 million tonnes shipped in 2015. We expect macroeconomic challenges in combination with current crop prices to be a risk in 2016. However, the arrival of the Northern Hemisphere's spring application season over the next couple of months is expected to result in improved demand, particularly in light of the poor fall season in the U.S. and the fact declining crop nutrient prices have caused buyers around the world to sit back and wait for stability. We also expect there will be a supply response across all three major nutrients in reaction to current price levels - some of which we have seen already in the form of production cuts and closures. 2016 ANNUAL GUIDANCE Based on our Market Outlook, Agrium expects to achieve annual diluted earnings per share of $5.50 to $7.00 in 2016. We have maintained a range encompassing approximately $300-million of EBITDA variability to reflect the risk and opportunity associated with crop nutrient prices and demand for crop inputs. We are assuming normal spring and fall application seasons, recognizing there is always a risk that inclement weather could affect the timing and duration of each season. Our earnings per share guidance assumes some recovery from current nitrogen prices during the key application seasons. Based on these and other assumptions regarding crop nutrient prices and demand for crop nutrients set out under the heading \"Market Outlook\", we expect Retail EBITDA to be $1.075-billion to $1.175-billion, and Retail nutrient sales volumes to be 9.8 to 10.2 million tonnes in 2016. Based on our expected increase in utilization rate for our nitrogen assets, we anticipate nitrogen production to total 3.5 to 3.7 million tonnes. Agrium has continued its active hedging program for our gas requirements in 2016 as we expect natural gas prices to remain at levels consistent with 2015. Our earnings per share guidance assume NYMEX gas prices will be between $2.05 and $2.85 per MMBtu in 2016. Agrium's expectation for potash production in 2016 includes incremental production from the completed expansion at our Vanscoy mine. We expect to produce between 2.4 and 2.6 million tonnes of potash in 2016. Total capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $800-million to $900-million, of which approximately $500-million to $550-million is expected to be sustaining capital expenditures. Our investing capital program planned for 2016 includes the completion of our Borger brownfield urea expansion. Agrium's annual effective tax rate for 2016 is expected to be 27 to 28 percent, consistent with 2015. This guidance and updated additional measures and related assumptions are summarized in the following table. Guidance excludes the impact of share-based payments expense (recovery), gains (losses) on foreign exchange and related non-qualifying derivative hedges and significant non-operating, non-recurring items.

Realized selling prices, on the other hand, decreased as a result of weaker market conditions. Reduced sales of product purchased for resale contributed to the decrease in sales as Agrium exited non-core, low return portions of this business. Wholesale's gross profit significantly increased due to manufacturing cost efficiencies associated with higher production volumes, reduced overall fixed costs and lower natural gas input costs for the fourth quarter compared to the same periods last year. Retail's sales and gross profit decreased for the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year primarily due to unfavorable weather conditions and the closure of one of our livestock export businesses in Australia. A decrease in gross profit was partially offset by higher rebates received in the fourth quarter of 2015. Expenses General and administrative expenses decreased by $4-million (5 percent) for the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year as a result of reduced payroll and office expenses related to our ongoing Operational Excellence program. Our share-based payments expense was lower by $10-million due primarily to a slight decrease in our share price in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to a share price increase in the fourth quarter of 2014. Other expenses breakdown In the fourth quarter of 2015, other expenses increased by $18-million due to the following: Costs of $18-million were incurred in the implementation of our Operational Excellence initiatives in the current quarter relating primarily to severance and closure costs. We recorded a goodwill impairment of $19-million for our Wholesale Europe operations. We recognized a $17-million gain from the sale of our West Sacramento nitrogen upgrade facility. We had losses of $15-million on natural gas derivatives in the fourth quarter of 2014, which we recorded directly to other expenses. 2015 did not have comparable results, as effective January 1, 2015, we began to designate all of our natural gas derivatives as qualifying hedges for accounting purposes. Related gains or losses are now recorded as part of cost of product sold when we sell the related product, while unrealized gains or losses are recorded in equity. Bad debt recovery of $11-million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014. Effective Tax Rate The effective tax rate on continuing operations of 20 percent for the fourth quarter was higher than the tax rate of (4) percent for the comparative quarter in 2014 due to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax assets in the fourth quarter of 2014. Excluding the recognition of the one-time previously unrecognized tax assets, the effective tax rate would have been 19 percent. BUSINESS SEGMENT PERFORMANCE Retail   Three months ended December 31,   (millions of U.S. dollars, except where noted) 2015 2014 Change   Sales 1,765 2,057 (292 ) Cost of product sold 1,166 1,443 (277 ) Gross profit 599 614 (15 ) EBITDA 199 181 18   Selling expense as a percentage of sales (%) 26 25 1   Retail sales and gross profit during the quarter were lower than the same period last year due to lower crop input prices and wet weather across the U.S. impacting the fall application season. Total Retail selling expenses decreased by 10 percent compared to the prior year due to lower depreciation and amortization, the impact of currency valuations in our international businesses and cost reduction measures taken across the business in 2015. Total EBITDA increased 10 percent over the fourth quarter of 2014 primarily due to lower selling expenses, strong margins for crop protection products and improved seed results. Regionally, all key geographies performed well. Canada and the U.S. both showed higher fourth quarter EBITDA figures. Australian EBITDA was down slightly compared to the prior year; however, EBIT in Australia increased compared to the prior quarter due to a reduction in depreciation and amortization. Our U.S. Retail business also reported an annual 2 percent increase in normalized comparable store sales versus a decrease of 2 percent in 2014. Crop nutrients Total crop nutrient sales were 13 percent lower compared to the same period last year due to weaker global pricing and lower application volumes due to weather challenges. However, crop nutrient margins per tonne improved, which offset the lower volumes and resulted in only a 1 percent decline in gross profit. Total crop nutrient volumes were 6 percent lower this quarter across our Retail operations compared to the same period last year. Volumes were lower in the U.S. due to excess rain in the fall application window, while in Canada and Australia, growers were conservative given the uncertainty over nutrient and agricultural markets. Total crop nutrient margins increased slightly on a per tonne basis and gross profit as a percentage of sales rose from 16 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014 to 18 percent this quarter reflecting a focus on inventory management. Crop protection products Total crop protection sales were down 2 percent this quarter, as slightly higher sales in North America were offset by lower sales in our International operations. U.S. sales were driven by a strong herbicide application season, while Canadian growers purchased higher volumes ahead of the weakening Canadian dollar. In Australia, sales were lower due to the weakening of the Australian dollar against the U.S. dollar; in local currency, Australian sales were higher in the current quarter. Crop protection margins as a percentage of sales increased 3 percent, primarily due to year-end rebate reconciliation and a higher margin product mix in the current quarter. Proprietary product sales as a percentage of total sales increased 2 percent compared to the same period in the prior year. Seed Seed sales were down 18 percent this quarter compared to the same period last year, primarily due to the significant reduction in planted wheat acres in the U.S. due to wet weather and lower wheat prices. Despite lower sales, seed margins increased 8 percent compared to the prior year due to strong supplier rebates and seed sales mix. Merchandise Merchandise sales decreased compared to the same period last year as a result of lower fuel pricing and demand in Canada and lower animal health and fencing product sales in Australia due to dry conditions. Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased 3 percent this quarter, primarily due to a reduction in the lower-margin Canadian fuel business compared to the prior year. Services and other Sales for services and other was down 35 percent this quarter, due mainly to the closure of one of our livestock export businesses in Australia. Application and other services were down in North America, due to the wet conditions in the U.S. during the fall application season. Wholesale   Three months ended December 31,   (millions of U.S. dollars, except where noted) 2015 2014 Change   Sales 888 897 (9 ) Sales volumes (tonnes 000's) 2,292 1,999 293   Cost of product sold 568 767 (199 ) Gross profit 320 130 190   Adjusted EBITDA 372 150 222   Expenses 33 46 (13 Wholesale successfully completed its Canpotex proving run for the Vanscoy potash expansion at the end of the fourth quarter, resulting in our annual Canpotex allocation increasing to 10.3 percent in 2016 from 7.3 percent in 2015. Higher operating production rates at our nitrogen facilities also supported increased sales volumes this quarter. Total sales were slightly lower this quarter due to lower global nutrient prices and our decision to sell non-core, lower-return purchase for resale facilities in 2015 related to our asset portfolio review. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $222-million this quarter, and more than doubled compared to the same quarter last year. The increase was primarily due to lower production costs per tonne and higher utilization rates from our potash and nitrogen operations. Nitrogen Nitrogen gross profit increased by 65 percent over the same period last year as a result of higher sales volumes and significantly lower cost of production. Sales volumes increased by 4 percent over the same period last year, driven by stronger urea and ammonia sales volumes. The increase was due to strong demand in our core markets and higher on-stream time at our production facilities, creating additional product availability compared to the same period last year. Sales volumes were partly impacted by a narrow window for ammonia application in the U.S. and lower nitrogen solution sales volumes due to the closure and subsequent sale of our West Sacramento upgrading facility in 2015. Cost of product sold per tonne was 40 percent lower than the same period last year. Operational improvements and higher on-stream time compared to the same period last year decreased fixed costs per tonne, while lower natural gas costs reduced variable costs. The weaker Canadian dollar also reduced operating costs at our Canadian plants. Nitrogen margins were $204 per tonne, a $76 per tonne increase over the same period last year, despite a 12 percent reduction in average selling prices. As of January 1, 2015, we have designated all of our natural gas derivatives as accounting hedges1, with realized gains and losses now recorded to cost of product sold (which also includes transportation and administration costs). In the prior year, unrealized and realized gains and losses on derivatives not designated as hedges were included in other expenses. Potash Potash gross profit this quarter was $113-million higher than the same period last year. The significant increase was due to higher production volumes and lower costs this quarter after the completion of the Vanscoy expansion project as compared to the significant outage in the fourth quarter of 2014 in order to tie-in the expansion, which resulted in a negative gross profit of $50-million. Sales volumes were 637,000 tonnes higher compared to the same period in the prior year. Production volumes this quarter were 691,000 tonnes and the Canpotex proving run was completed successfully before the end of 2015. We expect Agrium's new Canpotex allotment will be 10.3 percent of Canpotex's total annual international shipments. Realized selling prices were lower than the same period last year due to slow spot market demand in both domestic and international markets. Cost of product sold was reduced as a result of cost efficiencies associated with the ramp-up of the Vanscoy expansion compared to the outage last year for the final tie-in of the expansion project. The significant weakening of the Canadian dollar also reduced production costs reported in U.S. dollars. As a result, cash cost of product manufactured continues to improve and was $64 per tonne this quarter compared to $89 per tonne in the third quarter of 2015. Phosphate Sales volumes were slightly higher than last year, while reduced selling prices were largely offset by lower cost of production. As a result, phosphate margin per tonne was only 6 percent lower than the same quarter last year. Phosphate gross profit was unchanged from the prior year. Wholesale Other Gross profit for Wholesale's other product category increased this quarter primarily due to higher ammonium sulfate sales volumes and higher ESN margins resulting from lower cost of product sold. This was partly offset by lower ESN realized selling prices. Expenses Expenses in the current quarter were $13-million lower than the same period last year as a result of lower selling and general administrative expenses and a $17-million gain on sale of the West Sacramento upgrading facility. Partially offsetting this is a $19-million goodwill impairment in our European purchase for resale business resulting from ongoing portfolio review in 2015. Other EBITDA for our Other non-operating business unit for the fourth quarter of 2015 had a net expense of $92-million, compared to a net expense of $78-million for the fourth quarter of 2014. The variance was due to the following: $7-million higher gross profit elimination expense as a result of higher inter-segment inventory held at the end of the fourth quarter of 2015 Increase of $12-million in other expenses of our Other business unit primarily due to costs incurred in implementing our Operational Excellence initiatives including severance and closure costs $10-million lower share-based payments expenses due primarily to a slight decrease in our share price in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to a share price increase in the same period last year NORMAL COURSE ISSUER BID In January 2015, the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) accepted Agrium's notice of intention to make a normal course issuer bid (NCIB) whereby Agrium may purchase up to 7,185,866 common shares on the TSX and New York Stock Exchange from January 26, 2015 to January 25, 2016. In 2015, we purchased for cancellation 5,574,331 shares at an average share price of $100.25 for total consideration of $559-million. No shares were repurchased in 2016 to the date of expiry.

OTHER Barrick Gold Corporation (TSX: ABX) Our vision is the generation of wealth through responsible mining wealth for our owners, our people, and the countries and communities with which we partner. We aim to be the leading mining company focused on gold, growing our cash flow per share by developing and operating high quality assets through disciplined allocation of human and financial capital and operational excellence. Those who founded and first led the company were committed to a culture of partnership and the values underpinning such a culture: trust, transparency, shared responsibility and accountability, and a sense of emotional and financial ownership. The company is returning to its roots as a lean and nimble organization, with minimal bureaucracy. A small head office manages the company with a balance of entrepreneurialism and prudence, focusing on only a few core activities: defining and implementing strategy, allocating human and financial capital, and fulfilling the obligations required of a public company. Leaders at the operational level have greater autonomy, responsibility, and accountability, functioning as business owners. Free from bureaucracy and middle management, they are focused on maximizing free cash flow, and the head office is focused on allocating that cash flow to maximize shareholder returns. Barrick has mining operations in Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile, Dominican Republic, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Saudi Arabia, United States and Zambia. More than 75 percent of the company's gold production comes from the Americas region. Barrick Reports Third Quarter 2015 Results | Growing Free Cash Flow TORONTO, October 28, 2015 The company reported adjusted net earnings of $131 million ($0.11 per share)1and a net loss of $264 million ($0.23 per share) in the third quarter. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $942 million1; EBITDA was $490 million1. Free cash flow was $866 million1, or $256 million excluding proceeds from the Pueblo Viejo streaming transaction.  Gold production in the third quarter was 1.66 million ounces at all-in sustaining costs (AISC) of $771 per ounce1 Full-year gold production is expected to be 6.1-6.3 million ounces. Full-year all-in sustaining cost guidance reduced to $830-$870 per ounce from previous range of $840-$880 per ounce. On track to achieve $2 billion in cash flow improvements by end of 2016. Total debt reduced by 15 percent year-to-date, on track to achieve $3 billion debt reduction target. Progressing drilling and feasibility study work to convert resources to reserves over the next five years at Cortez, Goldstrike, Lagunas Norte, Pueblo Viejo, Turquoise Ridge and other sites. Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:ABX)(TSX:ABX) (Barrick or the \"company\") today reported adjusted net earnings of $131 million ($0.11 per share) for the third quarter and a net loss of $264 million ($0.23 per share). Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was$942 million and EBITDA was $490 million. Free cash flow was $866 million, or $256 million excluding the impact of $610 millionin proceeds from the Pueblo Viejo streaming transaction2. Production in the third quarter was in line with expectations at 1.66 million ounces of gold. All-in sustaining costs were $771 per ounce and cash costs were $570 per ounce1. Full-year 2015 gold production is expected to be 6.1-6.3 million ounces at lower all-in sustaining costs of $830-$870 per ounce. Our objective is to grow free cash flow per share from a portfolio of high-quality gold assets through disciplined capital allocation and operational excellence. In support of this objective, we have returned to a leaner, decentralized operating model designed to maximize free cash flow and improve execution. Clear capital allocation criteria, including a 15 percent hurdle rate for all investments, are driving greater financial rigor and stronger returns. The divestment of non-core assets has refocused our portfolio and we have formed vital new strategic partnerships that will drive new opportunities in the future. All of this is driving stronger performance across the business, reflected by two consecutive quarters of positive free cash flow and improved costs. At the same time, we are strengthening our balance sheet and remain on track to reduce debt by $3 billion. This momentum will support our overriding objective of growing free cash flow per share, underpinned by a strong pipeline of organic projects and mine site expansion opportunities in our core regions. STRENGTHENING THE BALANCE SHEET Earlier this year, we set a $3 billion debt reduction target for 2015. We said we would achieve this through the disciplined sale of non-core assets, the formation of new joint ventures and partnerships, and by maximizing free cash flow from our operations. Thus far, we have completed or announced asset sales, joint ventures and partnerships valued at $2.46 billion. We have also generated$282 million in positive free cash flow in the last two quarters despite a lower gold price, reflecting the impact of our efforts to maximize free cash flow across the company. Both asset sales and cash flow improvements have been credit positive, and have resulted in improvements to our debt-to-EBITDA ratio. Achieving our $3 billion debt reduction target will also reduce annual pre-tax interest payments by approximately $140 million. So far this year, total debt has been reduced by 15 percent, from $13.1 billion to $11.2 billion3, significantly reducing our near-term debt repayment obligations. We currently have less than $250 million in debt due before 2018 and approximately $5 billion of our $11.2 billion in outstanding debt matures after 2032. Building on $1.9 billion in repayments already completed this year, we intend to use approximately $1 billion in proceeds from the sale of 50 percent of Zaldivar to reduce debt. The sale is expected to close in the fourth quarter. This would bring total debt repayments to approximately $2.9 billion. We intend to use free cash flow to reach our target of $3 billion. Assuming the completion of $3 billion in repayments, total debt will have been reduced by 23 percent, from $13.1 billion to $10.1 billion. We also expect to announce the outcome of a process for the sale of certain non-core U.S. assets in the fourth quarter. As we move into 2016 and beyond, we will continue to take prudent steps to strengthen our balance sheet, balancing debt repayments with investments in profitable production that will drive growth in free cash flow and EBITDA. Our liquidity position continues to improve, with strong cash flow generation, very modest near-term debt repayment obligations, a$4 billion undrawn credit facility and $3.34 billion in cash on hand at the end of the third quarter. FINANCIAL DISCUSSION Free cash flow increased to $866 million, or $256 million excluding the impact of $610 million in proceeds from the Pueblo Viejo streaming transaction. This compares to $26 million in free cash flow in the second quarter of 2015. Two consecutive quarters of positive free cash flow after a prolonged period of negative free cash flow reflects our driving focus on maximizing free cash flow through greater capital discipline, operational efficiencies and strong cost management. Third quarter 2015 adjusted net earnings were $131 million ($0.11 per share) compared to $222 million ($0.19 per share) in the prior year period. The net loss for the quarter was $264 million ($0.23 per share) compared to net earnings of $125 million ($0.11per share) in the prior year quarter. Lower adjusted net earnings reflect lower realized gold and copper prices and higher depreciation compared to the prior year period, partially offset by increased gold and copper sales. Significant adjusting items for the quarter (net of tax and non-controlling interest effects) include: $455 million in impairment charges primarily related to the reclassification of our Zaldivar mine as held-for-sale; and $29 million in costs arising from the write-down of obsolete supplies inventory; partially offset by $52 million of gains related to the sale of our Cowal mine and 50 percent of our interest in the Porgera mine; and $45 million in unrealized foreign currency translation gains. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $942 million compared to $1.1 billion in the prior year period. On an unadjusted basis, EBITDA was $490 million for the third quarter compared to $1.0 billion in the prior year period. Operating cash flow was $1.26 billion compared to $852 million in the prior year period. Higher operating cash flow in the quarter reflects the impact of $610 million in proceeds from the Pueblo Viejo streaming transaction. OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS AND GUIDANCE Barrick's operations continued to perform in line with expectations for the year, meeting cost and production targets for the third quarter while generating stronger free cash flow. We have tightened our gold production guidance range for 2015, from 6.1-6.4 million ounces to 6.1-6.3 million ounces, reflecting lower anticipated gold production from Acacia Mining plc. All-in sustaining cost guidance for the year has been reduced to $830-$870 per ounce from the previous range of $840-$880 per ounce. Average all-in sustaining costs for our five core mines are now expected to be $700-$725 per ounce in 2015, down from$725-$775 per ounce at the start of this year. These mines are expected to account for about 75 percent of free cash flow from operations and 60-65 percent of production in 2015. Fourth quarter all-in sustaining costs are now expected to be similar to the third quarter while production is expected to be slightly higher, primarily driven by the impact of higher sustaining capital expenditures offset by higher production at Cortez, Pueblo Viejo, Lagunas Norte and Veladero. We expect significantly higher depreciation in the fourth quarter, primarily related to a drawdown in inventory stockpiles at Cortez, Lagunas Norte and Goldstrike and higher sales volumes at Pueblo Viejo. Total copper guidance for 2015 remains unchanged at 480-520 million pounds. Full-year C1 cash costs are now expected to be$1.60-$1.85 per pound5, down from $1.75-$2.00 per pound, driven by currency impacts and improved costs at Lumwana. Cortez The Cortez mine produced 321,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $501 per ounce in the third quarter. Production benefited from higher open pit tonnage and improved underground productivity through the implementation of short interval controls, an initiative identified as part of our Value Realization review for Cortez. Higher production, lower operating costs and lower sustaining capital drove improved all-in sustaining costs. Production in 2015 is now forecast to be 900,000-950,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $675-$725 per ounce. Fourth quarter production at Cortez is expected to be slightly higher than the third quarter, at higher costs. A prefeasibility study for expanded underground mining in an area known as Deep South below currently permitted levels will be completed in late 2015 and results are expected to be disclosed with the company's fourth quarter results. Our Value Realization review at Cortez also identified long-hole stoping as the preferred mining method for the deposit, as compared to the cut-and-fill method previously contemplated for the underground expansion, which could improve the economics of the project. Mineralization in this zone is primarily oxide and higher grade compared to the current underground mine, which is sulfide in nature. The limits of the Lower Zone have not yet been defined, and drilling has indicated the potential for new targets at depth. With a 382-square-mile land package, Cortez remains a highly prospective district for Barrick. Goldstrike The Goldstrike mine contributed 328,000 ounces in the third quarter in line with plan, while all-in sustaining costs of $558 per ounce were better than expected due to lower operating costs and lower sustaining capital. Our innovative thiosulfate (TCM) circuit achieved commercial production in the third quarter, coming in at a capital cost of $610 million. We expect to complete the ramp up of the TCM circuit in the first half of 2016. Goldstrike's production for 2015 is forecast to be 1.00-1.10 million ounces at improved all-in sustaining costs of $650-$700 per ounce. Fourth quarter production is expected to be similar to the third quarter, at slightly higher costs. Exploration at Goldstrike is focused on the underground mine where good potential exists at depth, and we plan to accelerate near-mine development in 2016. During the quarter, we began development of new areas below existing workings at Meikle and Rodeo in order to access deeper reserves which are expected to come into production at the end of 2016. This work will also open up new drilling platforms to better define future potential in these areas. Pueblo Viejo (60 percent) Barrick's 60 percent share of production from Pueblo Viejo for the third quarter was 172,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of$554 per ounce. Production was slightly below plan due to lower gold grades and recoveries from a higher proportion of carbonaceous ore. All-in sustaining costs were impacted by lower silver recoveries associated with a combination of scheduled autoclave maintenance in September, lime boil limitations and unscheduled maintenance on the limestone grinding circuit. Modifications to the lime boil are underway, including the addition of two lime boil tanks which will be operational in November. These additional tanks are expected to improve silver recoveries to the targeted 80 percent level from around 60 percent currently. We continue to forecast attributable production of 625,000-675,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $540-$590 per ounce in 2015. Production is expected to be higher and costs lower in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter on higher grades, improved recoveries and better autoclave availability. At the end of 2014, Pueblo Viejo had approximately six million ounces of gold and 37 million ounces of silver in the measured and indicated resource category (Barrick's 60 percent share)9. A significant portion of these resources are not currently included in reserves due to tailings storage constraints. We have completed a preliminary economic assessment on a plan to remove these constraints to tailings capacity, which if implemented could significantly extend the life of the mine. We expect to complete further engineering work and commission a prefeasibility study in the second half of 2016 to refine the technical and financial analysis for the increase in tailings storage capacity and to confirm whether the measured and indicated resources described above can be brought into reserves. Lagunas Norte The Lagunas Norte mine contributed 108,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $581 per ounce in the third quarter, in line with expectations. Production in 2015 is now anticipated to be 550,000-590,000 ounces at improved all-in sustaining costs of $550-$600 per ounce, with stronger production expected in the fourth quarter driven by improved performance at the Phase Five leach pad. Fourth quarter all-in sustaining costs are expected to be higher than the third quarter, reflecting the sale of higher cost inventory as well as increased sustaining capital for Phase Six leach pad construction. A pre-feasibility study on a plan to extend the mine life by up to 12 years by mining nearly two million ounces of sulfide ore below the existing open pit is on schedule for completion in 2015. Veladero The Veladero mine produced 143,000 ounces of gold in the third quarter at all-in sustaining costs of $914 per ounce. Production was below plan primarily due to lower grades in the Federico Phase Three pit and adverse weather events in August which impacted leach operations. All-in sustaining costs were higher than plan on lower gold ounces sold, timing of sustaining capital and lower silver credits. The addition of reagents to the leach circuit was temporarily halted in September following a valve failure on a pipe carrying processing solution, which led to a discharge to the environment through a diversion channel gate that was open at the time of the incident. Since the incident occurred, our first priority has been the safety of people and the environment. Water samples analyzed by independent third-parties, including the United Nations, have confirmed that there are no risks to the health of downstream communities as a result of this incident. Restrictions on leaching activities were lifted following implementation of additional monitoring and corrective actions. Production guidance for 2015 is unchanged at 575,000-625,000 ounces while all-in sustaining cost guidance has been narrowed to $950-$1,000 per ounce. Fourth quarter production is expected to be higher, at lower all-in sustaining costs driven by better grades, lower capital expenditures and higher silver and inventory credits. Turquoise Ridge (75 percent) The Turquoise Ridge mine contributed 55,000 ounces in the third quarter at all-in sustaining costs of $738 per ounce, in line with expectations. The mine is forecast to produce 175,000-200,000 ounces in 2015 at improved all-in sustaining costs of $750-$800per ounce. Detailed engineering and feasibility work on developing an additional shaft GoC which could bring forward more than one million ounces of production and roughly double output to an average of 500,000 ounces per year (100 percent basis) at all-in sustaining costs of about $625-$675 per ounce GoC is on track to be completed by the end of the year. Work to install additional ventilation capacity has also been initiated. Porgera (47.5 percent) The Porgera mine produced 134,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $986 per ounce, in line with plan. Attributable production in 2015 is now expected to be 400,000-450,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $1,025-$1,125 per ounce, reflecting Barrick's reduced interest following the sale of 50 percent of Barrick (Niugini) Ltd. to Zijin Mining. Recent drought conditions are not expected to have a material impact on production in 2015. We expect to increase our exploration budget at Porgera in 2016 to focus on underground targets which have been identified through a new geological model. Other Mines Barrick's other mines - consisting of Bald Mountain, 50 percent of Round Mountain, Golden Sunlight, Ruby Hill, Hemlo, Cowal, KCGM and Pierina - contributed 298,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $959 per ounce in the third quarter. A sale process is underway for Bald Mountain, Round Mountain, Ruby Hill, Golden Sunlight and the Spring Valley and Hilltop properties, with strong interest received to date. Acacia Mining (63.9 percent) Barrick's share of third quarter production was lower than expected at 104,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $1,195 per ounce due to temporary factors impacting output from Bulyanhulu and Buzwagi. We now expect attributable 2015 production from Acacia to be about 460,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of approximately $1,155 per ounce. Copper Copper production in the third quarter was 140 million pounds at C1 cash costs of $1.53 per pound. For 2015, copper production is anticipated to be 480-520 million pounds at lower C1 cash costs of $1.60-$1.85 per pound, reflecting currency impacts and improved costs at Lumwana. Lumwana contributed 77 million pounds at C1 cash costs of $1.59 per pound in the third quarter, in line with expectations. Power restrictions and potential reductions to smelter capacity in Zambia are not expected to have any material impact on Lumwana's 2015 production guidance. Production is now anticipated to be 260-280 million pounds at lower C1 cash costs of $1.80-$2.00per pound in 2015, reflecting higher grades. Production of 63 million pounds at Zaldivar at C1 cash costs of $1.47 per pound in the third quarter was in line with plan. At Jabal Sayid, first shipments of copper-in-concentrate continue to be anticipated in early 2016. Once the mine reaches full production, average production in the first full five years is expected to be 100 million pounds per year. TARGETING $2 BILLION IN CASH FLOW IMPROVEMENTS This year, we have taken significant actions to improve our business plans, resulting in positive free cash flow for two consecutive quarters. We remain focused on improving productivity and driving down costs to maximize free cash flow from our assets in any gold price environment. In support of this, we are targeting $2 billion in cash flow improvements across the company before the end of 2016, relative to our original internal plans for 2015 and 2016. These improvements are coming from productivity gains and cost reductions across operating expenses, capital spending and corporate overhead. While a majority of these actions will be incorporated into our 2016 plans, the initial outcomes are reflected in improvements to our 2015 guidance. Total capital expenditures for the year are expected to be 20 percent lower than 2014. Combined with reductions in corporate overhead and other operating cost savings, this has allowed us to reduce our 2015 all-in sustaining cost guidance by about $30 per ounce since the start of year, from our original range of $860-$895 per ounce to $830-$870 per ounce in the third quarter. We are now focused on optimizing our 2016 plans, with an emphasis on operating cost and productivity improvements. Our temporary suspension plan for Pascua-Lama has now been approved by the mining authority in Chile. This will enable us to complete the transition to care and maintenance, and should allow us to significantly reduce holding costs at the project in 2016. Implementation of the temporary suspension plan could require adjustments resulting from regulatory and legal actions and weather conditions, which could increase costs associated with the plan. CONVERTING RESOURCES TO RESERVES At the end of 2014, Barrick had 93 million ounces of proven and probable gold reserves and 94 million ounces of measured and indicated gold resources10. At 1.37 grams per tonne, our reserve grade is more than 50 percent higher than the senior peer average11. For more than 20 years, Barrick has maintained an average reserve mine life of between 10 to 20 years with a track record of replacing reserves and resources at our operations. Mine life and production rates at the majority of our mines have far surpassed initial estimates and we continue to identify excellent potential for resource conversion at many of our operations. Of our exploration budget, 65 percent is focused on opportunities at or near our existing operations. Drilling and feasibility study work to convert resources to reserves over the next five years at Cortez, Goldstrike, Lagunas Norte, Pueblo Viejo and Turquoise Ridge are progressing well. In addition, recent drilling at Hemlo and Porgera indicates strong potential for resource additions. We are also working to advance our Goldrush project in Nevada and drilling to define the limits of mineralization at the Alturas project inChile is expected to resume in the fourth quarter, following the South American winter. An illustration of the optionality that exists within our portfolio is the recent drill program at Hemlo. In the first quarter, Barrick completed the acquisition of surface and mineral rights adjacent to the Hemlo property in Ontario from subsidiaries of Newmont Mining. These claims included an area of geological potential adjacent to Barrick's existing underground workings. Barrick is currently undertaking an underground diamond drilling program in this area to evaluate its potential. To date, drilling has encountered a number of high grade intercepts with significant potential. These results highlight the ongoing potential of mineral deposits such as the Hemlo camp, even as they become mature operations. A detailed update on reserves and resources will be provided with the company's fourth quarter results in February 2016.

The company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law. Cameco Corporation (TSE: CCJ) Cameco is one of the world's largest uranium producers accounting for about 16% of the global production from its mines in Canada, the US and Kazakhstan. Our leading position is backed by about 429 million pounds of proven and probable reserves and extensive resources. Cameco reports fourth quarter and 2015 financial results delivered on annual guidance amid weak market conditions solid uranium segment results, record annual revenue and average realized price owing to a weaker Canadian dollar record annual uranium production on the back of strong results at Cigar Lake write-down of $210 million in the fourth quarter related to our Rabbit Lake operation Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada, February 5, 2016 Cameco (TSX: CCO; NYSE: CCJ) today reported its consolidated financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2015 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). \"In 2015, the company continued to perform well, in the context of the global challenges our industry faces,\" said president and CEO, Tim Gitzel. \"But despite the challenges, we continued to concentrate on the aspects of our business that are within our control, which has led us to once again deliver on, and in some cases exceed, our annual guidance. \"We are still waiting on a market recovery that was expected to come sooner, but we've learned to put those expectations aside and prepare for whatever comes our way. Looking ahead, our strategy is to continue focusing our capital on tier-one assets, because it's those world-class, low-cost mines that will position us to quickly respond when the market calls for more production. And we believe that the question is not 'if' the market will make that call, but 'when', as we continue to see a bright long-term outlook for the nuclear industry.\" FULL YEAR Our net earnings attributable to equity holders (net earnings) in 2015 were $65 million ($0.16 per share diluted) compared to $185 million ($0.47 per share diluted) in 2014, mainly due to: greater losses on foreign exchange derivatives due to the weakening of the Canadian dollar lower tax recoveries, primarily due to the write-off of our deferred tax asset in the US Partially offset by: lower impairment charges ($215 million in 2015; $327 million in 2014) higher earnings in our uranium and fuel services segments due to higher average realized prices higher earnings in our NUKEM segment as a result of higher volumes and average realized price reduction of the provision related to our Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) litigation In addition, in 2014 there were a number of one-time items that contributed to the higher net earnings in 2014 compared to 2015, including: the sale of our interest in Bruce Power Limited Partnership (BPLP) resulting in a $127 million gain in 2014 a favourable settlement of $66 million in 2014 with respect to a dispute regarding a long-term supply contract with a utility customer Partially offset by: payment of an early agreement termination fee of $18 million as a result of the cancellation of our toll conversion agreement with Springfields Fuels Limited (SFL), and $12 million for settlement costs with respect to early redemption of our Series C debentures in 2014 the write-off of $41 million of assets under construction in 2014 as a result of changes made to the scope of a number of projects On an adjusted basis, our earnings were $344 million ($0.87 per share diluted) (non-IFRS measure, see page 8) in 2015 compared to $412 million ($1.04 per share diluted) in 2014. The 17% decrease from 2014 to 2015 resulted from: greater losses on foreign exchange derivatives due to the weakening of the Canadian dollar lower tax recoveries, primarily due to the write-off of our deferred tax asset in the US partially offset by: higher earnings in our uranium and fuel services segments mainly due to a higher average realized price higher earnings from our NUKEM segment mainly due to higher sales volumes and a higher average realized price a reduction of the provision related to our CRA litigation In addition, in 2014 there was a favourable settlement of $66 million with respect to a dispute regarding a long-term supply contract with a utility customer that contributed to the higher adjusted net earnings in 2014 compared to 2015. The impact of the settlement was partially offset by an early termination fee of $18 million incurred as a result of the cancellation of our toll conversion agreement with SFL and settlement costs of $12 million with respect to the early redemption of our Series C debentures in 2014. FOURTH QUARTER In the fourth quarter of 2015, our net loss was $10 million ($(0.03) per share diluted), a decrease of $83 million compared to net earnings of $73 million ($0.18 per share diluted) in 2014, mainly due to: greater losses on foreign exchange derivatives resulting from the weakening of the Canadian dollar lower income tax recovery due to the reduction of our deferred tax asset in the US higher impairment charges in 2015 ($210 million in 2015, $131 million in 2014) Partially offset by: higher uranium gross profits resulting mainly from a higher average realized price and higher sales volumes higher gross profits from our fuel services segment due to a higher average realized price lower exploration expenditures the reduction of our provision related to the CRA litigation In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2014 there was a favourable settlement of $37 million with respect to a dispute regarding a long-term supply contract with a utility customer that contributed to the higher net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to the same period in 2015. The impact of the settlement was partially offset by the write-off of $41 million of assets under construction as a result of changes made to the scope of a number of projects in the fourth quarter of 2014. On an adjusted basis, our earnings this quarter were $151 million ($0.38 per share diluted) compared to $205 million ($0.52 per share diluted) (non-IFRS measure, see page 8) in 2014, mainly due to: a lower income tax recovery primarily due to the reduction of our deferred tax asset in the US partially offset by: higher uranium gross profits resulting mainly from a higher average realized price and higher sales volumes higher gross profits from our fuel services segment mainly due to a higher average realized price lower exploration expenditures the reduction of our provision related to the CRA litigation In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2014 there was a favourable settlement of $37 million with respect to a dispute regarding a long-term supply contract with a utility customer that contributed to the higher adjusted net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to the same period in 2015. Impairment charge on producing assets During the fourth quarter of 2015, we recognized a $210 million impairment charge related to our Rabbit Lake operation. The impairment was due to increased uncertainty around future production sources for the Rabbit Lake mill as a result of the ongoing economic conditions. The amount of the charge was determined as the excess of carrying value over the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of the mill was determined to be $69 million. See note 9 to the financial statements. 2015 market developments As has been the case in recent years, a lot happened over the course of 2015, although the general state of the market did not see much change. Making positive news for nuclear, as usual, was China. Not only did the country continue with its rapid reactor new build program and bring eight reactors online, but Chinese companies also signed agreements with Argentina, Romania and the UK for new reactors, illustrating the country's commitment to nuclear and its intent to become a major international player in the nuclear industry. Undoubtedly, the biggest headline of 2015 was the long-awaited first reactor restarts in Japan. Sendai units 1 and 2 were the first reactors in Japan to restart since 2013, and it is hoped they are the first of many to come. New builds in the UK and US continued to be bright spots for the industry, in addition to a number of reactor life extensions approved in Japan, and the US, with utilities now considering additional extensions that could see reactor lives reaching 80 years. However, these positive developments could not outweigh the more powerful influence of a continued sluggish global economy, geopolitical issues, concerns around growth in China, and flat electricity demand. These more general drivers had help from industry specific factors as well, such as slower new reactor construction, eight reactor shutdowns, the continued high level of inventories held by market participants, and France's policy to reduce nuclear in their energy mix to 50% by 2025 becoming law. In addition, supply performed relatively well, with only minor disruptions and one curtailment, unlike 2014, which saw six projects tempered or curtailed. The end result was a market seemingly indifferent to the commotion of events that occurred throughout the year. CONTRACTING Market contracting activity was modest. Spot volumes were normal, but long-term contracting was well below historical averages and current consumption levels--about half of current annual reactor consumption estimates, similar to 2014. Long- term contracting is a key factor in the timing of market recovery, and its pace will depend on the respective coverage levels, market views and risk appetite of both buyers and sellers. JAPAN The big news in Japan was the restart of Sendai units 1 and 2, which occurred in August and October. In addition, the court injunction against the two Takahama units was overturned in December, 2015, clearing the way for Takahama unit 3 to restart on January 29, 2016, with unit 4 expected to restart later in the first quarter. Ikata unit 3 has also cleared a safety inspection by the Nuclear Regulatory Authority, and four more units are in the final stages of approval. In all, three reactors are now in operation, while 23 remain under evaluation for restart. Over the long term, Japan's energy policy states that nuclear will make up 20 to 22% of the energy mix in the country. The billions of dollars in investment being made by Japan's utilities suggest a high degree of confidence in reactors coming back online and meeting this target; however, public sentiment towards nuclear in Japan remains somewhat uncertain. OTHER REGIONS China's remarkable nuclear growth program remains on track and the UK's plans for new reactor construction continue to move forward. India and South Korea are also among several key regions growing their nuclear generation fleet. In 2015, growth was tangible as 10 reactors came online--double that of 2014. These included the eight noted in China, one in Russia and one in South Korea. And seven more reactors began construction--six in China and one in the UAE, a formerly non-nuclear country with four reactors now under construction. But, to round out the picture, eight units shut down. Five of these were in Japan, plus one in Sweden, one in Germany as part of its phase-out plans, and one in the UK--the last Magnox reactor operating in the world. In addition, there were announcements for future shutdowns in the US, where nuclear struggles to remain competitive in deregulated electricity markets and in the context of low natural gas prices. One event that could have an effect on the future of nuclear in the US and other western countries is the UN Climate Conference COP-21 agreement, finalized in 2015. As a non-GHG emitter, nuclear could play a significant role in achieving climate change prevention goals. Outlook for 2016 Our strategy is to focus on our tier-one assets and profitably produce at a pace aligned with market signals, while maintaining the ability to respond to conditions as they evolve. Our outlook for 2016 reflects the expenditures necessary to help us achieve our strategy. We do not provide an outlook for the items in the table that are marked with a dash. See 2015 Financial results by segment on page 12 for details. 2016 FINANCIAL OUTLOOK We expect consolidated revenue to decrease up to 5% in 2016, based on currently committed sales volumes, due to a planned decrease in uranium and fuel services sales volumes. If we make additional sales with deliveries in 2016, we would expect our revenue outlook to increase. We expect administration costs (not including stock-based compensation) to be 5% to 10% higher compared to 2015 due to increased costs related to the northern collaboration agreements and increased project work. In 2016, we are continuing to negotiate new collaboration agreements with northern communities, which could result in additional one-time payments. Due to the uncertainty of the timing for the potential signing of agreements, the cost is not included in our outlook. If agreements are signed and there is an impact on our administrative costs, we will update our outlook. We expect exploration expenses to be about 15% to 20% higher than they were in 2015 due to increased exploration activity at Cigar Lake. On an adjusted net earnings basis, we expect a tax recovery of 25% to 30% in 2016 from our uranium, fuel services and NUKEM segments. Our consolidated tax rate is a blend of the statutory rates applicable to taxable income earned or tax losses incurred in Canada and in our foreign subsidiaries. We have a global customer base and we have established a marketing and trading structure involving foreign subsidiaries, which entered into various intercompany purchase and sale arrangements, as well as uranium purchase and sale agreements with third parties. Cameco and its subsidiaries made reasonable efforts to put arm's-length transfer pricing arrangements in place, and these arrangements expose the parties to the risks and rewards accruing to them under these contracts. The intercompany contract prices are generally comparable to those established in comparable contracts between arm's-length parties entered into at that time. This year, many of the existing intercompany purchase and sale arrangements in our portfolio expire. We have started to replace these contracts and will continue to put new intercompany arrangements in place, which, as the existing arrangements did, will reflect the market at the time they are signed. As a result, in 2017, we expect our consolidated tax rate will transition to a modest expense, and trend toward a tax expense of approximately 20% over the next five years. The actual effective tax rate will vary from year-to-year, primarily due to the actual distribution of earnings among jurisdictions and the market conditions at the time transactions occur under both our intercompany and third-party purchase and sale arrangements. ROYALTIES We pay royalties on the sale of all uranium extracted at our mines in the province of Saskatchewan. Two types of royalties are paid: Basic royalty: calculated as 5% of gross sales of uranium, less the Saskatchewan resource credit of 0.75%. Profit royalty: a 10% royalty is charged on profit up to and including $22.70/kg U3O8 ($10.30/lb) and a 15% royalty is charged on profit in excess of $22.70/kg U3O8. Profit is determined as revenue less certain operating, exploration, reclamation and capital costs. Both exploration and capital costs are deductible at the discretion of the producer. As a resource corporation in Saskatchewan, we also pay a corporate resource surcharge of 3% of the value of resource sales. During the period from 2013 to 2015, transitional rules for the new profit royalty regime were applied whereby only 50% of capital costs were deductible. The remaining 50% was accumulated and will now be deductible beginning in 2016. In addition, the capital allowance related to Cigar Lake under the previous system was grandfathered and is also now deductible beginning in 2016. Based on the expected application of transitional and grandfathered capital allowance deductions, we anticipate that only the first tier of the profit royalty (10%) will apply in 2016 and 2017. As capital pools are depleted, we expect to also be subject to the top tier of the profit royalty (15%) in 2018. CAPITAL SPENDING We classify capital spending as sustaining, capacity replacement or growth. As a mining company, sustaining capital is the money we spend to keep our facilities running in their present state, which would follow a gradually decreasing production curve, while capacity replacement capital is spent to maintain current production levels at those operations. Growth capital is money we invest to generate incremental production, and for business development. Outlook for investing activities We expect total capital expenditures for uranium and fuel services to decrease by about 11% in 2016. Major sustaining, capacity replacement and growth expenditures in 2016 include: McArthur River/Key Lake - At McArthur River, the largest projects are the expansion of freeze capacity and mine development. Other projects include site facility and equipment purchases. At Key Lake, work will be done to expand capacity in the solvent extraction and crystallization circuits of the mill. US in situ recovery (ISR) - wellfield construction represents the largest portion of our expenditures in the US. Rabbit Lake - At Eagle Point, the largest component is mine development, along with mine equipment upgrades and purchases. At the mill, we plan to optimize tailings capacity and work on various mill facility and equipment replacements. Cigar Lake - Work to expand freezing capacity makes up the largest portion of capital at the Cigar Lake site. We are also paying our share of the costs to modify and expand the McClean Lake mill. We previously expected to spend between $350 million and $400 million in 2017. We now expect to spend between $300 million and $350 million in 2017. Due to the continued market uncertainty, we have reduced growth capital to focus on our tierone properties. This information regarding currently expected capital expenditures for future periods is forward-looking information, and is based upon the assumptions and subject to the material risks discussed on pages 21 and 22. Our actual capital expenditures for future periods may be significantly different. REVENUE, CASH FLOW AND EARNINGS SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS For 2016: An increase of $5 (US) per pound in each of the Ux spot price ($34.65 (US) per pound on February 1, 2016) and the Ux long-term price indicator ($44.00 (US) per pound on January 25, 2016) would change revenue by $72 million and net earnings by $56 million. Conversely, a decrease of $5 (US) per pound would decrease revenue by $69 million and net earnings by $54 million. A one cent change in the value of the Canadian dollar versus the US dollar would change adjusted net earnings by $8 million and cash flow by $1 million, with a decrease in the value of the Canadian dollar versus the US dollar having a positive impact. URANIUM SEGMENT OUTLOOK We expect to produce 30.0 million pounds in 2016 and have commitments under long-term contracts to purchase approximately 9 million pounds. Based on the contracts we have in place, and not including sales between our segments, we expect to deliver between 30 million and 32 million pounds of U3O8 in 2016. We expect the unit cost of sales to be up to 5% higher than in 2015, primarily due to the planned purchases during the year. If we make additional discretionary purchases in 2016 at a cost different than our other sources of supply, then we expect the overall unit cost of sales to be affected. We expect revenue to be up to 5% lower than in 2015 as a result of an expected decrease in deliveries, not including sales between our segments, partially offset by a higher average realized price. In our uranium and fuel services segments, our customers choose when in the year to receive deliveries. As a result, our quarterly delivery patterns and, therefore, our sales volumes and revenue can vary significantly as shown below. We expect the quarterly distribution of uranium deliveries in 2016 to be weighted to the second half of the year. However, not all delivery notices have been received to date and the expected delivery pattern could change. Typically, we receive notices six months in advance of the requested delivery date. PRICE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: URANIUM SEGMENT The following table is not a forecast of prices we expect to receive. The prices we actually realize will be different from the prices shown in the table. It is designed to indicate how the portfolio of long-term contracts we had in place on December 31, 2015 would respond to different spot prices. In other words, we would realize these prices only if the contract portfolio remained the same as it was on December 31, 2015, and none of the assumptions we list below change. We intend to update this table each quarter in our MD&A to reflect deliveries made and changes to our contract portfolio. As a result, we expect the table to change from quarter to quarter. FUEL SERVICES OUTLOOK In 2016, we plan to produce 8 million to 9 million kgU, and we expect sales volumes, not including intersegment sales, to be up to 5% lower than in 2015. Overall revenue is expected to increase by up to 5% as lower sales volumes will be more than offset by an increase in the average realized price. We expect the average unit cost of sales (including D&A) to increase by 10% to 15%; therefore, overall gross profit will decrease as a result. NUKEM OUTLOOK For 2016, NUKEM expects to deliver between 9 million and 10 million pounds of uranium. Total revenue and unit cost of sales, not including intersegment sales, is expected to increase by 5% to 10% compared to 2015; however, the overall gross profit percentage is expected to be slightly lower than 2015 at 4% to 5%. Non-IFRS measures ADJUSTED NET EARNINGS Adjusted net earnings are a measure that does not have a standardized meaning or a consistent basis of calculation under IFRS (non-IFRS measure). We use this measure as a more meaningful way to compare our financial performance from period to period. We believe that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, certain investors use this information to evaluate our performance. Adjusted net earnings are our net earnings attributable to equity holders, adjusted to better reflect the underlying financial performance for the reporting period. The adjusted earnings measure reflects the matching of the net benefits of our hedging program with the inflows of foreign currencies in the applicable reporting period, and adjusted for impairment charges, the write-off of assets, NUKEM inventory write-down, gain on interest in BPLP (after tax), and income taxes on adjustments. Adjusted net earnings are non-standard supplemental information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information prepared according to accounting standards. Other companies may calculate this measure differently, so you may not be able to make a direct comparison to similar measures presented by other companies. To facilitate a better understanding of these measures, the table below reconciles adjusted net earnings with our net earnings for the years ended 2015 and 2014, and three months ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. TRANSFER PRICING DISPUTES We have been reporting on our transfer pricing disputes with CRA since 2008, when it originated, and with the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) since the first quarter of 2015. Below, we discuss the general nature of transfer pricing disputes and, more specifically, the ongoing disputes we have. Transfer pricing is a complex area of tax law, and it is difficult to predict the outcome of cases like ours. However, tax authorities generally test two things: the governance (structure) of the corporate entities involved in the transactions the price at which goods and services are sold by one member of a corporate group to another We have a global customer base and we established a marketing and trading structure involving foreign subsidiaries, including Cameco Europe Limited (CEL), which entered into various intercompany arrangements, including purchase and sale agreements, as well as uranium purchase and sale agreements with third parties. Cameco and its subsidiaries made reasonable efforts to put arm's-length transfer pricing arrangements in place, and these arrangements expose the parties to the risks and rewards accruing to them under these contracts. The intercompany contract prices are generally comparable to those established in comparable contracts between arm's-length parties entered into at that time. For the years 2003 to 2010, CRA has shifted CEL's income (as recalculated by CRA) back to Canada and applied statutory tax rates, interest and instalment penalties, and, from 2007 to 2009, transfer pricing penalties. There has not yet been a decision regarding a transfer pricing penalty for 2010. The IRS also allocated a portion of CEL's income for the years 2009 through 2012 to the US, resulting in such income being taxed in multiple jurisdictions. Taxes of approximately $320 million for the 2003 - 2015 years have already been paid in a jurisdiction outside Canada and the US. Bilateral international tax treaties contain provisions that generally seek to prevent taxation of the same income in both countries. As such, in connection with these disputes, we are considering our options, including remedies under international tax treaties that would limit double taxation; however, there is a risk that we will not be successful in eliminating all potential double taxation. The expected income adjustments under our tax disputes are represented by the amounts claimed by CRA and IRS and are described below. CRA dispute Since 2008, CRA has disputed our corporate structure and the related transfer pricing methodology we used for certain intercompany uranium sale and purchase agreements. To the end of 2014, we received notices of reassessment for our 2003 through 2009 tax returns, and, in the fourth quarter of 2015, we received a notice of reassessment for our 2010 tax year. We have recorded a cumulative tax provision of $50 million (September 30, 2015 - $92 million), where an argument could be made that our transfer price may have fallen outside of an appropriate range of pricing in uranium contracts for the period from 2003 through 2015. We have reduced the provision to reflect management's revised estimate, which takes into account additional contract information. We are confident that we will be successful in our case and continue to believe the ultimate resolution of this matter will not be material to our financial position, results of operations and cash flows in the year(s) of resolution. For the years 2003 through 2010, CRA issued notices of reassessment for approximately $3.4 billion of additional income for Canadian tax purposes, which would result in a related tax expense of about $1.1 billion. CRA has also issued notices of reassessment for transfer pricing penalties for the years 2007 through 2009 in the amount of $229 million. The Canadian income tax rules include provisions that require larger companies like us to remit or otherwise secure 50% of the cash tax plus related interest and penalties at the time of reassessment. To date, under these provisions, after applying elective deductions, we have paid a net amount of $232 million cash. In addition, we have provided $332 million in letters of credit (LC) to secure 50% of the cash taxes and related interest amounts reassessed in 2015. Using the methodology we believe CRA will continue to apply, and including the $3.4 billion already reassessed, we expect to receive notices of reassessment for a total of approximately $7.0 billion of additional income taxable in Canada for the years 2003 through 2015, which would result in a related tax expense of approximately $2.1 billion. As well, CRA may continue to apply transfer pricing penalties to taxation years subsequent to 2009. As a result, we estimate that cash taxes and transfer pricing penalties for these years would be between $1.65 billion and $1.70 billion. In addition, we estimate there would be interest and instalment penalties applied that would be material to us. While in dispute, we would be responsible for remitting or otherwise providing security for 50% of the cash taxes and transfer pricing penalties (between $825 million and $850 million), plus related interest and instalment penalties assessed, which would be material to us. Under the Canadian federal and provincial tax rules, the amount required to be paid or secured each year will depend on the amount of income reassessed in that year and the availability of elective deductions and tax loss carryovers. Recently, the CRA decided to disallow the use of any loss carry-backs for any transfer pricing adjustment, starting with the 2008 tax year. This does not impact the anticipated income tax expense for a particular year, but does impact the timing of any required security or payment. As noted above, for the 2010 tax year, as an alternative to paying cash, we used letters of credit to satisfy our obligations related to the reassessed income tax and related interest amounts. We expect to be able to continue to provide security in the form of letters of credit to satisfy these requirements. The estimated amounts summarized in the table below reflect actual amounts paid or secured and estimated future amounts owing based on the actual and expected reassessments for the years 2003 through 2015, and include the expected timing adjustment for the inability to use any loss carry-backs starting in 2008. We will update this table annually to include the estimated impact of reassessments expected for completed years subsequent to 2015. In light of our view of the likely outcome of the case as described above, we expect to recover the amounts remitted, including the $564 million already paid or otherwise secured to date. We are expecting the trial for the 2003, 2005 and 2006 reassessments to commence during the week of September 26, 2016, with final arguments in April 2017. If this timing is adhered to, we expect to receive a Tax Court decision within six to 18 months after the trial is complete. IRS dispute In the fourth quarter of 2015, we received a Revenue Agents Report (RAR) from the IRS for the tax years 2010 to 2012. Similar to the 2009 RAR received in the first quarter of 2015, the IRS is challenging the transfer pricing used under certain intercompany transactions pertaining to the 2010 to 2012 tax years for certain of our US subsidiaries. The 2009 and 2010 to 2012 RARs list the adjustments proposed by the IRS and calculate the tax and any penalties owing based on the proposed adjustments. The current position of the IRS is that a portion of the non-US income reported under our corporate structure and taxed in nonUS jurisdictions should be recognized and taxed in the US on the basis that: the prices received by our US mining subsidiaries for the sale of uranium to CEL are too low the compensation earned by Cameco Inc., one of our US subsidiaries, is inadequate The proposed adjustments result in an increase in taxable income in the US of approximately $419 million (US) and a corresponding increased income tax expense of approximately $122 million (US) for the 2009 through 2012 taxation years, with interest being charged thereon. In addition, the IRS proposed cumulative penalties of approximately $8 million (US) in respect of the adjustment. We believe that the conclusions of the IRS in the RARs are incorrect and we are contesting them in an administrative appeal, during which we are not required to make any cash payments. Until this matter progresses further, we cannot provide an estimation of the likely timeline for a resolution of the dispute. We believe that the ultimate resolution of this matter will not be material to our financial position, results of operations and cash flows in the year(s) of resolution. Caution about forward-looking information relating to our CRA and IRS tax dispute This discussion of our expectations relating to our tax disputes with CRA and IRS and future tax reassessments by CRA and IRS is forwardlooking information that is based upon the assumptions and subject to the material risks discussed under the heading Caution about forwardlooking information beginning on page 21 and also on the more specific assumptions and risks listed below. Actual outcomes may vary significantly. Assumptions CRA will reassess us for the years 2011 through 2015 using a similar methodology as for the years 2003 through 2010, and the reassessments will be issued on the basis we expect we will be able to apply elective deductions and utilize letters of credit to the extent anticipated CRA will seek to impose transfer pricing penalties (in a manner consistent with penalties charged in the years 2007 through 2009) in addition to interest charges and instalment penalties we will be substantially successful in our dispute with CRA and the cumulative tax provision of $50 million to date will be adequate to satisfy any tax liability resulting from the outcome of the dispute to date IRS may propose adjustments for later years subsequent to 2012 we will be substantially successful in our dispute with IRS Material risks that could cause actual results to differ materially CRA reassesses us for years 2011 through 2015 using a different methodology than for years 2003 through 2010, or we are unable to utilize elective deductions or letters of credit to the extent anticipated, resulting in the required cash payments or security provided to CRA pending the outcome of the dispute being higher than expected the time lag for the reassessments for each year is different than we currently expect we are unsuccessful and the outcomes of our dispute with CRA and/or IRS result in significantly higher cash taxes, interest charges and penalties than the amount of our cumulative tax provision, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial position, results of operations and cash flows cash tax payable increases due to unanticipated adjustments by CRA or IRS not related to transfer pricing IRS proposes adjustments for years 2013 through 2015 using a different methodology than for 2009 through 2012 we are unable to effectively eliminate all double taxation FOURTH QUARTER Production volumes this quarter were 17% higher compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, mainly as a result of higher production from the rampup of Cigar Lake production, offset by lower production at McArthur River/Key Lake, Rabbit Lake and our US ISR operations. See Our operations starting on page 15 for more information. Uranium revenues were up 13% due to a 5% increase in sales volumes, which represents normal quarterly variance in our delivery schedule, and an 8% increase in the average realized price. Average spot and long-term prices decreased, as did our US dollar average realized price due to lower prices under fixedprice contracts, and the mix of market and fixed contracts. However, the effect of foreign exchange resulted in an 8% higher Canadian dollar average realized price than the prior year. In the fourth quarter of 2015, our realized foreign exchange rate was $1.32 compared to $1.12 in the prior year. Total cost of sales (including D&A) increased by 17% ($429 million compared to $366 million in 2014). This was the result of a 12% increase in the average unit cost of sales and a 5% increase in sales volumes. The unit cost of sales increased due to an increase in the volume of material purchased throughout the year at prices higher than our average cost of inventory and an increase in the unit production costs related to the addition of higher cost production from Cigar Lake during rampup. The net effect was a $17 million increase in gross profit for the quarter. FULL YEAR Production volumes in 2015 increased by 22% compared to 2014. Lower production at our US ISR operations was more than offset by the rampup of Cigar Lake production. See Our operations starting on page 15 for more information. Uranium revenues this year were up 5% compared to 2014 due to an increase of 10% in the Canadian dollar average realized price, partially offset by a decrease in sales volumes of 4%. The spot price for uranium averaged $36.55 (US) per pound in 2015, an increase of 10% compared to the 2014 average price of $33.21 (US) per pound; however, our US dollar average realized price was lower mainly due to lower prices under fixed price contracts. The effect of foreign exchange resulted in a higher Canadian dollar average realized price than in the prior year. The realized foreign exchange rate was $1.27 compared to $1.10 in 2014. Total cost of sales (including D&A) increased by 7% ($1.26 billion compared to $1.18 billion in 2014) due to higher unit cost of sales offset by lower sales volumes. The higher unit cost of sales was mainly the result of an increase in the volume of material purchased at prices higher than our average cost of inventory, and an increase in unit production costs related to the addition of higher costs from Cigar Lake during rampup. The net effect was a $6 million increase in gross profit for the year. The following table shows the costs of produced and purchased uranium incurred in the reporting periods (non-IFRS measures see below). These costs do not include selling costs such as royalties, transportation and commissions, nor do they reflect the impact of opening inventories on our reported cost of sales. Cash cost per pound, non-cash cost per pound and total cost per pound for produced and purchased uranium presented in the above table are non-IFRS measures. These measures do not have a standardized meaning or a consistent basis of calculation under IFRS. We use these measures in our assessment of the performance of our uranium business. We believe that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, certain investors use this information to evaluate our performance and ability to generate cash flow. These measures are non-standard supplemental information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared according to accounting standards. These measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under IFRS. Other companies may calculate these measures differently, so you may not be able to make a direct comparison to similar measures presented by other companies. To facilitate a better understanding of these measures, the following table presents a reconciliation of these measures to our unit cost of sales for the years ended 2015 and 2014 and three months ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 as reported in our financial statements. FOURTH QUARTER Total revenue decreased by 21% due to a 39% decrease in sales volumes, partially offset by a 29% increase in average realized price. The total cost of sales (including D&A) decreased by 28% ($78 million compared to $109 million in the fourth quarter of 2014) mainly due to a 39% decrease in sales volumes, partially offset by an increase of 16% in the average unit cost of sales, primarily as a result of the mix of products sold. The net effect was a $5 million increase in gross profit. FULL YEAR Total revenue increased by 4% due to a 19% increase in the realized price, partially offset by a 12% decrease in sales volumes. The total cost of products and services sold (including D&A) decreased by 4% compared to 2014 ($258 million compared to $268 million in 2014), as a 12% decrease in sales volumes was partially offset by a 9% increase in the average unit cost of sales (including D&A). When compared to 2014, the average unit cost of sales was 9% higher due to the mix of fuel services products sold. The net effect was a $23 million increase in gross profit. FOURTH QUARTER NUKEM delivered 3.7 million pounds of uranium, an increase of 0.3 million pounds compared to 2014. NUKEM revenues amounted to $192 million compared to $159 million in 2014 due to an increase in volumes delivered. Gross profit percentage was 3% in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to 2% in the fourth quarter of 2014. The net effect was a $3 million increase in gross profit. FULL YEAR During 2015, NUKEM delivered 10.7 million pounds of uranium, an increase of 2.6 million pounds compared to the previous year due to an increase in market activity. Revenues from NUKEM amounted to $554 million, 59% higher than in 2014 as a result of higher sales volumes and an increase in the average realized price, mainly due to weakening of the Canadian dollar. Gross profit percentage was 8% for 2015, compared to 6% for 2014. The net effect was a $20 million increase in gross profit. Production Outlook We remain focused on taking advantage of the long-term growth we see coming in our industry, while maintaining the ability to respond to market conditions as they evolve. Our strategy is to focus on our tier-one assets and profitably produce at a pace aligned with market signals in order to increase long-term shareholder value. We plan to: ensure continued safe, reliable, low-cost production from our tier-one assets - McArthur River/Key Lake, Cigar Lake and Inkai complete rampup of production at Cigar Lake seek to expand production at McArthur River/Key Lake in conjunction with market signals manage the rest of our sources of supply in a manner that retains the flexibility to respond to market signals and take advantage of value adding opportunities within our own portfolio and the uranium market maintain our low-cost advantage by focusing on execution and operational excellence MCARTHUR RIVER/KEY LAKE Production Production from McArthur River/Key Lake was 19.1 million pounds; our share was 13.3 million pounds. This was 3% lower than our forecast for the year due to unplanned maintenance outages to repair the calciner at Key Lake. Annual production was unchanged from 2014. Licensing and production capacity In 2015, the CNSC approved our application to increase McArthur River's licensed annual production to 25 million pounds (100% basis) to allow flexibility to match the approved Key Lake mill capacity. The licence conditions handbooks for these operations now allow both operations to produce up to 25 million pounds (100% basis) per year. Key Lake extension and McArthur River production expansion In support of our strategy to maintain the flexibility to respond to market conditions as they evolve, we continue to advance projects that are necessary to sustain and increase production when the market signals that additional production is needed. The Key Lake mill began operating in 1983 and we continue to upgrade circuits with new technology to simplify operations and improve environmental performance. The extension project involved increasing our tailings capacity and the mill's nominal annual production rate to closely follow production from the McArthur River mine. As part of the mill upgrades, we continue to construct and commission a new calciner circuit, and expect to begin operating with the new calciner in 2016. The existing calciner circuit will remain in place until operational reliability of the new calciner is achieved. The calciner replacement project was planned in a way that temporarily allows us to use either calciner, which will help to mitigate risks to our production rate during the commissioning phase. In order to increase production at Key Lake, we also need to optimize and expand the solvent extraction and crystallization circuits in the mill (projects planned for 2017). At McArthur River, we must continue to successfully transition into new mine areas through mine development and investment in support infrastructure. We plan to: improve our dewatering system and expand our water treatment capacity as required to mitigate capacity losses, should mine development increase background water volumes expand the concrete distribution systems and batch plant capacity New mining areas New mining zones and increased mine production requires increased freeze capacity and ventilation. In 2015, we continued to upgrade our electrical infrastructure on surface as part of our plan to address these future needs. We advanced groundworks to prepare for the next freeze plant, which is scheduled to begin freezing the south end of the orebody (zone 4) in 2017. We also made changes in shaft 2 to increase air flow, resulting in a 15% to 20% improvement in ventilation capacity. The improved ventilation eliminates the need for a new ventilation shaft to support a higher production rate. Tailings capacity We expect to have sufficient tailings capacity to mill all the known McArthur River mineral reserves and resources, should they be converted to reserves, with additional capacity to toll mill ore from other regional deposits. PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE AT MCARTHUR RIVER/KEY LAKE Production We plan to produce 20.0 million pounds in 2016; our share is 14.0 million pounds. Expansion progress As previously disclosed in our 2012 Technical Report, we plan to reach an annual capacity of 22 million pounds by 2018. The capital required to do so is shown in our 2016 capital spending plan, and in our outlook for investing activities in 2017 and 2018, beginning on page 6. As we increase to 22 million pounds per year, we will optimize the capacity of both the Key Lake mill and McArthur River mine with a view to further increasing production to 25 million pounds per year (100% basis), as market conditions improve. Using this approach, we do not expect significant additional growth capital will be required to increase from annual production of 22 million pounds to an annual rate of 25 million pounds. We expect that this paced approach will allow us to extract maximum value from the operation as the market transitions. Exploration In 2015, underground drilling further delineated the zone A mineral resources. Underground definition drilling of zone B will be conducted in 2016 and 2017 to provide the information required for engineering work to develop more detailed mining plans. CIGAR LAKE Production Total packaged production from Cigar Lake was 11.3 million pounds U3O8; our share was 5.7 million pounds. The operation exceeded our forecast of 10 million pounds (100% basis) as a result of higher productivity and our intention to adjust annual production as necessary, based on our operating experience during rampup. During the year, we: completed commissioning of the equipment required to operate three JBS units at a production scale brought on additional slurry haul trucks to ensure a sufficient quantity of ore slurry can be transported to the McClean Lake mill completed final commissioning of underground processing circuits and updated our production rampup plan based on commissioning experience modified mine and project plans to reflect our decision to exclusively freeze from surface declared commercial production Commercial production Commercial production signals a transition in the accounting treatment for costs incurred at the mine. Cigar Lake met all of the criteria for commercial production, including cycle time and process specifications, in the second quarter of 2015. Therefore, effective May 1, 2015, we began charging all production costs, including depreciation, to inventory and subsequently recognizing them in cost of sales as the product is sold. Underground development As a result of our decision to exclusively use surface freezing going forward, and the resulting change in the mine plan, the bulk of the development and freeze drilling required for mining in 2016 is already complete. We are continuing to plan for future expansion of surface freezing infrastructure in late 2016. McClean Lake mill update Additional estimated expenditures of $50 million (100% basis, our share $25 million) are expected to be required at the McClean Lake mill in 2016, primarily to complete upgrades in the tailings neutralization area in support of the continued rampup to full production of 18 million pounds per year. PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE AT CIGAR LAKE Production In 2016, we expect to produce 16.0 million packaged pounds at Cigar Lake; our share is 8.0 million pounds. In 2016, we also expect to: extend the current surface freeze pad and advance planning for freeze plant infrastructure expansion to support future production advance underground development according to the new mine plan and backfill drifts no longer required for underground freezing operations continue ramping up towards the planned full annual production rate of 18 million pounds (100% basis) in 2017 Exploration We are planning to conduct delineation drilling from surface to confirm and upgrade resources contained in the western portion of the deposit. Approximately 65,000 metres of diamond drilling is planned over a three-year period, starting in 2016, in order to complete a detailed geological and geotechnical interpretation, a resource estimate, and a technical study for the western portion of the deposit. Rampup schedule In 2017, we expect to reach full annual production of 18 million pounds (100% basis, 9 million pounds our share). The McClean Lake mill's operating licence currently has an annual production limit of 13 million pounds. AREVA has submitted an application to the CNSC to increase the mill's licensed annual production limit; our 2016 and 2017 production outlook for Cigar Lake is therefore subject to AREVA securing the regulatory approvals necessary to increase mill production. Labour relations The current collective agreement between AREVA and unionized employees at the McClean Lake operation expires in May 2016. There is risk to our 2016 and 2017 production outlook for Cigar Lake if AREVA is unable to reach an agreement and there is a labour dispute. INKAI Production Total production from Inkai was 5.8 million pounds; our share was 3.4 million pounds. Production was 17% higher than our production in 2014. During 2015, the subsoil use law in Kazakhstan was amended to allow producers to produce within 20% (above or below) their licensed capacity in a year. As a result, Inkai produced 5.8 million pounds in 2015, 11% higher than its licensed capacity. The increase in production was the result of a higher head grade and an increase in wellfield development efficiency compared to 2014. Project funding As of December 31, 2015, Inkai had fully repaid the outstanding loan under our agreement to fund its project development costs related to blocks 1 and 2. In 2015, Inkai paid the remaining $0.8 million (US) in interest on the loan and repaid $55 million (US) of principal. We are currently advancing funds for Inkai's work on block 3 and, as of December 31, 2015, the principal amounted to $148 million (US). Under the loan agreement, Inkai is to repay Cameco from the net sales proceeds from the sale of production from block 3. Production expansion In 2012, we entered into a binding memorandum of agreement (2012 MOA) with our joint venture partner, Kazatomprom, setting out a framework to: increase Inkai's annual production from blocks 1 and 2 to 10.4 million pounds (our share 5.2 million pounds) and sustain it at that level extend the term of Inkai's resource use contract through 2045 Kazatomprom is pursuing a strategic objective to develop uranium processing capacity in Kazakhstan to complement its leading uranium mining operations. Their primary focus is now on uranium refining, which is an intermediate step in the uranium conversion process. A Nuclear Co-operation Agreement between Canada and Kazakhstan is in place, providing the international framework necessary for applying to the two governments for the required licences and permits. We expect to pursue further expansion of production at Inkai at a pace measured to market opportunities. Discussions continue with Kazatomprom. Block 3 exploration In 2015, Inkai completed construction of the test leach facility and began pilot production from test wellfields, as well as advancing work on a preliminary appraisal of the mineral potential of block 3 according to Kazakhstan standards. Block 3 licence extension The block 3 test leach facility is now operational and state commissioning of the test wellfields was accomplished during 2015. Our application for an extension of the block 3 evaluation period is still pending final approval from the Ministry of Energy of the Republic of Kazakhstan. Inkai continues working on the final appraisal of the mineral potential of block 3 according to Kazakhstan standards. Although a number of extensions of the licence term have been granted by Kazakh regulatory authorities in the past, there is no assurance that a further extension will be granted. Without such extension, there is a risk we could lose our rights to block 3, and a risk we will not be compensated for the funds we advanced to Inkai to fund block 3 activities. PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE AT INKAI Production We expect total production from blocks 1 and 2 to be 5.2 million pounds in 2016; our share is 3.0 million pounds. We expect to maintain production at this level until the potential growth plans are finalized with Kazatomprom. Block 3 exploration In 2016, Inkai expects to continue with pilot production from the test leach facility and to continue working on a final appraisal of the mineral potential according to Kazakhstan standards. RABBIT LAKE Production Production this year was unchanged from our 2014 production as a result of planned timing of production stopes, coupled with slightly improved ore grades. Development and production continued at the Eagle Point mine. At the mill, we continued to improve the efficiency of the mill operation schedule. Temporary mining restrictions On December 17, 2015, we announced that underground mining activities at Eagle Point were being restricted due to a rock fall in an inactive area of the mine. As a precautionary measure, non-essential personnel were removed from the mine while the condition of the affected area was evaluated. Mine production was suspended, although milling of previously mined and transported ore continued through to year end. The assessment determined that repairs were necessary to support the ground in the affected area of the mine. The repairs were completed, along with some further assessment of stability in other areas of the mine. The mine was reopened and normal operations resumed on February 3, 2016. PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE AT RABBIT LAKE Production We expect to produce 3.6 million pounds in 2016. The decrease compared to 2015 is the result of the restriction of mining activities at the end of 2015, which extended into 2016. Tailings capacity Under our current licence, we expect to have sufficient tailings capacity to support milling of Eagle Point ore until about late 2017, based upon expected ore tonnage, milling rates and tailings properties. Our plan for fully utilizing the available tailings capacity of the Rabbit Lake In-Pit Tailings Management facility requires regulatory approval in 2016 for which we have submitted the required applications. With these regulatory approvals and after we complete the necessary work on the existing pit, we expect to then have sufficient tailings capacity to support milling of Eagle Point ore until at least 2021 based upon expected ore tonnage, milling rates, and tailings properties. Exploration We plan to continue our underground drilling reserve replacement program in areas of interest north and northeast of the current mine workings in 2016. The drilling will be carried out from underground locations. Reclamation As part of our multi-year site-wide reclamation plan, we spent over $0.7 million in 2015 to reclaim facilities that are no longer in use and plan to spend over $0.5 million in 2016. FUEL SERVICES 2015 UPDATE Production Fuel services produced 9.7 million kgU, 16% lower than 2014. This was a result of our decision to decrease production in response to weak market conditions and the termination of our toll milling agreement with SFL in 2014. Port Hope conversion facility cleanup and modernization (Vision in Motion) The Vision in Motion project is currently in the feasibility stage and will continue with the CNSC licensing process in 2016, which is required to advance the project. Labour relations Approximately 100 unionized employees at Cameco Fuel Manufacturing Inc.'s operations in Port Hope and Cobourg, Ontario accepted a new collective bargaining agreement in the second quarter of 2015. The employees, represented by the United Steelworkers local 14193 agreed to a three-year contract that includes a 7% wage increase over the term of the agreement. The previous contract expired on June 1, 2015. PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE AT FUEL SERVICES Production We have decreased our production target for 2016 to between 8 million and 9 million kgU in response to the continued weak market conditions. Labour relations The current collective bargaining agreement for our unionized employees at the Port Hope conversion facility expires on June 30, 2016. We will commence the bargaining process in early 2016. Regulatory The current operating licence for the Port Hope conversion facility expires in February 2017. The CNSC relicensing process will take place in 2016. Caution about forward-looking information This document includes statements and information about our expectations for the future.

royalty and stream company by both gold revenues and number of gold assets.  The Company is gold-focused but also has the largest and most diversified portfolio of royalties and streams by commodity, geography, revenue type and stage of project.  The portfolio is actively managed with the aim to maintain over 80% of revenue from precious metals (gold, silver & PGM). The Company does not operate mines, develop projects or conduct exploration. Franco-Nevada's business model is focused on managing and growing its portfolio of royalties and streams. The advantages of this business model are: Market Exposure to the gold price and exploration optionality;  Limited exposure to many of the risks associated with operating companies;  A free cash-flow business with limited cash calls;  A high-margin business that can generate cash through the entire commodity cycle;  A scalable and diversified business in which a large number of assets can be managed with a small stable overhead;  A forward-looking business in which management focuses on growth opportunities rather than operational or development issues; and  A perpetual discovery option over large areas of geologically prospective lands with no cost other than the initial investment. Franco-Nevada's financial results in the short-term are primarily tied to the price of commodities and the amount of production from its portfolio of producing assets. From time to time, financial results are also supplemented by acquisitions of new producing assets. Over the longer-term, results are impacted by the availability of exploration and development capital applied by other companies to advance Franco-Nevada's advanced and exploration assets into production. Franco-Nevada has a long-term focus in making its investments and recognizes it is in a cyclical industry.  Franco-Nevada has historically operated by maintaining a strong balance sheet so that it can make investments during commodity cycle downturns. At year-end 2014, Franco-Nevada had $677.8 million in working capital and  an undrawn $500.0 million unsecured credit facility. Franco-Nevada's shares are listed on the Toronto and New York stock exchanges under the symbol FNV.  An investment in Franco-Nevada's shares is expected to provide investors with yield and more upside than gold ETF without exposure to operating cost inflation. Since its IPO over seven years ago, Franco-Nevada's share price has outperformed the gold price and all relevant gold equity benchmarks. Franco-Nevada Reports Q3 2015 Results and Declares Quarterly Dividend TORONTO, November 11, 2015 - Franco-Nevada Corporation (TSX: FNV; NYSE: FNV) today reported third quarter 2015 financial results realizing 85,637 Gold Equivalent Ounces (\"GEOs\")1 from its mineral assets and $7.8 million in revenue from its oil & gas assets. Net Income and Adjusted Net Income2 were $15.2 million, or $0.10 per share, and $19.4 million, or $0.12 per share, respectively, with Adjusted EBITDA3 being $78.0 million, or $0.50 per share. Prepared in accordance with IFRS and presented in U.S. dollars (unless otherwise noted). \"Franco-Nevada's diversified portfolio continues to perform well,\" said David Harquail, CEO. \"It is significant that these results are before any contributions from our $610 million Antamina silver stream investment which closed in October. We expect to begin recording revenues from the sale of ounces from Antamina in Q4 2015. Also, in November we began funding our gold and silver stream investment in the Cobre Panama project which we expect will be ramping up production in 2018. Franco-Nevada now has net debt of approximately $330 million, an undrawn credit facility of $270 million and remains well-positioned to continue to add to its portfolio.\" Revenues and GEOs by Asset Categories For the third quarter of 2015, revenue was earned 90% from precious metals (83% gold and 7% PGM) and 79% from the Americas (19% U.S., 23% Canada and 37% Latin America). Costs and expenses were impacted by higher depletion expense and costs of sales due to the Candelaria acquisition. Oil & gas production levels were stable with the associated oil & gas revenue decreasing significantly year over year due to lower average oil & gas prices in 2015. Cash provided by operating activities before changes to working capital was $72.4 million. Corporate Updates Antamina: On October 9, 2015, Franco-Nevada closed the previously announced Antamina silver stream with Teck Resources Limited by providing a $610.0 million upfront payment. The payment was funded through a combination of cash on hand and a partial draw of the Company's credit facility. Antamina is expected to contribute between 900,000 to 1,100,000 silver ounces (12,300 to 15,000 GEOs) in Q4 2015. Cobre Panama: Franco-Nevada and First Quantum finalized terms of a replacement precious metals stream agreement on the Cobre Panama project. On November 3, 2015, Franco-Nevada made a $337.9 million initial upfront payment under its $1.0 billion commitment which was funded through cash on hand and proceeds from a partial draw of its credit facility. Credit Facility: Franco-Nevada has entered into an agreement to increase its credit facility to $1.0 billion while maintaining a $250.0 million accordion and extending the maturity to November 2020. Closing is expected to occur prior to the end of November. Portfolio Updates Gold - U.S.: GEOs from U.S. gold assets increased to 14,618 GEOs mainly due to higher production at Goldstrike, Bald Mountain and Gold Quarry, partially offset by lower production at Marigold and fewer ounces under the Fire Creek/Midas fixed deliveries due to a reduction of the monthly ounce obligation in 2015 compared to 2014. Klondex Mines released an updated Mineral Resource estimate for its Midas Mine and Fire Creek project and announced positive drill results from recent underground and surface drilling at its Midas Mine. Gold - Canada: GEOs from Canadian assets decreased in the quarter due to lower production at Hemlo and Sudbury. In Ontario, Lake Shore Gold and Kirkland Lake Gold both announced positive drill results at their respective projects where Franco-Nevada holds various interests. Pretium Resources announced a $540 million construction financing package for its Brucejack project where Franco-Nevada has a 1.2% NSR. At the Phoenix gold project, where Franco-Nevada holds a 2% NSR, Rubicon Minerals announced the temporary suspension of underground activities while it reviews its geological model and develops an implementation plan Gold - Latin America: Candelaria had a strong quarter delivering 19,081 GEOs to Franco-Nevada. During the quarter, Lundin Mining released an updated mine plan for Candelaria which reflected a 26% increase in precious metal production over the next four years. Under the Guadalupe stream agreement, Franco-Nevada funded $4.0 million during the quarter and the final instalment of $8.0 million subsequent to the quarter. Gold - Rest of World: Contributions from Sabodala and Mine Waste Solutions represented approximately 60% of the total GEOs received from Rest of World gold assets for Q3 2015. True Gold announced the commencement of mining at its Karma project and remains on track for gold production at the end of Q1 2016. Franco-Nevada funded $10.4 million in the quarter and $9.7 million subsequent to the quarter under the Karma stream agreement bringing the total funded to $63.4 million. Perseus Mining announced it had signed a Mining Convention with the Ivorian government on its Sissingue project and expects to make a production decision in the fourth quarter of 2015. PGM: PGM GEOs were impacted by declining palladium and platinum prices relative to gold in the quarter. Oil & gas: Revenue from oil & gas assets was $7.8 million in Q3 2015 with similar production levels as Q3 2014. The decrease in revenue is the result of lower average oil & gas prices. On November 6, 2015, Franco-Nevada acquired an additional 0.29% working interest in the Weyburn Unit for C$6.2 million. Dividend Declaration Franco-Nevada is pleased to announce that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.21 per share. The dividend will be paid on December 17, 2015 to shareholders of record on December 3, 2015.

Goldcorp Delivers Strong Free Cash Flow as Third Quarter Gold Production Increases 42% October 29, 2015 (All amounts in $US unless stated otherwise) VANCOUVER, Oct. 29, 2015 /CNW/ - GOLDCORP INC. (TSX: G, NYSE: GG) today reported record third quarter gold production1 of 922,200 ounces, an increase of 42% compared to gold production of 651,700 ounces in the third quarter of 2014.  Adjusted quarterly revenues1 were $1.3 billion.  Adjusted operating cash flow1,2  was $374 million, compared to $399 million for the third quarter of 2014. Free cash flow3 was $243 million, compared to negative free cash flow of $355 million for the third quarter of 2014.  The reported net loss attributable to shareholders of Goldcorp for the quarter was $192 million, or $0.23 per share, compared to a net loss of $44 million, or $0.05 per share, for the third quarter of 2014.  The adjusted net loss1,4 was $37 million, or $0.04 per share, compared to adjusted net earnings of $70 million, or $0.09 per share, for the third quarter of 2014.  Included in the adjusted net loss is a reduction in the carrying values of inventory stockpiles of $40 million, or $0.05 per share. Third Quarter 2015 Highlights Gold sales1 of 942,600 ounces; gold production of 922,200 ounces.  Free cash flow of $243 million before dividends; $168 million after dividends. Revolving credit facility fully repaid. Adjusted revenues of $1.3 billion. All-in sustaining costs1,5 of $848 per ounce. Adjusted operating cash flow of $374 million. Adjusted net loss of $37 million, or $0.04 per share. 2015 production and cost guidance re-confirmed. Announced joint venture (50/50) with Teck Resources Limited (\"Teck\") to combine El Morro and Relincho projects into a single project.  \"Our third quarter results highlight the essence of Goldcorp's investment proposition: growing gold production, declining all-in sustaining costs and decreasing capital spending resulting in strong, sustained free cash flow, despite lower metals prices,\" said Chuck Jeannes, Goldcorp President and Chief Executive Officer.  \"Record quarterly gold production, successful cost containment efforts and the wind-down of a capital investment program that has brought two high-quality gold mines into commercial production this year contributed to quarterly free cash flow of $243 million.  The benefit of managing a strong portfolio of mines was illustrated in the quarter as good results at Penasquito, Cerro Negro and Musselwhite more than offset lower-than-expected production from Eleonore as the mine continues to ramp up.  As a result, we remain on track to meet the upper end of our production guidance of between 3.3 and 3.6 million ounces at all-in sustaining costs of between $850 and $900 per ounce.  Our focus over the balance of 2015 and into 2016 is on vigilant management of our costs in the current gold price environment, successful replacement of mined gold reserves and the prudent allocation of free cash flow to fortify our already-strong balance sheet and fund the next wave of Goldcorp's promising organic growth opportunities.\" Financial Review Third quarter gold sales were 942,600 ounces at an average realized gold price of $1,114per ounce on production of 922,200 ounces, compared to sales of 641,400 ounces at an average realized gold price of $1,266 per ounce on production of 651,700 ounces for the third quarter of 2014. Silver production totaled 11.3 million ounces compared to 7.8 million ounces in the prior year's third quarter.  All-in sustaining costs were $848 per ounce of gold for the third quarter of 2015 compared to $1,066 per ounce in the third quarter of 2014.   Excluding non-cash inventory impairments at Los Filos and Penasquito, all-in sustaining costs for the third quarter of 2015 would have been $802 per ounce. Adjusted revenues for the third quarter totaled $1.3 billion.  The reported net loss attributable to shareholders of Goldcorp for the third quarter was $192 million, or $0.23 per share, compared to a net loss of $44 million, or $0.05 per share, for the third quarter of 2014.  Adjusted net loss for the third quarter totaled $37 million, or $0.04 per share, compared to adjusted net earnings of $70 million, or $0.09 per share, for the third quarter of 2014.  The adjusted net loss for the third quarter of 2015 primarily excludes the unrealized losses from the foreign exchange translation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities ($158 million, or $0.19 per share). The adjusted net loss includes the impact of non-cash stock-based compensation expenses which amounted to approximately $14 million, or $0.02 per share, for the quarter.  Adjusted operating cash flow for the third quarter was $374 million, compared to $399 million for the third quarter of 2014.  Canada At Eleonore in Quebec, third quarter safe gold production totaled 86,700 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $974 per ounce.  Production increased over the prior quarter as a result of the expansion of underground mining from two to four horizons, in addition to successful mine optimization initiatives.  Stoping productivity and mining flexibility continued to improve, contributing to higher underground mine tonnage quarter over quarter.  Throughput during the quarter averaged 6,500 tonnes per day.  While recoveries in the third quarter were impacted by the presence of iron sulphides in certain production stopes, metallurgical studies are underway that are expected to minimize the effect on future recoveries.     As previously reported on September 8, 2015, initial production stopes at Eleonore are encountering folding and faulting resulting in higher dilution and therefore lower than planned mined grades and gold production. The folding is of varying intensities and is estimated to affect approximately 10% of the overall Eleonore deposit.  The Eleonore team continues to work on adjusting stope designs to minimize these impacts.  Work on the Eleonore crown pillar pre-feasibility study continued to advance during the third quarter.  Major activities included the successful completion of summer field work, underground and surface infrastructure and stope sequencing determination of the dike location, and permitting and stakeholder engagement efforts.  The pre-feasibility study is on track to be completed by the end of 2015.  Safe gold production at Red Lake in Ontario in the third quarter totaled 77,600 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $1,028 per ounce.  Production decreased over the prior quarter as a result of lower grades from remnant pillar mining at the Campbell Complex, the acceleration of development in the Sulphide Zones and lower-than-expected grades in the Footwall Zone.  An exploration drift to access the HG Young discovery at depth continued to advance north on the 14 Level at the Campbell Complex.  The drift provides a new platform for follow-up drilling down plunge of positive intercepts from the ongoing surface exploration program at HG Young.  At Cochenour, exploration drilling continued to assess the core area of the deposit as well as at the tram level, where there have been changes in the orientation of the veins from prior interpretations. Detailed interpretation and analysis is ongoing to support final mine planning and infrastructure. Processing of mill feed from the initial sill-development work was consistent with expectations. Work is ongoing to define the timing of initial stope production and ramp up of Cochenour feed for processing at Red Lake. At Porcupine in Ontario, safe gold production for the third quarter was 71,000 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $882 per ounce.  Production decreased over the prior quarter due to lower gold grades, driven primarily by the mining of lower-grade stopes at the Hoyle Pond underground,  partially offset by higher tonnage milled as a result of improved mill operations during the quarter.   The Hoyle Deep project, which will enable efficient access to lower portions of the Hoyle Pond deposit, continued to progress and remains on track to be fully operational in the first quarter of 2016.  At the Hollinger open pit, the environmental control berm was completed in mid-October, enabling mining to take place 24 hours a day.  At the Borden project 160 kilometres west of Porcupine, studies are underway to determine the optimization of a combined Borden-Porcupine operation.  Options to access the deposit from underground are currently being evaluated in preparation for permit applications.  Surface diamond drilling continued during the third quarter with seven drills on site.  The current exploration activity in this new gold district remains focused on in-fill drilling with a target to convert a portion of the resources into reserves at the end of 2015. Safe gold production at Musselwhite in Ontario increased over the prior quarter to 71,000 ounces as a result of higher mill throughput and increased grades.  Musselwhite's all-in sustaining cost continued to be among the lowest in the portfolio at $697 per ounce.  The focus of the exploration program during the third quarter was on reserve replacement. Drilling concluded late in the third quarter on the West Limb zone and the Upper Lynx zone with positive results showing continuity of mineralization in both areas.  All critical exploration development for the year is complete. Latin America At Penasquito in Mexico, safe gold production totaled 236,800 ounces for the quarter at an all-in sustaining cost of $467 per ounce.  Production was driven primarily by higher gold grades in sulphide as a result of positive model reconciliation.  In light of continued strong performance, production at Penasquito will exceed 2015 guidance of between 700,000 and 750,000 ounces. Construction of the Northern Well Field (\"NWF\") remained suspended throughout the third quarter of 2015 due to an illegal blockade by a local community.  Penasquito continues to seek a fair resolution of this matter with the community, while taking steps to enforce its contractual rights. Penasquito is also advancing alternatives for completion of the project without crossing through the affected community lands.  Contingency planning is ongoing for fresh water supply to the Penasquito mine until the NWF project is operational.  The Company believes that there will be timely resolution of this matter to meet the future water needs of Penasquito. The Metallurgical Enhancement Project (\"MEP\") feasibility study continued, which included completion of pilot testing, confirming capital estimates and concentrate marketing studies.  The feasibility study remains on schedule to be completed in early 2016.     At the Camino Rojo project, ongoing pre-feasibility study work is focused on the evaluation of Camino Rojo as a supplemental source of sulphide feed to the existing Penasquito facility, in addition to a smaller, stand-alone oxide heap leach facility.  An update of the geologic model continued during the third quarter and metallurgical testing of sulphide, transition and oxide zones is ongoing.  The pre-feasibility study is on track to be completed in 2016. Safe gold production at Los Filos in Mexico for the third quarter of 2015 totaled 70,300 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $1,442 per ounce.  Increased production over the prior quarter was a result of higher ore processed.   The 2015 exploration program to enhance deeper phases of the El Bermejal pit and extend high grade zones for underground mining was completed.  A new life-of-mine plan is progressing with a focus to maximize return on investment in the current lower price metals environment and is expected to be completed by the end of 2015. At Cerro Negro in Argentina, third quarter safe gold production totaled 135,700 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $731 per ounce, driven by the continued strong ramp-up at both the Mariana Central and Eureka mines.  Total tonnes milled increased resulting in an average throughput rate of 3,697 tonnes per day for the quarter.  Average milling rates for September surpassed the nameplate capacity of 4,000 tonnes per operating day.  Exploration in the third quarter continued to focus on surface resource confirmation drilling.  The current drilling program is progressing as planned, expanding resources at the Marianas Complex, particularly at the newly-discovered Emilia vein. The Bajo Negro expansion was completed in the third quarter and the results will be included within the year-end resource update.  On September 30, 2015, a work stoppage took place at Cerro Negro by miners represented by the Asociacion Obrera Minera Argentina, Province of Santa Cruz.  All work activity resumed on October 5, 2015 following the declaration of a mandatory minimum 15-day conciliation period by the Santa Cruz Provincial Secretariat of Labour.  Subsequent to the expiration of the conciliation period productive negotiations continue.  The Company remains committed to working cooperatively with union representatives and government authorities on a fair and equitable resolution. At the Pueblo Viejo joint venture in the Dominican Republic, Goldcorp's share of third quarter safe gold and silver production totaled 115,000 ounces and 502,700 ounces, respectively, at an all-in sustaining cost of $585 per ounce.  Gold production increased over the prior quarter as a result of higher tonnes processed, grades and recoveries.  Silver production increased primarily due to higher recoveries.  Tonnage processed was higher in the third quarter due to the prior quarter being impacted by autoclave and counter current decantation thickener maintenance.  Silver recoveries were higher due to the shut-down of the lime boil tanks during autoclave maintenance in the prior quarter.  At El Morro in Chile, an agreement was reached with Teck on August 27, 2015 to combine the El Morro and Relincho projects into a 50/50 joint venture. In addition, an agreement was reached with New Gold to acquire New Gold's 30% interest in the El Morro project for$90 million in cash upon closing, and a 4% gold stream on future gold production from the El Morro property. Closing of both transactions is expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2015.  The project will undertake extensive engagement with communities and other stakeholders to help guide the project's development. In combination with community consultation, a pre-feasibility study is expected to commence in mid-2016. 2015 Guidance Outlook The Company today reconfirmed 2015 production guidance, expected to be at the upper-end of between 3.3 and 3.6 million gold ounces.  All-in sustaining costs are expected to be between $850 and $900 per gold ounce; $500 and $550 per ounce on a by-product basis; and $625 to $675 per ounce on a co-product basis.  Depreciation, depletion and amortization (\"DD&A\") will increase to $450 per gold ounce from the previous guidance of$425 per gold ounce due primarily to production coming from our newer and higher DD&A per ounce sites and additional assets placed in service earlier than anticipated.  Capital spending guidance remains unchanged at between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion for 2015.  Corporate administration expense guidance, excluding share-based compensation, is expected to be approximately $170 million in 2015. Excluding the impacts of foreign exchange on current and deferred tax assets and liabilities and excluding the dilution and disposition gains on the sale of mining interests and the related taxes, the Company continues to expect an annual effective tax rate on adjusted earnings subject to income tax of 45% in 2015.

Competitive Strengths Growth in copper, gold and zinc production with exploration upside Consistent performance from reliable operations Disciplined and clear growth strategy already being executed Strong financial position Experienced management and operating team  Hudbay Announces Fourth Quarter 2015 Results February 24, 2016 TORONTO, ON -- (Marketwired) -- 02/24/16 -- HudBay Minerals Inc. (\"Hudbay\" or the \"company\") (TSX: HBM) (NYSE: HBM) today released its fourth quarter 2015 financial results. All amounts are in US dollars, unless otherwise noted. Summary: 2016 planned capital spending and operating expenses reduced by over $100 million compared to 2016 guidance, with no impact on production guidance. Commitments in place for credit facility amendments to provide more flexible financial covenants and extend all principal repayments to 2019, deferring $53.4 million in 2016 scheduled repayments. Copper sales volumes increased 850% year-over-year to a record 58,714 tonnes in the fourth quarter and copper concentrate logistical issues resolved. Operating cash flow before changes in non-cash working capital increased to $106.3 million, or $0.45 per share, from negative $2.0 million, or $(0.01) per share, in the fourth quarter of 2014. Net loss in the fourth quarter of 2015 was $255.5 million, or $1.09 per share, compared to earnings of $43.6 million, or $0.19 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2014, as a result of non-cash after-tax impairment charges of $198.8 million on Constancia and $114.5 million on Rosemont, primarily due to lower copper price expectations. In the fourth quarter of 2015, operating cash flow before change in non-cash working capital increased to $106.3 million from negative $2.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. \"With the successful ramp-up of our new mines in 2015, we delivered sector-leading growth in low-cost copper production, and are well-positioned to weather the current commodity price environment,\" said Alan Hair, president and chief executive officer. \"We have taken specific action already in 2016 to capitalize on mine optimization and sustainable cost reduction opportunities, and have strengthened our liquidity position to ensure that the business is positioned to respond to a volatile metal price environment.\" Net loss and loss per share in the fourth quarter of 2015 were $255.5 million and $1.09, respectively, compared to net profit and earnings per share of $43.6 million and $0.19, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2014. Financial and Operating Results Total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2015 was $336.6 million, $223.9 million higher than the same period in 2014. This increase was primarily due to higher copper, gold and silver sales volumes compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, which was a result of commercial production being achieved at Constancia and significant inventory drawdown. Higher sales volumes were partially offset by lower prices for all metals and the effect of higher treatment and refining charges. Operating cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2015 benefited from an increase in payable copper in concentrate sales volumes and significantly higher precious metal sales volumes compared to the same quarter last year. This resulted from the Constancia mine reaching commercial production in the second quarter of 2015 and sales volumes of most metals in the Manitoba business unit growing as the Lalor mine had its first full year of commercial production. The increase in sales volumes and associated economies of scale more than offset the sharp decline in realized sales prices of all metals compared to the same quarter last year. Net loss and loss per share in the fourth quarter of 2015 were $255.5 million and $1.09, respectively, compared to a net profit and earnings per share of $43.6 million and $0.19, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2014. The loss was due mainly to an after-tax asset and goodwill impairment charge of $313.3 million recorded in the Peru and Arizona business units. Partly offsetting this impact was a $52.1 million increase in gross profit compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 due to the growth in sales volumes discussed above, despite lower realized sales prices and higher depreciation charges. Additionally, there was a $37.0 million gain in the fourth quarter of 2015 arising from the sale of Balmat Holding Corporation.

Credit Facility Amendments Commitments have been received from lenders under Hudbay's two secured credit facilities to consolidate the lender groups and restructure the two facilities. The credit facility restructuring is intended to enhance Hudbay's liquidity position in the current commodity price environment and reflects the transition of the Constancia operation into commercial production. At December 31, 2015, Hudbay had a $400 million revolving credit facility, secured by its Manitoba assets (the \"Canada Facility\") and a $150 million standby credit facility, secured by its Peru assets (the \"Peru Facility\"), collectively referred to as the \"Facilities\". Commitments of $500 million have been received from existing lenders toward the restructured facilities, and syndication is ongoing to bring total commitments to $550 million. Subject to completion of definitive documentation and customary conditions, the Facilities will be structured as follows: Whereas the Canada Facility is currently repayable in full in March 2018 and the Peru Facility is currently repayable in quarterly installments which began in December 2015 and end in September 2018, both Facilities will now be repayable in full in March 2019. As a result, 2016 scheduled principal amortization payments of $53.4 million will be deferred. Both Facilities will be subject to the same set of financial covenants. The financial covenants will require that: Consolidated senior secured debt to EBITDA shall be no more than 3.25:1. Consolidated senior secured debt is defined to include amounts outstanding under the Facilities and any other secured financings. Consolidated EBITDA to interest expense shall be no less than 1.75:1 in 2016 and 2017, and 2.50:1 beginning with the 12 months ending March 31, 2018. Consolidated tangible net worth shall be no less than 75% of Hudbay's tangible net worth at December 31, 2015. The Peru Facility will become revolving in nature and both the Peru Facility and the Canada Facility will bear an interest rate of LIBOR + 4.5%, consistent with the interest rate on the current Canada Facility. The Canada Facility and Peru Facility will continue to be secured by Hudbay's Manitoba and Peru assets, respectively, and will not be cross-collateralized. At December 31, 2015, $50.1 million of letters of credit had been advanced under the Facilities. Including borrowings and letters of credit, a total of $347.1 million was drawn under the Facilities as at December 31, 2015. Closing of the amendments, which is not conditional on any further lender commitments, is expected in March 2016. Cost Reduction Initiatives Following the ramp-up of Hudbay's new mine production in 2015, an extensive review was launched as part of a company-wide efficiency improvement initiative. This ongoing review, combined with cost containment efforts, resulted in expected 2016 capital expenditure and operating cost reductions of more than $100 million, compared to 2016 guidance, with no effect on production guidance. Operating cost savings have been identified which are expected to reduce 2016 operating and general and administrative costs by approximately $55 million. Approximately $15 million relates to lower current prices for commodities such as diesel, propane and steel compared to budget expectations. Another $22 million relates to savings from renegotiated contracts for goods and services, and approximately $18 million relates to other operating efficiencies and lower discretionary spending, including reduced corporate spending. All of the operating cost reductions in 2016 are considered to be sustainable based on current prices for input costs. Planned sustaining capital expenditures in 2016 have been reduced by approximately $50 million, relative to initial guidance of $270 million, with no impact on production guidance. The planned reduction in spending reflects the deferral of a portion of sustaining capital expenditures from 2016 to 2017, and is comprised of $40 million in the Peru business unit and $10 million in the Manitoba business unit. Of the $40 million of reduced spending in Peru in 2016, $19 million relates to the deferral of certain tailings dam construction activities into 2017, and $14 million relates to the deferral of mobile equipment purchases for the development of the Pampacancha satellite deposit. In Manitoba, 2016 capital spending reductions relate partly to expenditures on underground equipment and development at the 777 mine. Planned 2016 Manitoba spending reductions of approximately $15 million are partially offset by approximately $5 million in equipment purchases carried over from 2015. Hudbay's sustaining capital spending in 2017 is expected to be moderately lower than revised 2016 spending of $220 million, as initial spending on the Constancia tailings dam nears completion. Sustaining capital spending in 2018 is expected to be substantially lower than 2016 and 2017 levels with the completion of the initial Constancia tailings dam raise in 2017, and lower capitalized development spending in Manitoba at the 777 and Reed mines based on the current life of mine plans. Capital expenditures related to Pampacancha and Snow Lake enhancements are not included in the sustaining capital estimates. As a result of these initiatives, Hudbay's guidance for capital and operating costs in 2016 have been revised as follows: Revised 2016 Capital Expenditure and Unit Operating Cost Guidance Capital Expenditures 1   Original  (Millions)   Revised  (Millions) Sustaining Capital         Manitoba   90   80 Peru   180   140 Total Sustaining Capital   270   220           Growth Capital         Arizona2   30   30 Total Growth Capital   30   30           Capitalized Exploration   3   3           Total Capital Expenditure   303   253 Combined Mine and Mill Unit Operating Costs 3   ($/tonne ore  processed)   ($/tonne ore  processed) Manitoba Operations - 777, Lalor and Reed   C$85 - 104   C$80 - 100           Peru Operations - Constancia   US$8.5 - 9.4   US$7.3 - 8.2 Excludes capitalized interest. Original estimated growth capital estimate for Rosemont related to spending during the first half of 2016; revised estimated spending is for the full year 2016. Reflects combined mine and mill costs per tonne of milled ore. Manitoba operating costs are presented in CAD, and include general and administrative (\"G&A\") costs and cost of ore purchased from joint venture partner at Reed mine. Peru operations combined mine and mill unit costs are presented in USD, include G&A costs and reflect the deduction of expected deferred stripping costs. Rosemont spending of $30 million in 2016 is now expected to occur over the full year, rather than the first six months. This amount is expected to be sufficient to advance a definitive feasibility study and the permitting process, and, upon receipt of permits, complete a mine plan of operations. Peru Operations Review During the fourth quarter of 2015, mining operations continued as planned and cost optimization is underway. Equipment availabilities are within design parameters, and both loading and hauling efficiencies remain consistent with expectations. Optimization of plant performance remains the primary focus, as more is understood about varying ore types. During the fourth quarter of 2015, shipments of copper concentrate from the Constancia mine to the port in Matarani increased with improved trucking capacity, resulting in significant inventory drawdown. The approximate concentrate inventory levels in Peru, including the mine site and port inventories, decreased from 74,000 dmt at the end of the third quarter of 2015, including 65,000 dmt at the mine, to a normal working level of approximately 28,000 dmt at the end of the fourth quarter, including 11,000 dmt at the mine. All of the excess copper concentrate was sold by year-end. Expansion at the port of Matarani is nearing completion, and initial shipments from the new \"Pier F\" facility began in mid-February 2016. Completion of the new facility is expected to alleviate port congestion as other mines ramp-up production. Constancia's production in the first quarter of 2016 is expected to be affected by the planned replacement of the trunnions on both the SAG and ball mills on one of the two grinding circuits. The trunnions were damaged due to a lubrication failure during the commissioning period, and the affected line is expected to be shut down at the end of February to begin an estimated six to eight week outage to replace the trunnions, during which the second grinding circuit should continue to operate normally. In 2015, metal production at Constancia was within the guidance range, and combined operating costs per tonne were below the guidance range. Manitoba Operations Review Ore production at the Manitoba mines for the fourth quarter of 2015 increased by 31% compared to the same period in 2014 primarily as a result of increased production from the main production shaft at the Lalor mine. Production in the fourth quarter of 2014 at the 777 mine was also impacted by an unscheduled two-week shutdown of the production shaft. Copper and gold grades in the fourth quarter of 2015 were lower compared with the grades in the fourth quarter of 2014 by 23% and 12%, respectively, and zinc and silver grades were higher by 46% and 2%, respectively, due to stope sequencing. Unit operating costs for the fourth quarter of 2015 declined by 4% compared to the same period in 2014 as a result of increased production at 777 and reduced operating costs at the Reed mine. Ore processed in Flin Flon in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 13% higher, while ore processed in Snow Lake was 39% higher compared to the same period in 2014 as a result of higher production at 777 and Lalor. Grades varied as a result of normal mine sequencing. Recoveries in Flin Flon were generally consistent in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 with the exception of zinc. Zinc recoveries in 2014 were impacted by lower mine head grades. In Snow Lake, copper, gold, and silver recoveries in the fourth quarter of 2015 were higher by 35%, 10% and 11%, respectively, as a result of achieving steady operations at Lalor and optimization of the copper circuit. Unit costs for the Flin Flon and Snow Lake concentrators decreased by 15% and 22%, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 as a result of increased production. In the fourth quarter of 2015, Manitoba's combined mine/mill unit operating cost decreased by 6%, compared to the same period in 2014, due to increased production. For the fourth quarter of 2015, production of copper and gold remained consistent compared to the same period last year, while zinc and silver increased by 69% and 35%, respectively, as a result of increased production at Lalor and increased zinc and silver grades at both the 777 and Reed mines. In 2015, production of all metals increased compared to 2014 as a result of increased production at Lalor and increased copper grades at Reed. Production of all metals and unit operating costs were within guidance ranges. Impairments During the fourth quarter of 2015, Hudbay recognized an after-tax impairment of $198.8 million ($264.4 million pre-tax) on Constancia goodwill and property, plant and equipment as a result of lower expected copper prices. In addition, a pre-tax and after-tax impairment of $114.5 million was recognized on Rosemont goodwill mainly as a result of lower expected copper prices and an expected delay in the start of construction on the Rosemont project. Engineering and permitting activities at Rosemont are progressing in accordance with expectations. Hudbay remains committed to advancing Rosemont, which is expected to be one of the first new copper projects to be built once copper prices and capital market conditions improve. The impairment analyses for Constancia and Rosemont assumed copper prices of $2.25/lb in 2016 and 2017, increasing to $3.00/lb in 2019 and thereafter. Real discount rates of 8.00% and 9.75% were applied for Constancia and Rosemont, respectively. The underlying operating assumptions in the impairment models were substantially the same as those used in the September 30, 2015 impairment tests. Other Recent Developments Effective January 1, 2016, Alan Hair became President and Chief Executive Officer, replacing David Garofalo, who announced his resignation in early December 2015. Mr. Hair has twenty years of experience with Hudbay and has worked in the mining industry for more than three decades. He previously served as Hudbay's Chief Operating Officer from 2012 to 2015, a role that is now held by Cashel Meagher. Mr. Meagher was previously Vice President, South America Business Unit from 2011 to 2015, where he led the successful construction and ramp-up of the Constancia operation. Hudbay declared a semi-annual dividend of C$0.01 per share on February 24, 2016. The dividend will be paid on March 31, 2016 to shareholders of record as of March 11, 2016. Non-IFRS Financial Performance Measures Operating cash flow per share and cash cost per pound of copper produced are included in this news release because the company believes that, in the case of operating cash flow per share, it helps investors and management to evaluate changes in cash flow while taking into account changes in shares outstanding, and in the case of cash cost per pound of copper produced, it helps investors assess the performance of the company's operations. These measures do not have a meaning prescribed by IFRS and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with IFRS and are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under IFRS. Other companies may calculate these measures differently. Operating cash flow per share The following table presents Hudbay's calculation of operating cash flow per share for the three months and years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014: $000s except shares and per share amounts)   Three Months Ended December 31   Year Ended December 31     2015   2014   2015   2014 Operating cash flow before stream deposit and change in non-cash working capital   106,305   (1,990)   222,140   16,771                   Weighted average shares outstanding - basic   235,231,688   233,631,382   234,675,080   209,023,666 Operating cash flow per share1 ($)   0.45   (0.01)   0.95   0.08 Operating cash flow per share is before stream deposit and change in non-cash working capital. It is a non-IFRS financial performance measure with no standardized meaning under IFRS. Reconciliation of Cash Cost, After By-product Credits (non-IFRS) to Cost of Sales (IFRS) Cash cost per pound of copper produced (\"cash cost\") is a non-IFRS measure that management uses as a key performance indicator to assess the performance of the company's operations. Hudbay's calculation designates copper as its primary metal of production as it has been, and is expected to be, the largest component of revenues. Two changes have been made to the cash cost calculation beginning with reporting for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015. First, the basis of measurement has been changed from pounds of copper sold to pounds of copper produced. This change has been made to better align the costs of production with copper produced in the same period and reduce the variation in cash cost due to inventory sales timing. Second, royalties have been removed from the cash cost. This change increases consistency between Hudbay's cash cost calculation and industry peers. The calculation is presented in two manners: Cash cost, before by-product credits - This measure is gross of by-product revenues and is a function of the efforts and costs incurred to mine and process all ore mined. However, the measure divides this aggregate cost over only pounds of copper produced, Hudbay's primary metal of production. This measure is generally less volatile from period to period, as it is not affected by changes in the price received for by-product metals. It is, however, significantly affected by the relative mix of copper concentrate and finished zinc production, and an increase in production of zinc metal will tend to result in an increase in cash cost under this measure. Cash cost, net of by-product credits - In order to calculate the cost to produce and sell copper, the net of by-product credits measure subtracts the revenues realized from the sale of the metals other than copper. The by-product revenues from zinc, gold, silver, and molybdenum are significant and are integral to the economics of Hudbay's operations. The economics that support Hudbay's decision to produce and sell copper would be different if the company did not receive revenues from the other significant metals being extracted and processed. This measure provides management and investors with an indication of the minimum copper price consistent with positive operating cash flows and operating margins, assuming that realized by-product metal prices are consistent with those prevailing during the reporting period. It also serves as an important operating statistic that management and investors utilize to measure Hudbay's operating performance versus that of its competitors. However, it is important to understand that if by-product metal prices decline alongside copper prices, the cash cost net of by-product credits would increase, requiring a higher copper price than that reported to maintain positive cash flows and operating margins. The tables below summarize consolidated cash cost in addition to reconciliations between cash cost, after by-product credits, to the most comparable GAAP measures of cost of sales for the three months and years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Cash cost, net of by-product credits per pound of copper produced, may not calculate based on amounts presented in the tables below due to rounding.

Note to United States Investors This news release has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the securities laws in effect in Canada, which may differ materially from the requirements of United States securities laws applicable to U.S. issuers. Information concerning Hudbay's mineral properties has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Canadian securities laws, which differ in material respects from the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") set forth in Industry Guide 7. Under the SEC's Industry Guide 7, mineralization may not be classified as a \"reserve\" unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically and legally produced or extracted at the time of the reserve determination, and the SEC does not recognize the reporting of mineral deposits which do not meet the SEC Industry Guide 7 definition of \"Reserve\". In accordance with National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\"NI 43-101\") of the Canadian Securities Administrators, the terms \"mineral reserve\", \"proven mineral reserve\", \"probable mineral reserve\", \"mineral resource\", \"measured mineral resource\", \"indicated mineral resource\" and \"inferred mineral resource\" are defined in the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (the \"CIM\") Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves adopted by the CIM Council on May 10, 2014. While the terms \"mineral resource\", \"measured mineral resource\", \"indicated mineral resource\" and \"inferred mineral resource\" are recognized and required by NI 43-101, the SEC does not recognize them. You are cautioned that, except for that portion of mineral resources classified as mineral reserves, mineral resources do not have demonstrated economic value. Inferred mineral resources have a high degree of uncertainty as to their existence and as to whether they can be economically or legally mined. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Therefore, you are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource exists, that it can be economically or legally mined, or that it will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Likewise, you are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of measured or indicated mineral resources will ever be upgraded into mineral reserves.

Lundin Mining follows an annual reporting cycle and reports its Health, Safety, Environmental and Community performance using the reporting framework of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), including the G3 Guidelines and the Mining and Metals Sector Supplement. FEB 18, 2016 Lundin Mining Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results TORONTO, ONTARIO--(Marketwired - Feb. 18, 2016) - Lundin Mining Corporation (\"Lundin Mining\" or the \"Company\") (TSX:LUN)(OMX:LUMI) today reported positive cash flows of $107.1 million generated from operations in the quarter and $713.9 million for the year, not including the Company's attributable cash flows related to Tenke Fungurume, which aggregated to an additional $32.9 million in 2015. As a result of a significant decline of metal prices, a number of asset impairments were taken which result in a net loss attributable to Lundin shareholders of $377.7 million ($0.52 per share) for the quarter and $294.1 million ($0.41 per share) for the year ended December 31, 2015. Net loss for the quarter and the year included a non-cash, after-tax impairment charge of $278.0 million ($0.39 per share) as short-term metal prices negatively impacted estimated net recoverable values of our operating assets and exploration properties. Mr. Paul Conibear, President and CEO commented, \"For 2015 we are very pleased to have generated the highest cash flow in our Company's history. With all of our operations achieving or exceeding their annual production guidance and continuing to generate robust margins, the Company has been able to further improve its strong financial position despite the current commodity price environment. As we progress through 2016 and beyond, we intend to maintain our focus on consistent high performance of our operations, which are capable of providing positive margins at current metal prices, and disciplined capital investment, contributing to preservation of a healthy balance sheet.\" Three months ended Twelve months ended December 31, December 31, US$ Millions (except per share amounts) 2015 2014 2015 2014 Sales 316.0 443.0 1,701.9 951.3 Operating earnings1 101.0 144.1 712.1 304.3 Net (loss) / earnings (383.5 ) 36.6 (281.8 ) 123.4 Net (loss) / earnings attributable to Lundin shareholders (377.7 ) 25.8 (294.1 ) 112.6 Basic and diluted (loss) / earnings per share (0.52 ) 0.04 (0.41 ) 0.19 Cash flow from operations 107.1 68.4 713.9 187.4 Ending net debt position2 441.3 829.2 441.3 829.2 Operating earnings is a non-GAAP measure defined as sales, less operating costs (excluding depreciation) and general and administrative costs. Net debt is a non-GAAP measure defined as cash and cash equivalents, less long-term debt and finance leases, before deferred financing fees. Highlights Operational Performance For 2015, all of the Company's operations met or performed better than guidance on production, but financial results were negatively impacted by a lower metal price environment. Aggregate capital spending was well below guidance as a result of proactive spending restraint measures adopted in stages to react to declining metal markets. Candelaria (80%): The Candelaria operations produced, on a 100% basis, 181,040 tonnes of copper, approximately 1,874,000 ounces of silver, and 102,500 ounces of gold in concentrate, with copper and gold production exceeding expectations as a result of higher throughput. Copper cash costs1 of $1.25/lb for the year were lower than full year guidance of $1.35/lb. Eagle (100%): Eagle's operational results were excellent, with both nickel (27,167 tonnes) and copper (24,331 tonnes) production exceeding guidance. Nickel cash costs of $2.02/lb for the year were in-line with guidance of $2.00/lb. Neves-Corvo (100%): Neves-Corvo produced 55,831 tonnes of copper and 61,921 tonnes of zinc for the year ended December 31, 2015. Copper production exceeded the prior year by 9% due to higher average copper head grades and recoveries. Zinc production fell short of the prior year comparable period resulting from lower mill throughput and lower zinc recoveries. Significant improvements were achieved in stabilizing the existing zinc plant resulting in improved recoveries in the fourth quarter. Copper cash costs of $1.63/lb for the year were in-line with our latest full-year guidance ($1.60/lb) and were lower than the prior year of $1.85/lb. Zinkgruvan (100%): Zinc production of 83,451 tonnes at Zinkgruvan was a new record, exceeding prior year production due primarily to record tonnages of ore mined and milled. Lead production of 34,120 tonnes exceeded both expectations and 2014 production. Cash costs for zinc of $0.37/lb were lower than guidance ($0.40/lb) and in-line with the prior year ($0.37/lb). Aguablanca (100%): Aguablanca met production expectations for the year, though current year production of 7,213 tonnes of nickel and 6,221 tonnes of copper were lower than the prior year due to cessation of open pit mining in the first quarter and the suspension of underground mining operations in the third quarter of 2015. Cash costs of $2.72/lb of nickel for 2015 were slightly higher than full year guidance ($2.60/lb) due to the lower by-product credits. Tenke (24%): Tenke operations continue to perform well. Lundin's attributable share of annual production included 48,951 tonnes of copper cathode and 3,843 tonnes of cobalt in hydroxide. The Company's attributable share of sales included 50,826 tonnes of copper at an average realized price of $2.42/lb and 3,809 tonnes of cobalt at an average realized price of $8.21/lb. Tenke operating cash costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $1.21/lb of copper sold, higher than the latest guidance due to lower cobalt by-product credits. Cash distributions received by Lundin Mining in the year from Tenke were $24.6 million, slightly higher than expectations. An additional $8.3 million was received from the Freeport Cobalt operations, for total Tenke related distributions to the Company of $32.9 million for the year. Cash cost/lb of copper, zinc and nickel are non-GAAP measures defined as all cash costs directly attributable to mining operations, less royalties and by-product credits. Financial Performance Operating earnings for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $712.1 million, an increase of $407.8 million in comparison to the $304.3 million reported in 2014. The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of operating results from Candelaria ($383.4 million) and Eagle ($100.1 million) and favourable foreign exchange rates in the EUR and SEK ($74.8 million), partially offset by lower realized metal prices and price adjustments ($173.9 million) from our European operations. Sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $1,701.9 million, an increase of $750.6 million in comparison to the $951.3 million reported in 2014. The increase was mainly due to the inclusion of a full year of operating results from Candelaria ($692.9 million) and Eagle ($236.7 million), partially offset by lower realized metal prices and price adjustments from our European operations. Average London Metal Exchange (\"LME\") metal prices for copper, nickel and zinc were lower (20%, 30%, and 11%, respectively) in comparison to 2014. Operating costs (excluding depreciation) for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $962.7 million, an increase of $343.0 million in comparison to the $619.7 million reported in 2014. The increase was largely due to the inclusion of a full year of operating results from Candelaria and Eagle of $309.5 million and $136.6 million, respectively, partially offset by favourable foreign exchange rates. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $555.0 million, an increase of $346.3 million in comparison to the $208.7 million reported in 2014. The increase was attributable to the inclusion of a full year of operating results from Candelaria and Eagle of $238.2 million and $122.3 million, respectively. Cash flow from operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $713.9 million, an increase of $526.5 million in comparison to the $187.4 million reported in 2014. The increase was attributable to: a full year of operating earnings from Candelaria, net of deferred revenue recognized ($336.5 million), and Eagle ($100.1 million); and changes in non-cash working capital and long-term inventory ($226.6 million); partly offset by lower operating earnings at our European operations ($74.8 million); and higher net income taxes paid ($49.3 million). Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $281.8 million, a decrease of $405.2 million in comparison to net earnings of $123.4 million reported in 2014. Net losses were primarily a result of asset impairments connected to lower metal prices, as cost and production performance at mine operations met or exceeded expectations. Before the impact of impairments (net of tax), net loss for the current year was $3.8 million, compared with net earnings of $155.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Net loss, before asset impairments, was impacted by: net loss at Neves-Corvo and lower net income at Zinkgruvan largely due to lower metal prices ($55.4 million); and net loss at Eagle generated from a full year of operation in a poor economic environment ($32.1 million) and write-down of deferred tax assets ($22.9 million); and lower operating earnings from Aguablanca ($22.0 million), partially due to the suspension of underground mining operations in the third quarter; and full year of interest expense associated with the senior secured notes ($62.8 million); and lower income from investment in Tenke ($63.4 million); partly offset by a full year of operations at Candelaria ($106.9 million). Corporate Highlights On June 2, 2015, the Company announced that exploration drilling near the Eagle Mine had intersected a new zone of high-grade massive and semi-massive nickel-copper sulphide mineralization. On July 23, 2015, the Company announced approval of its Environmental Impact Assessment (\"EIA\") for Candelaria 2030, an initiative which includes a number of enhancements to support current and future operations, primarily the construction of the Los Diques tailings storage facility which represents an important step in extending the life of mine of the Candelaria operation. On July 29, 2015, the Company announced the completion of an updated mine plan and annual sustaining capital cost estimate for Candelaria. The new plan is expected to result in an improved production and operating cost profile over the next four year period. On January 28, 2016, the Company advised local authorities and employees of its intention to permanently close the Aguablanca mine. The closure was originally scheduled for early 2018. The decision to close the Aguablanca mine was due to the significant and sustained decrease in nickel and copper prices. Financial Position and Financing Net debt position at December 31, 2015 was $441.3 million compared to $829.2 million at December 31, 2014. The $387.9 million decrease in net debt during the year was attributable to operating cash flows of $713.9 million and distributions from Tenke and Freeport Cobalt of $32.9 million, partially offset by investments in mineral properties, plant and equipment of $277.7 million and interest paid on the senior secured notes of $77.5 million. The Company has a revolving credit facility available for borrowing up to $350 million. As at December 31, 2015, the Company had no amount drawn on the credit facility. A letter of credit in the amount of $19.4 million (SEK 162 million) is outstanding. Net debt as of February 18, 2016 was approximately $458 million. Outlook Market Conditions The Company is advancing production optimizations, cost savings and cost deferrals that are expected to protect cash flows and profits in 2016 and which are reflected in the guidance outlined below. To the extent that base metals markets improve, spending restraint plans will be re-assessed as certain expenditures and deferrals would be reconsidered in a moderately stronger metal price environment. 2016 Production and Cost Guidance With the exception of Tenke, production and costs guidance remains unchanged from that provided on January 21, 2016 (see news release entitled \"Lundin Mining Announces 2015 Production Results and Provides Operating and Capital Guidance\"). Guidance on Tenke's copper production and cash costs have been updated to reflect the most recent guidance from Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (\"Freeport\"). (contained tonnes) Tonnes Cash Costsa Copper Candelaria (80%) 118,000 - 123,000 $1.55/lb Eagle 20,000 - 23,000 Neves-Corvo 50,000 - 55,000 $1.65/lb Zinkgruvan 3,500 - 4,000 Tenke (24%)b 54,000 $1.32/lb Total attributable 245,500 - 259,000 Nickel Eagle 21,000 - 24,000 $2.25/lb Zinc Neves-Corvo 65,000 - 70,000 Zinkgruvan 80,000 - 85,000 $0.45/lb Total 145,000 - 155,000 Cash costs remain dependent upon exchange rates (forecast at EUR/USD:1.10, USD/SEK:8.50, USD/CLP:700) and metal prices (forecast at Cu: $2.05/lb, Ni: $4.15/lb, Zn: $0.70/lb, Pb: $0.70/lb, Au: $1,100/oz, Ag: $15.00/oz). Freeport has provided 2016 sales and cash costs guidance. Tenke's 2016 production is assumed to approximate sales guidance. Tenke's 2016 cash costs assume a cobalt price of $10.00/lb. Commentary on 2016 Production Guidance by Mine Candelaria: Attributable share of Candelaria production is expected to decline modestly from 2015 production levels, which benefited from better rock fragmentation and softer ore. Gold and silver production are expected to remain as significant by-product credits. Eagle: Consistent with original plans, year over year production levels of nickel and copper are expected to gradually decline as the highest grade ore is mined early in the mine plan. Neves-Corvo: Copper production is expected to be maintained above 50,000 tonnes per annum with a significant zinc by-product credit. The zinc expansion project has not been reflected in this outlook. Lead by-products are expected to increase as Lombador zinc ore is mined. Zinkgruvan: Planned expansion activities were initiated in 2015, but are not expected to impact production until the end of 2017. Tenke: Freeport expects 2016 copper cathode sales of 224,500 tonnes, an increase of about 10% over 2015 production. Cobalt sales are expected to remain relatively unchanged at 15,900 tonnes. 2016 Capital Expenditure Guidance Capital expenditures, excluding capitalized interest, are expected to be $220 million (excluding Tenke), lower than the $275 million of capital expenditures in 2015, as part of on-going efforts to defer or reduce non-essential spending as long as base metal prices remain low. Sustaining Capital: Americas: $130 million ($179 million in 2015), consisting of approximately $120 million for Candelaria, of which approximately $35 million is for capitalized stripping activities in the open pit, $70 million for construction of the expanded tailings storage facility project, and $15 million for replacement and rebuild of equipment and infrastructure, and $10 million for Eagle which is predominantly for underground development. Europe: $82 million ($86 million in 2015). Neves-Corvo's $55 million capital spending program includes approximately $20 million for underground development, $12 million for commencement of a water treatment plant, $10 million for replacement and rebuild of equipment and the balance for miscellaneous other sustaining capital investment and small projects. Zinkgruvan is expected to spend approximately $15 million for underground development and $12 million on expanded tailings storage and miscellaneous other sustaining capital investment and small projects. New Investment: $8 million ($10 million in 2015) for a processing plant expansion at Zinkgruvan. Exploration Investment The Company's exploration expenditures (not including Tenke) are expected to be in the range of $40 million in 2016 (2015 - $52 million). The majority of the planned activity is expected to be directed towards near mine targets at Candelaria and Eagle. Tenke The Company estimates its share of sustaining capital funding for 2016 at $25 million ($67 million in 2015). All of Tenke's capital expenditures and exploration programs are expected to be self-funded by cash flow from operations. At current metal prices, the Company believes it is reasonable to expect Lundin Mining's attributable cash distributions to range between $30 to $40 million in 2016, taking into account self-funding of capital and other expenditures such as exploration. Final decisions on capital investments and the amounts and timing of any cash distributions for 2016 are ultimately made by Freeport, the mine's operator.

Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc. (TSE: POT) Who we are PotashCorp is the world's largest fertilizer company by capacity, producing the three primary crop nutrients: potash (K), nitrogen (N) and phosphate (P). We are the world's leading potash producer by capacity and our Canadian operations represent nearly one-fifth of global capacity1. To enhance our global footprint, we also have investments in four potash-related businesses in South America, the Middle East and Asia. With operations and business interests in seven countries, PotashCorp is an international enterprise and plays an important role in helping the world grow the food it needs. What we produce Our potash, phosphate and nitrogen products help provide the primary nutrients that crops need. They are also used to make livestock feeds and industrial goods. Produced from mineral deposits (potash and phosphate) and from the air we breathe (nitrogen), our main products are: potash, in standard and granular grades DAP (diammonium phosphate), MAP (monoammonium phosphate) and phosphoric acid Ammonia and urea Why fertilizer? With world population rising, arable land per person diminishing and demand increasing for higher quality diets that include more fruits and vegetables and protein from crop-fed livestock, the need to maximize the efficiency of farmland has never been greater. Every crop harvested removes nutrients from the soil, which must be replaced to keep soil healthy and productive. Responsible for more than 40 percent of the world's total crop yield, fertilizers feed plants, which help to feed animals and people. Where we serve Our products serve customers throughout the global marketplace from China, the world's most populous nation and largest fertilizer consumer, to India, with its 1.2 billion people. From Latin America an agricultural superpower to the rice and oil palm producing fields of Other Asian countries and the breadbasket markets of North America. Together these five regions account for nearly three-quarters of the world's population and roughly 80 percent of the total fertilizer consumption. Delivering when we're needed As the world's food challenges become more pressing, we're taking an active role in meeting them, investing heavily in our assets to deliver quality product when and where our customers need it. We are adding to our current potash capacity without building a new mine - an advantage as demand is expected to rise. And through our partnerships and investments, we strive to better serve customers in emerging markets. How we do business We hold ourselves to the highest business standards and consider factors beyond financial performance when evaluating our success. Guided by our Core Values, we cultivate mutually beneficial relationships with our communities, customers, employees, investors and other people critical to our success. Acting with a long-term view, we make decisions that consider people and the planet, always looking for opportunities to improve. 28 January 2016 Q4 & Year-End: PotashCorp Reports Full-Year 2015 Earnings of $1.52 per Share Key Highlights Fourth-quarter earnings of $0.24 per share1; full-year total of $1.52 per share Annual cash provided by operating activities of $2.3 billion Indefinite suspension of Picadilly, New Brunswick potash operation in January 2016 Quarterly dividend reduced by 34 percent to $0.25 per share Full-year 2016 guidance of $0.90-$1.20 per share; $0.10-$0.20 for the first quarter CEO Commentary \"Weaker fertilizer prices late in the year reduced our earnings for the quarter, giving rise to a more cautious outlook for all three nutrients as we begin 2016,\" said PotashCorp President and Chief Executive Officer Jochen Tilk. \"Against this backdrop, our focus has been not only to navigate these challenges but to further strengthen our company for the future by: supporting our longstanding potash business model, including matching supply to demand; enhancing our best-in-class assets; and protecting our long-term financial health and flexibility. \"We made the very difficult decisions to suspend potash production in New Brunswick and realign our dividend. These actions are part of our thoughtful and holistic approach to strategically position the company and balance the interests of our shareholders, debtholders, employees and communities who depend on our enduring success. Longer term, we maintain our conviction that the drivers of fertilizer demand - rising global crop production and supportive farmer economics - will support improved market conditions.\" Saskatoon, Saskatchewan - Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc. (PotashCorp) reported fourth-quarter earnings of $0.24 per share ($201 million), bringing earnings for the full year to $1.52 per share ($1.3 billion). These totals for the quarter and full year trailed the $0.49 per share ($407 million) and $1.82 per share ($1.5 billion) earned in the same periods of 2014. Gross margin for the quarter ($386 million) and the year ($2.3 billion) was below 2014 levels ($746 million and $2.6 billion, respectively), due primarily to weaker nitrogen prices and lower potash volumes. Cash from operating activities of $623 million for the quarter and $2.3 billion for the year was below 2014 results by 13 percent and 11 percent, respectively. Quarterly and annual earnings before finance costs, income taxes and depreciation and amortization (EBITDA)2 of $482 million and $2.6 billion, respectively, were also lower than in the comparable periods of 2014. Investments in Arab Potash Company (APC) in Jordan, Israel Chemicals Ltd. (ICL) in Israel and Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile S.A. (SQM) in Chile contributed $27 million to our quarterly earnings, trailing the $31 million generated in the fourth quarter of 2014. Our earnings for the year from these three investments - plus a dividend from Sinofert Holdings Limited (Sinofert) in China - totaled $162 million, below the $210 million earned in 2014, which included a special dividend from ICL. The market value of our investments in these four publicly traded companies was approximately $3.5 billion, or $4 per PotashCorp share, at market close on January 27, 2016. Market Conditions Challenging conditions, including currency weakness relative to the US dollar in emerging markets, continued to weigh on fertilizer markets through the fourth quarter. Cautious buying patterns resulted in deteriorating prices across all three nutrients as the year ended. Global potash shipments for the fourth quarter remained relatively flat compared to 2014, with increased deliveries to China offsetting slightly weaker demand in most other markets. Nitrogen markets continued to feel the effects of falling energy prices. Lower production costs in key producing regions increased competitive supply, which - combined with a weaker-than-normal fall application season in the US and slower demand in Brazil - caused prices for nearly all nitrogen products to trend lower during the quarter. In phosphate, record Chinese exports, seasonally slow demand in India and the US and continued caution in Brazil weighed on prices for solid fertilizers. Prices for feed, industrial, and liquid fertilizer products were more resilient, supported by strong demand and tighter supply. Potash Reduced sales volumes and a softening price environment - particularly in the second half of 2015 - resulted in gross margin of $183 million for the quarter and $1.3 billion for the year, below 2014's comparative totals of $445 million and $1.4 billion, respectively. Sales volumes for both the quarter (down 31 percent) and the year (down 6 percent) trailed those achieved in the same periods of 2014. The most significant decline for both the quarter and full year was in North America, which reflected a pullback in demand from 2014's especially strong levels, as well as increased competition. Offshore, the majority of Canpotex's3 shipments for the quarter were to China (40 percent) and Other Asian markets outside of China and India (30 percent), while Latin America and India accounted for 18 percent and 4 percent, respectively. Our average realized potash price for the quarter was $238 per tonne, down considerably from $284 per tonne in the same period last year, reflecting the declining price environment in 2015. Inventory-related shutdowns at our Saskatchewan mines and the closure of our Penobsquis, New Brunswick operation reduced production volumes and resulted in per-tonne cost of goods sold for the quarter of $132, which was 26 percent higher than in the comparable period in 2014. For the year, per-tonne cost of goods sold of $111 was relatively flat with the previous year as the favorable impact of a weaker Canadian dollar was offset primarily by increased shutdown weeks. Nitrogen In nitrogen, weaker prices had a negative impact on our results for the fourth quarter and the full year. Gross margin of $142 million for the quarter and $706 million for the year trailed results from the same periods in 2014 by 39 percent and 30 percent, respectively. Our US operations accounted for 61 percent of our nitrogen gross margin for the quarter, with Trinidad providing the remainder. Sales volumes of 1.6 million tonnes for the quarter were similar to those in the same period of 2014. Extended expansion-related downtime, coupled with weaker demand, resulted in sales volumes for 2015 of 5.9 million tonnes, down 7 percent from the previous year. Our average realized price of $288 per tonne during the quarter was down significantly from the $405 per tonne achieved in the same period last year as lower energy costs and increased global supply weighed heavily on prices for all nitrogen products. Cost of goods sold for the fourth quarter was $199 per tonne, down 21 percent from 2014, driven largely by lower natural gas costs in the US and Trinidad. Phosphate Gross margin for the quarter totaled $61 million, down slightly from the $67 million earned during the same period last year, due to lower sales volumes and price realizations. For the year, we generated $241 million, up from the $202 million earned in 2014, primarily due to increased prices for liquid fertilizers. For the quarter, sales volumes of 0.8 million tonnes were relatively flat compared to the same period in 2014, while volumes for the year of 2.9 million tonnes trailed 2014, due primarily to the absence of production from the Suwannee River chemical plant. Our average realized phosphate price for the fourth quarter of $522 per tonne was similar to 2014's as improved prices for liquid fertilizers offset declining prices for DAP and MAP. Per-tonne cost of goods sold was $443 for the quarter, similar to last year. Financial Provincial mining and other taxes of $46 million for the quarter were lower than the $82 million in the same period last year, due to weaker potash earnings. For the year, provincial mining and other taxes totaled $310 million, 21 percent more than in 2014 because of a weaker Canadian dollar and changes in the timing of allowable deductions within Saskatchewan's potash taxation regulations. Income tax expense for the fourth quarter ($69 million) and full year ($451 million) was down from the same periods last year due primarily to lower earnings. Potash Market Outlook We expect global potash shipments in the range of 59-62 million tonnes, in line with 2015's total of approximately 60 million tonnes. In North America, lower dealer inventories and significant nutrient requirements following consecutive years of large crops are expected to support growth of potash shipments in 2016 to a range of 9.2-9.7 million tonnes In Latin America, we expect agronomic need and favorable crop economics to keep demand at elevated levels, although credit availability and currency weakness are anticipated to keep growth in this market relatively modest. For the full year, we forecast shipments of 10.8-11.3 million tonnes, slightly above 2015 levels. In China, elevated inventories are likely to keep demand below 2015's record of more than 15.0 million tonnes. We anticipate shipments in the range of 13.5-14.5 million tonnes, with strong consumption trends for bulk blends and compound fertilizers continuing. Demand in India is expected to strengthen in 2016. We forecast deliveries of 4.2-4.7 million tonnes to this market, a slight increase from 2015 when a weak monsoon and currency issues reduced demand late in the year. In Other Asian markets, supportive crop economics and substantial agronomic need are expected to keep demand fairly robust in 2016. We anticipate deliveries in the range of 8.5-8.8 million tonnes, slightly above 2015 levels. Financial Outlook Based on these market factors, we anticipate our 2016 potash sales volumes will be in the range of 8.3-9.1 million tonnes. For the year, we forecast potash gross margin of $0.8-$1.1 billion, down significantly from 2015 as the sharp decline in potash prices through the second half of that year is expected to weigh on margins in 2016. Our guidance reflects the suspension of our Picadilly potash operations announced in mid-January, including favorable impacts on our cost of goods sold of $40-$50 million and reduced capital expenditures of $50 million. The company has concluded that the announced change will not result in any impairment charges although our guidance does reflect approximately $35 million in severance and transition costs expected to be recorded in the first quarter of 2016. In nitrogen, we expect improved operating rates at our US facilities and our recently completed Lima nitrogen expansion to increase our sales volumes in 2016. Despite higher sales volumes and reduced costs from lower natural gas prices, a weaker pricing environment - driven by an increase in competitive supply - is expected to result in considerably lower gross margin. In phosphate, we anticipate weaker market fundamentals will keep prices for most products below 2015 levels, although our historically more stable feed and industrial products are forecast to be less impacted. We expect lower input costs and our focus on improved reliability will reduce costs and increase the amount of product available for sale, which we anticipate will help keep gross margin at a level similar to 2015. Given these considerations, we forecast combined nitrogen and phosphate gross margin will be in the range of $0.7-$0.9 billion in 2016. We estimate provincial mining and other taxes in the range of 22-24 percent of potash gross margin, similar to the 2015 percentage. Based on these factors, we forecast full-year 2016 earnings of $0.90-$1.20 per share, including first-quarter earnings of $0.10-$0.20 per share. Our quarterly guidance reflects the severance and transition charges related to the suspension of production at Picadilly and an expectation of some potash demand being deferred to the second quarter. Other annual guidance numbers - including those noted above - are outlined in the table below. 2016 Guidance Earnings per share Annual: $0.90-$1.20 Q1: $0.10-$0.20 Potash sales volumes 8.3-9.1 million tonnes Potash gross margin $0.8-$1.1 billion Nitrogen and phosphate gross margin $0.7-$0.9 billion Capital expenditures* $0.8-$0.9 billion Effective tax rate 25-27 percent Provincial mining and other taxes** 22-24 percent Selling and administrative expenses $240-$250 million Finance costs $210-$220 million Income from offshore equity investments*** $120-$140 million Annual Foreign Exchange Rate CDN$1.38 per US$ Annual EPS sensitivity to Foreign Exchange US$ strengthens vs. CDN$ by $0.02 = +$0.01 EPS * Does not include capitalized interest ** As a percentage of potash gross margin *** Includes income from dividends and share of equity earnings Dividend Our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend of US $0.25 per share payable May 3, 2016 to shareholders of record April 12, 2016. \"We are committed to preserving a strong balance sheet and investment-grade credit rating, but also believe in retaining a competitive dividend. In consideration of these objectives, we have decided to reduce our quarterly dividend by 34 percent,\" said Tilk. \"We believe this level - representing a payout ratio of close to 100 percent of 2016 earnings - remains highly competitive and balances the interests of our many stakeholders, including equity and debtholders.\" Notes All references to per-share amounts pertain to diluted net income per share.

ANOTHER RECORD QUARTER OF SILVER EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION AND SALES VOLUME FOR SILVER WHEATON IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2015 11/03/2015 VANCOUVER, Nov. 3, 2015 /CNW/ - Silver Wheaton Corp. (\"Silver Wheaton\" or the \"Company\") (TSX: SLW) (NYSE:SLW) is pleased to announce its unaudited results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2015. All figures are presented in United States dollars unless otherwise noted. Silver Wheaton achieved record production for a third quarter in a row and record sales volume for a second quarter in a row, driven by record production at Salobo and Penasquito and record sales volume at San Dimas. In addition, the ramp-up of production at Salobo and Constancia continue to progress as expected. THIRD QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS Record attributable silver equivalent production in Q3 2015 of 11.0 million ounces (6.9 million ounces of silver and 54,500 ounces of gold), compared with 8.9 million ounces in Q3 2014, representing an increase of 24%. Record silver equivalent sales volume in Q3 2015 of 10.2 million ounces (6.6 million ounces of silver and 48,100 ounces of gold), compared with 8.7 million ounces in Q3 2014, representing an increase of 17%. During the three month period ending September 30, 2015, payable silver equivalent ounces attributable to the Company produced but not yet delivered decreased by 0.1 million ounces to approximately 6.3 million ounces.  Revenues of $153.3 million in Q3 2015 compared with $165.9 million in Q3 2014, representing a decrease of 8%. Average realized sale price per silver equivalent ounce sold in Q3 2015 of $15.03 ($15.05 per ounce of silver and $1,130 per ounce of gold), compared with $18.98 in Q3 2014, representing a decrease of 21%. Adjusted net earnings1 of $49.8 million ($0.12 per share) in Q3 2015 compared with $72.6 million ($0.20 per share) in Q3 2014, representing a decrease of 31%. During the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $154.0 million related to its 777 silver and gold interest. After including the after tax impact of the impairment charge, net loss of $95.9 million ($0.24 per share) in Q3 2015 compared with net earnings of $4.5 million ($0.01 per share) in Q3 2014.1 Operating cash flows of $99.5 million ($0.25 per share1) in Q3 2015 compared with $120.4 million ($0.34 per share1) in Q3 2014, representing a decrease of 17%. Cash operating margin1 in Q3 2015 of $10.45 per silver equivalent ounce compared with $14.39 in Q3 2014, representing a decrease of 27%. Average cash costs1 in Q3 2015 were $4.26 and $389 per ounce of silver and gold, respectively. On a silver equivalent basis, average cash costs1 decreased to $4.58 compared with $4.59 in Q3 2014. Declared quarterly dividend of $0.05 per common share. On September 18, 2015, the Company announced that it had received TSX approval for a normal course issuer bid (\"NCIB\") of up to 5% of the Company's outstanding Common Shares. To date, the Company has purchased 764,789 shares under the NCIB. On September 24, 2015, the Company announced that it had received Notices of Reassessment from the Canada Revenue Agency (the \"CRA\") for the 2005 to 2010 taxation years (the \"Relevant Taxation Years\"). Subsequent to the quarter, Silver Wheaton filed notices of objection for each of the Relevant Taxation Years. Asset Highlights Salobo had record attributable production of almost 33,000 ounces of gold net to Silver Wheaton in Q3, and the ongoing ramp-up continues to be on track to achieve 100% utilization in Q4 2015. Record attributable production from Penasquito. Record sale volume from San Dimas. Events Subsequent to the Quarter Silver Wheaton agreed to acquire from a subsidiary of Glencore Plc (\"Glencore\") an amount of silver equal to 33.75% of the silver production until delivery of 140 million ounces of silver and 22.5% of the silver production thereafter for the life of mine from the Antamina mine for an upfront cash consideration of US$900 million and ongoing payments of 20% of spot price per silver ounce delivered. \"Silver Wheaton hit record production for a third consecutive quarter, as the company produced 11 million silver equivalent ounces in the third quarter alone. Our cornerstone assets delivered solid results with Penasquito and Salobo setting new production records. With over 32 million ounces produced year to date, we remain well on track to deliver on our original production growth guidance of over 20% in 2015,\" said Randy Smallwood, President and Chief Executive Officer of Silver Wheaton. \"Clearly, not everything has been smooth sailing, as we have also faced persistently low commodity prices, along with the receipt of the Notices of Reassessment from the CRA. I once again want to reiterate our confidence in our structure and that we will vigorously defend our tax filing position; as such, we have filed notices of objections with the CRA in regards to the Reassessments.\" \"While our cornerstone operations have performed exceptionally well, we did take an impairment charge on 777 in the third quarter due to lack of exploration success combined with lower commodity prices. While the low commodity price environment has had its challenges, it has also created some great opportunities. This is clearly evidenced by the announcement of our acquisition of a silver stream on Antamina, one of the lowest cost, largest copper mines in the world. Antamina is an ideal asset for Silver Wheaton, one that readily fits in to our portfolio of top tier assets.\" Financial Review Revenues Revenue was $153.3 million in the third quarter of 2015, on silver equivalent sales of 10.2 million ounces (6.6 million ounces of silver and 48,100 ounces of gold). This represents an 8% decrease from the $165.9 million of revenue generated in the third quarter of 2014 due primarily to a 21% decrease in the average realized silver equivalent price ($15.03 in Q3 2015 compared with $18.98 in Q3 2014), partially offset by a 17% increase in the number of silver equivalent ounces sold. Costs and Expenses Average cash costs1 in the third quarter of 2015 were $4.58 per silver equivalent ounce as compared with $4.59 during the comparable period of 2014. This resulted in a cash operating margin1 of $10.45 per silver equivalent ounce, a reduction of 27% as compared with Q3 2014. The decrease in the cash operating margin was primarily due to a 21% decrease in the average realized silver equivalent price in Q3 2015 compared with Q3 2014. Earnings and Operating Cash Flows Adjusted net earnings1 and cash flow from operations in the third quarter of 2015 were $49.8 million ($0.12 per share) and $99.5 million ($0.25 per share1), compared with $72.6 million ($0.20 per share) and $120.4 million ($0.34 per share1) for the same period in 2014, a decrease of 31% and 17%, respectively. Earnings and cash flow continued to be impacted by lower gold and silver prices. Balance Sheet At September 30, 2015, the Company had approximately $81 million of cash on hand and $647 million outstanding under the Company's $2 billionrevolving term loan. On September 18, 2015 the Company announced it had received TSX approval to purchase up to 20,229,671 common shares (representing 5% of the Company's 404,593,425 total issued and outstanding common shares as of September 11, 2015) over a period of twelve months commencing onSeptember 23, 2015. The NCIB will expire no later than September 22, 2016.  During the three months ended September 30, 2015 the Company purchased 119,400 shares under the NCIB at an average price of $12.26 per share.  Subsequent to September 30, 2015, the Company purchased an additional 645,389 shares under the NCIB at an average price of $11.86 per share.  Asset Impairment On August 8, 2012, the Company entered into an agreement with Hudbay Minerals Inc. (\"Hudbay\") to acquire an amount equal to 100% of the silver and gold production from its currently producing 777 mine, located in Canada, until the end of 2016, and 100% of the silver and 50% of the gold production for the remainder of the mine life. During the third quarter of 2015, the Company's management was informed that as a result of an unsuccessful drilling program at 777, Hudbay's management believes that the mine life for 777 is unlikely to be extended beyond 2020.  As a result, during the third quarter of 2015, the estimate of future production from 777 was reduced, with this reduction representing an indicator of impairment related to the 777 silver and gold interests.  At September 30, 2015, Silver Wheaton's management estimated that the recoverable amount under the 777 silver and gold interests was$147.5 million, representing its fair value less cost to sell and resulting in an impairment charge of $154.0 million.     CRA Audit Update On July 6, 2015, the Company announced that it had received a proposal letter (the \"Proposal\") from the CRA in which the CRA was proposing to reassess Silver Wheaton under the transfer pricing provisions contained in the Income Tax Act (Canada) (the \"Act\"). Subsequent to the issuance of the Proposal, on September 24, 2015, the Company announced that it had received Notices of Reassessment (the \"Reassessments\") from the CRA for the 2005 to 2010 taxation years (the \"Relevant Taxation Years\"). The Reassessments are consistent with the Proposal and seek to increase the Company's income subject to tax in Canada for the Relevant Taxation Years by approximately Cdn$715.3 million which would result in federal and provincial tax of approximately Cdn$201.3 million. In addition, the CRA is seeking to impose transfer pricing penalties of approximately Cdn$71.5 million and interest and other penalties of Cdn$80.6 million for the Relevant Taxation Years. Total tax, interest and penalties sought by the CRA for the Relevant Taxation Years isCdn$353.4 million. The CRA's position in the Reassessments is that the transfer pricing provisions of the Act relating to income earned by the Company's foreign subsidiaries outside of Canada should apply such that the income of Silver Wheaton subject to tax in Canada should be increased by substantially all of the income of the Company's foreign subsidiaries. Management believes that the Company has filed its tax returns and paid applicable taxes in compliance with Canadian tax law, and as a result no amounts have been recorded for any potential liability arising from this matter. Silver Wheaton intends to vigorously defend its tax filing positions. As such, subsequent to September 30, 2015, Silver Wheaton has filed notices of objection for each of the Relevant Taxation Years.  The Company will be required to make a deposit of Cdn$176.7 million representing 50% of the reassessed amounts of tax, interest and penalties. Silver Wheaton will seek to post security in the form of a letter of credit for this amount as opposed to a cash deposit. Cash that has been deposited in respect of a reassessment will be refunded, plus interest, if the Company is ultimately successful in challenging that reassessment. Events Subsequent to the Quarter Antamina Subsequent to the quarter, Silver Wheaton, through its wholly owned subsidiary Silver Wheaton (Caymans) Ltd. (\"SWC\"), has agreed to acquire fromAnani Investments Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Glencore plc (\"Glencore\") an amount of silver equal to 33.75% of the silver production until delivery of 140 million ounces of silver and 22.5% of silver production thereafter for the life of mine silver production from the Antamina mine, located in Peru. SWC will pay Glencore cash consideration of US$900 million for the silver stream. In addition, SWC will make ongoing payments of 20% of spot price per silver ounce delivered. The silver stream is effective September 30, 2015, and as a result, production and sales attributable to Silver Wheaton are forecast for the fourth quarter of 2015. Silver production is expected to average 4.7 million ounces per year over the first 20 years. Closing of the transaction is expected to occur prior to the end of November 2015 and is subject to the completion of certain corporate matters and customary conditions.  (See Silver Wheaton's November 3, 2015 news release for full details.) Third Quarter Asset Highlights During the third quarter of 2015, attributable silver equivalent production was 11.0 million ounces (6.9 million ounces of silver and 54,500 ounces of gold), representing an increase of 24% compared with the third quarter of 2014. Operational highlights for the quarter ended September 30, 2015, are as follows: Salobo In the third quarter of 2015, Salobo produced a record 32,954 ounces of gold attributable to Silver Wheaton, an increase of approximately 216% relative to the third quarter of 2014. This increase was primarily due to the doubling of the percentage of gold that Silver Wheaton is entitled to and the increased throughput as a result of the expansion to 24 million tonnes per annum, which commenced production in mid-2014. According to Vale's third quarter of 2015 production report, the ramp-up of Salobo was weaker than expected in July and August but recovered in September with capacity utilization exceeding 90%. Salobo is expected to achieve 100% capacity utilization in the fourth quarter. Constancia In the third quarter of 2015, Constancia produced approximately 4,341 ounces of gold and 0.7 million ounces of silver attributable to Silver Wheaton as the mine declared commercial production on April 30, 2015, and it continues to ramp-up as expected. Penasquito  In the third quarter of 2015, Penasquito produced a record 2.1 million ounces of silver attributable to Silver Wheaton, an increase of approximately 28% relative to the third quarter of 2014 due to higher grades being mined as substantial mining took place in the heart of the deposit. As disclosed inGoldcorp Inc.'s (\"Goldcorp\") third quarter of 2015 MD&A, construction of the Northern Well Field project remained suspended throughout the third quarter of 2015 due to an illegal blockade by a local community.  Penasquito continues to seek a fair resolution of this matter with the community, while taking steps to enforce its contractual rights. Penasquito is also advancing alternatives for completion of the project without crossing through the affected community lands. Goldcorp believes that there will be timely resolution of this matter to meet the future water needs of Penasquito. The Metallurgical Enhancement Project feasibility study remains on schedule to be completed in early 2016.  San Dimas In the third quarter of 2015, attributable production from San Dimas was 1.4 million ounces of silver, an increase of approximately 22% relative to the third quarter of 2014.2 This growth was primarily due to increased production as a result of the expansion to 2,500 tonnes per day (tpd), which was completed early in 2014, as well as to the sharing threshold increasing to 6 million ounces3, partially offset by the cessation of Goldcorp's four-year obligation to deliver 1.5 million ounces of silver to the Company on August 6, 2014. Silver sales in the third quarter of 2015 from San Dimas were a record 2.0 million ounces, an increase of 72% relative to the third quarter of 20142, as silver inventories built up in the second quarter of 2014 were subsequently sold. As at September 30, 2015, approximately 0.2 million ounces of cumulative payable silver ounces have been produced at San Dimas but not yet delivered to the Company, representing a decrease of 0.6 million payable silver ounces during the third quarter of 2015. As reported by Primero on July 6, 2015, silver deliveries in the second quarter had been delayed due to the suspension of Primero's import and export licenses in May 2015 by the Mexican customs authorities due to a discrepancy over Primero's address related to its corporate office relocation from Mexico City to Durango, Mexico. As per Primero's August 6, 2015, news release, the import and export license was reinstated and normal course imports and exports resumed, including the sales of all inventoried silver. Finally, as per Primero's third quarter of 2015 MD&A, during the third quarter, Primero achieved key milestones at both the San Dimas mine and the mill, tracking towards the completion of its expansion from 2,500 tpd to 3,000 tpd by the accelerated April 2016 completion date. Primero successfully connected the tunnel between the Sinaloa-Graben and Central mining blocks, providing a critical de-bottlenecking in the flow of machinery through theSan Dimas mine. At the San Dimas mill, Primero has completed the construction of foundations for the new secondary crusher and demolition of the old foundry is well advanced. The installation of the additional tailings pump is now complete and control has been handed over to the operations team.  The new tailings filter and thickener are also in the process of fabrication and remain on-schedule for delivery to site in Q1 2016. Sudbury In the third quarter of 2015, attributable gold production from Vale's Sudbury mine was 5,967 ounces, a decrease of approximately 51% relative to the third quarter of 2014.  According to Vale's third quarter of 2015 production report, the decrease was primarily due to planned maintenance shutdowns in the Sudbury surface plants in August 2015. As per Vale, key work completed as part of the shutdown encompassed the rebuild of the SAG mill, the overhaul of the acid plant in preparation for the implementation of the AER project (atmospheric emissions reduction project), and the upgrade of the environmental equipment at the Copper Cliff Nickel Refinery. It should also be noted that production in Q3 2014 was at an elevated level, as Vale processed large inventories of feed stock that had built up in Q2 2014 due to planned maintenance of surface facilities.  Yauliyacu In the third quarter of 2015, attributable silver production from Yauliyacu was 0.7 million ounces, a decrease of approximately 20% relative to the third quarter of 2014, primarily due to lower grade being mined in the quarter. Barrick In the third quarter of 2015, attributable silver production from Barrick was 0.5 million ounces, an increase of approximately 27% relative to the third quarter of 2014, primarily due to higher grades at the Veladero mine and higher recoveries at the Lagunas Norte mine. 777 In the third quarter of 2015, 777 produced approximately 6,330 ounces of gold and 0.1 million ounces of silver attributable to Silver Wheaton, a decrease of approximately 48% and 37%, respectively, relative to the third quarter of 2014 primarily due to lower throughput and grades. Other Minto: In the third quarter of 2015, attributable gold production from Minto was 4,920 ounces, a decrease of approximately 29% relative to the third quarter of 2014, primarily due to lower grade being mined in the quarter.  According to Capstone Mining Corp.'s (\"Capstone\") third quarter production results, the Minto mill processed solely underground and stockpiled ore while transitioning to the next open pit mining area. In addition, Capstone reported that the Yukon Water Board issued the final Water Use Licence on August 5, 2015, and that stripping of the Minto North open pit commenced immediately. Stripping of Minto North is reportedly on schedule for first ore to the mill starting in December 2015, with high grade ore commencing in the second quarter of 2016.   Stratoni: In the third quarter of 2015, attributable silver production from Stratoni was 0.1 million ounces, a decrease of approximately 52% relative to the third quarter of 2014, primarily due to lower throughput as a result of fewer production stopes available in the mine as well as a five week suspension of operations in the quarter.  As per Eldorado Gold Corporation's (\"Eldorado\") news release dated August 20, 2015, operations at the Stratoni mine were temporarily suspended as a direct result of the revocation by Greece's Ministry of Energy of the technical studies of Eldorado's projects in Halkidiki,Greece. As per Eldorado's news release dated October 5, 2015, mining operations have resumed at Halkidiki. Subsequent to the quarter, the Stratoni silver purchase agreement dated April 23, 2007, was amended in order to incentivize additional exploration and potentially extend the limited remaining mine life of Stratoni. The primary modification is to increase the production price per ounce of silver delivered to SWC over the current fixed price by one of the following amounts: i) US$2.50 if 10,000 meters of drilling is completed outside of the existing ore body and within SWC's defined area of interest (\"Expansion Drilling\"), ii) US$5.00 if 20,000 meters of Expansion Drilling is completed, and iii) US$7.00 if 30,000 meters of Expansion Drilling is completed. Drilling in all three cases must be completed by December 31, 2020, in order for the agreed upon increase in production price to be initiated.4 Produced But Not Yet Delivered 5  As at September 30, 2015, payable silver equivalent ounces produced but not yet delivered to Silver Wheaton by its partners decreased by 0.1 million ounces to approximately 6.3 million silver equivalent payable ounces, as increases at Salobo and Constancia were more than offset by decreases at San Dimas, 777 and Penasquito. Payable ounces produced but not yet delivered to Silver Wheaton are expected to average approximately two to three months of annualized production but may vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of mining operation factors including mine ramp-up, delays in shipments, and so forth. Detailed mine by mine production and sales figures can be found in the Appendix to this press release and in Silver Wheaton's MD&A in the 'Results of Operations and Operational Review' section. Sherritt International Corporation (S: TSX) Sherritt is a world leader in the mining and refining of nickel from lateritic ores with projects and operations in Canada, Cuba and Madagascar.  The Corporation is the largest independent energy producer in Cuba, with extensive oil and power operations on the island. Sherritt licenses its proprietary technologies and provides metallurgical services to commercial metals operations worldwide. The Corporation's common shares are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol \"S\". Sherritt is committed to the highest standards of environment, health and safety practices at all of its operations, while making valuable contributions to local communities. Sherritt Announces Q4 and Year End 2015 Results February 10, 2016 TORONTO, ON --(Marketwired - February 10, 2016) - NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION TO UNITED STATES NEWSWIRE SERVICES OR FOR DISSEMINATION IN THE UNITED STATES Sherritt International Corporation (\"Sherritt\" or the \"Corporation\") (TSX: S), a world leader in the mining and refining of nickel from lateritic ores, today reported its financial results for the year ended December 31, 2015. \"This has been a year of profound base metal and oil price weakness, with nickel down 40% and fuel oil down 50% in 2015. Operationally, we were able to mitigate these price declines with increased nickel production, significant year over year cost reductions, and prudent, proactive management of our capital spending,\" said David Pathe, President and CEO, Sherritt International. \"Looking to 2016, a healthy balance sheet and maintaining liquidity remain our top priorities, and we will continue to enforce strict cost discipline and allocate capital judiciously.\" Q4 AND YEAR END HIGHLIGHTS (1)(2)(3) The nickel price erosion continued in the fourth quarter, with LME traded nickel hitting a new low of US$3.70/lb before recovering to US$3.93/lb at year end. At these prices and based on Wood Mackenzie published cash cost estimates (C1) for the year ended December 31, 2015, up to 70% of global nickel production is considered to be underwater on a cash cost basis before sustaining capital and debt service costs. Crude oil prices also hit multi-year lows, with WTI prices ending the year at US$36.60 per barrel, and Gulf Coast Fuel Oil 6 ending the year at US$21.80 per barrel. Preserving cash has been the Corporation's highest priority in the last half of the year, and cost discipline across all operations mitigated cash funding requirements despite the commodity price slide. At year end 2015, the Corporation had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $435.4 million, compared to $373.8 million at the end of Q3 2015. In the fourth quarter, Sherritt drew down an additional $65 million on its credit facilities, which accounted for most of the increased cash position. Adjusting for this drawdown, the cash decrease in the quarter was only approximately $5 million. During the fourth quarter 2015, the challenge period for financial completion expired, confirming that the Ambatovy project financing is now non-recourse to Sherritt and the other partners. Continuing cost discipline paid off in the fourth quarter, with the Moa JV reporting Q4 Net Direct Cash Cost (NDCC) of US$2.90 per pound, the lowest since 2009, and Ambatovy's Q4 NDCC being US$4.07/lb. For the full year, the Moa JV reported NDCC of US$3.88/lb while the Ambatovy JV reported NDCC of US$4.83 per pound. Sherritt's oil production maintained positive margins, with average realized prices of $29.53 per barrel of oil equivalent in Q4 and unit operating costs of $11.64 per barrel on a Gross Working Interest (GWI) basis. For the full year, average realized prices were $38.73 per barrel and unit operating costs were $10.69 per barrel. The Q4 2015 average realized prices were down 40% compared to year ago levels, while on a full year basis, the average realized prices were down 41%. Unit operating costs were stable on a quarterly comparison basis, being down 5% in Q4 2015 compared to the year ago quarter and up 13% for the year compared to 2014. Nickel production was up 8% in Q4 2015 over the prior year quarter, and for the full year was up 14% as the Ambatovy JV ramped up to approximately 80% of design capacity. On a 100% basis, the Metals division produced 80,976 tonnes of finished nickel in 2015. Cobalt production was up 27% in Q4 2015 over Q4 2014, and up 17% on a full year basis to 7,199 tonnes (100% basis). Oil production declined following natural reservoir declines and poor results in the wells drilled on the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) Extension lands. Fourth quarter 2015 Cuban oil production of 17,045 bopd (GWI basis) was down 9% from levels reported a year ago, and on a full year basis, production of 18,257 bopd was down 6% from the 19,456 bopd in 2014. Power production of 226GWh (33 1/3 % basis) in the fourth quarter was up 6% from the comparable quarter of 2014, and on a full year basis, production of 902GWh was also up 6% from the 847 Gwh produced during 2014. Production in 2015 benefited from a full year of power generation from the 150MW Boca de Jaruco Combined Cycle Project which was brought online in February of 2014. All amounts are Canadian dollars unless otherwise indicated. For additional information see the Non-GAAP measures section of this press release. Compared to the same period in the prior year. Shown on Sherritt's attributable share ownership basis. SIGNIFICANT ITEMS In the fourth quarter of 2015, Sherritt reported an impairment expense of $1.6 billion after tax on Ambatovy, consisting of $1.3 billion representing Sherritt's 40% share of Ambatovy's impairment and $0.3 billion from the incremental carrying value of Sherritt's Ambatovy assets, primarily related to mineral rights acquired from Dynatec in 2007. On a 100% base, the recorded impairment expense was US$2.4 billion, and was due to lower forecast nickel prices. This impairment resulted in a breach of the Financial Debt to Equity covenant in our credit facilities, for which waivers were obtained. Ambatovy Financial Completion was announced by press release September 21, 2015. AMBATOVY FUNDING In 2015, Sherritt provided funding to Ambatovy of US$105.6 million. Funding requirements were significantly impacted in the year by principal and interest payments on the Ambatovy Joint Venture Financing. As no funding was provided in Q4, this amount is unchanged from the funding that Sherritt reported at the end of Q3 2015. As a result of achieving financial completion, the US$1.6 billion Ambatovy Joint Venture Financing (balance as at December 31, 2015, 100% basis) became non-recourse to the Ambatovy partners. Pursuant to cash calls due in January, 2016, an additional US$30.0 million was provided to Ambatovy by Sumitomo Corp. and Korea Resources Corp. (KORES). Total cash calls of US$50.0 million were made, with Sherritt not funding its 40% pro-rata share (US$20.0 million). By agreement amongst the partners Sherritt's unfunded amounts remain payable to Ambatovy, with accrued interest. These amounts will be subtracted from future Ambatovy Joint Venture distributions, or may be set off by the Ambatovy Joint Venture against certain other amounts owed to Sherritt. Sherritt also has the option to pay the amounts in cash at any time, at Sherritt's election. Until the funding deficit is cured, and subject to continued discussions with the Ambatovy partners, Sherritt will not be exercising its Ambatovy voting rights. Sherritt determined not to fund further cash calls at this time to preserve liquidity and due to the current structure of the Ambatovy partner loans, which, at current nickel prices, effectively reduce Sherritt's 40% interest in Ambatovy to a 12% economic interest.(1) At this time, Sherritt continues to serve as operator, and constructive discussions are ongoing between partners and senior lenders regarding future funding of Ambatovy and modifications to the existing senior principal amortization. METAL MARKETS Nickel spot prices hit a multi-year low of US$3.70 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2015, and have since traded lower in February. These are price levels not seen since 2003. More significant supply disruptions have started to appear in January, with announced cuts from Votorantim and Mirabela in Brazil, and Panoramic and Mincor in Australia. Coupled with Chinese supply cuts announced in 2015, these cuts could impact 200,000 tonnes of nickel supply in 2016. So far, the LME nickel price has not shown any positive response to the supply cut news, as nickel was one of the worst performers in 2015 and published inventories remain at high levels buffering the impact of any supply disruptions. On the demand side, global stainless demand is estimated to have decreased marginally (by approximately 1.2%) in 2015; however, despite this slowdown, world nickel demand is projected to increase marginally in 2016. High levels of nickel stocks and the strengthening US dollar are factors that may cap price rallies in 2016. Sherritt's Moa JV and Ambatovy JV operations experienced steady demand for their nickel briquettes throughout 2015, despite the negative market sentiment and price decline. Higher nickel grades of stainless steel remain more profitable for steel mills, which is positive for both the Moa and Ambatovy JVs. Moa Joint Venture (50% interest) and Fort Site Adjusted EBITDA of $7.6 million in the fourth quarter was up $5.4 million from the level reported in Q3 2015, despite lower production of finished nickel and lower nickel average realized sales prices. Cost reductions and strong fertilizer sales following their normal seasonal patterns were the main drivers in maintaining Adjusted EBITDA levels that outperformed the weak nickel price environment. Finished nickel production of 4,098 tonnes (50% basis) for the fourth quarter of 2015 was down approximately 5% from production of 4,332 tonnes (50% basis) in the fourth quarter 2014, and down approximately 9% from third quarter production of 4,521 tonnes (50% basis). Moa's operations were negatively impacted late in the third quarter and part of the fourth quarter from unplanned maintenance in High Pressure Acid Leach (HPAL) operations resulting in lower process plant availability. The unplanned maintenance and lower availability was partially attributed to power failures stemming from a newly commissioned national power plant in Moa, which also contributed to premature component failures in the HPAL. Moa has addressed the component failures and taken measures to mitigate the impact of future power disruptions with operations returning to normal by the end of 2015. For the full year, finished nickel production of 16,853 tonnes (50% basis) was up 2% from last year's level. Finished cobalt production of 1,867 tonnes (50% basis) for the full year was up 16% over the prior year, reflecting higher utilization of cobalt-rich feeds. Nickel recovery at Moa has been steady at 89% all year, an improvement over the 87% level recorded for full year 2014. The NDCC of US$2.90 per pound of nickel in the fourth quarter of 2015 was an improvement of 35% (US$1.54 per pound) from the fourth quarter of 2014, and the lowest reported since the third quarter of 2009. The Moa JV continues to demonstrate that it is a world class laterite asset and is well positioned to meet our long term objective of being in the lowest quartile of nickel producers on a C1 basis as the fourth quarter 2015 was well within that target based on latest published data from Wood Mackenzie. For the full year, the Moa JV reported an average NDCC of US$3.88 per pound of nickel, down 22% (US$1.11/lb) from the previous year. In addition to cost reductions realized as a result of lower fuel oil and energy prices, a weaker Canadian dollar relative to the US dollar, and lower third party feed costs, efforts to focus on controllable costs have paid off. Capital spending of $20.5 million in the quarter and $64.1 million year to date is lower than its comparable quarter of 2014, but higher for the year than 2014, due to the once in 10 year planned maintenance shutdown at Fort Saskatchewan in the second quarter of 2015, and a weaker Canadian dollar, along with the expansion capital spent on the construction of the 2,000 tonne per day acid plant which is on track for full operation in the second half of 2016. Full year capital spending of $64.1 million was $10.9 million less than the guidance provided at the end of the third quarter of 2015, with the difference being carried over to the 2016 capital spending estimate coupled with deferrals in response to continual weakness in commodity markets. This year, Sherritt expects capital spending of US$38 million, covering Sherritt's 50% share of the Moa JV and capex required in the Fort Site fertilizer and utilities operations. The capital spending includes completion of the Moa JV acid plant, which has been financed by a Cuban financial institution. Ambatovy Joint Venture (40% interest) Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter was negative $(9.5) million during the quarter compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $ (7.5) million in the same quarter last year. Nickel reference prices averaged US$4.27/lb in the quarter, compared to US$7.17/lb in the same quarter a year ago, and down 11% from the US$4.78/lb average reference price in Q3 this year. Despite the profound slide in nickel prices, higher production and a significantly improved NDCC have mitigated the losses in the quarter. For the full year, Adjusted EBITDA of $ (9.4) million compares with $ (5.5) million last year. During the quarter, finished nickel production was 4885 tonnes (40% basis), down 6% from the Q3 2015 record production, but an improvement of 23% over last year. Finished cobalt production of 386 tonnes (40% basis) was up 39% from its level in the same quarter of 2014, and very close to the 392 tonnes cobalt produced in the third quarter. For the year, Ambatovy performed at close to 80% of design capacity, and twice achieved the \"90 for 90\" production test performance that was necessary to satisfy the financial completion criteria. The test required operating at 90% of design capacity for 90 days within a 100 day continuous period. While production and efficiency milestones were set and achieved in 2015, during the fourth quarter, Sherritt also received confirmation that finished nickel briquettes from Ambatovy qualified for delivery to London Metal Exchange (LME) warehouses. This recognition demonstrates the technical and metallurgical capabilities that Sherritt has contributed as operator during Ambatovy's ramp-up. LME delivery status allows Ambatovy or its customers the flexibility and commercial advantage of delivering nickel product to LME warehouses where logistics benefits exist or to mitigate short term variance in customer demand. LME certification should also have a positive impact on pricing. Ambatovy nickel was sold at an average realized price of $5.52/lb in the quarter (approximately US$4.14/lb at the quarterly average exchange rate), demonstrating that pricing is not suffering from discounting, and is approaching Moa JV average realized prices. The NDCC of nickel was US$4.07 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2015, continuing the strong decreasing trend achieved for each quarter this year, starting from US$5.74 per pound in Q1. Ambatovy is also demonstrating its potential to move into the lowest quartile of industry cash costs. Costs have responded positively to increased production as the operation has ramped up, improvements in maintenance costs and headcount, and falling input commodity prices. For example, autoclave turnaround times had been reduced from 42 days to 21 by the end of the year. In 2016, a two week total plant shutdown is scheduled for Q3, to complete inspections of pressure vessels in accordance with statutory engineering codes, and to carry out major opportune maintenance in various areas of the plant. Capital spending in 2015 was $23.8 million, which was approximately $11.2 million less than the guidance provided in Q3 2015. In 2016, capital spending is estimated to be US$25 million, which includes the continued build-up of mining fleet to support the mine plan, further mine development works including sediment control dam construction, and ongoing tailings dam expansion works. AMBATOVY FUNDING In 2015, Sherritt provided funding to Ambatovy of US$105.6 million. Funding requirements were significantly impacted in the year by principal and interest payments on the Ambatovy Joint Venture Financing. This amount is unchanged from the funding that Sherritt reported at the end of Q3 2015. As a result of achieving financial completion, the US$ 1.6 billion Ambatovy Joint Venture Financing (balance as at December 31, 2015, 100% basis) became non-recourse to the Ambatovy partners. Pursuant to cash calls due in January, 2016, an additional US$30.0 million was provided to Ambatovy by Sumitomo Corp. and Korea Resources Corp. (KORES). Total cash calls of US$50.0 million were made, with Sherritt not funding its 40% pro-rata share (US$20.0 million). By agreement amongst the partners Sherritt's unfunded amounts remain payable to Ambatovy, with accrued interest. These amounts will be subtracted from future Ambatovy Joint Venture distributions, or may be set off by the Ambatovy Joint Venture against certain other amounts owed to Sherritt. Sherritt also has the option to pay the amounts in cash at any time, at Sherritt's election. Until the funding deficit is cured, and subject to continued discussions with the Ambatovy partners, Sherritt will not be exercising its Ambatovy voting rights. Sherritt determined not to fund further cash calls at this time to preserve liquidity and due to the current structure of the Ambatovy partner loans, which, at current nickel prices, effectively reduce Sherritt's 40% interest in Ambatovy to a 12% economic interest.(1) At this time, Sherritt continues to serve as operator, and constructive discussions are ongoing between partners and senior lenders regarding future funding of Ambatovy and modifications to the existing senior principal amortization. Adjusted EBITDA of $9.7 million was 63% ($16.6 million) lower in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year period, with the average reference price for Gulf Fuel Oil 6 falling 52% from its year ago levels. The WTI and Fuel Oil 6 prices have continued to deteriorate since year end, with Gulf Coast Fuel Oil 6 now trading in a range of US$18 - US$21 per barrel in January of 2016. Fourth quarter GWI oil production in Cuba of 17,045 bopd was down 9% from the same quarter a year ago following natural reservoir declines and lower than expected production from the PSC Extension wells drilled earlier in 2015. Fourth quarter NWI oil production in Cuba of 10,145 bopd increased by 3% over the same quarter in 2014 despite the decrease in Cuban GWI oil production. This trend was also evident in the year over year comparison, with GWI oil production in Cuba down 6% for the full year, while net working interest production was up 1%. Cost recovery oil production in Cuba for both the quarter and the full year increased compared to 2014 because of lower oil prices. The allocation of cost recovery barrels in any particular period is limited to a fixed percentage of GWI volumes within each cost pool. Unit operating costs in Cuba increased by 9% ($0.88 per barrel) to $10.82 (GWI basis) for the fourth quarter (up 11% on a full year basis to $9.53 per barrel). This increase in unit operating costs is mainly attributable to lower than expected production combined with a weaker Canadian dollar, offset to some degree by lower workover costs. Quarterly free cash flow of $23.3 million was considerably higher than quarterly Adjusted EBITDA, benefiting from the collection of overdue receivables and limited capital spending. Although overdue receivables are still above normal levels at year end, approximately $48.8 million was collected during the quarter, and a schedule of payments has been agreed with the Cuban agency that shows receivables returning to current by year end 2016. In the third quarter of 2015, an impairment expense of $80.6 million ($0.27 per share) was recorded on Cuban and Spain oil assets in the quarter. The lower oil price forecast, combined with drilling results on the PSC extension that were below expectations, are the reasons for the impairment. Depletion, depreciation and amortization charges in the last quarter of 2015 were reduced accordingly, with Q4 depletion, depreciation and amortization charges of $10.9 million being $6.7 million lower than the Q4 2014 depletion, depreciation and amortization charges of $17.6 million. On a year to date basis, capital spending of $54.5 million is down 17% year over year, as further drilling was stopped in Q3 on the Extension areas after poor drilling results. Although the decision was made to stop further development within the PSC Extension areas, new capital spending is necessary to offset declines in existing production. The outlook for 2016 Cuban oil production of 14,500 bopd (GWI basis) is 21% lower than 2015 production, anticipating continuing natural reservoir declines, and no further drilling planned on the existing PSCs. The original PSCs expire in 2017 and 2018, with future production dependent on the ability to develop new prospective areas within the Cuban oil partnership. Drilling activity for 2016 is focused on the preparation and drilling of Block 10, where Sherritt has budgeted to drill two wells. Block 10 is one of two new PSC's which Sherritt signed in 2014 with the Cuban agency, covering 261 square kilometres for a 25-year term. Sherritt originally held Block 10 in the Bay of Cardenas, and drilled one well in June 1994. The well was drilled using an offshore drilling rig, and produced a discovery which tested at 3,750 barrels of oil per day. Since then, significant advances in horizontal drilling technology have made new drilling from onshore a viable prospect. Power Quarterly Adjusted EBITDA increased by 2% from Q4 2014 levels, while on a full year basis, Adjusted EBITDA was up 21%. Higher gas availability led to higher production, with Sherritt's share being 902 GWh for the full year. Production included the first full year of production from the 150MW Boca de Jaruco Combined Cycle Project, which was brought online effective February 2, 2014. The average-realized price of electricity was also higher for the quarter and for the full year period compared to 2014, mainly because of a weaker Canadian dollar. Operating costs increased by 48% ($11.06 per MWh) in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year period, with most of the increase being in non-base costs. These are mainly maintenance expenditures on the Boca de Jaruco and Puerto Escondido facilities. Operating costs fluctuate from a quarter to quarter basis with the timing of maintenance performed on gas and steam turbines. The weaker Canadian dollar also contributed to higher unit operating costs on both a three month and full year basis, as the Canadian dollar weakened from levels of approximately $1.14 in Q4 last year to $1.34 in Q4 of 2015, a change of 18%. Higher depletion, depreciation, and amortization expenses in both the quarter and the year compared to 2014 reflect the impact of a change in residual value estimate of the Varadero facility in Q1 2015, as well as the Canadian dollar decline. Free cash flow generation of $4.4 million in the quarter included a $2.8 million payment of interest on the Energas conditional sales agreement ($37.9 million year to date). Principal repayments of $7.9 million in the quarter were also received ($33.7 million year to date). OUTLOOK 2016 PRODUCTION AND CAPITAL SPENDING GUIDANCE In 2016, Sherritt has made certain modifications to how guidance is presented. For example, nickel and cobalt production expectations will continue to be published and reconciled to production guidance, but mixed sulphide production will not be part of the production guidance. This change was implemented recognizing that external stakeholders are focused on finished metal production with mixed sulphide production guidance having less utility. Secondly, capital spending estimates are being presented in US dollar denominated ranges, with the Canadian dollar estimate being presented for ease of comparison. The Canadian dollar estimate has been converted using the 2016 forecast conversion rate $1.36. This change in presentation is intended to align with Sherritt's capital budgeting practices, and to mitigate the change to capital that arises from translation to the Canadian dollar reporting currency. In 2015, capital spending revisions were generally explained in terms of their US dollar movement, as the fall in the Canadian dollar offset larger downward revisions to capital spending as the year progressed. This year, the presentation in US dollars and reporting against spending projections in US dollars is intended to mitigate the impacts of currency exchange volatility. Capital projects in the Metals business are generally US dollar expenditures, while in Oil & Gas, the expenditures are roughly 50% Canadian dollar denominated and 50% US dollar denominated.

Production at Moa and in the power operations is expected to remain steady, with a decline in Oil & Gas, reflecting natural reservoir declines and no further drilling activity on existing PSC's. The original PSC wells are scheduled to revert to Cuban ownership in 2017 and 2018. Longer term, new production in Oil & Gas is expected to come from the drilling of Block 10, where the drill program will progress at a pace driven by prudent capital spending, and the objective of running the business units to be cash flow neutral. Capital Spending Capital spending (excluding Corporate) in 2015 was approximately $147 million, up 39% from 2014 capex of approximately $106 million, but down 21% from guidance provided at the end of Q3 2015. Approximately US$12 million ($16.3 million) has been carried over to 2016 estimated capital spending of US$107 million. In the Moa JV, 2016 estimated capital spending is consistent with 2015 levels adjusting for carry-forwards. The acid plant construction at the Moa JV is nearing 75% completion at January 31, 2016, and is on track to be operating in the second half of 2016. Counting US$40.4 million spent (100% basis) from the construction re-start in 2013 to the end of 2015 and an additional estimated US$24.6 million (included in the 2016 capital spending estimate), the construction completion cost (since resuming construction in 2013) is forecast at approximately US$65 million which is in line with the 2013 approved budget and is being 100% financed by a Cuban leading institution. Ambatovy capital spending is similar to what was originally estimated for 2015. Oil and gas estimated capital spending is focused on the preparation and drilling of Block 10. Block 10 is covered by one of the two new PSC's which Sherritt signed in 2014 with the Cuban agency, encompassing 261 square kilometres in the Bay of Cardenas for a 25-year term. Sherritt originally held Block 10 and completed a drill hole on the block in June 1994. Sherritt drilled one well, using an offshore drilling rig, which produced a discovery which tested at 3,750 barrels of oil per day. Since then, significant advances in horizontal drilling technology have made new drilling from onshore a viable prospect. Power capital spending is forecast to be US$1 million (Sherritt's 33 1/3% share) in 2016. In addition, the cost to construct a new pipeline to increase gas availability is estimated at US$4 million (Sherritt's share) with construction starting and finishing in 2016. NON-GAAP MEASURES The Corporation uses combined results, Adjusted EBITDA, average-realized price, unit operating cost, and adjusted operating cash flow to monitor the performance of the Corporation and its operating divisions and believes these measures enable investors and analysts to compare the Corporation's financial performance with its competitors and evaluate the results of its underlying business. These measures do not have a standard definition under IFRS and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. As these measures do not have a standardized meaning, they may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other companies.

Teck Reports Unaudited Fourth Quarter Results For 2015 Vancouver, BC - Teck Resources Limited (TSX: TCK.A and TCK.B, NYSE: TCK) (\"Teck\") reported unaudited annual adjusted profit attributable to shareholders of $188 million, or $0.33 per share, compared with $452 million, or $0.78 per share in 2014. Fourth quarter adjusted profit attributable to shareholders was $16 million, or $0.03 per share, compared with $116 million, or $0.20 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2014. Total non-cash after-tax impairment charges for 2015 amounted to $2.7 billion, of which $536 million was taken in the fourth quarter. \"We were pleased with our operating performance in 2015, meeting our guidance, reducing our costs and raising nearly $1 billion through two streaming transactions to strengthen our balance sheet,\" said Don Lindsay, President and CEO. \"However, the commodity cycle continues to provide us with a very challenging environment such that our near-term priorities are to keep all of our operations cash flow positive, meet our commitment to Fort Hills with internal sources of funds, evaluate options to further strengthen our liquidity and maintain a strong financial position by ending the year without drawing on our lines of credit.\" Highlights and Significant Items Annual adjusted profit attributable to shareholders was $188 million, or $0.33 per share. Fourth quarter adjusted profit attributable to shareholders was $16 million, or $0.03 per share. Gross profit before depreciation and amortization in 2015 was $2.6 billion compared with $2.9 billion in 2014. Gross profit before depreciation and amortization was $614 million in the fourth quarter compared with $757 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Cash flow from operations, before working capital changes, was $1.7 billion in 2015 compared with $2.0 billion last year. Cash flow from operations, before working capital changes, was $428 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with $491 million a year ago. The loss attributable to shareholders was $459 million in the fourth quarter compared with a profit of $129 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Our quarterly loss included impairment charges of $736 million on a pre-tax basis, including $45 million on our steelmaking coal assets, $93 million on copper and $598 million on the Fort Hills oil sand project resulting in a $536 million after-tax charge. For 2015, total pre-tax asset impairment charges were $3.6 billion and $2.7 billion on an after-tax basis. Adjusted EBITDA for 2015 (not including the non-cash impairment charges) was $2.0 billion compared with $2.4 billion in 2014. Our liquidity remains strong with a cash balance of $1.8 billion at February 10, and US$3.0 billion available under our revolving credit facility which matures in 2020. Construction of the Fort Hills oil sands project is more than 50% complete and progressing substantially on schedule and on budget. As at February 10, our remaining cash funding to complete the project is $1.2 billion. We received a payment of $789 million (US$610 million) for the sale of a silver stream linked to our share of the Antamina mine. Cash unit production costs were reduced at all of our operations in 2015 compared with a year ago as a result of the highly focused efforts on our cost reduction program and lower diesel prices. We have reached agreements with the majority of our steelmaking coal customers for the first quarter of 2016, based on a quarterly benchmark of US$81 per tonne for the highest quality product, and we expect total sales in the first quarter, including spot sales, to be at least 5.5 million tonnes of steelmaking coal. We were recognized as one of the Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations for the fourth consecutive year by media and investment research company Corporate Knights. Operating highlights in 2015 included: all our operating mines, with the exception of Quebrada Blanca and Pend Oreille, remained cash positive in the fourth quarter and for 2015, we achieved record annual production at Trail for refined zinc and silver, and we achieved record annual mill throughput at Antamina. If we meet our full year guidance for production, costs and capital expenditures, assuming current commodity prices and exchange rates and no unusual transactions or events, we should complete 2016 with at least $500 million in cash without any material change in our overall U.S. dollar debt level.

These statements are based on a number of assumptions, including, but not limited to, assumptions regarding general business and economic conditions, the supply and demand for, deliveries of, and the level and volatility of prices of, zinc, copper and steelmaking coal and other primary metals and minerals as well as oil, and related products, the timing of the receipt of regulatory and governmental approvals for our development projects and other operations, our costs of production and production and productivity levels, as well as those of our competitors, power prices, continuing availability of water and power resources for our operations, market competition, the accuracy of our reserve estimates (including with respect to size, grade and recoverability) and the geological, operational and price assumptions on which these are based, conditions in financial markets, the future financial performance of the company, our ability to attract and retain skilled staff, our ability to procure equipment and operating supplies, positive results from the studies on our expansion projects, our steelmaking coal and other product inventories, our ability to secure adequate transportation for our products, our ability to obtain permits for our operations and expansions, our ongoing relations with our employees and business partners and joint venturers. Assumptions regarding the sensitivity of EBITDA and operating costs to oil prices are based on assumptions regarding the amount of diesel fuel used in our operations and transporting our coal products is as forecast, and also based on an assumed Canadian/U.S. dollar exchange rate of $1.40. Our forecast of $500 million in cash at the end of 2016 is based on an assumed Canadian/U.S. dollar exchange rate of $1.40, current commodity prices and assumes no unusual transactions or events occur and that we meet our full year guidance for production, costs and capital expenditures. Assumptions regarding the impact of foreign exchange are based on current commodity prices. The foregoing list of assumptions is not exhaustive. Events or circumstances could cause actual results to vary materially. Factors that may cause actual results to vary materially include, but are not limited to, changes in commodity and power prices, changes in market demand for our products, changes in interest and currency exchange rates, acts of foreign governments and the outcome of legal proceedings, inaccurate geological and metallurgical assumptions (including with respect to the size, grade and recoverability of mineral reserves and resources), unanticipated operational difficulties (including failure of plant, equipment or processes to operate in accordance with specifications or expectations, cost escalation, unavailability of materials and equipment, government action or delays in the receipt of government approvals, industrial disturbances or other job action, adverse weather conditions and unanticipated events related to health, safety and environmental matters), union labour disputes, political risk, social unrest, failure of customers or counterparties to perform their contractual obligations, changes in our credit ratings, unanticipated increases in costs to construct our development projects, difficulty in obtaining permits, inability to address concerns regarding permits of environmental impact assessments, and changes or further deterioration in general economic conditions. Our Fort Hills project is not controlled by us and construction and production schedules may be adjusted by our partners. Statements concerning future production costs or volumes are based on numerous assumptions of management regarding operating matters and on assumptions that demand for products develops as anticipated, that customers and other counterparties perform their contractual obligations, that operating and capital plans will not be disrupted by issues such as mechanical failure, unavailability of parts and supplies, labour disturbances, interruption in transportation or utilities, adverse weather conditions, and that there are no material unanticipated variations in the cost of energy or supplies. Statements regarding anticipated steelmaking coal sales volumes and average steelmaking coal prices for the quarter depend on timely arrival of vessels and performance of our steelmaking coal-loading facilities, as well as the level of spot pricing sales. Turqoise Hill Resources Ltd. (TSE: TRQ) Turquoise Hill Resources (TRQ: TSX, NYSE & NASDAQ) is an international mining company with copper-gold and coal mines in the Asia Pacific region. Principal assets: A 66% interest in Oyu Tolgoi, one of the world's largest copper-gold-silver mines now producing and shipping concentrate to customers in China. A 22.63% interest in established Mongolian coal miner SouthGobi Resources (SGQ: TSX, 1878: HK). Turquoise Hill announces financial results and review of operations for 2015 VANCOUVER, CANADA - Turquoise Hill Resources today announced its financial results for the year ended December 31, 2015. All figures are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated. HIGHLIGHTS Oyu Tolgoi achieved an excellent safety performance for 2015 with an All Injury Frequency Rate of 0.33 per 200,000 hours worked. In May 2015, the Oyu Tolgoi Underground Mine Development and Financing Plan was signed addressing key outstanding shareholder matters and setting out long-term funding of the project. In August 2015, Oyu Tolgoi filed revised schedules for the statutory feasibility study with the Mongolian Minerals Council. In December 2015, Oyu Tolgoi signed a $4.4 billion project financing facility provided by a syndicate of international financial institutions, export credit agencies and 15 commercial banks. Underground pre-start activities are underway in parallel with an update to the feasibility study capital estimate, which is expected to be complete in Q1'16. Turquoise Hill continues to expect approval of the updated 2016 feasibility study and notice to proceed decisions by the various boards for underground construction in Q2'16. Oyu Tolgoi recorded revenue of $1.6 billion in 2015 on record concentrate sales of 819,800 tonnes reflecting higher concentrate sales volumes partially offset by lower copper and gold prices. In Q4'15, Oyu Tolgoi recorded revenue of $355.6 million on concentrate sales of 236,200 tonnes reflecting lower copper and gold prices combined with lower sales of metal in concentrate. Turquoise Hill generated operating cash flow before interest and taxes of $650.5 million in 2015. In 2015, cash operating costs1 at Oyu Tolgoi were $962.6 million including $59.9 million in non-recurring charges for the May 18 underground agreement and underground early works expensed. For 2015, Oyu Tolgoi generated C11 costs of $0.57 per pound of copper and all-in sustaining costs1 of $1.37 per pound of copper, a decrease of 50.0% and 29.7% respectively over 2014. Capital expenditure on a cash basis for 2015 was $116.2 million, primarily attributed to sustaining activities. For 2015, Oyu Tolgoi's second full year of production, the mine operated at record levels Productivity improvements in the concentrator implemented throughout 2015 led to throughput exceeding nameplate capacity by year end and increasing by 23.9% over 2014. For Q4'15, concentrator throughput increased 8.5% over Q3'15 reaching an all-time quarterly high. In 2015, copper production of 202,200 tonnes exceeded the Company's guidance and annual gold production of 653,000 ounces met guidance. Compared to 2014, 2015 mined production increased 19.3%, concentrate production increased 39.9%, copper production increased 36.3% and gold production increased 10.9%. Oyu Tolgoi is expected to produce 175,000 to 195,000 tonnes of copper and 210,000 to 260,000 ounces of gold in concentrates for 2016. Sales contracts have been signed for approximately 90% of Oyu Tolgoi's expected 2016 concentrate production. In September 2015, Oyu Tolgoi surpassed 1.5 million tonnes of concentrate shipped. Turquoise Hill's cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2015 were approximately $1.3 billion. FINANCIAL RESULTS In 2015, the Company recorded net income attributable to owners of Turquoise Hill of $313.3 million or $0.16 per share compared with net income of $26.9 million or $0.01 per share in 2014, an increase of $286.4 million. The increase is mainly attributable to a $210.2 million non-cash impairment charge recorded in 2014 on reclassification of SouthGobi to assets held for sale, and a deferred tax asset of $165.0 million recognized in 2015, partially offset by adjustments for inventory write-down of $103.2 million. Operating cash flows before interest and taxes in 2015 were $650.5 million compared with $718.5 million in 2014, reflecting the impact of lower commodity prices on sales revenue, offset by the continued production and delivery cost improvements and effective working capital management. Capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment was $116.2 million on a cash basis in 2015, primarily attributed to sustaining capital activities. Turquoise Hill's cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2015 were approximately $1.3 billion. OYU TOLGOI COPPER-GOLD MINE The Oyu Tolgoi mine is approximately 550 kilometres south of Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia's capital city, and 80 kilometres north of the Mongolia-China border. Mineralization on the property consists of porphyry-style copper, gold, silver and molybdenum contained in a linear structural trend (the Oyu Tolgoi Trend) that has a strike length extending over 26 kilometres. Mineral resources have been identified in a series of deposits throughout this trend. They include, from south to north, the Heruga Deposit, the Southern Oyu deposits (Southwest Oyu, South Oyu, Wedge and Central Oyu) and the Hugo Dummett deposits (Hugo South, Hugo North and Hugo North Extension). The Oyu Tolgoi mine has initially been developed as an open-pit operation. A copper concentrator plant, with related facilities and necessary infrastructure to support a nominal throughput of 100,000 tonnes of ore per day, has been constructed to process ore mined from the Southern Oyu open pit. Long term development plans for Oyu Tolgoi are based on a 95,000-tonne-per-day underground block-cave mine. In August 2013, development of the underground mine was suspended pending resolution of matters with the Government of Mongolia. On May 18, 2015, Turquoise Hill, the Government of Mongolia and Rio Tinto signed the Oyu Tolgoi Underground Mine Development and Financing Plan, which addressed key outstanding shareholder matters and set out an agreed basis for the funding of the project. Oyu Tolgoi Underground Mine Development and Financing Plan On May 18, 2015, Turquoise Hill, the Government of Mongolia and Rio Tinto signed the Oyu Tolgoi Underground Mine Development and Financing Plan (Underground Plan), which addressed key outstanding shareholder matters and set out an agreed basis for the funding of the project. The Underground Plan confirmed the project cost for Oyu Tolgoi's initial construction and development and reinforced the principles set out in the Investment Agreement and the Amended and Restated Shareholders Agreement (ARSHA). The agreements addressed key outstanding matters including the following specific items: tax matters, the 2% net smelter royalty, sales royalty calculation and management services payments. The agreements also addressed the sourcing of power for Oyu Tolgoi from within Mongolia. The overall value impact for the Company in connection with the agreements is less than 2% of the value of the reserve case of $7.4 billion presented in the 2014 Oyu Tolgoi Technical Report. The components of the variance are outlined in the following paragraphs. In 2003, Turquoise Hill acquired a 2% net smelter royalty from BHP Billiton. The enforceability of the royalty was challenged by the Assistant General Prosecutor of Mongolia under Mongolian law. The Company determined, as part of the Underground Plan negotiated, that it would not contest its right to receive payment and consequently recognized a charge of $36.8 million in Q2'15 for write-off of the original royalty acquisition cost. In June 2014, Oyu Tolgoi LLC received a Tax Act (Tax Assessment) from the Mongolian Tax Authority as a result of a general tax audit for the period 2010 through 2012. Oyu Tolgoi appealed the assessment and in September 2014 received a response reducing the amount of tax, interest and penalties claimed to be payable, from approximately $127.0 million to approximately $30.0 million. In a separate agreement with the Government of Mongolia, Oyu Tolgoi agreed, without accepting liability and without creating a precedent, to pay the amount of the determination by way of settlement to resolve the tax matter. A final charge of $22.1 million has been recognized in Q2'15 for settlement of amounts not previously paid or provided for in relation to the Tax Assessment. The parties agreed that Oyu Tolgoi's 5% sales royalty paid to the Government of Mongolia will be calculated on gross revenues by not allowing deductions for the costs of processing, freight differentials, penalties or payables. Oyu Tolgoi recalculated royalties payable accordingly since the commencement of sales and submitted an additional amount payable in Q2'15 of approximately $17.1 million to the Government, which includes approximately $14.5 million on previous years' sales. Notwithstanding the terms of the ARSHA, the parties agreed that in calculating the Management Services Payment (MSP), the rate applied to capital costs of the underground development will be 3% instead of 6%, as provided by the ARSHA. The MSP rate on operating cost and capital related to current operations remains at 6%. In accordance with the ARSHA, 50% of the MSP is payable to Turquoise Hill and 50% to Rio Tinto. Turquoise Hill continues to work with Oyu Tolgoi LLC on possible support of Oyu Tolgoi LLC's obligations under a potential power purchase arrangement from the Tavan Tolgoi power plant project. Signing of project finance On December 14, 2015, Oyu Tolgoi signed a $4.4 billion project finance facility, one of the largest in the mining industry. The facility was provided by a syndicate of international financial institutions and export credit agencies representing the governments of Canada, the United States and Australia, along with 15 commercial banks. The project finance facility will be funded by Export Development Canada, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Finance Corporation, the Export-Import Bank of the United States, the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation of Australia and commercial lenders comprising BNP Paribas, ANZ, ING, Societe Generale Corporate & Investment Banking, Sumitomo Mitsui, Standard Chartered Bank, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Credit Agricole, Intesa Sanpaolo, National Australia Bank, Natixis, HSBC, The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UJF, KfW IPEX-Bank and Nederlandse Financierings-Maatschappij voor Ontwikkelingslanden. The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) provided political risk insurance for the commercial banks. Turquoise Hill, Rio Tinto and Oyu Tolgoi continue to work towards completing the 2016 feasibility study, including the updated capital estimate and securing all necessary permits for the development of the underground mine. Once these steps have been completed and subject to the boards of Turquoise Hill, Rio Tinto and Oyu Tolgoi approving a formal 'notice to proceed' (Notice to Proceed), the full $4.4 billion facility will be drawn down by Oyu Tolgoi subject to satisfaction of certain conditions precedent typical for a financing of this nature. Net proceeds from the project finance facility (Net PF Proceeds), after fees and taxes, are anticipated to be approximately $4.1 billion. The Net PF Proceeds will be used by Oyu Tolgoi to pay down shareholder loans payable to Turquoise Hill. The Net PF Proceeds will be available to be re-drawn by Oyu Tolgoi for the development of the underground mine. As part of the project finance agreements, Rio Tinto has agreed to provide a guarantee, known as the completion support undertaking, in favour of the project finance lenders. In consideration for providing completion support, and as contemplated by previous agreements, Oyu Tolgoi and Turquoise Hill have agreed to pay Rio Tinto an annual completion support fee equal to 2.5% of the amounts drawn under the facility, of which 1.9% is payable by Oyu Tolgoi and 0.6% is payable by Turquoise Hill. The annual completion support fee will apply to funding used for facility fees and taxes at initial drawdown as well as amounts used to fund development. The obligation to pay a completion support fee will terminate on the date Rio Tinto's completion support obligations to the project lenders terminate. Following successful fulfilment of the completion tests outlined in the project finance facility, the Rio Tinto completion support undertaking will terminate and the facility interest rates will shift to post-completion rates. The project financing facility provides for interest only payments for the first five years and is then structured on a stepped amortization schedule for the remaining life of the facility. The parties to the project finance facility have agreed to a debt cap of $6.0 billion for Oyu Tolgoi, providing the option for an additional $1.6 billion of supplemental debt in the future. In its capacity as project sponsor, Turquoise Hill will enter into a guarantee, known as the sponsor debt service undertaking, with Rio Tinto, the project lenders and agents representing such lenders (Sponsor DSU). Under the Sponsor DSU, Turquoise Hill guarantees to the finance parties payment of principal, interest and fees owed by Oyu Tolgoi to the senior lenders under the project financing payable prior to completion. The obligations of Turquoise Hill under the Sponsor DSU terminate upon the earliest of (i) completion of the project, (ii) the termination of the Sponsor DSU as a result of the occurrence of certain force majeure circumstances (described in the agreements as suspensive events), and (iii) the date on which all senior debt obligations have been irrevocably and unconditionally paid or discharged and the commitments have terminated or expired. The provisions contained in the Company Financing Support Agreement, including those referred to below, are broadly in line with the principles and provisions established under the Memorandum of Agreement between Turquoise Hill and Rio Tinto entered into in 2012: Under the Company Financing Support Agreement, in the event a fact or circumstance occurs which affects or could reasonably be expected to affect Turquoise Hill's ability to meet its obligations under the Sponsor DSU or give rise to an event of default or completion default under the project finance agreements, Rio Tinto shall have the right to require that Turquoise Hill effect an equity contribution by way of private placement of Turquoise Hill shares to Rio Tinto or a rights offering similar in form and structure to the rights offering which closed in January 2014. Turquoise Hill will also have the right to propose an alternative financing proposal to Rio Tinto which, depending on the nature of such proposal, may require Rio Tinto's consent. The parties have agreed that the aggregate amount of any such funding mechanisms shall not exceed 25% of Turquoise Hill's market capitalization as of the date of the Company Financing Support Agreement. Any such transaction shall also be subject to applicable securities laws. The Company Financing Support Agreement also contains certain restrictions relating to the conduct of the Company's business and operations and to the implementation of certain corporate transactions until the later of (i) the date Rio Tinto's completion support obligations terminate, (ii) the date that all senior loan advances under the project finance agreements are repaid in full, and (iii) the date that all subordinated debt advances by Rio Tinto have been repaid in full, which shall be deemed to be the date on which Rio Tinto's completion support obligations terminate if, as of such date, the aggregate amount of subordinated debt advances by Rio Tinto has not exceeded $500 million. Under the Oyu Tolgoi Financing Support Agreement, in the event a fact or circumstance occurs which affects or could reasonably be expected to affect Oyu Tolgoi's ability to meet its obligations under the project finance agreements or give rise to an event of default thereunder, Rio Tinto shall have the right to require that Oyu Tolgoi borrow funds from Rio Tinto (or an affiliate thereof) by way of a senior debt advance or a subordinated debt advance, or borrow funds from a third party senior lender. The proceeds of any such advances shall be used to repay amounts due and owing to the project lenders. Under the Cash Management Services Agreement, Turquoise Hill has appointed 9539549 Canada Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Rio Tinto, as service provider to provide post-drawdown cash management services in connection with the Net PF Proceeds, which shall be placed with 9539549 Canada Inc. and returned to Turquoise Hill as required for purposes of funding the Oyu Tolgoi underground mine. Turquoise Hill is also entitled to the return of any outstanding balance of such managed funds upon the termination of Rio Tinto's completion support obligations. RTIH has agreed to guarantee the obligations of the service provider under this agreement. Preparation for underground development Following the filing of revised schedules for the statutory feasibility study with the Mongolian Minerals Council in August 2015, pre-start activities began in parallel with an update to the capital estimate, which is expected to be complete in Q1'16. Pre-start activities include ramp-up of the owners and EPCM team, re-estimate activities, detailed engineering and early procurement for equipment and materials required for necessary critical works that are key enablers for recommencement of underground lateral development mining activity. Care and maintenance activities have continued for Shaft #1, facilities and mobile equipment. Appointments to key roles in the underground team are well underway, with key staff starting in Q1'16. Turquoise Hill expects the Notice to Proceed decision for underground construction in Q2'16. Prior to the suspension in August 2013, underground lateral development at Hugo North had advanced approximately 16 kilometres off Shaft #1. Sinking of Shaft #2, the primary operations access and initial production hoisting shaft, had reached a depth of 1,168 metres below surface, 91% of its final depth of 1,284 metres. The 96 metre-high Shaft #2 concrete headframe has been constructed. Sinking of Shaft #5, a dedicated exhaust ventilation shaft, had reached a depth of 208 metres, 17% of its final depth of 1,174 metres. Surface facilities, including offices, mine dry, and workshop, are in place to support initial pre-production development and construction. Full-year 2015 and Q4'15 performance Safety continues to be a major focus throughout Oyu Tolgoi's operations and the mine's management is committed to reducing risk and injury. Oyu Tolgoi achieved an excellent safety performance for 2015 with an All Injury Frequency Rate of 0.33 per 200,000 hours worked. Oyu Tolgoi Key Financial Metrics Revenue of $1.6 billion in 2015 decreased 5.8% over 2014 reflecting lower copper and gold prices partially offset by higher volumes of copper-gold concentrate sales. Concentrate sold in 2015 of 819,800 tonnes increased 11.7% over 2014 reaching an all-time annual high. Revenue of $355.6 million in Q4'15 decreased 17.6% over Q3'15 reflecting lower copper and gold prices combined with lower metals in concentrate sales. Fourth quarter concentrate sold of 236,200 tonnes increased 4.5% over Q3'15. Production and delivery costs include primarily the cash costs in inventory sold as well as allocated mine administration costs. Depreciation and depletion includes the depreciation and depletion in inventory sold as well as any depreciation of assets used in the selling and delivery process, including the depreciation of capitalized production phase stripping costs. A charge of $90.9 million was recorded in 2015, within operating expenses, for provision against, and writes off of, non-current ore stockpiles. The charge followed a re-estimation of realizable value to reflect lower copper and gold prices and updated assumptions for timing of processing. Capital expenditure, on a cash basis, for 2015 was $116.2 million (2014: $242.2 million) primarily attributed to sustaining activities, including the tailings storage facility and deferred stripping (2014 included payments relating to 2013 underground development prior to suspension). Total cash operating costs at Oyu Tolgoi in 2015 were $962.6 million inclusive of non-recurring charges following agreement of the Underground Plan (tax settlement: $22.1 million; recalculation of royalties: $14.5 million) and costs relating to underground remobilization and early works expensed ($23.3 million). Throughout 2015, Oyu Tolgoi improved and optimized operations in order to reduce costs across the mine's operation. Following transition to IFRS, the 5% royalty payable to the Government of Mongolia, previously deducted from revenue, is reflected as a cash operating expense, and production phase stripping costs, previously included within cash operating expense, are capitalized where appropriate and depreciated. Please refer to Section 12 - INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS - on page 20 of the MD&A. Oyu Tolgoi's C1 costs in 2015 were $0.57 per pound, compared with $1.14 per pound in 2014. The decrease was mainly due to production volume increases and cost optimization, partly offset by reduced gold and silver credits per pound of copper produced. Oyu Tolgoi's open-pit mine has a high-grade zone containing a large proportion of gold in addition to copper; Turquoise Hill anticipates quarterly fluctuation of C1 costs as the quantity of gold in concentrates sold varies. Oyu Tolgoi's C1 costs in Q4'15 were $0.88 per pound, compared with $0.40 per pound in Q3'15. The increase was mainly due to a drop in gold revenues and lower grades. All-in sustaining costs in 2015 were $1.37 per pound, compared with $1.95 per pound in 2014. The decrease was mainly due to volume increases, cost optimization and operational efficiencies, partly offset by reduced gold and silver credits per pound of copper produced, combined with impact of non-recurring and non-cash items. All-in sustaining costs in Q4'15 were $1.56 per pound, compared with $1.52 per pound in Q3'15. The increase was mainly due to a drop in gold revenues and lower grades. For 2015, Oyu Tolgoi's second full year of production, the mine operated at record levels. Productivity improvements in the concentrator implemented throughout the year led to throughput exceeding nameplate capacity by year end. Copper production for 2015 of 202,200 tonnes exceeded the Company's guidance of 175,000 to 195,000 tonnes and annual gold production of 653,000 ounces met 2015 guidance of 600,000 to 700,000 ounces. Compared to 2014 results, 2015 mined production increased 19.3%, concentrator throughput increased 23.9%, concentrate production increased 39.9%, copper production increased 36.3% and gold production increased 10.9%. For Q4'15, throughput increased 8.5% over Q3'15 reaching an all-time high. Copper production for the quarter increased 2.3% over Q3'15 due to higher volumes offset by lower grades. As a result of mining higher grades from Phase 2 and higher volumes, Q4'15 gold production increased 68.3% over Q3'15. Funding of Oyu Tolgoi by Turquoise Hill In accordance with the ARSHA dated June 8, 2011, Turquoise Hill has funded Oyu Tolgoi's cash requirements beyond internally generated cash flows by a combination of equity investment and shareholder debt. For amounts funded by debt, Oyu Tolgoi must repay such amounts, including accrued interest, before it can pay common share dividends. At December 31, 2015, the aggregate outstanding balance of shareholder loans extended by subsidiaries of the Company to Oyu Tolgoi was $6.9 billion, including accrued interest of $0.8 billion. These loans bear interest at an effective annual rate of LIBOR plus 6.5%. During 2015, Oyu Tolgoi repaid a total amount of $482.0 million with respect to these loans, including accrued interest of $150.3 million. In accordance with the ARSHA, a subsidiary of the Company has funded the common share investments in Oyu Tolgoi on behalf of Erdenes. These funded amounts earn interest at an effective annual rate of LIBOR plus 6.5% and are repayable, by Erdenes to a subsidiary of the Company, via a pledge over Erdenes' share of Oyu Tolgoi common share dividends. Erdenes also has the right to reduce the outstanding balance by making cash payments at any time. As at December 31, 2015, the cumulative amount of such funding was $751.1 million, representing approximately 34% of invested common share equity; unrecognized interest on the funding amounted to $231.1 million. Operational outlook Oyu Tolgoi is expected to produce 175,000 to 195,000 tonnes of copper and 210,000 to 260,000 ounces of gold in concentrates for 2016. Open-pit operations are expected to mine in phases 2, 3 and 6 during the year as well as begin stripping for phase 4. In addition, stockpiled ore is anticipated to be processed during the year. The reduction in gold compared to 2015 is expected to result from mining in lower-grade gold areas and processing lower-grade stockpiled ore. The majority of 2016 gold production is expected in the first half of the year. Operating cash costs for 2016 are expected to be approximately $800 million. The reduction compared to 2015 operating cash costs is mainly related to additional capitalization of phase 4 stripping costs. Capital expenditures for 2016 on a cash-basis, excluding underground development, are expected to be approximately $300 million, of which approximately $280 million relates to sustaining capital. Sustaining capital reflects increased capitalization of phase 4 deferred stripping costs. For underground development, Turquoise Hill will provide capital guidance for 2016 once a final Notice to Proceed decision is confirmed. Sales contracts have been signed for approximately 90% of Oyu Tolgoi's expected 2016 concentrate production. Exploration during 2015 Oyu Tolgoi's exploration program focused on near surface targets using geochemical surveys and detailed ground magnetic surveys to identify porphyry style mineralisation. In December 2015, Turquoise Hill acquired a second exploration licence within 50 kilometers of Oyu Tolgoi. SOUTHGOBI During 2015, the Company pursued a strategy of divesting its holding in SouthGobi, which amounted to 104.8 million shares (47.9%) at January 1, 2015. Sale of 50.4 million shares in SouthGobi to Novel Sunrise Investments Limited (NSI) was completed between April 23 and June 3, 2015 at a price of C$0.35 per share. At December 31, 2015, following dilution of the Company's interest on November 30 as the result of issuance to the China Investment Corporation (CIC) of 11.9 million new SouthGobi shares, and general market sales in accordance with the Company's ongoing divestment strategy, Turquoise Hill owned 49.3 million shares (19.2%). The Company's remaining interest in SouthGobi is recorded as an available for sale investment within financial assets, with a fair value (based on the quoted share price) of $14.5 million at December 31, 2015. See Note 14 to the annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 for more information. CORPORATE ACTIVITIES Statutory feasibility study On March 18, 2015, Oyu Tolgoi filed a statutory feasibility study with the Mongolian Minerals Council. Under Mongolian law, Oyu Tolgoi is required to submit an update to the feasibility study at least every five years. MIGA host country approval signing In September 2015, the Government of Mongolia signed the request of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) for host country approval (HCA) with respect to guarantees to be issued by MIGA in connection with the Oyu Tolgoi project financing. The signing of the HCA was a significant milestone in the project financing timeline. Management changes In September 2015, Turquoise Hill announced the resignation of Stewart Beckman, Senior Vice President, Operations and Technical Development, effective October 1, 2015 due to Mr. Beckman having accepted a new position within Rio Tinto. In January 2016, Turquoise Hill announced the appointment of Brendan Lane as Vice President, Operations and Development effective February 1, 2016. Mr. Lane brings 25-years of industry experience including metallurgical, mine engineering and commercial roles at Rio Tinto, Anglo American and BHP Billiton. NON-GAAP MEASURES The Company's financial results are prepared in accordance with IFRS. In addition, the Company presents and refers to the following measures (non-GAAP measures) which are not defined in IFRS. A description and calculation of these measures is given below, and may differ from equivalent measures provided by other issuers. Cash operating costs This measure comprises Oyu Tolgoi cash operating costs, and is presented in order to provide investors and other stakeholders in the Company with a greater understanding of performance and operations at Oyu Tolgoi. The measure of cash operating costs excludes: depreciation and depletion; exploration and evaluation; charges for asset write-down (including write-down of materials and supplies inventory), and includes management services payments to Rio Tinto, and management services payments to Turquoise Hill which are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements of the Company. C1 cash costs C1 cash costs is a metric representing the cash cost per unit of extracting and processing the Company's principal metal product to a condition in which it may be delivered to customers, net of by-product credits. It is provided in order to support peer group comparability and to provide investors and other stakeholders useful information about the underlying cash costs of Oyu Tolgoi and the impact of by-product credits on the operations' cost structure. C1 cash costs are relevant to understanding the Company's operating profitability and ability to generate cash flow. When calculating costs associated with producing a pound of copper, the Company includes gold and silver revenue credits as the production cost is reduced as a result of selling these by-products. Turquoise Hill's principal metal product is copper, and C1 cash costs are reported for Oyu Tolgoi only. All-in sustaining costs All-in sustaining costs (AISC) is an extended cash based cost metric, providing further information on the aggregate cash, capital and overhead outlay per unit, and is intended to reflect the costs of producing the Company's principal metal product over the life-cycle of its operations. The measure seeks to reflect the full cost of copper production from current operations and as a result development project capital is not included. AISC allows Turquoise Hill to assess the ability of Oyu Tolgoi to support sustaining capital expenditures for future production from the generation of operating cash flows.

Barrick Gold Corporation (TSE: ABX) - Update on Argentina Legal Action - 11/3/2016 TORONTO -- On March 11, 2016, the Jachal Court of San Juan province, Argentina announced that it will proceed with criminal charges against nine current and former Barrick employees in connection with an unauthorized release of processing solution that occurred at the Veladero mine in September 2015. Separately, the Government of San Juan province has announced that it intends to impose an administrative fine of approximately $9 million against Barrick in connection with the incident. \"The safety of our employees, local communities and the environment has always been -- and will continue to be -- our highest priority,\" said Barrick President Kelvin Dushnisky. \"Following the incident last September, we implemented a comprehensive action plan to strengthen controls and safeguards at the mine, while addressing the root causes of the solution release. These actions include intensified water monitoring, the addition of heating controls and pressure sensing equipment to manage freezing risks, new procedures related to leach pad operations and additional water management controls.\" Water samples taken immediately following the incident, and in the months following, demonstrate that the solution release did not pose any risks to the health of communities or the environment downstream from the mine. These results are consistent with studies ordered by federal and provincial regulators and the provincial court, including those conducted by the National Institute of Water (INA), the National University of San Juan (UNSJ) and the Center for Investigations for the Prevention of Mining and Industrial Contamination (Cipcami). \"We recognize that we have disappointed many of our partners in San Juan province and we deeply regret this incident. The company is committed to ensuring we have robust polices and standards in place that protect the environment at all of our operations,\" added Mr. Dushnisky.

Latest Research Challenges and opportunities of using tunnel boring machines in mining Y.L. Zheng, Q.B. Zhang, J. Zhao Abstract Full-face tunnel boring machine (TBM) tunnelling has unparalleled advantages over conventional drill-and-blast (D&B) techniques in terms of higher advance rates and lower risk levels in favourable ground conditions. However, there are only a few successful TBM applications in mines. The aim of this paper is to discuss the technical challenges of using TBMs in mining since the pioneering work in the 1960s. It starts with a description on the genesis of hard rock mines and coal mines and the differences of TBM tunnelling in mining and civil engineering projects. The historical applications of TBMs in mines are critically reviewed and the reasons for the unsuccessful applications are summarised and analysed from a geological point of view. Challenges, such as cutter wear, jamming and steering difficulties in difficult grounds with water inrush, fractured and faulted zones, high in-situ stresses, and gas, are explored in depth through case histories. Moreover, the corresponding mitigations measures to cope with complex grounds in mines are provided. A prospect of TBM applications in mining is presented at the end. The Industry Mining Facts Minerals and metals are the building blocks of the computers and smartphones we rely on, of the vehicles and public transit that get us places, of the buildings where we live and work, and of green technologies that help make the world a more sustainable place. Just as we as individuals depend on mining to support our daily lives, Canada relies on the industry to keep the economy humming. Mining is one of Canada's most important economic sectors and a major job creator. A major employer: Approximately 380,000 people across Canada work in the mining and mineral processing industries. Mining is the largest private sector employer of Aboriginal peoples in Canada on a proportional basis, and employment is poised to increase. Canada has one of the largest mining supply sectors globally with more than 3,400 companies supplying engineering, geotechnical, environmental, financial and other services to mining operations. Those who work in mining enjoy the highest wages and salaries of all industrial sectors in Canada with an average annual pay exceeding $110,000, which surpassed the average earnings of workers in forestry, manufacturing, finance and construction by a range of $31,000 to $46,000 for those sectors. An economic engine: Mining contributed $54 billion to Canada's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2013. The industry accounted for 19.6% of the value of Canadian goods exports in 2013. Canada's value of mineral production was nearly $43.6 billion in 2013. The mining industry's payments to Canadian federal and provincial governments total $71 billion in taxes and royalties over the last decade (2003-2012). A global leader: Thanks to its rich geology, Canada is one of the largest mining nations in the world producing more than 60 minerals and metals. Canada ranks in the top five countries in the global production of 11 major minerals and metals: First in potash Second in uranium and cobalt Third in aluminum and tungsten Fourth in platinum group metals, sulphur and titanium Fifth in nickel and diamonds 57% of the world's public mining companies are listed on the TSX and TSX-Venture Exchanges. Together, the two exchanges handled 48% of global mining equity transactions in 2013, and accounted for 46% of global mining equity capital for that year. Globally, Canada is recognized for its leadership in safety and sustainability. Mining companies in Canada were the first in the world to develop an externally-verified performance system for sustainable mining practices with the creation of MAC's Towards Sustainable Mining initiative in 2004. Leading Companies Agnico Eagle Mines Limited Agnico Eagle's mission is to run a high quality, easy to understand business, that generates superior long-term per share returns for our shareholders, creates a great place to work for our employees, and that is a leading contributor to the well-being of the communities in which we operate. Agnico Eagle Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Results - Strong Operational Performance Yields Record Annual Production; Updated Amaruq Mineral Resources and Initial Mineral Resources Declared at El Barqueno and the Sisar Zone at Kittila February 10, 2016 Stock Symbol: AEM (NYSE and TSX) (All amounts expressed in U.S. dollars (\"$\" or \"US$\") unless otherwise noted) TORONTO, Feb. 10, 2016 /PRNewswire/ - Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (NYSE:AEM, TSX:AEM) (\"Agnico Eagle\" or the \"Company\") today reported a quarterly net loss of $15.5 million, or a net loss of $0.07 per share for the fourth quarter of 2015. This result includes a non-cash foreign currency translation loss on deferred tax liabilities of $8.6 million ($0.04 per share), various mark-to-market adjustment losses of $5.0 million ($0.02 per share), unrealized losses on financial instruments of $3.3 million ($0.01 per share), non-cash foreign currency translation losses of $1.3 million ($0.01 per share), non-cash stock option expense of $3.6 million ($0.02 per share) and non-recurring gains of $2.4 million ($0.01). Excluding these items would result in adjusted net income of $3.9 million ($0.02 per share) for the fourth quarter of 2015. In the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company reported a net loss of $21.3 million or a net loss of $0.10 per share. Fourth quarter 2015 cash provided by operating activities was $140.7 million ($112.6 million before changes in non-cash components of working capital), this compares to cash provided by operating activities of $164.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 ($151.6 million before changes in non-cash components of working capital). The decrease in cash flow before changes in working capital during the current period was largely due to a tax adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2015. \"In 2015, our operations continued to perform well, which allowed us to do better on both our production and cost guidance for the fourth consecutive year. Despite a volatile gold price environment, we doubled our exploration spending, continued to advance our pipeline of development projects, and reduced our net debt by approximately $190 million,\" said Sean Boyd, Agnico Eagle's Chief Executive Officer. \"Over the next three years, we are forecasting stable annual production and costs, which should allow us to continue to invest in our existing mines, maintain funding levels at our key exploration projects, advance our development pipeline in Nunavut at a steady and measured pace and maintain our history of continuous dividend payments to shareholders,\" added Mr. Boyd. Fourth quarter and full year 2015 highlights include: Guidance exceeded for fourth consecutive year - Payable production1 in 2015 was 1,671,340 ounces of gold at total cash costs2 per ounce on a by-product basis of $567, compared to guidance of 1,650,000 ounces at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $600. All-in sustaining costs per ounce3 (\"AISC\") on a by-product basis for 2015 were $810, compared to guidance of $850 per ounce Stable production and costs expected through 2018 - Average annual production from 2016 to 2018 is forecast to be approximately 1.53 million ounces of gold. Production for 2016 is forecast to be between 1.525 and 1.565 million ounces of gold with total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of between $590 and $630 per ounce. AISC for 2016 are forecast to be between $850 and $890 per ounce. Costs were calculated using a US$/C$ exchange rate of 1.30, EURO$/US$ exchange rate of 1.10 and a US$/MXP exchange rate of 16.00 Increased gold reserve grades at key mines, significant increase in year-end 2015 gold resources, slight decline in gold reserves after mining depletion - Gold reserve grades increased at the LaRonde, Canadian Malartic, Goldex and La India mines. Measured and indicated mineral resources were up 1%, while inferred mineral resources increased by 23%. Mineral reserves declined by only 5% (0.9 million ounces) to 19.1 million ounces due to mine depletion of approximately 1.8 million ounces Gold resources increased by 67% at Amaruq - Inferred mineral resources at Amaruq now total 3.3 million ounces (16.9 million tonnes grading 6.05 grams per tonne (\"g/t\") gold). The 2016 Phase 1 drill program (approximately 75,000 metres) is now underway with a focus on expanding and upgrading mineral resources and outlining a second open pit deposit Initial inferred gold resources declared at El Barqueno and the Sisar Zone at Kittilla - At El Barqueno, initial inferred mineral resources are estimated to be 0.61 million ounces (19.7 million tonnes grading 0.96 g/t gold), while at Kittila the recently discovered Sisar Zone contains inferred mineral resources of 0.65 million ounces (3.4 million tonnes grading 5.91 g/t gold) Moderate 2016 capital spending preserves production optionality in Nunavut - Expenditures at Amaruq are designed to expand and upgrade the gold resources and outline a second source of open pit ore for the project. Planned spending levels at Meliadine for 2016 are expected to be sufficient to keep critical path elements moving forward. However, decreased spending as compared with previous internal forecasts is expected to delay the potential project start-up by approximately one year to 2020 Improved financial flexibility - In 2015, net debt was reduced by $190 million, further strengthening the Company's investment grade balance sheet A quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share declared New Three-Year Guidance Plan - Stable Production and Cost Profile The Company is announcing its production and cost guidance for 2016 through 2018. The Company expects average annual production of approximately 1.53 million ounces of gold over the next three years with a stable cost profile. Highlights from the new production and cost guidance for 2016 through 2018 include: In 2016, payable production is expected to be between 1.525 million and 1.565 million ounces of gold. Total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis in 2016 are expected to be between $590 and $630 using a US$/C$ exchange rate assumption of 1.30. Previous guidance for 2016 (from the February 2015 forecast) was 1.60 million ounces. The change from previous guidance is primarily due to the expansion of the Vault pit, which increased overall production from Meadowbank but deferred ounces from 2016 to 2017 and 2018, thereby extending the mine life Consolidated AISC for 2016 are expected to be between $850 and $890 per ounce. In 2017 and 2018, the Company's goal is to reduce AISC below this range The estimated production level in 2017 is currently forecast to be approximately 1.55 million ounces of gold (up from 1.50 million ounces in its February 2015 forecast), while production in 2018 is forecast to be approximately 1.50 million ounces of gold. However, the Company is evaluating potential optimizations and opportunities (none of which have yet been approved for construction) at a number of existing operations to further enhance the production profile in 2018 and beyond. These include: LaRonde optimization potential Bousquet Zone 5 Lapa Zone 8 - Upper mine and Zulapa 7 - Deep 2 Zone Goldex optimization potential Increased throughput from Deep Zone 1 Potential for accelerated development of Deep Zone 2 Potential development of the Akasaba West satellite deposit Kittila optimization potential Upper Rimpi Zone development Potential development of the new Sisar Zone Mexican optimization potential Satellite zones at Pinos Altos and Creston Mascota Potential to expand reserves at La India Development Pipeline Expected to Provide Further Production Growth in 2019 and Beyond The Amaruq and Meliadine projects in Nunavut, the El Barqueno project in Mexico, the Odyssey Zone and near pit/underground opportunities at Canadian Malartic (these opportunities are near or below the existing mining infrastructure) and a possible expansion of the LaRonde mine at depth have the potential to further add to the Company's production profile in 2019 and beyond. Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Financial and Production Highlights In the fourth quarter of 2015, strong operational performance continued at the Company's mines. Payable production in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 422,328 ounces of gold compared to 387,535 ounces in the fourth quarter of 2014. A detailed description of the production and cost performance of each mine is set out below. Total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis for the fourth quarter of 2015 were $547 compared to $662 per ounce for the fourth quarter 2014. The decrease in total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis in the fourth quarter of 2015 is mainly due to higher production levels at the LaRonde, Canadian Malartic, Meadowbank, Kittila, Pinos Altos and Creston Mascota mines and favourable foreign exchange rates. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the average value of the Canadian dollar, Euro and Mexican Peso were 10%, 7%, and 17% lower, respectively, than the Company's 2015 currency price assumptions (see February 11, 2015 news release). For the full year 2015, the Company recorded net income of $24.6 million, or $0.11 per share. In 2014, Agnico Eagle recorded net income of $83.0 million, or $0.43 per share. Compared with the prior year, 2015 earnings were affected by lower realized gold and silver prices (down 8% and 14%, respectively, period over period) and increased exploration expenses (up 97%, period over period). In 2015, exploration drilling yielded a significant increase in inferred mineral resources at the Amaruq project in Nunavut, an initial inferred mineral resource at the El Barqueno project in Mexico and a maiden inferred mineral resource at the Sisar Zone at Kittila. The decrease in realized gold and silver prices and increase in exploration expenses were partially offset by higher gold production and favourable foreign exchange rates. For the full year 2015, cash provided by operating activities was $616.2 million ($660.0 million before changes in non-cash components of working capital). This represents a decrease over 2014, when cash provided by operating activities totalled $668.3 million ($624.4 million before changes in non-cash components of working capital). The decrease was primarily due to increased inventory positions. For the fourth consecutive year, Agnico Eagle has reported annual gold production in excess of annual guidance. The Company's payable production for the full year 2015 was 1,671,340 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $567, compared to guidance of 1,650,000 ounces at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $590 to $610. In 2014, full year production was 1,429,288 ounces at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $637. The improvement in gold production in 2015 was a result of strong operating results from all of the mines, particularly Canadian Malartic as a result of the full year inclusion of production, LaRonde as a result of the higher grades from mining in more gold rich areas of the lower areas of the mine (below the 215 level), Goldex due to better productivity, increased throughput at Kittila from the ramp up of the mill expansion, increased stacking capacity at La India, and higher grades from Pinos Altos. The decrease in total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis in 2015 was primarily due to higher gold production for 2015, strong cost control initiatives at all of the mines and the positive effect of foreign exchange rates. For the full year 2015, the average value of the Canadian dollar, Euro and Mexican Peso were 5%, 4%, and 18% lower, respectively than the Company's 2015 currency price assumptions (see February 11, 2015 news release). AISC for 2015 on a by-product basis was $810 per ounce, which is below the previous 2015 guidance between $840 and $860 per ounce. The lower AISC is primarily due to lower than forecast total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis in 2015 and a reduction in sustaining capital expenditures through a strong emphasis on sustaining capital expenditure controls. Quarterly Dividend Declared Agnico Eagle's Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.08 per common share, payable on March 15, 2016 to shareholders of record as of March 1, 2016. Agnico Eagle has now declared a cash dividend every year since 1983. Liquidity - Existing Cash and Credit Facility Provide Flexibility Cash and cash equivalents and short term investments decreased to $131.6 million at December 31, 2015, from the September 30, 2015 balance of $208.1 million partly as a result of using cash to repay outstanding balances on the Company's credit facility. The outstanding balance on the Company's $1.2 billion credit facility was reduced from $350 million at September 30, 2015 to $265 million at December 31, 2015, resulting in availability under its credit lines of approximately $935 million, not including the $300 million accordion facility. Total capital expenditures made by the Company in the fourth quarter of 2015 were $133.0 million, including $22.2 million at Meliadine, $20.0 million at Pinos Altos, $18.0 million at Meadowbank, $18.0 million at Kittila, $16.7 million at LaRonde, $13.6 million at Canadian Malartic (50% basis), $13.6 million at Goldex, $7.9 million at La India, $2.6 million at Creston Mascota and $1.0 million at Lapa. Total capital expenditures for the full year 2015 were $449.8 million including $67.3 million at LaRonde, $66.7 million at Meliadine, $65.2 million at Meadowbank, $61.8 million at Pinos Altos, $56.4 million at Kittila, $48.8 million at Goldex, $43.4 million at Canadian Malartic (50% basis), $23.4 million at La India, $6.5 million at Lapa and $4.2 million at Creston Mascota. Total sustaining capital expenditures made by the Company in the fourth quarter of 2015 were $90.4 million, including $18.0 million at Meadowbank, $16.7 million at LaRonde, $15.1 million at Kittila, $13.6 million at Canadian Malartic (50% basis), $11.4 million at Pinos Altos, $7.9 million at La India, $4.1 million at Goldex, $2.6 million at Creston Mascota and $1.0 million at Lapa. Total sustaining capital expenditures for the full year 2015 were $305.1 million including $67.3 million at LaRonde, $65.2 million at Meadowbank, $45.7 million at Kittila, $41.6 million at Canadian Malartic (50% basis), $35.5 million at Pinos Altos, $23.4 million at La India, $15.7 million at Goldex, $6.5 million at Lapa, and $4.2 million at Creston Mascota. Three-Year Guidance Plan Outlines a Stable Production and Cost Profile The Company is announcing its production and cost guidance for 2016 through 2018. The Company expects average annual production of approximately 1.53 million ounces over the next three years with a stable cost profile. Various internal projects at current operating mines have the potential to add incremental production in 2018, while Amaruq, Meliadine and El Barqueno are expected to add significant production starting in 2019 to 2020. However, the Company continues to take a prudent and measured approach to development while maintaining financial flexibility. In 2016, payable production is expected to be between 1.525 million and 1.565 million ounces of gold. Total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis in 2016 are expected to be in a range from $590 and $630 using a US$/C$ exchange rate assumption of 1.30. Previous production guidance for 2016 (from the February 2015 forecast), was 1.60 million ounces. The change in production compared to the previous 2016 guidance is primarily due to the decision to proceed with the expansion of the Vault pit at Meadowbank (thereby extending the mine life). With the Vault extension, the production forecast at Meadowbank was reduced in 2016, but increased for 2017 and 2018. Consolidated AISC for 2016 are expected to be between $850 and $890 per ounce using a US$/C$ exchange rate assumption of 1.30. Near-term Mine Optimization Projects Could Potentially Enhance 2018 Production Over the next three years (2016 through 2018) annual production is forecast to average approximately 1.53 million ounces. The estimated production level in 2018 is currently forecast to be approximately 1.50 million ounces. However, the Company is evaluating potential optimizations and opportunities (none of which have yet been approved for construction) at a number of existing operations to further enhance the Company's production profile in 2018 and beyond. LaRonde Optimization In 2003, the Company acquired the Bousquet gold property from Barrick Gold. The property adjoins the LaRonde mining complex to the east and hosts the Bousquet Zone 5, which previous operators had partly exploited by open pit. The Company is evaluating the potential to initially mine the Bousquet Zone 5 from a depth of 90 to 330 metres below surface via an underground ramp. This portion of the deposit contains indicated mineral resources of approximately 566,000 ounces of gold (9.3 million tonnes grading 1.90 g/t gold) and inferred gold mineral resources of approximately 109,000 ounces of gold (1.47 million tonnes grading 2.31 g/t gold). The mining method is likely to be similar to that employed at Goldex, and processing could utilize excess capacity from the Lapa circuit at LaRonde. Dewatering of the old pit is underway and permit applications to collect a bulk sample will be submitted shortly. An internal technical study is expected to be completed by the end of 2016. At the Lapa mine two areas (Zone 8 East - Upper mine and the Zulapa 7- Deep 2 Zone) have been identified through exploration (see Lapa mine discussion) as areas that could potentially support future mining activity. Further exploration and internal studies are underway to look at synergies with other production opportunities such as the Bousquet Zone 5. In addition, Canadian Malartic Corporation (\"CMC\", owned 50% by Agnico Eagle and 50% by Yamana Gold Inc. \"Yamana\") is continuing to explore the Pandora project, which adjoins the Lapa mine to the west (for additional details see the Canadian Malartic section of this news release). Should the exploration efforts be successful, Pandora could potentially have synergies with the other opportunities currently being evaluated at the Lapa mine. Goldex Optimization At present, the Goldex mill has about 25% excess capacity (rated capacity is 8,000 tpd, but forecast to process approximately 6,400 tpd in 2016). As such, the Company is evaluating opportunities to potentially increase throughput from the Deep 1 Zone, and the potential to mine a portion of the Deep 2 Zone. These opportunities, and the potential development of the Akasaba West deposit (see below), could enhance production levels or extend the current mine life and reduce operating costs. In January 2014, Agnico Eagle acquired the Akasaba West gold-copper deposit from Alexandria Minerals. Located less than 30 km from Goldex, the Akasaba West deposit could create flexibility and synergies for the Company's operations in the Abitibi region by utilizing extra milling capacity at both Goldex and LaRonde, while reducing overall costs. Akasaba West currently hosts a probable mineral reserve of 141,000 ounces of gold and 24,557 tonnes of copper (4.76 million tonnes grading 0.92 g/t gold and 0.52% copper). Permitting and technical studies are ongoing with the goal of moving the project towards a production decision in late 2016 or early 2017. Kittila Optimization Previous drilling on the Rimpi Zone at Kittila has outlined a significant zone of mineralization with potentially wider widths and better grades than those currently being mined. The main underground ramp at Kittila is being extended to reach the Rimpi Zone, and it is also providing further underground drill access to test for additional depth extensions of the Rimpi, Suuri, Roura and the newly discovered Sisar mineralized zones. In addition, a surface ramp is being driven into the Rimpi Zone (now at a depth of 190 metres below surface) for production purposes and to provide a second egress for the Suuri ramp system. It will serve as the main haulage route from the deeper portions of both Rimpi and Suuri and potentially the Sisar Zone. In 2015, a new sub-parallel zone of mineralization (Sisar Zone) was recognized by exploration drilling from the underground ramp being driven towards the deeper portion of the Rimpi Zone. Additional drilling through year-end 2015 continued to yield favourable results (see Kittila mine discussion in this news release) at Sisar, and an initial inferred mineral resource of approximately 651,000 ounces of gold (3.4 million tonnes grading 5.91 g/t gold) has been announced (see \"Detailed Mineral Reserve and Mineral Resource Data (as at December 31, 2015)\" below). In 2016, additional drilling is planned to infill and further expands the Sisar mineralization. Given that the Sisar Zone is located approximately 200 metres directly east of the exploration ramp (at a depth of approximately 800 metres below surface), Sisar could potentially provide an additional source of underground ore to the Kittila mill with relatively little additional underground development. With the potential for higher mill capacity (approximately 20%) through ongoing optimization, development of the Rimpi and Sisar zones could result in increased future production levels and reduced operating costs at Kittila. Mexican Opportunities At Pinos Altos and Creston Mascota, the Company continues to evaluate the sequencing of additional satellite zones, which could provide additional ore to the Pinos Altos complex. This drill data is being incorporated into preliminary studies along with metallurgical testing and geotechnical data in order to better optimize the development potential of remaining satellite resources including Sinter and Bravo. During 2015, higher grade mineralization was encountered at the bottom of the Creston Mascota pit. Work is underway to understand the potential impact of this mineralization on the pit design and production planning. At La India, additional drilling was carried out in 2015 with a focus on extending mineralization in the Main Zone and the La India Zone, and conversion of sulfide mineralization into mineral reserves and mineral resources. In addition, drilling was also carried out on a portion of the El Realito property. The 2015 exploration program and new ore model resulted in a 28% increase in mineral reserves, and a 21% increase in measured and indicated mineral resources (see \"Detailed Mineral Reserve and Mineral Resource Data (as at December 31, 2015)\" below). The Company is looking at near pit potential for further mineral reserve expansion and will consider opportunities to increase production at La India based on the success of that program. Development/Expansion Projects in the Abitibi, Nunavut and Mexico Expected to Provide Longer-term Growth Opportunities beyond 2019 The expansion and development projects set out below, which have not yet been approved for construction, have the potential to add to the Company's production profile in 2019 and beyond. Amaruq - Expanding the Mineral Resource Base and Locating a Second Open Pit Deposit is the Key Focus in 2016 The 100% owned Amaruq property consists of 114,760 hectares of Inuit and federal crown land. Agnico Eagle acquired its initial interest in April 2013 pursuant to a mineral exploration agreement with Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated. In 2015, a $37.7 million exploration program (378 drill holes totalling approximately 108,000 metres) was carried out at the Amaruq project, which is located approximately 50 kilometres northwest of the Meadowbank mine in Nunavut. A large portion of last year's drill program was focused on the Whale Tail Zone, where drilling has outlined up to five mineralized lenses along a strike length of 2.3 kilometres and to a depth of up to 600 metres below surface. Mineralization at Whale Tail remains open in all directions. Significant mineralization has also been outlined in the IVR area. As a result of the 2015 exploration program, the inferred mineral resource at Amaruq increased by approximately 67% compared to the inferred mineral resource of 2.0 million ounces of gold (see the Company's August 19, 2015 news release for comparison) to 3.3 million ounces of gold (16.9 million tonnes grading 6.05 g/t gold) at December 31, 2015 (for additional details see the mineral reserve and mineral resource discussion in this news release). The first phase of a planned 75,000 metre drill program (costing approximately $19 million) began with two drills in early February 2016. The goals of this program are to infill and expand the known mineral resource areas and test other favourable targets (for additional details see the exploration section below). A mineral resource update is expected in the second half of 2016. In late 2015, the Company received approvals for the construction of an all-weather access road linking the Amaruq access site to the Meadowbank mine. In 2016 the Company expects to carry out additional engineering and begin road preparation from the Vault pit at Meadowbank. The Company expects to ultimately develop Amaruq as a satellite operation to Meadowbank, with the potential to begin production in 2019. Given that the initial mineral resource grade at Amaruq is well in excess of the mineral reserve grade at Meadowbank, the Company believes that there is good potential for Amaruq to have similar annual output to Meadowbank in its peak production years. Permitting activities and engineering studies for the construction of an initial open pit mine and an underground exploration ramp at Amaruq are ongoing. Meliadine - Moderate 2016 Capital Expenditures Preserves Production Optionality Located near Rankin Inlet, Nunavut, Canada, the Meliadine project was acquired in July 2010, and is one of Agnico Eagle's largest gold projects in terms of mineral resources. The Company owns 100% of the 111,757 hectare property. The updated technical study for Meliadine released last year (see March 12, 2015 news release) forecast average annual production of approximately 350,000 ounces at a life-of-mine total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of approximately $531 over a nine-year mine life. The study used a gold price of C$1,495 per ounce (as compared to a current spot price of approximately C$1,657 per ounce on February 8, 2016). The technical study was based on extracting only the 3.3 million ounces of gold in proven and probable mineral reserves at December 31, 2014 (13.9 million tonnes of ore grading 7.44 g/t gold), which is all contained in the Tiriganiaq and Wesmeg deposits. At December 31, 2015, the Meliadine property hosted 3.4 million ounces of proven and probable mineral reserves (14.5 million tonnes of ore grading 7.32 g/t gold), 3.31 million ounces of measured and indicated mineral resources (20.8 million tonnes of ore grading 4.95 g/t gold), and 3.55 million ounces of inferred mineral resources (14.7 million tonnes of ore grading 7.51 g/t gold). In addition, there are numerous other known gold occurrences in the 80-kilometre-long greenstone belt that require further evaluation. The capital budget for 2016 is $96 million with activities focused on further underground development (approximately 3,000 metres), detailed engineering and procurement, construction of essential surface infrastructure and acquisition of a used camp facility. The goal of the 2016 capital program is to ensure that the project remains on track for a potential 2020 production start-up, which is approximately a one year delay from previous expectations. Internal studies are ongoing to evaluate the potential to extract additional ounces of gold from the Tiriganiaq and Wesmeg/Normeg deposits that could potentially extend the mine life, increase annual production and improve the project economics and the after-tax internal rate of return. These studies are expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2016. On October 5, 2015, the Nunavut Water Board issued the permit (License B) for Meliadine pre-development work. License A, which is required for production activities, is expected to be granted in the second quarter of 2016. The timing of future capital expenditures on the Meliadine project beyond 2016 and the determination of whether to build a mine at Meliadine are subject to approval by Agnico Eagle's Board of Directors which will be based on prevailing market conditions and outcomes of the various potential scenarios being evaluated. El Barqueno - Initial Mineral Resource Announced, Significant Drilling Planned in 2016 The El Barqueno property in Jalisco State, Mexico covers a land position with known strike extent for mineralization larger than both the La India and Pinos Altos properties combined. Previous property owners outlined several mineralized zones through surface exploration and diamond drilling. In 2015, the Company completed approximately 69,500 metres of drilling at a cost of $17 million on the El Barqueno property. The primary focus of the 2015 program was to define the limits of the Azteca-Zapoteca, Angostura and Pena de Oro prospects, and delineate an initial mineral resource estimate for these deposits. Several other prospects were also under evaluation. Based on the 2015 exploration results and previous work programs, the Company has estimated initial total inferred in-pit mineral resources of approximately 0.61 million ounces (19.7 million tonnes grading 0.96 g/t gold) from the Azteca-Zapoteca, Angostura and Pena de Oro areas to open-pit mineable depths. An additional 11,000 metres of drilling has been completed since the estimation of the inferred mineral resource. Further details on the El Barqueno inferred mineral resource can be found in \"Detailed Mineral Reserve and Mineral Resource Data (as at December 31, 2015)\" below. In 2016, Agnico Eagle plans to carry out a $13 million exploration program to further expand and infill the known mineral resource areas and evaluate other prospective targets such as: Olmeca, Zapote, Mixteca, El Rayo, and Pilarica. At present there are 14 drills operating on the project. While it is too early to estimate the full extent of the mineral resources and the number of deposits with economic potential at El Barqueno, the Company has the experience of developing cost-efficient mining operations in Mexico and increasing their size through successful exploration as well as metallurgical innovation. This body of knowledge will be applied as El Barqueno continues to be explored and studied. Agnico Eagle believes that El Barqueno ultimately has the potential to be developed into a series of open pits utilizing heap leach processing, similar to the Creston Mascota and La India mines. Conceptual design studies and additional metallurgical testing are underway at El Barqueno with a goal of potentially starting operations in 2019. Canadian Malartic - Odyssey Zone and Near Pit Opportunities Could Provide Future Production Upside At the Canadian Malartic mine (owned 50% by Agnico Eagle and 50% by Yamana), exploration programs are planned to evaluate a number of near pit/underground targets at the mine and further define the extent of the mineralization at the Odyssey Zone (which is located to the east of the Canadian Malartic open pit). Both of these opportunities could provide new potential sources of ore for the Canadian Malartic mill. In 2016, the Canadian Malartic block model will be reviewed to further define the potential of a number of near pit/underground targets and a 60,000 metre drill program has been proposed to further evaluate the extent of the mineralization at Odyssey. For additional details on these opportunities, see the Canadian Malartic section of this news release. LaRonde - Studies Ongoing to Evaluate Potential to Mine Below a Depth of 3.1 Kilometres Studies are continuing to assess the potential to extend the mineral reserves and carry out mining activities between the 311 and 371 levels at LaRonde. At present, the mineral reserves extend to the 311 level, which is 3.1 kilometres below the surface. Drilling is ongoing to further expand the known mineral resource between the 311 and 341 levels. Additional holes are also being drilled to evaluate the extent of the mineralization down to the 371 level (a depth of 3.7 kilometres below the surface). In 2016, the focus of drilling will be on mineral resource expansion and mineral resource to mineral reserve conversion in the western portion of the LaRonde orebody. 2016 Exploration Program and Budget - Main Focus on Amaruq, El Barqueno and the Sisar Zone at Kittila A large component of the 2016 exploration program will be focused on the Amaruq project near the Meadowbank mine in Nunavut, the El Barqueno project in Jalisco State, Mexico and the Sisar Zone at the Kittila mine in Finland. These exploration programs are designed to infill and expand known deposits and test other favourable target areas. The goal is to delineate mineral reserves and mineral resources that can supplement the Company's existing production profile. The 2016 Amaruq drill program commenced earlier this month with two drills testing targets in the Mammoth Lake area. Eventually the Company expects to have eight to ten drills operating with a focus on infilling and expanding the known mineralized zones, testing other nearby targets with a focus on developing a second source of open pit ore and further evaluation of regional target areas. The initial 2016 exploration program contemplates approximately 75,000 metres of drilling with a budget of approximately $19 million. The 2016 program also includes engineering studies and permitting activities for the construction of an initial open pit mine and an underground exploration ramp. Exploration expenditures at El Barqueno in 2016 are budgeted at $13 million for mineral resource development, conversion and regional exploration. There are currently 14 drills on the property working to define the limits of the known prospects and test new target areas such as: Olmeca, Zapote, Mixteca, El Rayo, and Pilarica. El Barqueno's gold-silver deposits could potentially be developed into a series of open pits utilizing heap leach processing, similar to Creston Mascota and the La India mines. In 2016, approximately $5 million will be spent on further deep drilling at Kittila (which includes the Sisar Zone). The goal of this program is to expand and upgrade the mineral resources and evaluate the potential to possibly develop the Sisar Zone as a new mining horizon at Kittila. Depreciation Guidance Agnico Eagle expects its 2016 depreciation and amortization expense to be in the range of $630 to $660 million. General & Administrative Cost Guidance Agnico Eagle expects 2016 general and administration expense to be between $70 and $80 million, excluding share based compensation. In 2016, share based compensation is expected to be between $20 and $25 million including stock option expense (which is a non-cash item) of between $18 and $22 million, which is consistent with previous years. Please see the supplemental financial data section of the Financial and Operating Database on the Company's website for additional historical financial data. Tax Guidance for 2016 For 2016, the jurisdictional tax rates are expected to be: Canada - 40% to 50% Mexico - 35% to 40% Finland - 20% The Company's overall tax rate is expected to be between 40% and 45%. Gold Reserves Decrease Slightly to Approximately 19.1M Ounces, Reserve Grade Increased at Key Operations To estimate the 2015 year-end mineral reserves, the Company continued to use conservative assumptions: $1,100/ounce gold and $16/ounce silver, US$/C$, EUR/US$ and US$/MPX exchange rates of 1.16, 1.20 and 14.00, respectively for all mines and projects, other than Lapa, Meadowbank, Creston Mascota and the Santo Nino pit at Pinos Altos. Due to the shorter mine life of these mining operations, the Company used exchange rate assumptions for US$/C$ and US$/MXP of 1.30 and 16.00, respectively (other assumptions unchanged). At year-end 2015, the Company's proven and probable mineral reserves (net of 2015 production) totaled 251 million tonnes of ore grading 2.37 g/t gold, containing approximately 19.1 million ounces of gold. This is a decrease of approximately 0.9 million ounces of gold (5%) compared with a year earlier. The decrease in the Company's mineral reserves is largely due to the 1,671,340 ounces of payable gold production in 2015 (1,910,000 ounces of in-situ gold mined), partially offset by successful conversion of measured and indicated mineral resources to mineral reserves at several operations. Highlights from the December 31, 2015 Mineral Reserve Statement include: Increased mineral reserve grades at LaRonde (5.31 g/t gold versus 5.20 g/t gold), Canadian Malartic (1.08 g/t gold versus 1.06 g/t gold), Goldex (1.61 g/t gold versus 1.49 g/t gold), and La India (0.90 g/t gold versus 0.85 g/t gold) At Goldex, the mineral reserves almost doubled to 668,000 ounces of gold with an 8% increase in the mineral reserve grade At the Akasaba project, initial mineral reserves of 141,000 ounces of gold are reported (4.8 million tonnes grading 0.92 g/t gold and 0.52% copper) At La India, the mineral reserves increased by 28% (188,000 ounces) to 867,000 ounces of gold (30.0 million tonnes of ore grading 0.90 g/t gold and 4.23 g/t silver) Comparison of assumptions used to estimate mineral reserves and the gold price in local currencies in 2013, 2014 and 2015 The Company's overall mineral reserve gold grade has decreased slightly to 2.37 g/t from 2.40 g/t. This is the result of a reduction in the cut-off grades at each operation because of a slight increase of the assumed gold price when converted to local currencies (shown in the table above). Agnico Eagle has one of the highest mineral reserve grades among its North American peers. In the Northern Business, gold contained in mineral reserves decreased by 726,000 ounces (4%) in 2015; during the year this business segment produced 1,319,301 ounces of gold (1,451,000 ounces of in-situ gold mined). The largest mineral reserve increase in the Northern Business was at the Goldex mine, where the amount contained in mineral reserves increased by 328,000 ounces of gold (96%), year-over-year, to 668,000 ounces of gold, with an 8% increase in the mineral reserve grade to 1.61 g/t gold from 1.49 g/t gold. The increase is largely due to the successful conversion of mineral resources to mineral reserves, mainly in the D Zone as well as in the M and E zones. These are the initial D Zone probable mineral reserves (354,000 ounces of gold in 6.3 million tonnes of ore grading 1.75 g/t gold), related to the approval of mining the Deep 1 project announced in the Company's news release dated July 29, 2015. This increase was offset by the 2015 production of 115,426 ounces of gold (123,000 ounces of in-situ gold mined). At the nearby Akasaba project, initial probable mineral reserves reported are 141,000 ounces of gold (4.8 million tonnes grading 0.92 g/t gold and 0.52% copper), the result of conversion of indicated mineral resources to mineral reserves. Canadian Malartic had the largest decline in mineral reserves; its mineral reserves decreased by 466,000 ounces of gold, mainly due to 2015 gold production of 285,809 ounces (322,000 ounces of in-situ gold mined). The remainder of the decline was due to a slight reduction in the pit shells related to the incorporation of the 5% net smelter return royalty payable to Osisko Gold Royalties Ltd. and the termination of the Gouldie open pit. All numbers shown for Canadian Malartic reflect Agnico Eagle's 50% ownership in the mine. The decrease in the Meadowbank mine's mineral reserves by mine depletion was partially offset by the conversion of mineral resources to mineral reserves for the Vault pit extension, announced in the Company's news release dated July 29, 2015. At Kittila, the mining depletion was partially offset by successful conversion of mineral resources to mineral reserves. In the Southern Business, the gold contained in mineral reserves decreased by approximately 175,000 ounces (7%) in 2015. This business segment had production of 352,039 ounces of gold (459,000 ounces of in-situ gold mined) in 2015. There was a large increase at the La India mine where the gold mineral reserves increased by 28% (188,000 ounces) to 867,000 ounces of gold (30.0 million tonnes of ore grading 0.90 g/t gold and 4.23 g/t silver) compared with a year ago. The mine depletion was more than offset by the addition of new oxide reserves and by conversion of sulphide mineral resources to mineral reserves in the Main pit, the result of successful metallurgical investigations in 2015 and field-proven experience with the North Zone sulphide material. The 304,000-ounce decline in mineral reserves at Pinos Altos was due to 2015 production of 192,974 ounces of gold (205,000 ounces of in-situ gold mined) as well as a change to the Cerro Colorado block model based on information gained from geological mapping and mining development. It is the Company's goal to maintain its global mineral reserves at approximately 10 to 15 times its annual gold production rate. The current mineral reserves are within this range when compared to the Company's projected annual 2016 production rate. In addition to gold, Agnico Eagle's proven and probable mineral reserves include by-product metals of approximately 55 million ounces of silver at the Pinos Altos, LaRonde, La India and Creston Mascota mines (68.2 million tonnes of ore grading an average of 25.0 g/t silver), plus 147,927 tonnes of zinc and 43,357 tonnes of copper at the LaRonde mine (18.2 million tonnes of ore grading 0.81% zinc and 0.24% copper) and 24,557 tonnes of copper at the Akasaba project (4.8 million tonnes grading 0.52% copper). At a gold price of $1,200 per ounce (leaving all other assumptions unchanged), there would be an approximate 5.4% increase in the gold contained in proven and probable mineral reserves. Conversely, using a gold price of $1,000 (leaving all other assumptions unchanged), there would be an estimated 5.4% decrease in the gold contained in proven and probable mineral reserves. Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources Grow by Approximately 1%, While Inferred Mineral Resources Increase by Approximately 23% Highlights from the December 31, 2015 Mineral Resource Statement include: Measured and indicated mineral resources now total approximately 309 million tonnes of ore grading 1.52 g/t gold, or approximately 15.1 million ounces of gold. This represents an increase of approximately 1% over the 2014 estimate Inferred mineral resources total approximately 230 million tonnes of ore grading 2.24 g/t gold, or approximately 16.5 million ounces of gold. This represents an increase of approximately 23% over the 2014 estimate At Amaruq, inferred mineral resources increased by approximately 67% to 3.3 million ounces of gold (16.9 million tonnes grading 6.05 g/t gold) There was a 43% increase (approximately 533,000 ounces of gold) in inferred mineral resources at Kittila, which includes initial mineral resources in the Sisar Zone discovered in 2015 An initial inferred mineral resource of 608,000 ounces of gold and 3.7 million ounces of silver (19.7 million tonnes grading 0.96 g/t gold and 5.78 g/t silver) was estimated at the El Barqueno project in Mexico At Canadian Malartic, the approach of tripling the cut-off grade of the out-pit mineral resources had the effect of removing 343,000 ounces from the measured and indicated mineral resources, leaving 625,000 ounces (12.8 million tonnes of ore grading 1.51 g/t gold) in measured and indicated mineral resources. The same approach resulted in removing 344,000 ounces from the inferred mineral resource base, leaving 213,000 ounces (4.5 million tonnes of ore grading 1.47 g/t gold) of inferred mineral resources. The cut-off grade used for the calculation of mineral resources at Canadian Malartic is now similar to that used at Goldex The Company's measured and indicated mineral resources now total approximately 309 million tonnes of ore grading 1.52 g/t gold, or 15.1 million ounces of gold. This represents approximately a 1% increase in ounces and a slight increase in grade over the December 2014 measured and indicated mineral resource (see the April 30, 2015 news release for comparison). Two of the Kirkland Lake properties of CMC (50% owned by Agnico Eagle) reported increased indicated mineral resources: the Upper Beaver project increased by 179,000 ounces of gold to 901,000 ounces (4.4 million tonnes grading 6.36 g/t gold), while the Amalgamated Kirkland (\"AK\") project reported initial indicated mineral resources of 133,000 ounces of gold (0.63 million tonnes grading 6.51 g/t gold) (these amounts represent Agnico Eagle's 50% interest). Measured and indicated mineral resources at Kittila increased by 198,000 ounces of gold. La India's measured and indicated mineral resources increased by 143,000 ounces of gold. These increases were offset by the successful conversion drilling from inferred mineral resources at several of the operations, particularly Akasaba and Meadowbank. At Canadian Malartic, the gold in all mineral resource categories declined as the result of adjusting the approach to the out-pit material (adjacent to or below the pit outline) throughout the property. The approach of tripling the cut-off grade of the out-pit mineral resources had the effect of removing 343,000 ounces from the measured and indicated mineral resources, leaving 625,000 ounces (12.8 million tonnes of ore grading 1.51 g/t gold) in measured and indicated mineral resources. The same approach resulted in removing 344,000 ounces from the inferred mineral resource base, leaving 213,000 ounces (4.5 million tonnes of ore grading 1.47 g/t gold) of inferred mineral resources. The cut-off grade used for the calculation of mineral resources at Canadian Malartic is now similar to that used at Goldex. All data shown for Canadian Malartic represent Agnico Eagle's 50% ownership. The Company's inferred mineral resources now total 230 million tonnes of ore grading 2.24 g/t, or approximately 16.5 million ounces of gold. This represents an increase of 23% or approximately 3.1 million ounces of gold in inferred mineral resources (see the Company's April 30, 2015 news release for comparison). The largest part of this increase is the significant updated inferred mineral resource of 16.9 million tonnes grading 6.05 g/t gold (approximately 3.3 million ounces of gold) at the higher-grade Amaruq discovery, which is 50 kilometres from the Meadowbank mine in Nunavut. This is an increase of 1.8 million ounces of gold compared with a year ago. Approximately 56% of the Amaruq mineral resources are near-surface. A portion of the 2015 exploration program at Amaruq involved drill testing portions of the Whale Tail deposit from the north to the south to gain a better understanding of the geological controls on the mineralization. This drilling led to the modelling of thicker, but slightly lower grade zones of mineralization, which resulted in a modest decline in the grade of the inferred mineral resources reachable by open pit. As at December 31, 2015, an initial inferred mineral resource of 608,000 ounces of gold and 3.7 million ounces of silver (19.7 million tonnes grading 0.96 g/t gold and 5.78 g/t silver) was estimated at the El Barqueno project in Mexico. This maiden mineral resource consists of inferred mineral resources from the Azteca-Zapoteca, Angostura and Pena de Oro zones based on preliminary open pit designs. Exploration drilling at depth was responsible for a 43% increase (approximately 533,000 ounces of gold) in inferred mineral resources at Kittila, which includes initial mineral resources in the Sisar Zone, which was discovered in 2015. More details about Sisar can be found in the Kittila operations section of this news release. The Upper Beaver and AK properties in the Kirkland Lake area (50% owned by Agnico Eagle) also reported increased inferred mineral resources, the result of new drilling programs on these projects. The Upper Beaver project increased inferred mineral resources by 136,000 ounces of gold to 659,000 ounces (3.45 million tonnes grading 5.94 g/t gold), while the AK project reported initial inferred mineral resources of 203,000 ounces of gold (1.19 million tonnes grading 5.32 g/t gold) (in each case, representing Agnico Eagle's 50% interest). Successful conversion drilling at depth at the Goldex mine resulted in approximately 329,000 ounces of gold from the inferred mineral resource category to mineral reserves. NORTHERN BUSINESS REVIEW ABITIBI REGION, QUEBEC Agnico Eagle is currently Quebec's largest gold producer with a 100% interest in three mines (LaRonde, Goldex and Lapa) and a 50% interest in the Canadian Malartic mine. These mines are located within 50 kilometres of each other, which provides operating synergies and allows for the sharing of technical expertise. LaRonde Mine - Increased Tonnage From Lower Mine Drives Record Quarterly Production The 100% owned LaRonde mine in northwestern Quebec achieved commercial production in 1988. The LaRonde mill processed an average of 6,128 tpd in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared with an average of 5,847 tpd in the corresponding period of 2014. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$94 in the fourth quarter of 2015, lower than the C$97 per tonne experienced in the fourth quarter of 2014. Throughput in the 2014 period was lower and costs were higher due to the ten days of unscheduled shutdown related to a production hoist drive failure at shaft #4 (the internal winze) in December 2014. Milling performance for the full year 2015 was approximately 6,141 tpd, compared to 5,713 tpd in 2014. Throughput in the 2014 period was lower due primarily to the planned shutdowns for the installation of new hoist drives to replace obsolete production and service hoist equipment in the Penna shaft. Minesite costs per tonne for the full year 2015 were approximately C$99, unchanged from C$99 per tonne in 2014. LaRonde's total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis were $510 in the fourth quarter of 2015 on payable production of 73,161 ounces of gold. This compares with the fourth quarter of 2014 when total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis were $590 on production of 59,316 ounces of gold. The decrease in total cash costs per ounce in the 2015 period was largely due to higher production (due to higher gold grades from the lower mine area and the improved recoveries from the CIP circuit) and favourable foreign exchange rates. For the full year 2015, LaRonde's total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis were $590 on gold production of 267,921 ounces. This compares to total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $668 on gold production of 204,652 ounces in 2014. The higher production and lower costs in the 2015 period are primarily due to the reasons outlined above. In 2015, the LaRonde mine also produced approximately 3,501 tonnes of zinc (67% less than in 2014), 0.9 million ounces of silver (28% less than in 2014), and 4,941 tonnes of copper (1% less than in 2014) as by-products to the gold production. These totals are consistent with the change in the metals mix as the mine goes deeper and becomes more gold rich as opposed to zinc/silver rich in the upper levels. In 2016, approximately 89% of production is expected to come from the lower mine area (below the 248 level). In 2015, work was completed on the installation of the coarse ore conveyor system that extends from the 293 level to the crusher on the 280 level. The new conveyor was commissioned in the fourth quarter and a new ore pass and silo designed to feed the conveyor system are expected to be commissioned in the second quarter of 2016. This new conveyor should help improve mining flexibility and reduce congestion in the deeper portions of the mine. Studies are ongoing to assess the potential to extend the mineral reserve base and carry out mining activities between the 311 and 371 levels at LaRonde. At present, the mineral reserve base extends to the 311 level, which is 3.1 kilometres below the surface. In 2015, exploration drilling focused on the eastern portion of the LaRonde orebody down to the 371 level. As underground development progresses to the west, a key exploration focus in 2016 will be drill testing the western portion of the LaRonde orebody from the 311 to the 371 level. The Company is also evaluating the potential to develop and mine the Bousquet Zone 5 on the adjoining Bousquet property. Previous property owners had partly exploited the Bousquet Zone 5 by open pit and underground, and Agnico Eagle is evaluating the potential to initially mine the Bousquet Zone 5 from a depth of 90 to 330 metres below surface via an underground ramp. The mining method is likely to be similar to that employed at Goldex, and processing could utilize excess capacity from the Lapa circuit at LaRonde. Dewatering of the old pit is underway and permit applications to collect a bulk sample will be submitted shortly. An internal technical study is expected to be completed by the end of 2016. Canadian Malartic Mine - Annual Records Set for Ounces Produced and Tonnes Milled In June 2014, Agnico Eagle and Yamana acquired all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Osisko Mining Corporation (\"Osisko\") and created the Partnership. The Partnership owns and operates the Canadian Malartic mine in northwestern Quebec through a joint management committee. Each of Agnico Eagle and Yamana has an indirect 50% ownership interest in the Partnership. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Canadian Malartic mill processed an average of 52,780 tpd (on a 100% basis) compared with an average of 53,232 tpd in the corresponding period of 2014. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$25 (C$21.76 excluding royalties) compared to the C$21 (C$19.32 excluding royalties) per tonne experienced in the fourth quarter of 2014. In the 2015 period, throughput was lower and costs were higher primarily due to a longer than planned mill shutdown in December 2015. During this shutdown additional costs were incurred to repair the eccentric at the crusher and for the alignment of the ring gear at the #2 ball mill. The average stripping ratio in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 1.86 to 1.0. For the full year 2015, the Canadian Malartic mill processed an average of 52,300 tpd compared with an average of 51,248 tpd in 2014 (on a 100% basis). Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$23 (C$20.24 excluding royalties) compared to the C$22 (C$19.76 excluding royalties) per tonne experienced in 2014. The 2014 tonnage and costs are not considered to be representative as they only reflect the period from the acqusition date of June 16 through December 31. For the fourth quarter of 2015, Agnico Eagle's share of production at the Canadian Malartic mine was 72,872 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $606. This compares with the fourth quarter of 2014 when total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis were $684 on production of 66,369 ounces of gold. Production was higher in the 2015 period primarily due to higher grades. Costs in the 2015 period were lower due to lower costs for fuel and explosives, increased production and favourable foreign exchange rates, partially offset by higher shutdown costs for the planned mill maintenance. For the full year 2015, Agnico Eagle's share of production at the Canadian Malartic mine was 285,809 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $596. This is in contrast with production from June 16 to December 31, 2014, which only included 143,008 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $701 from Canadian Malartic. Future Opportunities - Continuing to Look to Further Optimize Operations Since acquiring the mine in June 2014, the Partnership has been looking at a variety of ways to optimize the operations. In parallel with the Barnat permitting (see below), the Partnership is currently working on the permitting necessary for improving the efficiency and environmental performance of the existing mobile crusher. At this point, milling levels are expected to be approximately 53,000 tpd through year-end 2016. Several other opportunities have been identified to further optimize productivity, including: Improvements to SAG mill liners in order to reduce the number of major shutdowns to three from four Higher North Zone performance with the purchase of an additional remote control production back hoe. This should result in higher grade ore being brought to the mill Cost savings opportunities: primarily on explosives and contractors Ongoing continuous improvement projects Ounce reconciliation with the block model continues to be positive (approximately 5% higher) and is an opportunity to provide additional production flexibility going forward. Permitting activities for the Barnat extension and deviation of Highway 117 are continuing on schedule. An Environmental Impact Assessment (\"EIA\") for this project was submitted in February 2015. A second series of questions from the Quebec government was received by the Partnership in December 2015, and final responses were submitted in January 2016. Public hearings are expected to be held later in 2016. Granting of final permits is expected to occur after the completion of the public consultation process. In parallel, the Partnership is currently working on permitting for improving the efficiency and environmental performance of the existing mobile crusher. Odyssey and Near Pit Targets Could Provide Future Production Upside At the Canadian Malartic mine, exploration programs are planned to evaluate a number of near pit/underground targets at the mine and further define the extent of the mineralization at the Odyssey zone (which is located to the east of the Canadian Malartic open pit). Both of these opportunities could provide new potential sources of ore for the Canadian Malartic mill. At Odyssey, 44 holes (a total of 35,870 metres) were drilled in 2015. Exploration to date has outlined two mineralized zones: Odyssey North and Odyssey South. Odyssey North has been traced from a depth of 550 to 1,200 metres below the surface and along approximately 1,500 metres of strike length. Odyssey South is approximately 200 to 550 metres below surface with an approximate strike length of 1,500 metres. Gold occurs along the margins of a porphyry body in both zones. Plan and three dimensional views of the Odyssey mineralization are shown below. [Plan View Showing Odyssey Zones and Near Pit/Underground opportunities at Canadian Malartic] In 2016, the Canadian Malartic block model will be reviewed to further define the potential of the near pit targets and a 60,000 metre drill program has been proposed to further evaluate the extent of the mineralization at Odyssey. CMC Exploration Activities - Pandora and Kirkland Lake are focus areas In addition to joint, indirect ownership of the Canadian Malartic mine, Agnico Eagle and Yamana are also jointly exploring a portfolio of properties in the Kirkland Lake area and the Pandora and Wood-Pandora properties in the Abitibi region of Quebec. Agnico Eagle and Yamana, indirectly through Canadian Malartic Corporation (CMC) each hold a 50% interest in the Kirkland Lake and Pandora properties, while the Wood-Pandora property is a joint venture between Globex Mining Enterprises Inc. (50%) and CMC. In 2015, approximately 960 metres of underground drifting was carried out on the Pandora project from a track drift developed from the Lapa mine. In addition, 34 surface holes (a total of 19,200 metres) and 13 underground holes (a total of approximately 7,900 metres) were drilled to test the C Zone and Branch Zone targets. Results have been encouraging, and additional underground development and 10,400 metres of drilling is planned in 2016. The proposed budget for Pandora in 2016 (100% basis) is approximately C$4.1 million. In Kirkland Lake, a total of approximately C$7.4 million (100%) was spent in 2015. This work included 58 drill holes (a total of 15,140 metres) on the AK, Upper Canada, Skead-MacGregor and Northland properties. In addition, an Airborne Gravity survey was completed. This new drilling has been incorporated into a new mineral resource estimate for the AK property which is included in Agnico Eagle's December 31, 2015 mineral reserve and mineral resource update (see \"Detailed Mineral Reserve and Mineral Resource Data (as at December 31, 2015)\" below). The proposed budget for Kirkland Lake in 2016 (100% basis) is approximately C$5.2 million. This program will include 3,000 metres of drilling and further data compilation. Lapa - Strong 2015 Performance, Limited Mine Life in 2016 but Exploration Could Provide Additional Upside The 100% owned Lapa mine in northwestern Quebec achieved commercial production in May 2009. The Lapa circuit, located at the LaRonde mill, processed an average of 1,478 tpd in the fourth quarter of 2015. This compares with an average of 1,760 tpd in the fourth quarter of 2014. The reduced throughput in the 2015 period was largely due to lower mill availability resulting from electrical and mechanical issues with the Lapa ball mill. Minesite costs per tonne were C$111 in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to the C$109 realized in the fourth quarter of 2014. Costs in the 2015 period were higher due to the reasons above. Milling performance for the full year 2015 was approximately 1,534 tpd compared to 1,750 tpd in 2014. Throughput in the 2015 period was lower primarily due to downtime related to repairs carried out on the Lapa ball mill in the third and fourth quarters. Full-year minesite costs in 2015 were C$117 per tonne, higher than the C$107 in 2014. Costs were higher in 2015 largely due to the reasons outlined above. Payable production in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 19,929 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $620. This compares with the fourth quarter of 2014, when production was 25,611 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $607. In the 2015 period, production was lower and costs were higher due to a combination of lower throughput and lower grades compared to the 2014 period. For the full year 2015, payable production was 90,967 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $590. The prior year production was 92,622 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $667. Production in 2015 was lower due to lower throughput, while costs were lower primarily due to favourable foreign exchange rates. Under the current life of mine plan, Lapa is only expected to operate until early into the fourth quarter of 2016. Two areas (Zone 8 East - Upper mine and the Zulapa 7 - Deep 2 Zone) have been identified through exploration as areas that could potentially support future mining activity post 2017. However, additional exploration is required, and any potential production from these areas would likely require synergies with other production opportunities such as the Bousquet Zone 5 or the Pandora project. The LaRonde mine has now assumed responsibilities for the management and administration of the Lapa mine and progressive transfers of Agnico Eagle personnel from Lapa are now underway throughout the Company. Goldex - Record Underground Ore Hoisting in Q4 2015, Trend Could Continue into 2016 The 100% owned Goldex mine in northwestern Quebec began operation in 2008 but mining operations in the original orebody, the Goldex Extension Zone (\"GEZ\"), were suspended in October 2011. In July 2012, the M and E satellite zones were approved for development. Mining operations resumed on the M and E satellite zones in September 2013. Mining operations at GEZ remain suspended. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Goldex mine had record underground ore hoisting of 7,273 tpd. Although not currently built into the 2016 production forecast, the Company believes that there is potential for continued strong underground performance in 2016. Should this performance be sustainable, the Company will evaluate the potential to increase mill throughput (current mill capacity is approximately 8,000 tpd). The Goldex mill processed an average of 6,213 tpd in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to 6,251 tpd in the fourth quarter of 2014, which was similar to prior-year levels. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$31 in the fourth quarter of 2015, lower than the C$34 per tonne experienced in the fourth quarter of 2014. The 2015 decrease in costs over the prior-year period is primarily due to the strong underground performance outlined above. For the full year 2015, the Goldex mill averaged 6,336 tpd, which compares to 5,799 tpd in the corresponding period of 2014. The higher throughput in the 2015 period was largely due to accelerated mining levels compared to the 2014 period. Full-year minesite costs per tonne in 2015 were C$33, the same in 2014. Payable production in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 27,646 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $513. This compares with the fourth quarter of 2014, when production was 29,463 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $583. Production in the 2014 period was higher due to slightly higher grades and marginally more ore processed compared to the 2015 period. Costs were lower in the 2015 period due to lower unit costs and favourable exchange rates as compared to the same period in 2014. For the full year 2015, payable production was 115,426 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $538. The prior year production was 100,433 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $638. Production in 2015 was higher and costs were lower than in 2014 due to higher tonnage, grade and recoveries. Rehabilitation of the surface ramp has been completed which provides increased operational flexibility. This ramp also provides access to the M2 and M5 satellite zones for conversion drilling and development later this year. The exploration ramp into the DX Zone (the top of the Deep Zone) has reached the 120 level, which is the proposed bottom of the Deep 1 development phase. Underground development in the Deep 1 Zone will now shift to excavation of the various sublevels needed for mining development and excavation of the conveyor ramp. Studies are underway to evaluate the potential to increase throughput from the Deep 1 Zone, and the potential to mine a portion of the Deep 2 Zone, both of which could enhance production levels or extend the current mine life at Goldex and reduce operating costs. In January 2014, Agnico Eagle acquired the Akasaba West gold-copper deposit from Alexandria Minerals. Located less than 30 km from Goldex, the Akasaba West deposit could potentially create flexibility and synergies for the Company's operations in the Abitibi region by utilizing extra milling capacity at both Goldex and LaRonde, while reducing overall costs. Permitting and technical studies are ongoing with the goal of moving the project towards a production decision in late 2016 or early 2017. FINLAND AND SWEDEN Agnico Eagle's Kittila mine in Finland is the largest primary gold producer in Europe and hosts the Company's largest mineral reserves. Exploration activities continue to expand the mineral resources and studies are underway to evaluate the potential to cost-effectively increase production. Kittila - Strong Mining Performance in Q4 2015 and Available Mill Capacity Provide Potential for Increased Future Production The 100% owned Kittila mine in northern Finland achieved commercial production in 2009. The focus at Kittila in 2015 was on improving mill reliability. Several projects were carried out in the fourth quarter of 2015 which appear to have improved maintenance performance. With further optimization, the Company believes that there is potential for improved mill availability, which could lead to higher throughput levels (possibly up to 20% higher) in the future. The Kittila mill processed an average of 4,100 tpd in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the 3,980 tpd in the fourth quarter of 2014. The underground performed very well in the fourth quarter resulting in record average daily throughput of 4,750 tpd in December 2015. Minesite costs per tonne at Kittila were approximately EUR80 in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to EUR75 in the fourth quarter of 2014. Costs increased in the fourth quarter of 2015 due to the increased usage of consumables, higher contractor costs and increased underground development costs when compared with the 2014 period. For the full year 2015, the mill processed an average of 4,011 tpd, as compared with 2014 when the mill processed an average of 3,168 tpd. The increase in throughput was a result of the completion of the mill expansion at the end of September 2014. For the full year 2015, the minesite costs per tonne were EUR76, compared to EUR78 in 2014. The slight decrease in minesite costs per tonne in the 2015 period are primarily due to efficiencies related to increased mill capacity. Fourth quarter 2015 payable production at Kittila was 44,279 ounces of gold with total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $747. In the fourth quarter of 2014, the mine produced 43,130 ounces at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $809. The higher production and lower costs in the 2015 period were a result of the completion of the mill expansion which continues to ramp-up to design capacity and favourable exchange rates. For the full year 2015, payable production from Kittila was 177,374 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $709. In 2014, the mine produced 141,742 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $845. The lower production in 2014 was largely due to the planned mill shutdown in September 2014 to tie-in the expansion. The lower total cash costs per ounce in the 2015 period are largely due to increased production and favourable foreign exchange rates. Previous drilling on the Rimpi Zone at Kittila has outlined a significant zone of mineralization with potentially wider widths and better grades than those currently being mined. The main underground ramp at Kittila is being extended to reach the deeper portions of the Rimpi Zone and it is also providing further underground drill access to test for additional depth extensions of the Rimpi, Suuri, Roura and the newly discovered Sisar mineralized zones. In addition, a surface ramp is being driven into the Rimpi Zone (now at a depth of 190 metres below surface) for production purposes and to provide a second egress for the Suuri ramp system. It will serve as the main haulage route from the deeper portions of both Rimpi and Suuri and, potentially, the Sisar Zone. At the Kuotko deposit, located approximately 15 kilometres north of Kittila, approximately 7,300 metre of drilling was completed in 2015. New mineralized zones have been identified outside of the known mineral resource areas. Metallurgical testing is also ongoing and studies are being carried out to assess the viability of mining the deposit as a satellite open pit. In 2015, a new zone of mineralization, known as the Sisar Zone, was discovered by exploration drilling from the underground ramp being driven towards the deeper portion of the Rimpi Zone. The Sisar Zone is located to the east of the main Kittila ore zone, and in close proximity to existing underground infrastructure. The Sisar Zone could potentially provide an additional source of underground ore to the Kittila mill with relatively little additional underground development, should further drilling outline an economic deposit. This new zone is discussed in further detail below. Inferred mineral resources at Kittila as of December 31, 2015 include the initial inferred mineral resources reported for the Sisar zone. As the table below sets out, 37% (approximately 651,000 ounces of gold) of the current inferred resources at Kittila are within the Sisar zone. Note that all of the inferred resources at Kittila, including Sisar, are above 1,400 metres depth. Meliadine - Moderate 2016 Capital Expenditures Preserves Production Optionality Located near Rankin Inlet, Nunavut, Canada, the Meliadine project was acquired in July 2010, and is one of Agnico Eagle's largest gold projects in terms of mineral resources. The Company owns 100% of the 111,757 hectare property. In 2015, capital expenditures at Meliadine were approximately $67 million with a focus on additional ramp development, permitting, camp operation and completion of an updated National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\"NI 43-101\") technical study (see news release dated March 12, 2015). In 2015, approximately 2,084 metres of underground development were completed, with the ramp now extending to a vertical depth of approximately 300 metres below the surface. The technical study was based on extracting only the 3.3 million ounces of gold in proven and probable mineral reserves at December 31, 2014 (13.9 million tonnes of ore grading 7.44 g/t gold), which is all contained in the Tiriganiaq and Wesmeg deposits. At December 31, 2015, the Meliadine property hosted 3.4 million ounces of proven and probable mineral reserves (14.5 million tonnes of ore grading 7.32 g/t gold), 3.31 million ounces of measured and indicated mineral resources (20.78 million tonnes of ore grading 4.95 g/t gold), and 3.55 million ounces of inferred mineral resources (14.71 million tonnes of ore grading 7.51 g/t gold). In addition, there are numerous other known gold occurrences in the 80-kilometre-long greenstone belt that require further evaluation. The updated technical study forecast average annual production of approximately 350,000 ounces at a life-of-mine total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of approximately $531 over a nine year mine life. The study used a gold price of C$1,495 per ounce (as compared to a current spot price of approximately C$1,657 per ounce on February 8, 2016). The capital budget for 2016 is $96 million with activities focused on further underground development (approximately 3,000 metres), detailed engineering and procurement, construction of essential surface infrastructure, and acquisition of a used camp facility. The goal of the 2016 capital program is to ensure that the project remains on track for a potential 2020 production start-up, which is approximately a one year delay from previous expectations. Internal studies are ongoing to evaluate the potential to extract additional ounces of gold from the Tiriganiaq and Wesmeg/Normeg deposits, which could potentially extend the mine life, increase annual production, and improve the project economics and the after-tax internal rate of return. These studies are expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2016. In July 2015, the Kivalliq Inuit Association and Agnico Eagle signed the Inuit Impact Benefit Agreement (\"IIBA\") for the Meliadine gold project. The IIBA addresses protection of Inuit values, culture and language, protection of the land, water and wildlife, provides financial compensation to Inuit over the mine life and contains provision for training, employment and contracting. On October 5, 2015, the Nunavut Water Board issued the permit (License B) for Meliadine pre-development work. License A, which is required for production activities, is expected to be granted in the second quarter of 2016. The timing of future capital expenditures on the Meliadine project beyond 2016 and the determination of whether to build a mine at Meliadine are subject to approval by Agnico Eagle's Board of Directors, which will be based on prevailing market conditions and outcomes of the various potential scenarios being evaluated. Acquisition of New Properties in Nunavut Agnico Eagle is currently studying options and alternatives in Nunavut to capitalize on the large and growing mineral resource in the region. As part of this initiative, the Company has staked in 2015 new claims totaling 68,012 hectares on properties to the west-northwest of the project, on the continuation of the greenstone belt that hosts the Meliadine deposits. In summer 2015, an airborne VTEM magnetic and electromagnetic survey was flown over the new properties. A field crew initiated prospecting and sampling of areas with geophysical signatures typical of iron formation-hosted Archean/Proto-Proterozoic deposits, similar to those recognized at Meadowbank, Amaruq and Meliadine projects. Close to 800 rock samples have been collected from the properties. Initial results have identified a 2-kilometre-long structure from which 21 rock samples returned values above 1.0 g/t gold including seven values in excess of 10.0 g/t gold, with a maximum value of 42.0 g/t gold. The new properties appear to be geologically similar to the Meadowbank, Meliadine and Amaruq projects where the Company's exploration team has demonstrated the effectiveness of a systematic exploration approach and the strong mineral potential of this part of Nunavut. Assembling and analyzing the data collected this summer will assist in preparing a drill program for 2016 to further investigate the higher potential areas on the new properties. SOUTHERN BUSINESS REVIEW Agnico Eagle's Southern Business operations are focused in Mexico. These operations have been the source of growing precious metals production (gold and silver), stable operating costs and strong free cash flow since 2009. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the Mexican operations had record quarterly silver production of approximately 745,000 ounces. Pinos Altos - Shaft Commissioning Scheduled for H1 2016 The 100% owned Pinos Altos mine in northern Mexico achieved commercial production in November 2009. The Pinos Altos mill processed 4,940 tpd in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to 5,466 tpd per day processed in the fourth quarter of 2014. During the fourth quarter of 2015, approximately 146,200 tonnes of ore were stacked on the leach pad at Pinos Altos, compared to 131,000 tonnes in the comparable 2014 period. Mill throughput in the 2015 period was negatively impacted by cold weather conditions and a higher percentage of clay in the ore. Minesite costs per tonne at Pinos Altos were $44 in the fourth quarter of 2015, lower than the $48 in the fourth quarter of 2014. The difference in minesite costs per tonne was largely attributable to variations in the proportion of heap leach ore to milled ore and open pit ore to underground ore and routine fluctuations in the waste to ore stripping ratio in the open pit mines. In addition, the 2015 costs were favourably impacted by lower energy and fuel costs. For the full year 2015, the Pinos Altos mill processed an average of 5,462 tpd, compared to 5,350 tpd processed in 2014. In 2015, approximately 384,700 tonnes of ore were stacked on the leach pad at Pinos Altos, compared to approximately 567,800 tonnes in 2014. Minesite costs per tonne at Pinos Altos for the full year period in 2015 were approximately $45 compared to approximately $48 in 2014, with the difference due to the reasons mentioned above. Payable production in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 44,496 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $417. This compares with production of 40,669 ounces at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $597 in the fourth quarter of 2014. Higher production in 2015 is largely due to higher grades processed compared to the same period last year. The decrease in the year over year total cash costs per ounce is largely due to higher silver production and favourable foreign exchange rates compared to the prior year period. For the full year 2015, Pinos Altos produced 192,974 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $387. This is in contrast to 2014 when the mine produced 171,019 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $533. The higher ounces produced and decrease in the cash costs per ounce on a year-over-year basis is largely due to the reasons mentioned above. The $106 million Pinos Altos shaft sinking project remains on schedule for completion in early 2016, with full commissioning expected during the first half of 2016. When the shaft is completed, it will allow better matching of the future mining capacity with the mill capacity at Pinos Altos once the open pit mining operation begins to wind down as planned over the next several years. Creston Mascota - Record Annual Tonnes Stacked The Creston Mascota heap leach has been operating as a satellite operation to the Pinos Altos mine since late 2010. Approximately 529,000 tonnes of ore were stacked on the Creston Mascota leach pad during the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to approximately 550,800 tonnes stacked in the fourth quarter of 2014. In the 2015 period, crusher throughput was slightly lower due to cold weather conditions which created minor ore handling issues. Minesite costs per tonne at Creston Mascota were $13 in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $14 in the fourth quarter of 2014. Costs were slightly lower in the 2015 period due to lower fuel consumption, favourable fuel price variance and lower equipment rental charges. For the full year 2015, approximately 2,098,800 tonnes of ore were stacked on the Creston Mascota leach pad, compared to approximately 1,793,800 tonnes stacked in the full year 2014. In the 2015 period, additional ore was encountered outside the block model, which resulted in more tonnes being stacked in the first half of the year compared to the 2014 period. Minesite costs per tonne at Creston Mascota were $12 for the full year 2015, compared to $16 in 2014. The increase in tonnes stacked in the 2015 period resulted in lower costs compared to the 2014 period. Payable production at Creston Mascota in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 13,933 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $445. This compares to 12,989 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $556 during the fourth quarter of 2014. Production was higher in the 2015 period due to higher grades. Costs in the 2015 period were lower primarily due to increased production and favourable exchange rates. Payable production for the full year 2015 totaled 54,703 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $430, compared to 47,842 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $578 in 2014. The higher production in 2015 is primarily due to more tonnes stacked at slightly higher grades. Costs were lower in the 2015 period primarily due to more ounces produced and favourable exchange rates. In fourth quarter of 2015, work on the Phase 4 leach pad advanced with construction activities focused on earthworks, drainages, peripheral roads and water diversion channels. Overall, the project is 50% constructed with full completion expected later in 2016. As reported in the Company's July 29, 2015 news release, infill drilling has encountered higher grade mineralization at the Creston Mascota deposit. In the fourth quarter of 2015, five holes totaling approximately 600 metres were completed which showed structural continuity of the mineralization down dip. Work is underway to evaluate the impact of these results on the pit design and production planning. La India - Increased Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources at Year-End 2015 The La India mine in Sonora, Mexico, located approximately 70 kilometres from the Company's Pinos Altos mine, was acquired in November 2011 through the purchase of Grayd Resources Inc., which held a 56,000 hectare land position in the Mulatos gold belt. Commissioning of the mine commenced ahead of schedule in the third quarter of 2014. Design, permitting, construction and start-up of the La India mine were completed within 22 months of the acquisition. In 2014, the mine reported 3,180 ounces of pre-commercial production, and commercial production was declared as at February 1, 2014. Approximately 1,439,500 tonnes of ore were stacked on the La India leach pad during the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to approximately 1,426,700 tonnes stacked in the fourth quarter of 2014. Minesite costs per tonne at La India were $8 in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to $9 in the fourth quarter of 2014. The slightly lower costs in the 2015 period are primarily due to lower costs for fuel, consumables and labour. For the full year 2015, approximately 5,371,400 tonnes of ore were stacked on the La India leach pad compared to approximately 4,773,200 tonnes stacked in the full year 2014. Minesite costs per tonne at La India were $9 for the full year 2015, compared to $8 in 2014. The increase in tonnes stacked in the 2015 period reflects a full year of stacking versus 11 months (the commercial production period) in 2014. Costs were slightly higher due to higher maintenance and contractor costs. Payable production at La India in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 23,432 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $485. This compares to 23,273 ounces at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $496 during the fourth quarter of 2014. Costs were slightly better in the 2015 period due to favourable foreign exchange rates. Payable production for the full year 2015 totaled 104,362 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $436, compared to 75,093 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $487 in 2014. The higher production in 2015 is primarily due to more ore tonnes stacked compared to the 2014 period. Costs were lower in the 2015 period due to more ounces produced and favourable foreign exchange rates. In the fourth quarter of 2015, construction for the leach pad expansion (earthworks and liner installation) was finished within budget and haul road construction and preparation activities for the start-up of mining at the Main Zone pit were also completed. Additional drilling was carried out at La India in 2015, with a focus on extending mineralization in the Main Zone and the La India Zone and conversion of sulfide mineralization into mineral reserves and mineral resources. In addition, drilling was also carried out on a portion of the El Realito property. The 2015 exploration program resulted in a 28% increase in mineral reserves, and a 21% increase in measured and indicated mineral resources (see \"Detailed Mineral Reserve and Mineral Resource Data (as at December 31, 2015)\" below). With the increased mineral reserves and mineral resources, the Company is undertaking studies consider the potential for expanding production at the mine. El Barqueno - Drilling Continues with a Focus on Mineral Resource Delineation and Defining New Target Areas Agnico Eagle has a 100% interest in the El Barqueno project. The 32,840-hectare property is in the Guachinango gold-silver mining district, Jalisco State, Mexico, approximately 150 kilometres west of the state capital of Guadalajara. It consists of three blocks of land: the original El Barqueno package (El Barqueno I, II and III) acquired from Cayden Resources in November 2014, and two adjacent blocks acquired from Soltoro Limited in June 2015 (El Rayo and El Tecolote). The Company last reported on this project in a news release dated October 28, 2015. The El Barqueno project contains a number of known mineralized zones and several prospects that require further evaluation. The project was a major exploration focus for the Company in 2015, with a total of 279 holes (a total of 69,522 metres) drilled in the $17 million exploration program. Using these results, an initial inferred mineral resource at El Barqueno is being reported in this news release: 19.7 million tonnes grading 0.96 g/t gold and 5.78 g/t silver (containing 608,000 ounces of gold and 3.7 million ounces of silver) at the Azteca-Zapoteca, Angostura and Pena de Oro zones. Exploration expenditures at El Barqueno in 2016 are budgeted at $13 million for mineral resource development, conversion and regional exploration. There are currently 14 drills working to define the limits of the known prospects and test new target areas such as: Olmeca, Zapote, Mixteca, El Rayo and Pilarica. The project's gold-silver deposits could potentially be developed into a series of open pits utilizing heap leach processing, similar to Creston Mascota and the La India mine.

So that, together, we can feed the world responsibly and improve the lives of future generations. Agrium reports strong fourth quarter results TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 09, 2016 CALGARY, ALBERTA--(Marketwired - Feb. 9, 2016) - ALL AMOUNTS ARE STATED IN U.S.$ Agrium Inc. (TSX:AGU) (NYSE:AGU) announced today 2015 fourth quarter net earnings from continuing operations of $200-million ($1.45 diluted earnings per share), compared to $70-million ($0.46 diluted earnings per share) in the fourth quarter of 2014. The increased net earnings were driven by strong performance from our Wholesale business unit, which achieved reduced cost of production and higher overall sales volumes for all three nutrients. Retail's fourth quarter earnings were also higher than last year, despite the wet weather in the U.S. during the fall application season. On an annual basis, 2015 net earnings from continuing operations were $988-millon ($6.98 diluted earnings per share) compared to $798-millon ($5.51 diluted earnings per share) in 2014. Highlights: Fourth quarter adjusted net earnings of $209-million or $1.52 per share (see page 2 for adjusted net earnings reconciliation)1, the second highest fourth quarter results on record. Our results include an $18-million restructuring expense ($0.10 per share) associated with the portfolio review and cost reduction measures undertaken, which was not included in the adjusted net earnings reconciliation on page 2. Wholesale's fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA2 of $372-million demonstrates improved nitrogen and potash production performance, delivering higher sales volumes and significantly lower production costs. The Canpotex proving run for the Vanscoy expansion was highly successful. We demonstrated our nameplate capacity within a year of mechanical completion, which increased our allocation to 10.3 percent of total Canpotex shipments starting in 2016. Retail EBITDA2 was higher than the same quarter last year as a result of strong year-end rebates for crop protection products and seed as well as lower operating expenses as a result of cost reduction initiatives implemented in 2015. On an annual basis, Retail U.S. normalized comparable store sales was up 2 percent versus a 2 percent decline in 2014. On an annual basis, 2015 free cash flow3 increased to $1.2-billion, or $8.59 per share, compared to $841-million, or $5.85 per share in 2014. Agrium has announced a 2016 annual guidance range of $5.50 to $7.00 diluted earnings per share (see page 3 for further details). \"Agrium achieved a strong finish to 2015, despite lower nutrient prices and challenging commodity markets. A key differentiator for the company was our integrated strategy, which helped provide stability in our earnings. We also benefited from the proactive steps we took to further strengthen the company over the past year, including a renewed focus on execution and controlling our controllables. These benefits flowed through to our bottom line, helped us to generate $8.59 of free cash flow per share and drive increased returns to shareholders, while still investing in future earnings growth,\" commented Chuck Magro, Agrium's President and CEO. Quarter effective tax rate of 20 percent used for adjusted net earnings and per share calculations. These are non-IFRS measures which represent net earnings adjusted for certain income (expenses) that are considered to be non-operational in nature. We believe these measures provide meaningful comparison to the earnings of other companies by eliminating share-based payments expense (recovery), gains (losses) on foreign exchange and related gains (losses) on non-qualifying derivative hedges and significant non-operating, non-recurring items. These should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS and may not be directly comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. EBITDA is earnings (loss) from continuing operations before finance costs, income taxes, depreciation and amortization while Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA before finance costs, income taxes, depreciation and amortization of joint ventures.

We remain focused on Operational Excellence and our growth strategy, controlling what we can in order to reduce our cost position, while continuing to optimize and grow our more stable Retail operations,\" added Mr. Magro. MARKET OUTLOOK The macroeconomic environment has continued to be challenging for commodities, resulting in many commodities trading at multi-year lows in early 2016. While agricultural commodities are driven by unique supply and demand fundamentals, prices have not escaped the general negative sentiment toward commodities. In addition to this, the prices of most crops have been pressured by another year of high global crop yields in 2015, allowing the global inventories of many major grains and oilseeds to increase. Furthermore, the strength in the U.S. dollar relative to most other global currencies has increased the competitiveness of non-U.S. growers, which has led to lower than expected U.S. grain and oilseed exports and added pressure on prices. Despite the weak macroeconomic environment, we expect growers within North America and other major agricultural markets will plant historically high crop acreage again in 2016, supporting robust crop input demand. In the U.S., growers are expected to increase overall crop acreage, including a one to three million acre increase in corn area, as significant crop acreage was lost in 2015 due to excess moisture in parts of the U.S. Corn Belt. Outside of the U.S., the weakness in domestic currencies has led to relatively attractive domestic crop prices, which is expected to support planted acreage. Analysts project that North American corn, soybean, cotton and canola acreage could increase in 2016 if weather cooperates, which is supportive of overall seed demand, but like 2015, growers may be more discerning in trait selection to optimize for yield depending on field locations. Crop protection prices are expected to be relatively stable and we expect that lower year-over-year cash rents and significantly lower fuel and crop nutrient prices will provide support for North American crop input expenditures in 2016. Crop nutrient prices have declined over the past few months, driven by a combination of supply and demand factors. The fall application season in the U.S. was expected to be supported by the relatively early end of the harvest season; however the same warm weather that supported a rapid harvest delayed fall ammonia applications because soil temperatures were too high. Following the warm start, the ability of growers to apply nutrients was constrained by persistent wet weather. November 2015 was the wettest November in the U.S. since 1985 and December 2015 was the wettest December on record in addition to being the warmest. The combination of wet and warm weather meant that application equipment could not get into the field to apply crop nutrients, resulting in below-expected fall applications. The lower than expected fall applications left crop nutrient inventories at higher than expected levels throughout the supply chain and pressured prices of all crop nutrients. The combination of expected increase in U.S. corn acreage and the poor fall application season is anticipated to result in strong U.S. crop nutrient demand in the first half of 2016. Based on expected crop acreage, North American crop nutrient demand is expected to increase by 1 to 3 percent in 2015/2016, but phosphate and potash demand may fall below that range as volumes lost due to the poor fall season may not be fully made up in the first half of 2016. Global urea prices have declined significantly below the cost of production of the high-cost Chinese producers. Even so, Chinese urea production has remained surprisingly strong. While Chinese urea production has not declined as much as expected, Chinese urea exports declined by 26 percent year-over-year in the second half of 2015. Chinese urea costs have declined due to lower coal prices and the weakened yuan, but costs have not declined as much as urea prices. As a result of the continued price weakness and increased non-Chinese urea supplies, Chinese urea exports are projected to decline from 2015 levels to between 12.5 and 13.5 million tonnes in 2016. We expect that the combination of poor Chinese urea profitability and strong North American demand will support urea prices entering the spring season. Chinese phosphate supplies have also pressured that market. Chinese diammonium phosphate and monoammonium phosphate exports reached a record 10.6 million tonnes in 2015 and are expected to remain relatively flat in 2016. On the demand side, the Brazilian market for crop nutrients continued to fall short of expectations in late 2015 as credit constraints and the weak value of the Brazilian real pressured demand for all nutrients. Given that these challenges remain, we expect 2016 Brazilian import demand for all products to remain relatively flat to 2015. The below-average Indian monsoon and weak rupee value pressured demand for phosphate and potash in late 2015, while 2015 urea imports set a record, all of which has led to building inventories and the belief that Indian import demand will be relatively low to start 2016. Global potash markets have been under pressure recently due to a combination of factors, including the sizeable shift in global currencies, a build-up of global inventories due to strong shipments earlier in the year, Indian demand impacted by the below average monsoon and buyers delaying purchases due to the current price uncertainty. We anticipate solid potash demand in global markets in 2016, with global shipments expected to come in between 58 to 60 million tonnes in 2016, relative to the 58.5 million tonnes shipped in 2015. We expect macroeconomic challenges in combination with current crop prices to be a risk in 2016. However, the arrival of the Northern Hemisphere's spring application season over the next couple of months is expected to result in improved demand, particularly in light of the poor fall season in the U.S. and the fact declining crop nutrient prices have caused buyers around the world to sit back and wait for stability. We also expect there will be a supply response across all three major nutrients in reaction to current price levels - some of which we have seen already in the form of production cuts and closures. 2016 ANNUAL GUIDANCE Based on our Market Outlook, Agrium expects to achieve annual diluted earnings per share of $5.50 to $7.00 in 2016. We have maintained a range encompassing approximately $300-million of EBITDA variability to reflect the risk and opportunity associated with crop nutrient prices and demand for crop inputs. We are assuming normal spring and fall application seasons, recognizing there is always a risk that inclement weather could affect the timing and duration of each season. Our earnings per share guidance assumes some recovery from current nitrogen prices during the key application seasons. Based on these and other assumptions regarding crop nutrient prices and demand for crop nutrients set out under the heading \"Market Outlook\", we expect Retail EBITDA to be $1.075-billion to $1.175-billion, and Retail nutrient sales volumes to be 9.8 to 10.2 million tonnes in 2016. Based on our expected increase in utilization rate for our nitrogen assets, we anticipate nitrogen production to total 3.5 to 3.7 million tonnes. Agrium has continued its active hedging program for our gas requirements in 2016 as we expect natural gas prices to remain at levels consistent with 2015. Our earnings per share guidance assume NYMEX gas prices will be between $2.05 and $2.85 per MMBtu in 2016. Agrium's expectation for potash production in 2016 includes incremental production from the completed expansion at our Vanscoy mine. We expect to produce between 2.4 and 2.6 million tonnes of potash in 2016. Total capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $800-million to $900-million, of which approximately $500-million to $550-million is expected to be sustaining capital expenditures. Our investing capital program planned for 2016 includes the completion of our Borger brownfield urea expansion. Agrium's annual effective tax rate for 2016 is expected to be 27 to 28 percent, consistent with 2015. This guidance and updated additional measures and related assumptions are summarized in the following table. Guidance excludes the impact of share-based payments expense (recovery), gains (losses) on foreign exchange and related non-qualifying derivative hedges and significant non-operating, non-recurring items.

Realized selling prices, on the other hand, decreased as a result of weaker market conditions. Reduced sales of product purchased for resale contributed to the decrease in sales as Agrium exited non-core, low return portions of this business. Wholesale's gross profit significantly increased due to manufacturing cost efficiencies associated with higher production volumes, reduced overall fixed costs and lower natural gas input costs for the fourth quarter compared to the same periods last year. Retail's sales and gross profit decreased for the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year primarily due to unfavorable weather conditions and the closure of one of our livestock export businesses in Australia. A decrease in gross profit was partially offset by higher rebates received in the fourth quarter of 2015. Expenses General and administrative expenses decreased by $4-million (5 percent) for the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year as a result of reduced payroll and office expenses related to our ongoing Operational Excellence program. Our share-based payments expense was lower by $10-million due primarily to a slight decrease in our share price in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to a share price increase in the fourth quarter of 2014. Other expenses breakdown In the fourth quarter of 2015, other expenses increased by $18-million due to the following: Costs of $18-million were incurred in the implementation of our Operational Excellence initiatives in the current quarter relating primarily to severance and closure costs. We recorded a goodwill impairment of $19-million for our Wholesale Europe operations. We recognized a $17-million gain from the sale of our West Sacramento nitrogen upgrade facility. We had losses of $15-million on natural gas derivatives in the fourth quarter of 2014, which we recorded directly to other expenses. 2015 did not have comparable results, as effective January 1, 2015, we began to designate all of our natural gas derivatives as qualifying hedges for accounting purposes. Related gains or losses are now recorded as part of cost of product sold when we sell the related product, while unrealized gains or losses are recorded in equity. Bad debt recovery of $11-million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014. Effective Tax Rate The effective tax rate on continuing operations of 20 percent for the fourth quarter was higher than the tax rate of (4) percent for the comparative quarter in 2014 due to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax assets in the fourth quarter of 2014. Excluding the recognition of the one-time previously unrecognized tax assets, the effective tax rate would have been 19 percent. BUSINESS SEGMENT PERFORMANCE Retail   Three months ended December 31,   (millions of U.S. dollars, except where noted) 2015 2014 Change   Sales 1,765 2,057 (292 ) Cost of product sold 1,166 1,443 (277 ) Gross profit 599 614 (15 ) EBITDA 199 181 18   Selling expense as a percentage of sales (%) 26 25 1   Retail sales and gross profit during the quarter were lower than the same period last year due to lower crop input prices and wet weather across the U.S. impacting the fall application season. Total Retail selling expenses decreased by 10 percent compared to the prior year due to lower depreciation and amortization, the impact of currency valuations in our international businesses and cost reduction measures taken across the business in 2015. Total EBITDA increased 10 percent over the fourth quarter of 2014 primarily due to lower selling expenses, strong margins for crop protection products and improved seed results. Regionally, all key geographies performed well. Canada and the U.S. both showed higher fourth quarter EBITDA figures. Australian EBITDA was down slightly compared to the prior year; however, EBIT in Australia increased compared to the prior quarter due to a reduction in depreciation and amortization. Our U.S. Retail business also reported an annual 2 percent increase in normalized comparable store sales versus a decrease of 2 percent in 2014. Crop nutrients Total crop nutrient sales were 13 percent lower compared to the same period last year due to weaker global pricing and lower application volumes due to weather challenges. However, crop nutrient margins per tonne improved, which offset the lower volumes and resulted in only a 1 percent decline in gross profit. Total crop nutrient volumes were 6 percent lower this quarter across our Retail operations compared to the same period last year. Volumes were lower in the U.S. due to excess rain in the fall application window, while in Canada and Australia, growers were conservative given the uncertainty over nutrient and agricultural markets. Total crop nutrient margins increased slightly on a per tonne basis and gross profit as a percentage of sales rose from 16 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014 to 18 percent this quarter reflecting a focus on inventory management. Crop protection products Total crop protection sales were down 2 percent this quarter, as slightly higher sales in North America were offset by lower sales in our International operations. U.S. sales were driven by a strong herbicide application season, while Canadian growers purchased higher volumes ahead of the weakening Canadian dollar. In Australia, sales were lower due to the weakening of the Australian dollar against the U.S. dollar; in local currency, Australian sales were higher in the current quarter. Crop protection margins as a percentage of sales increased 3 percent, primarily due to year-end rebate reconciliation and a higher margin product mix in the current quarter. Proprietary product sales as a percentage of total sales increased 2 percent compared to the same period in the prior year. Seed Seed sales were down 18 percent this quarter compared to the same period last year, primarily due to the significant reduction in planted wheat acres in the U.S. due to wet weather and lower wheat prices. Despite lower sales, seed margins increased 8 percent compared to the prior year due to strong supplier rebates and seed sales mix. Merchandise Merchandise sales decreased compared to the same period last year as a result of lower fuel pricing and demand in Canada and lower animal health and fencing product sales in Australia due to dry conditions. Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased 3 percent this quarter, primarily due to a reduction in the lower-margin Canadian fuel business compared to the prior year. Services and other Sales for services and other was down 35 percent this quarter, due mainly to the closure of one of our livestock export businesses in Australia. Application and other services were down in North America, due to the wet conditions in the U.S. during the fall application season. Wholesale   Three months ended December 31,   (millions of U.S. dollars, except where noted) 2015 2014 Change   Sales 888 897 (9 ) Sales volumes (tonnes 000's) 2,292 1,999 293   Cost of product sold 568 767 (199 ) Gross profit 320 130 190   Adjusted EBITDA 372 150 222   Expenses 33 46 (13 Wholesale successfully completed its Canpotex proving run for the Vanscoy potash expansion at the end of the fourth quarter, resulting in our annual Canpotex allocation increasing to 10.3 percent in 2016 from 7.3 percent in 2015. Higher operating production rates at our nitrogen facilities also supported increased sales volumes this quarter. Total sales were slightly lower this quarter due to lower global nutrient prices and our decision to sell non-core, lower-return purchase for resale facilities in 2015 related to our asset portfolio review. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $222-million this quarter, and more than doubled compared to the same quarter last year. The increase was primarily due to lower production costs per tonne and higher utilization rates from our potash and nitrogen operations. Nitrogen Nitrogen gross profit increased by 65 percent over the same period last year as a result of higher sales volumes and significantly lower cost of production. Sales volumes increased by 4 percent over the same period last year, driven by stronger urea and ammonia sales volumes. The increase was due to strong demand in our core markets and higher on-stream time at our production facilities, creating additional product availability compared to the same period last year. Sales volumes were partly impacted by a narrow window for ammonia application in the U.S. and lower nitrogen solution sales volumes due to the closure and subsequent sale of our West Sacramento upgrading facility in 2015. Cost of product sold per tonne was 40 percent lower than the same period last year. Operational improvements and higher on-stream time compared to the same period last year decreased fixed costs per tonne, while lower natural gas costs reduced variable costs. The weaker Canadian dollar also reduced operating costs at our Canadian plants. Nitrogen margins were $204 per tonne, a $76 per tonne increase over the same period last year, despite a 12 percent reduction in average selling prices. As of January 1, 2015, we have designated all of our natural gas derivatives as accounting hedges1, with realized gains and losses now recorded to cost of product sold (which also includes transportation and administration costs). In the prior year, unrealized and realized gains and losses on derivatives not designated as hedges were included in other expenses. Potash Potash gross profit this quarter was $113-million higher than the same period last year. The significant increase was due to higher production volumes and lower costs this quarter after the completion of the Vanscoy expansion project as compared to the significant outage in the fourth quarter of 2014 in order to tie-in the expansion, which resulted in a negative gross profit of $50-million. Sales volumes were 637,000 tonnes higher compared to the same period in the prior year. Production volumes this quarter were 691,000 tonnes and the Canpotex proving run was completed successfully before the end of 2015. We expect Agrium's new Canpotex allotment will be 10.3 percent of Canpotex's total annual international shipments. Realized selling prices were lower than the same period last year due to slow spot market demand in both domestic and international markets. Cost of product sold was reduced as a result of cost efficiencies associated with the ramp-up of the Vanscoy expansion compared to the outage last year for the final tie-in of the expansion project. The significant weakening of the Canadian dollar also reduced production costs reported in U.S. dollars. As a result, cash cost of product manufactured continues to improve and was $64 per tonne this quarter compared to $89 per tonne in the third quarter of 2015. Phosphate Sales volumes were slightly higher than last year, while reduced selling prices were largely offset by lower cost of production. As a result, phosphate margin per tonne was only 6 percent lower than the same quarter last year. Phosphate gross profit was unchanged from the prior year. Wholesale Other Gross profit for Wholesale's other product category increased this quarter primarily due to higher ammonium sulfate sales volumes and higher ESN margins resulting from lower cost of product sold. This was partly offset by lower ESN realized selling prices. Expenses Expenses in the current quarter were $13-million lower than the same period last year as a result of lower selling and general administrative expenses and a $17-million gain on sale of the West Sacramento upgrading facility. Partially offsetting this is a $19-million goodwill impairment in our European purchase for resale business resulting from ongoing portfolio review in 2015. Other EBITDA for our Other non-operating business unit for the fourth quarter of 2015 had a net expense of $92-million, compared to a net expense of $78-million for the fourth quarter of 2014. The variance was due to the following: $7-million higher gross profit elimination expense as a result of higher inter-segment inventory held at the end of the fourth quarter of 2015 Increase of $12-million in other expenses of our Other business unit primarily due to costs incurred in implementing our Operational Excellence initiatives including severance and closure costs $10-million lower share-based payments expenses due primarily to a slight decrease in our share price in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to a share price increase in the same period last year NORMAL COURSE ISSUER BID In January 2015, the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) accepted Agrium's notice of intention to make a normal course issuer bid (NCIB) whereby Agrium may purchase up to 7,185,866 common shares on the TSX and New York Stock Exchange from January 26, 2015 to January 25, 2016. In 2015, we purchased for cancellation 5,574,331 shares at an average share price of $100.25 for total consideration of $559-million. No shares were repurchased in 2016 to the date of expiry.

OTHER Barrick Gold Corporation (TSX: ABX) Our vision is the generation of wealth through responsible mining wealth for our owners, our people, and the countries and communities with which we partner. We aim to be the leading mining company focused on gold, growing our cash flow per share by developing and operating high quality assets through disciplined allocation of human and financial capital and operational excellence. Those who founded and first led the company were committed to a culture of partnership and the values underpinning such a culture: trust, transparency, shared responsibility and accountability, and a sense of emotional and financial ownership. The company is returning to its roots as a lean and nimble organization, with minimal bureaucracy. A small head office manages the company with a balance of entrepreneurialism and prudence, focusing on only a few core activities: defining and implementing strategy, allocating human and financial capital, and fulfilling the obligations required of a public company. Leaders at the operational level have greater autonomy, responsibility, and accountability, functioning as business owners. Free from bureaucracy and middle management, they are focused on maximizing free cash flow, and the head office is focused on allocating that cash flow to maximize shareholder returns. Barrick has mining operations in Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile, Dominican Republic, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Saudi Arabia, United States and Zambia. More than 75 percent of the company's gold production comes from the Americas region. Barrick Reports Third Quarter 2015 Results | Growing Free Cash Flow TORONTO, October 28, 2015 The company reported adjusted net earnings of $131 million ($0.11 per share)1and a net loss of $264 million ($0.23 per share) in the third quarter. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $942 million1; EBITDA was $490 million1. Free cash flow was $866 million1, or $256 million excluding proceeds from the Pueblo Viejo streaming transaction.  Gold production in the third quarter was 1.66 million ounces at all-in sustaining costs (AISC) of $771 per ounce1 Full-year gold production is expected to be 6.1-6.3 million ounces. Full-year all-in sustaining cost guidance reduced to $830-$870 per ounce from previous range of $840-$880 per ounce. On track to achieve $2 billion in cash flow improvements by end of 2016. Total debt reduced by 15 percent year-to-date, on track to achieve $3 billion debt reduction target. Progressing drilling and feasibility study work to convert resources to reserves over the next five years at Cortez, Goldstrike, Lagunas Norte, Pueblo Viejo, Turquoise Ridge and other sites. Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:ABX)(TSX:ABX) (Barrick or the \"company\") today reported adjusted net earnings of $131 million ($0.11 per share) for the third quarter and a net loss of $264 million ($0.23 per share). Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was$942 million and EBITDA was $490 million. Free cash flow was $866 million, or $256 million excluding the impact of $610 millionin proceeds from the Pueblo Viejo streaming transaction2. Production in the third quarter was in line with expectations at 1.66 million ounces of gold. All-in sustaining costs were $771 per ounce and cash costs were $570 per ounce1. Full-year 2015 gold production is expected to be 6.1-6.3 million ounces at lower all-in sustaining costs of $830-$870 per ounce. Our objective is to grow free cash flow per share from a portfolio of high-quality gold assets through disciplined capital allocation and operational excellence. In support of this objective, we have returned to a leaner, decentralized operating model designed to maximize free cash flow and improve execution. Clear capital allocation criteria, including a 15 percent hurdle rate for all investments, are driving greater financial rigor and stronger returns. The divestment of non-core assets has refocused our portfolio and we have formed vital new strategic partnerships that will drive new opportunities in the future. All of this is driving stronger performance across the business, reflected by two consecutive quarters of positive free cash flow and improved costs. At the same time, we are strengthening our balance sheet and remain on track to reduce debt by $3 billion. This momentum will support our overriding objective of growing free cash flow per share, underpinned by a strong pipeline of organic projects and mine site expansion opportunities in our core regions. STRENGTHENING THE BALANCE SHEET Earlier this year, we set a $3 billion debt reduction target for 2015. We said we would achieve this through the disciplined sale of non-core assets, the formation of new joint ventures and partnerships, and by maximizing free cash flow from our operations. Thus far, we have completed or announced asset sales, joint ventures and partnerships valued at $2.46 billion. We have also generated$282 million in positive free cash flow in the last two quarters despite a lower gold price, reflecting the impact of our efforts to maximize free cash flow across the company. Both asset sales and cash flow improvements have been credit positive, and have resulted in improvements to our debt-to-EBITDA ratio. Achieving our $3 billion debt reduction target will also reduce annual pre-tax interest payments by approximately $140 million. So far this year, total debt has been reduced by 15 percent, from $13.1 billion to $11.2 billion3, significantly reducing our near-term debt repayment obligations. We currently have less than $250 million in debt due before 2018 and approximately $5 billion of our $11.2 billion in outstanding debt matures after 2032. Building on $1.9 billion in repayments already completed this year, we intend to use approximately $1 billion in proceeds from the sale of 50 percent of Zaldivar to reduce debt. The sale is expected to close in the fourth quarter. This would bring total debt repayments to approximately $2.9 billion. We intend to use free cash flow to reach our target of $3 billion. Assuming the completion of $3 billion in repayments, total debt will have been reduced by 23 percent, from $13.1 billion to $10.1 billion. We also expect to announce the outcome of a process for the sale of certain non-core U.S. assets in the fourth quarter. As we move into 2016 and beyond, we will continue to take prudent steps to strengthen our balance sheet, balancing debt repayments with investments in profitable production that will drive growth in free cash flow and EBITDA. Our liquidity position continues to improve, with strong cash flow generation, very modest near-term debt repayment obligations, a$4 billion undrawn credit facility and $3.34 billion in cash on hand at the end of the third quarter. FINANCIAL DISCUSSION Free cash flow increased to $866 million, or $256 million excluding the impact of $610 million in proceeds from the Pueblo Viejo streaming transaction. This compares to $26 million in free cash flow in the second quarter of 2015. Two consecutive quarters of positive free cash flow after a prolonged period of negative free cash flow reflects our driving focus on maximizing free cash flow through greater capital discipline, operational efficiencies and strong cost management. Third quarter 2015 adjusted net earnings were $131 million ($0.11 per share) compared to $222 million ($0.19 per share) in the prior year period. The net loss for the quarter was $264 million ($0.23 per share) compared to net earnings of $125 million ($0.11per share) in the prior year quarter. Lower adjusted net earnings reflect lower realized gold and copper prices and higher depreciation compared to the prior year period, partially offset by increased gold and copper sales. Significant adjusting items for the quarter (net of tax and non-controlling interest effects) include: $455 million in impairment charges primarily related to the reclassification of our Zaldivar mine as held-for-sale; and $29 million in costs arising from the write-down of obsolete supplies inventory; partially offset by $52 million of gains related to the sale of our Cowal mine and 50 percent of our interest in the Porgera mine; and $45 million in unrealized foreign currency translation gains. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $942 million compared to $1.1 billion in the prior year period. On an unadjusted basis, EBITDA was $490 million for the third quarter compared to $1.0 billion in the prior year period. Operating cash flow was $1.26 billion compared to $852 million in the prior year period. Higher operating cash flow in the quarter reflects the impact of $610 million in proceeds from the Pueblo Viejo streaming transaction. OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS AND GUIDANCE Barrick's operations continued to perform in line with expectations for the year, meeting cost and production targets for the third quarter while generating stronger free cash flow. We have tightened our gold production guidance range for 2015, from 6.1-6.4 million ounces to 6.1-6.3 million ounces, reflecting lower anticipated gold production from Acacia Mining plc. All-in sustaining cost guidance for the year has been reduced to $830-$870 per ounce from the previous range of $840-$880 per ounce. Average all-in sustaining costs for our five core mines are now expected to be $700-$725 per ounce in 2015, down from$725-$775 per ounce at the start of this year. These mines are expected to account for about 75 percent of free cash flow from operations and 60-65 percent of production in 2015. Fourth quarter all-in sustaining costs are now expected to be similar to the third quarter while production is expected to be slightly higher, primarily driven by the impact of higher sustaining capital expenditures offset by higher production at Cortez, Pueblo Viejo, Lagunas Norte and Veladero. We expect significantly higher depreciation in the fourth quarter, primarily related to a drawdown in inventory stockpiles at Cortez, Lagunas Norte and Goldstrike and higher sales volumes at Pueblo Viejo. Total copper guidance for 2015 remains unchanged at 480-520 million pounds. Full-year C1 cash costs are now expected to be$1.60-$1.85 per pound5, down from $1.75-$2.00 per pound, driven by currency impacts and improved costs at Lumwana. Cortez The Cortez mine produced 321,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $501 per ounce in the third quarter. Production benefited from higher open pit tonnage and improved underground productivity through the implementation of short interval controls, an initiative identified as part of our Value Realization review for Cortez. Higher production, lower operating costs and lower sustaining capital drove improved all-in sustaining costs. Production in 2015 is now forecast to be 900,000-950,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $675-$725 per ounce. Fourth quarter production at Cortez is expected to be slightly higher than the third quarter, at higher costs. A prefeasibility study for expanded underground mining in an area known as Deep South below currently permitted levels will be completed in late 2015 and results are expected to be disclosed with the company's fourth quarter results. Our Value Realization review at Cortez also identified long-hole stoping as the preferred mining method for the deposit, as compared to the cut-and-fill method previously contemplated for the underground expansion, which could improve the economics of the project. Mineralization in this zone is primarily oxide and higher grade compared to the current underground mine, which is sulfide in nature. The limits of the Lower Zone have not yet been defined, and drilling has indicated the potential for new targets at depth. With a 382-square-mile land package, Cortez remains a highly prospective district for Barrick. Goldstrike The Goldstrike mine contributed 328,000 ounces in the third quarter in line with plan, while all-in sustaining costs of $558 per ounce were better than expected due to lower operating costs and lower sustaining capital. Our innovative thiosulfate (TCM) circuit achieved commercial production in the third quarter, coming in at a capital cost of $610 million. We expect to complete the ramp up of the TCM circuit in the first half of 2016. Goldstrike's production for 2015 is forecast to be 1.00-1.10 million ounces at improved all-in sustaining costs of $650-$700 per ounce. Fourth quarter production is expected to be similar to the third quarter, at slightly higher costs. Exploration at Goldstrike is focused on the underground mine where good potential exists at depth, and we plan to accelerate near-mine development in 2016. During the quarter, we began development of new areas below existing workings at Meikle and Rodeo in order to access deeper reserves which are expected to come into production at the end of 2016. This work will also open up new drilling platforms to better define future potential in these areas. Pueblo Viejo (60 percent) Barrick's 60 percent share of production from Pueblo Viejo for the third quarter was 172,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of$554 per ounce. Production was slightly below plan due to lower gold grades and recoveries from a higher proportion of carbonaceous ore. All-in sustaining costs were impacted by lower silver recoveries associated with a combination of scheduled autoclave maintenance in September, lime boil limitations and unscheduled maintenance on the limestone grinding circuit. Modifications to the lime boil are underway, including the addition of two lime boil tanks which will be operational in November. These additional tanks are expected to improve silver recoveries to the targeted 80 percent level from around 60 percent currently. We continue to forecast attributable production of 625,000-675,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $540-$590 per ounce in 2015. Production is expected to be higher and costs lower in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter on higher grades, improved recoveries and better autoclave availability. At the end of 2014, Pueblo Viejo had approximately six million ounces of gold and 37 million ounces of silver in the measured and indicated resource category (Barrick's 60 percent share)9. A significant portion of these resources are not currently included in reserves due to tailings storage constraints. We have completed a preliminary economic assessment on a plan to remove these constraints to tailings capacity, which if implemented could significantly extend the life of the mine. We expect to complete further engineering work and commission a prefeasibility study in the second half of 2016 to refine the technical and financial analysis for the increase in tailings storage capacity and to confirm whether the measured and indicated resources described above can be brought into reserves. Lagunas Norte The Lagunas Norte mine contributed 108,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $581 per ounce in the third quarter, in line with expectations. Production in 2015 is now anticipated to be 550,000-590,000 ounces at improved all-in sustaining costs of $550-$600 per ounce, with stronger production expected in the fourth quarter driven by improved performance at the Phase Five leach pad. Fourth quarter all-in sustaining costs are expected to be higher than the third quarter, reflecting the sale of higher cost inventory as well as increased sustaining capital for Phase Six leach pad construction. A pre-feasibility study on a plan to extend the mine life by up to 12 years by mining nearly two million ounces of sulfide ore below the existing open pit is on schedule for completion in 2015. Veladero The Veladero mine produced 143,000 ounces of gold in the third quarter at all-in sustaining costs of $914 per ounce. Production was below plan primarily due to lower grades in the Federico Phase Three pit and adverse weather events in August which impacted leach operations. All-in sustaining costs were higher than plan on lower gold ounces sold, timing of sustaining capital and lower silver credits. The addition of reagents to the leach circuit was temporarily halted in September following a valve failure on a pipe carrying processing solution, which led to a discharge to the environment through a diversion channel gate that was open at the time of the incident. Since the incident occurred, our first priority has been the safety of people and the environment. Water samples analyzed by independent third-parties, including the United Nations, have confirmed that there are no risks to the health of downstream communities as a result of this incident. Restrictions on leaching activities were lifted following implementation of additional monitoring and corrective actions. Production guidance for 2015 is unchanged at 575,000-625,000 ounces while all-in sustaining cost guidance has been narrowed to $950-$1,000 per ounce. Fourth quarter production is expected to be higher, at lower all-in sustaining costs driven by better grades, lower capital expenditures and higher silver and inventory credits. Turquoise Ridge (75 percent) The Turquoise Ridge mine contributed 55,000 ounces in the third quarter at all-in sustaining costs of $738 per ounce, in line with expectations. The mine is forecast to produce 175,000-200,000 ounces in 2015 at improved all-in sustaining costs of $750-$800per ounce. Detailed engineering and feasibility work on developing an additional shaft GoC which could bring forward more than one million ounces of production and roughly double output to an average of 500,000 ounces per year (100 percent basis) at all-in sustaining costs of about $625-$675 per ounce GoC is on track to be completed by the end of the year. Work to install additional ventilation capacity has also been initiated. Porgera (47.5 percent) The Porgera mine produced 134,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $986 per ounce, in line with plan. Attributable production in 2015 is now expected to be 400,000-450,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $1,025-$1,125 per ounce, reflecting Barrick's reduced interest following the sale of 50 percent of Barrick (Niugini) Ltd. to Zijin Mining. Recent drought conditions are not expected to have a material impact on production in 2015. We expect to increase our exploration budget at Porgera in 2016 to focus on underground targets which have been identified through a new geological model. Other Mines Barrick's other mines - consisting of Bald Mountain, 50 percent of Round Mountain, Golden Sunlight, Ruby Hill, Hemlo, Cowal, KCGM and Pierina - contributed 298,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $959 per ounce in the third quarter. A sale process is underway for Bald Mountain, Round Mountain, Ruby Hill, Golden Sunlight and the Spring Valley and Hilltop properties, with strong interest received to date. Acacia Mining (63.9 percent) Barrick's share of third quarter production was lower than expected at 104,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $1,195 per ounce due to temporary factors impacting output from Bulyanhulu and Buzwagi. We now expect attributable 2015 production from Acacia to be about 460,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of approximately $1,155 per ounce. Copper Copper production in the third quarter was 140 million pounds at C1 cash costs of $1.53 per pound. For 2015, copper production is anticipated to be 480-520 million pounds at lower C1 cash costs of $1.60-$1.85 per pound, reflecting currency impacts and improved costs at Lumwana. Lumwana contributed 77 million pounds at C1 cash costs of $1.59 per pound in the third quarter, in line with expectations. Power restrictions and potential reductions to smelter capacity in Zambia are not expected to have any material impact on Lumwana's 2015 production guidance. Production is now anticipated to be 260-280 million pounds at lower C1 cash costs of $1.80-$2.00per pound in 2015, reflecting higher grades. Production of 63 million pounds at Zaldivar at C1 cash costs of $1.47 per pound in the third quarter was in line with plan. At Jabal Sayid, first shipments of copper-in-concentrate continue to be anticipated in early 2016. Once the mine reaches full production, average production in the first full five years is expected to be 100 million pounds per year. TARGETING $2 BILLION IN CASH FLOW IMPROVEMENTS This year, we have taken significant actions to improve our business plans, resulting in positive free cash flow for two consecutive quarters. We remain focused on improving productivity and driving down costs to maximize free cash flow from our assets in any gold price environment. In support of this, we are targeting $2 billion in cash flow improvements across the company before the end of 2016, relative to our original internal plans for 2015 and 2016. These improvements are coming from productivity gains and cost reductions across operating expenses, capital spending and corporate overhead. While a majority of these actions will be incorporated into our 2016 plans, the initial outcomes are reflected in improvements to our 2015 guidance. Total capital expenditures for the year are expected to be 20 percent lower than 2014. Combined with reductions in corporate overhead and other operating cost savings, this has allowed us to reduce our 2015 all-in sustaining cost guidance by about $30 per ounce since the start of year, from our original range of $860-$895 per ounce to $830-$870 per ounce in the third quarter. We are now focused on optimizing our 2016 plans, with an emphasis on operating cost and productivity improvements. Our temporary suspension plan for Pascua-Lama has now been approved by the mining authority in Chile. This will enable us to complete the transition to care and maintenance, and should allow us to significantly reduce holding costs at the project in 2016. Implementation of the temporary suspension plan could require adjustments resulting from regulatory and legal actions and weather conditions, which could increase costs associated with the plan. CONVERTING RESOURCES TO RESERVES At the end of 2014, Barrick had 93 million ounces of proven and probable gold reserves and 94 million ounces of measured and indicated gold resources10. At 1.37 grams per tonne, our reserve grade is more than 50 percent higher than the senior peer average11. For more than 20 years, Barrick has maintained an average reserve mine life of between 10 to 20 years with a track record of replacing reserves and resources at our operations. Mine life and production rates at the majority of our mines have far surpassed initial estimates and we continue to identify excellent potential for resource conversion at many of our operations. Of our exploration budget, 65 percent is focused on opportunities at or near our existing operations. Drilling and feasibility study work to convert resources to reserves over the next five years at Cortez, Goldstrike, Lagunas Norte, Pueblo Viejo and Turquoise Ridge are progressing well. In addition, recent drilling at Hemlo and Porgera indicates strong potential for resource additions. We are also working to advance our Goldrush project in Nevada and drilling to define the limits of mineralization at the Alturas project inChile is expected to resume in the fourth quarter, following the South American winter. An illustration of the optionality that exists within our portfolio is the recent drill program at Hemlo. In the first quarter, Barrick completed the acquisition of surface and mineral rights adjacent to the Hemlo property in Ontario from subsidiaries of Newmont Mining. These claims included an area of geological potential adjacent to Barrick's existing underground workings. Barrick is currently undertaking an underground diamond drilling program in this area to evaluate its potential. To date, drilling has encountered a number of high grade intercepts with significant potential. These results highlight the ongoing potential of mineral deposits such as the Hemlo camp, even as they become mature operations. A detailed update on reserves and resources will be provided with the company's fourth quarter results in February 2016.

Cash costs reflect our equity share of unit production costs, including the impact of by-product credits, which is calculated in accordance with the standard published by the WGC. See page 54 of Barrick's Third Quarter 2015 Report for further details. The Cowal mine was sold effective July 23, 2015. Operating unit guidance ranges reflect expectations at each individual operating unit, but do not add up to corporate-wide guidance range total. C3 fully allocated costs per pound is a non-GAAP financial performance measure. See pages 52-58 of Barrick's Third Quarter 2015 Report. We now expect minesite sustaining capital expenditures to be in the range of $1,400-$1,500 million and total capital expenditures to be ~$1,700 million compared to our previous guidance ranges of $1,500-$1,700 million and $1,800-$2,100 million, respectively. All-in sustaining costs per ounce, EBITDA and free cash flow are non-GAAP financial performance measures. See pages 52-58 of Barrick's Third Quarter 2015 Report. Due to our hedging activities, which are reflected in these sensitivities, we are partially protected against changes in these factors. Impact on EBITDA only reflects contracts that mature in 2015.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT ON FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION Certain information contained or incorporated by reference in this Third Quarter 2015 Report, including any information as to our strategy, projects, plans or future financial or operating performance, constitutes \"forward-looking statements\". All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements. The words \"believe\", \"expect\", \"anticipate\", \"contemplate\", \"target\", \"plan\", \"intend\", \"project\", \"continue\", \"budget\", \"estimate\", \"potential\", \"may\", \"will\", \"can\", \"could\" and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. In particular, this Third Quarter Report 2015 contains forward-looking statements with respect to cash flow forecasts, projected capital, operating and exploration expenditures, targeted cost and debt reductions, mine life and production rates, potential mineralization and metal or mineral recoveries, and information pertaining to Barrick's Value Realization project (including potential improvements to financial and operating performance and mine life at Barrick's Cortez, Lagunas Norte and Pueblo Viejo mines that may result from certain Value Realization initiatives). Forward-looking statements are necessarily based upon a number of estimates and assumptions that, while considered reasonable by the company in light of management's experience and perception of current conditions and expected developments, are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies. Known and unknown factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to: fluctuations in the spot and forward price of gold, copper or certain other commodities (such as silver, diesel fuel, natural gas and electricity); the speculative nature of mineral exploration and development; changes in mineral production performance, exploitation and exploration successes; risks associated with the fact that Value Realization initiatives are still in the early stages of evaluation and additional engineering and other analysis is required to fully assess their impact; diminishing quantities or grades of reserves; increased costs, delays, suspensions and technical challenges associated with the construction of capital projects; operating or technical difficulties in connection with mining or development activities, including disruptions in the maintenance or provision of required infrastructure and information technology systems; failure to comply with environmental and health and safety laws and regulations; timing of receipt of, or failure to comply with, necessary permits and approvals; uncertainty whether some or all of the Value Realization initiatives will meet the company's capital allocation objectives; the impact of global liquidity and credit availability on the timing of cash flows and the values of assets and liabilities based on projected future cash flows; adverse changes in our credit ratings; the impact of inflation; fluctuations in the currency markets; changes in U.S. dollar interest rates; risks arising from holding derivative instruments; changes in national and local government legislation, taxation, controls or regulations and/or changes in the administration of laws, policies and practices, expropriation or nationalization of property and political or economic developments in Canada , the United States and other jurisdictions in which the company does or may carry on business in the future; damage to the company's reputation due to the actual or perceived occurrence of any number of events, including negative publicity with respect to the company's handling of environmental matters or dealings with community groups, whether true or not; the possibility that future exploration results will not be consistent with the company's expectations; risks that exploration data may be incomplete and considerable additional work may be required to complete further evaluation, including but not limited to drilling, engineering and socio-economic studies and investment; risk of loss due to acts of war, terrorism, sabotage and civil disturbances; litigation; contests over title to properties, particularly title to undeveloped properties, or over access to water, power and other required infrastructure; business opportunities that may be presented to, or pursued by, the company; our ability to successfully integrate acquisitions or complete divestitures; employee relations; increased costs and risks related to the potential impact of climate change; availability and increased costs associated with mining inputs and labor; and the organization of our previously held African gold operations and properties under a separate listed company. In addition, there are risks and hazards associated with the business of mineral exploration, development and mining, including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, unusual or unexpected formations, pressures, cave-ins, flooding and gold bullion, copper cathode or gold or copper concentrate losses (and the risk of inadequate insurance, or inability to obtain insurance, to cover these risks). Many of these uncertainties and contingencies can affect our actual results and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, us. Readers are cautioned that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. All of the forward-looking statements made in this Third Quarter 2015 Report are qualified by these cautionary statements. Specific reference is made to the most recent Form 40-F/Annual Information Form on file with the SEC and Canadian provincial securities regulatory authorities for a discussion of some of the factors underlying forward-looking statements. The company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law. Cameco Corporation (TSE: CCJ) Cameco is one of the world's largest uranium producers accounting for about 16% of the global production from its mines in Canada, the US and Kazakhstan. Our leading position is backed by about 429 million pounds of proven and probable reserves and extensive resources. Cameco reports fourth quarter and 2015 financial results delivered on annual guidance amid weak market conditions solid uranium segment results, record annual revenue and average realized price owing to a weaker Canadian dollar record annual uranium production on the back of strong results at Cigar Lake write-down of $210 million in the fourth quarter related to our Rabbit Lake operation Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada, February 5, 2016 Cameco (TSX: CCO; NYSE: CCJ) today reported its consolidated financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2015 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). \"In 2015, the company continued to perform well, in the context of the global challenges our industry faces,\" said president and CEO, Tim Gitzel. \"But despite the challenges, we continued to concentrate on the aspects of our business that are within our control, which has led us to once again deliver on, and in some cases exceed, our annual guidance. \"We are still waiting on a market recovery that was expected to come sooner, but we've learned to put those expectations aside and prepare for whatever comes our way. Looking ahead, our strategy is to continue focusing our capital on tier-one assets, because it's those world-class, low-cost mines that will position us to quickly respond when the market calls for more production. And we believe that the question is not 'if' the market will make that call, but 'when', as we continue to see a bright long-term outlook for the nuclear industry.\" FULL YEAR Our net earnings attributable to equity holders (net earnings) in 2015 were $65 million ($0.16 per share diluted) compared to $185 million ($0.47 per share diluted) in 2014, mainly due to: greater losses on foreign exchange derivatives due to the weakening of the Canadian dollar lower tax recoveries, primarily due to the write-off of our deferred tax asset in the US Partially offset by: lower impairment charges ($215 million in 2015; $327 million in 2014) higher earnings in our uranium and fuel services segments due to higher average realized prices higher earnings in our NUKEM segment as a result of higher volumes and average realized price reduction of the provision related to our Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) litigation In addition, in 2014 there were a number of one-time items that contributed to the higher net earnings in 2014 compared to 2015, including: the sale of our interest in Bruce Power Limited Partnership (BPLP) resulting in a $127 million gain in 2014 a favourable settlement of $66 million in 2014 with respect to a dispute regarding a long-term supply contract with a utility customer Partially offset by: payment of an early agreement termination fee of $18 million as a result of the cancellation of our toll conversion agreement with Springfields Fuels Limited (SFL), and $12 million for settlement costs with respect to early redemption of our Series C debentures in 2014 the write-off of $41 million of assets under construction in 2014 as a result of changes made to the scope of a number of projects On an adjusted basis, our earnings were $344 million ($0.87 per share diluted) (non-IFRS measure, see page 8) in 2015 compared to $412 million ($1.04 per share diluted) in 2014. The 17% decrease from 2014 to 2015 resulted from: greater losses on foreign exchange derivatives due to the weakening of the Canadian dollar lower tax recoveries, primarily due to the write-off of our deferred tax asset in the US partially offset by: higher earnings in our uranium and fuel services segments mainly due to a higher average realized price higher earnings from our NUKEM segment mainly due to higher sales volumes and a higher average realized price a reduction of the provision related to our CRA litigation In addition, in 2014 there was a favourable settlement of $66 million with respect to a dispute regarding a long-term supply contract with a utility customer that contributed to the higher adjusted net earnings in 2014 compared to 2015. The impact of the settlement was partially offset by an early termination fee of $18 million incurred as a result of the cancellation of our toll conversion agreement with SFL and settlement costs of $12 million with respect to the early redemption of our Series C debentures in 2014. FOURTH QUARTER In the fourth quarter of 2015, our net loss was $10 million ($(0.03) per share diluted), a decrease of $83 million compared to net earnings of $73 million ($0.18 per share diluted) in 2014, mainly due to: greater losses on foreign exchange derivatives resulting from the weakening of the Canadian dollar lower income tax recovery due to the reduction of our deferred tax asset in the US higher impairment charges in 2015 ($210 million in 2015, $131 million in 2014) Partially offset by: higher uranium gross profits resulting mainly from a higher average realized price and higher sales volumes higher gross profits from our fuel services segment due to a higher average realized price lower exploration expenditures the reduction of our provision related to the CRA litigation In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2014 there was a favourable settlement of $37 million with respect to a dispute regarding a long-term supply contract with a utility customer that contributed to the higher net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to the same period in 2015. The impact of the settlement was partially offset by the write-off of $41 million of assets under construction as a result of changes made to the scope of a number of projects in the fourth quarter of 2014. On an adjusted basis, our earnings this quarter were $151 million ($0.38 per share diluted) compared to $205 million ($0.52 per share diluted) (non-IFRS measure, see page 8) in 2014, mainly due to: a lower income tax recovery primarily due to the reduction of our deferred tax asset in the US partially offset by: higher uranium gross profits resulting mainly from a higher average realized price and higher sales volumes higher gross profits from our fuel services segment mainly due to a higher average realized price lower exploration expenditures the reduction of our provision related to the CRA litigation In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2014 there was a favourable settlement of $37 million with respect to a dispute regarding a long-term supply contract with a utility customer that contributed to the higher adjusted net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to the same period in 2015. Impairment charge on producing assets During the fourth quarter of 2015, we recognized a $210 million impairment charge related to our Rabbit Lake operation. The impairment was due to increased uncertainty around future production sources for the Rabbit Lake mill as a result of the ongoing economic conditions. The amount of the charge was determined as the excess of carrying value over the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of the mill was determined to be $69 million. See note 9 to the financial statements. 2015 market developments As has been the case in recent years, a lot happened over the course of 2015, although the general state of the market did not see much change. Making positive news for nuclear, as usual, was China. Not only did the country continue with its rapid reactor new build program and bring eight reactors online, but Chinese companies also signed agreements with Argentina, Romania and the UK for new reactors, illustrating the country's commitment to nuclear and its intent to become a major international player in the nuclear industry. Undoubtedly, the biggest headline of 2015 was the long-awaited first reactor restarts in Japan. Sendai units 1 and 2 were the first reactors in Japan to restart since 2013, and it is hoped they are the first of many to come. New builds in the UK and US continued to be bright spots for the industry, in addition to a number of reactor life extensions approved in Japan, and the US, with utilities now considering additional extensions that could see reactor lives reaching 80 years. However, these positive developments could not outweigh the more powerful influence of a continued sluggish global economy, geopolitical issues, concerns around growth in China, and flat electricity demand. These more general drivers had help from industry specific factors as well, such as slower new reactor construction, eight reactor shutdowns, the continued high level of inventories held by market participants, and France's policy to reduce nuclear in their energy mix to 50% by 2025 becoming law. In addition, supply performed relatively well, with only minor disruptions and one curtailment, unlike 2014, which saw six projects tempered or curtailed. The end result was a market seemingly indifferent to the commotion of events that occurred throughout the year. CONTRACTING Market contracting activity was modest. Spot volumes were normal, but long-term contracting was well below historical averages and current consumption levels--about half of current annual reactor consumption estimates, similar to 2014. Long- term contracting is a key factor in the timing of market recovery, and its pace will depend on the respective coverage levels, market views and risk appetite of both buyers and sellers. JAPAN The big news in Japan was the restart of Sendai units 1 and 2, which occurred in August and October. In addition, the court injunction against the two Takahama units was overturned in December, 2015, clearing the way for Takahama unit 3 to restart on January 29, 2016, with unit 4 expected to restart later in the first quarter. Ikata unit 3 has also cleared a safety inspection by the Nuclear Regulatory Authority, and four more units are in the final stages of approval. In all, three reactors are now in operation, while 23 remain under evaluation for restart. Over the long term, Japan's energy policy states that nuclear will make up 20 to 22% of the energy mix in the country. The billions of dollars in investment being made by Japan's utilities suggest a high degree of confidence in reactors coming back online and meeting this target; however, public sentiment towards nuclear in Japan remains somewhat uncertain. OTHER REGIONS China's remarkable nuclear growth program remains on track and the UK's plans for new reactor construction continue to move forward. India and South Korea are also among several key regions growing their nuclear generation fleet. In 2015, growth was tangible as 10 reactors came online--double that of 2014. These included the eight noted in China, one in Russia and one in South Korea. And seven more reactors began construction--six in China and one in the UAE, a formerly non-nuclear country with four reactors now under construction. But, to round out the picture, eight units shut down. Five of these were in Japan, plus one in Sweden, one in Germany as part of its phase-out plans, and one in the UK--the last Magnox reactor operating in the world. In addition, there were announcements for future shutdowns in the US, where nuclear struggles to remain competitive in deregulated electricity markets and in the context of low natural gas prices. One event that could have an effect on the future of nuclear in the US and other western countries is the UN Climate Conference COP-21 agreement, finalized in 2015. As a non-GHG emitter, nuclear could play a significant role in achieving climate change prevention goals. Outlook for 2016 Our strategy is to focus on our tier-one assets and profitably produce at a pace aligned with market signals, while maintaining the ability to respond to conditions as they evolve. Our outlook for 2016 reflects the expenditures necessary to help us achieve our strategy. We do not provide an outlook for the items in the table that are marked with a dash. See 2015 Financial results by segment on page 12 for details. 2016 FINANCIAL OUTLOOK We expect consolidated revenue to decrease up to 5% in 2016, based on currently committed sales volumes, due to a planned decrease in uranium and fuel services sales volumes. If we make additional sales with deliveries in 2016, we would expect our revenue outlook to increase. We expect administration costs (not including stock-based compensation) to be 5% to 10% higher compared to 2015 due to increased costs related to the northern collaboration agreements and increased project work. In 2016, we are continuing to negotiate new collaboration agreements with northern communities, which could result in additional one-time payments. Due to the uncertainty of the timing for the potential signing of agreements, the cost is not included in our outlook. If agreements are signed and there is an impact on our administrative costs, we will update our outlook. We expect exploration expenses to be about 15% to 20% higher than they were in 2015 due to increased exploration activity at Cigar Lake. On an adjusted net earnings basis, we expect a tax recovery of 25% to 30% in 2016 from our uranium, fuel services and NUKEM segments. Our consolidated tax rate is a blend of the statutory rates applicable to taxable income earned or tax losses incurred in Canada and in our foreign subsidiaries. We have a global customer base and we have established a marketing and trading structure involving foreign subsidiaries, which entered into various intercompany purchase and sale arrangements, as well as uranium purchase and sale agreements with third parties. Cameco and its subsidiaries made reasonable efforts to put arm's-length transfer pricing arrangements in place, and these arrangements expose the parties to the risks and rewards accruing to them under these contracts. The intercompany contract prices are generally comparable to those established in comparable contracts between arm's-length parties entered into at that time. This year, many of the existing intercompany purchase and sale arrangements in our portfolio expire. We have started to replace these contracts and will continue to put new intercompany arrangements in place, which, as the existing arrangements did, will reflect the market at the time they are signed. As a result, in 2017, we expect our consolidated tax rate will transition to a modest expense, and trend toward a tax expense of approximately 20% over the next five years. The actual effective tax rate will vary from year-to-year, primarily due to the actual distribution of earnings among jurisdictions and the market conditions at the time transactions occur under both our intercompany and third-party purchase and sale arrangements. ROYALTIES We pay royalties on the sale of all uranium extracted at our mines in the province of Saskatchewan. Two types of royalties are paid: Basic royalty: calculated as 5% of gross sales of uranium, less the Saskatchewan resource credit of 0.75%. Profit royalty: a 10% royalty is charged on profit up to and including $22.70/kg U3O8 ($10.30/lb) and a 15% royalty is charged on profit in excess of $22.70/kg U3O8. Profit is determined as revenue less certain operating, exploration, reclamation and capital costs. Both exploration and capital costs are deductible at the discretion of the producer. As a resource corporation in Saskatchewan, we also pay a corporate resource surcharge of 3% of the value of resource sales. During the period from 2013 to 2015, transitional rules for the new profit royalty regime were applied whereby only 50% of capital costs were deductible. The remaining 50% was accumulated and will now be deductible beginning in 2016. In addition, the capital allowance related to Cigar Lake under the previous system was grandfathered and is also now deductible beginning in 2016. Based on the expected application of transitional and grandfathered capital allowance deductions, we anticipate that only the first tier of the profit royalty (10%) will apply in 2016 and 2017. As capital pools are depleted, we expect to also be subject to the top tier of the profit royalty (15%) in 2018. CAPITAL SPENDING We classify capital spending as sustaining, capacity replacement or growth. As a mining company, sustaining capital is the money we spend to keep our facilities running in their present state, which would follow a gradually decreasing production curve, while capacity replacement capital is spent to maintain current production levels at those operations. Growth capital is money we invest to generate incremental production, and for business development. Outlook for investing activities We expect total capital expenditures for uranium and fuel services to decrease by about 11% in 2016. Major sustaining, capacity replacement and growth expenditures in 2016 include: McArthur River/Key Lake - At McArthur River, the largest projects are the expansion of freeze capacity and mine development. Other projects include site facility and equipment purchases. At Key Lake, work will be done to expand capacity in the solvent extraction and crystallization circuits of the mill. US in situ recovery (ISR) - wellfield construction represents the largest portion of our expenditures in the US. Rabbit Lake - At Eagle Point, the largest component is mine development, along with mine equipment upgrades and purchases. At the mill, we plan to optimize tailings capacity and work on various mill facility and equipment replacements. Cigar Lake - Work to expand freezing capacity makes up the largest portion of capital at the Cigar Lake site. We are also paying our share of the costs to modify and expand the McClean Lake mill. We previously expected to spend between $350 million and $400 million in 2017. We now expect to spend between $300 million and $350 million in 2017. Due to the continued market uncertainty, we have reduced growth capital to focus on our tierone properties. This information regarding currently expected capital expenditures for future periods is forward-looking information, and is based upon the assumptions and subject to the material risks discussed on pages 21 and 22. Our actual capital expenditures for future periods may be significantly different. REVENUE, CASH FLOW AND EARNINGS SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS For 2016: An increase of $5 (US) per pound in each of the Ux spot price ($34.65 (US) per pound on February 1, 2016) and the Ux long-term price indicator ($44.00 (US) per pound on January 25, 2016) would change revenue by $72 million and net earnings by $56 million. Conversely, a decrease of $5 (US) per pound would decrease revenue by $69 million and net earnings by $54 million. A one cent change in the value of the Canadian dollar versus the US dollar would change adjusted net earnings by $8 million and cash flow by $1 million, with a decrease in the value of the Canadian dollar versus the US dollar having a positive impact. URANIUM SEGMENT OUTLOOK We expect to produce 30.0 million pounds in 2016 and have commitments under long-term contracts to purchase approximately 9 million pounds. Based on the contracts we have in place, and not including sales between our segments, we expect to deliver between 30 million and 32 million pounds of U3O8 in 2016. We expect the unit cost of sales to be up to 5% higher than in 2015, primarily due to the planned purchases during the year. If we make additional discretionary purchases in 2016 at a cost different than our other sources of supply, then we expect the overall unit cost of sales to be affected. We expect revenue to be up to 5% lower than in 2015 as a result of an expected decrease in deliveries, not including sales between our segments, partially offset by a higher average realized price. In our uranium and fuel services segments, our customers choose when in the year to receive deliveries. As a result, our quarterly delivery patterns and, therefore, our sales volumes and revenue can vary significantly as shown below. We expect the quarterly distribution of uranium deliveries in 2016 to be weighted to the second half of the year. However, not all delivery notices have been received to date and the expected delivery pattern could change. Typically, we receive notices six months in advance of the requested delivery date. PRICE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: URANIUM SEGMENT The following table is not a forecast of prices we expect to receive. The prices we actually realize will be different from the prices shown in the table. It is designed to indicate how the portfolio of long-term contracts we had in place on December 31, 2015 would respond to different spot prices. In other words, we would realize these prices only if the contract portfolio remained the same as it was on December 31, 2015, and none of the assumptions we list below change. We intend to update this table each quarter in our MD&A to reflect deliveries made and changes to our contract portfolio. As a result, we expect the table to change from quarter to quarter. FUEL SERVICES OUTLOOK In 2016, we plan to produce 8 million to 9 million kgU, and we expect sales volumes, not including intersegment sales, to be up to 5% lower than in 2015. Overall revenue is expected to increase by up to 5% as lower sales volumes will be more than offset by an increase in the average realized price. We expect the average unit cost of sales (including D&A) to increase by 10% to 15%; therefore, overall gross profit will decrease as a result. NUKEM OUTLOOK For 2016, NUKEM expects to deliver between 9 million and 10 million pounds of uranium. Total revenue and unit cost of sales, not including intersegment sales, is expected to increase by 5% to 10% compared to 2015; however, the overall gross profit percentage is expected to be slightly lower than 2015 at 4% to 5%. Non-IFRS measures ADJUSTED NET EARNINGS Adjusted net earnings are a measure that does not have a standardized meaning or a consistent basis of calculation under IFRS (non-IFRS measure). We use this measure as a more meaningful way to compare our financial performance from period to period. We believe that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, certain investors use this information to evaluate our performance. Adjusted net earnings are our net earnings attributable to equity holders, adjusted to better reflect the underlying financial performance for the reporting period. The adjusted earnings measure reflects the matching of the net benefits of our hedging program with the inflows of foreign currencies in the applicable reporting period, and adjusted for impairment charges, the write-off of assets, NUKEM inventory write-down, gain on interest in BPLP (after tax), and income taxes on adjustments. Adjusted net earnings are non-standard supplemental information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information prepared according to accounting standards. Other companies may calculate this measure differently, so you may not be able to make a direct comparison to similar measures presented by other companies. To facilitate a better understanding of these measures, the table below reconciles adjusted net earnings with our net earnings for the years ended 2015 and 2014, and three months ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. TRANSFER PRICING DISPUTES We have been reporting on our transfer pricing disputes with CRA since 2008, when it originated, and with the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) since the first quarter of 2015. Below, we discuss the general nature of transfer pricing disputes and, more specifically, the ongoing disputes we have. Transfer pricing is a complex area of tax law, and it is difficult to predict the outcome of cases like ours. However, tax authorities generally test two things: the governance (structure) of the corporate entities involved in the transactions the price at which goods and services are sold by one member of a corporate group to another We have a global customer base and we established a marketing and trading structure involving foreign subsidiaries, including Cameco Europe Limited (CEL), which entered into various intercompany arrangements, including purchase and sale agreements, as well as uranium purchase and sale agreements with third parties. Cameco and its subsidiaries made reasonable efforts to put arm's-length transfer pricing arrangements in place, and these arrangements expose the parties to the risks and rewards accruing to them under these contracts. The intercompany contract prices are generally comparable to those established in comparable contracts between arm's-length parties entered into at that time. For the years 2003 to 2010, CRA has shifted CEL's income (as recalculated by CRA) back to Canada and applied statutory tax rates, interest and instalment penalties, and, from 2007 to 2009, transfer pricing penalties. There has not yet been a decision regarding a transfer pricing penalty for 2010. The IRS also allocated a portion of CEL's income for the years 2009 through 2012 to the US, resulting in such income being taxed in multiple jurisdictions. Taxes of approximately $320 million for the 2003 - 2015 years have already been paid in a jurisdiction outside Canada and the US. Bilateral international tax treaties contain provisions that generally seek to prevent taxation of the same income in both countries. As such, in connection with these disputes, we are considering our options, including remedies under international tax treaties that would limit double taxation; however, there is a risk that we will not be successful in eliminating all potential double taxation. The expected income adjustments under our tax disputes are represented by the amounts claimed by CRA and IRS and are described below. CRA dispute Since 2008, CRA has disputed our corporate structure and the related transfer pricing methodology we used for certain intercompany uranium sale and purchase agreements. To the end of 2014, we received notices of reassessment for our 2003 through 2009 tax returns, and, in the fourth quarter of 2015, we received a notice of reassessment for our 2010 tax year. We have recorded a cumulative tax provision of $50 million (September 30, 2015 - $92 million), where an argument could be made that our transfer price may have fallen outside of an appropriate range of pricing in uranium contracts for the period from 2003 through 2015. We have reduced the provision to reflect management's revised estimate, which takes into account additional contract information. We are confident that we will be successful in our case and continue to believe the ultimate resolution of this matter will not be material to our financial position, results of operations and cash flows in the year(s) of resolution. For the years 2003 through 2010, CRA issued notices of reassessment for approximately $3.4 billion of additional income for Canadian tax purposes, which would result in a related tax expense of about $1.1 billion. CRA has also issued notices of reassessment for transfer pricing penalties for the years 2007 through 2009 in the amount of $229 million. The Canadian income tax rules include provisions that require larger companies like us to remit or otherwise secure 50% of the cash tax plus related interest and penalties at the time of reassessment. To date, under these provisions, after applying elective deductions, we have paid a net amount of $232 million cash. In addition, we have provided $332 million in letters of credit (LC) to secure 50% of the cash taxes and related interest amounts reassessed in 2015. Using the methodology we believe CRA will continue to apply, and including the $3.4 billion already reassessed, we expect to receive notices of reassessment for a total of approximately $7.0 billion of additional income taxable in Canada for the years 2003 through 2015, which would result in a related tax expense of approximately $2.1 billion. As well, CRA may continue to apply transfer pricing penalties to taxation years subsequent to 2009. As a result, we estimate that cash taxes and transfer pricing penalties for these years would be between $1.65 billion and $1.70 billion. In addition, we estimate there would be interest and instalment penalties applied that would be material to us. While in dispute, we would be responsible for remitting or otherwise providing security for 50% of the cash taxes and transfer pricing penalties (between $825 million and $850 million), plus related interest and instalment penalties assessed, which would be material to us. Under the Canadian federal and provincial tax rules, the amount required to be paid or secured each year will depend on the amount of income reassessed in that year and the availability of elective deductions and tax loss carryovers. Recently, the CRA decided to disallow the use of any loss carry-backs for any transfer pricing adjustment, starting with the 2008 tax year. This does not impact the anticipated income tax expense for a particular year, but does impact the timing of any required security or payment. As noted above, for the 2010 tax year, as an alternative to paying cash, we used letters of credit to satisfy our obligations related to the reassessed income tax and related interest amounts. We expect to be able to continue to provide security in the form of letters of credit to satisfy these requirements. The estimated amounts summarized in the table below reflect actual amounts paid or secured and estimated future amounts owing based on the actual and expected reassessments for the years 2003 through 2015, and include the expected timing adjustment for the inability to use any loss carry-backs starting in 2008. We will update this table annually to include the estimated impact of reassessments expected for completed years subsequent to 2015. In light of our view of the likely outcome of the case as described above, we expect to recover the amounts remitted, including the $564 million already paid or otherwise secured to date. We are expecting the trial for the 2003, 2005 and 2006 reassessments to commence during the week of September 26, 2016, with final arguments in April 2017. If this timing is adhered to, we expect to receive a Tax Court decision within six to 18 months after the trial is complete. IRS dispute In the fourth quarter of 2015, we received a Revenue Agents Report (RAR) from the IRS for the tax years 2010 to 2012. Similar to the 2009 RAR received in the first quarter of 2015, the IRS is challenging the transfer pricing used under certain intercompany transactions pertaining to the 2010 to 2012 tax years for certain of our US subsidiaries. The 2009 and 2010 to 2012 RARs list the adjustments proposed by the IRS and calculate the tax and any penalties owing based on the proposed adjustments. The current position of the IRS is that a portion of the non-US income reported under our corporate structure and taxed in nonUS jurisdictions should be recognized and taxed in the US on the basis that: the prices received by our US mining subsidiaries for the sale of uranium to CEL are too low the compensation earned by Cameco Inc., one of our US subsidiaries, is inadequate The proposed adjustments result in an increase in taxable income in the US of approximately $419 million (US) and a corresponding increased income tax expense of approximately $122 million (US) for the 2009 through 2012 taxation years, with interest being charged thereon. In addition, the IRS proposed cumulative penalties of approximately $8 million (US) in respect of the adjustment. We believe that the conclusions of the IRS in the RARs are incorrect and we are contesting them in an administrative appeal, during which we are not required to make any cash payments. Until this matter progresses further, we cannot provide an estimation of the likely timeline for a resolution of the dispute. We believe that the ultimate resolution of this matter will not be material to our financial position, results of operations and cash flows in the year(s) of resolution. Caution about forward-looking information relating to our CRA and IRS tax dispute This discussion of our expectations relating to our tax disputes with CRA and IRS and future tax reassessments by CRA and IRS is forwardlooking information that is based upon the assumptions and subject to the material risks discussed under the heading Caution about forwardlooking information beginning on page 21 and also on the more specific assumptions and risks listed below. Actual outcomes may vary significantly. Assumptions CRA will reassess us for the years 2011 through 2015 using a similar methodology as for the years 2003 through 2010, and the reassessments will be issued on the basis we expect we will be able to apply elective deductions and utilize letters of credit to the extent anticipated CRA will seek to impose transfer pricing penalties (in a manner consistent with penalties charged in the years 2007 through 2009) in addition to interest charges and instalment penalties we will be substantially successful in our dispute with CRA and the cumulative tax provision of $50 million to date will be adequate to satisfy any tax liability resulting from the outcome of the dispute to date IRS may propose adjustments for later years subsequent to 2012 we will be substantially successful in our dispute with IRS Material risks that could cause actual results to differ materially CRA reassesses us for years 2011 through 2015 using a different methodology than for years 2003 through 2010, or we are unable to utilize elective deductions or letters of credit to the extent anticipated, resulting in the required cash payments or security provided to CRA pending the outcome of the dispute being higher than expected the time lag for the reassessments for each year is different than we currently expect we are unsuccessful and the outcomes of our dispute with CRA and/or IRS result in significantly higher cash taxes, interest charges and penalties than the amount of our cumulative tax provision, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial position, results of operations and cash flows cash tax payable increases due to unanticipated adjustments by CRA or IRS not related to transfer pricing IRS proposes adjustments for years 2013 through 2015 using a different methodology than for 2009 through 2012 we are unable to effectively eliminate all double taxation FOURTH QUARTER Production volumes this quarter were 17% higher compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, mainly as a result of higher production from the rampup of Cigar Lake production, offset by lower production at McArthur River/Key Lake, Rabbit Lake and our US ISR operations. See Our operations starting on page 15 for more information. Uranium revenues were up 13% due to a 5% increase in sales volumes, which represents normal quarterly variance in our delivery schedule, and an 8% increase in the average realized price. Average spot and long-term prices decreased, as did our US dollar average realized price due to lower prices under fixedprice contracts, and the mix of market and fixed contracts. However, the effect of foreign exchange resulted in an 8% higher Canadian dollar average realized price than the prior year. In the fourth quarter of 2015, our realized foreign exchange rate was $1.32 compared to $1.12 in the prior year. Total cost of sales (including D&A) increased by 17% ($429 million compared to $366 million in 2014). This was the result of a 12% increase in the average unit cost of sales and a 5% increase in sales volumes. The unit cost of sales increased due to an increase in the volume of material purchased throughout the year at prices higher than our average cost of inventory and an increase in the unit production costs related to the addition of higher cost production from Cigar Lake during rampup. The net effect was a $17 million increase in gross profit for the quarter. FULL YEAR Production volumes in 2015 increased by 22% compared to 2014. Lower production at our US ISR operations was more than offset by the rampup of Cigar Lake production. See Our operations starting on page 15 for more information. Uranium revenues this year were up 5% compared to 2014 due to an increase of 10% in the Canadian dollar average realized price, partially offset by a decrease in sales volumes of 4%. The spot price for uranium averaged $36.55 (US) per pound in 2015, an increase of 10% compared to the 2014 average price of $33.21 (US) per pound; however, our US dollar average realized price was lower mainly due to lower prices under fixed price contracts. The effect of foreign exchange resulted in a higher Canadian dollar average realized price than in the prior year. The realized foreign exchange rate was $1.27 compared to $1.10 in 2014. Total cost of sales (including D&A) increased by 7% ($1.26 billion compared to $1.18 billion in 2014) due to higher unit cost of sales offset by lower sales volumes. The higher unit cost of sales was mainly the result of an increase in the volume of material purchased at prices higher than our average cost of inventory, and an increase in unit production costs related to the addition of higher costs from Cigar Lake during rampup. The net effect was a $6 million increase in gross profit for the year. The following table shows the costs of produced and purchased uranium incurred in the reporting periods (non-IFRS measures see below). These costs do not include selling costs such as royalties, transportation and commissions, nor do they reflect the impact of opening inventories on our reported cost of sales. Cash cost per pound, non-cash cost per pound and total cost per pound for produced and purchased uranium presented in the above table are non-IFRS measures. These measures do not have a standardized meaning or a consistent basis of calculation under IFRS. We use these measures in our assessment of the performance of our uranium business. We believe that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, certain investors use this information to evaluate our performance and ability to generate cash flow. These measures are non-standard supplemental information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared according to accounting standards. These measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under IFRS. Other companies may calculate these measures differently, so you may not be able to make a direct comparison to similar measures presented by other companies. To facilitate a better understanding of these measures, the following table presents a reconciliation of these measures to our unit cost of sales for the years ended 2015 and 2014 and three months ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 as reported in our financial statements. FOURTH QUARTER Total revenue decreased by 21% due to a 39% decrease in sales volumes, partially offset by a 29% increase in average realized price. The total cost of sales (including D&A) decreased by 28% ($78 million compared to $109 million in the fourth quarter of 2014) mainly due to a 39% decrease in sales volumes, partially offset by an increase of 16% in the average unit cost of sales, primarily as a result of the mix of products sold. The net effect was a $5 million increase in gross profit. FULL YEAR Total revenue increased by 4% due to a 19% increase in the realized price, partially offset by a 12% decrease in sales volumes. The total cost of products and services sold (including D&A) decreased by 4% compared to 2014 ($258 million compared to $268 million in 2014), as a 12% decrease in sales volumes was partially offset by a 9% increase in the average unit cost of sales (including D&A). When compared to 2014, the average unit cost of sales was 9% higher due to the mix of fuel services products sold. The net effect was a $23 million increase in gross profit. FOURTH QUARTER NUKEM delivered 3.7 million pounds of uranium, an increase of 0.3 million pounds compared to 2014. NUKEM revenues amounted to $192 million compared to $159 million in 2014 due to an increase in volumes delivered. Gross profit percentage was 3% in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to 2% in the fourth quarter of 2014. The net effect was a $3 million increase in gross profit. FULL YEAR During 2015, NUKEM delivered 10.7 million pounds of uranium, an increase of 2.6 million pounds compared to the previous year due to an increase in market activity. Revenues from NUKEM amounted to $554 million, 59% higher than in 2014 as a result of higher sales volumes and an increase in the average realized price, mainly due to weakening of the Canadian dollar. Gross profit percentage was 8% for 2015, compared to 6% for 2014. The net effect was a $20 million increase in gross profit. Production Outlook We remain focused on taking advantage of the long-term growth we see coming in our industry, while maintaining the ability to respond to market conditions as they evolve. Our strategy is to focus on our tier-one assets and profitably produce at a pace aligned with market signals in order to increase long-term shareholder value. We plan to: ensure continued safe, reliable, low-cost production from our tier-one assets - McArthur River/Key Lake, Cigar Lake and Inkai complete rampup of production at Cigar Lake seek to expand production at McArthur River/Key Lake in conjunction with market signals manage the rest of our sources of supply in a manner that retains the flexibility to respond to market signals and take advantage of value adding opportunities within our own portfolio and the uranium market maintain our low-cost advantage by focusing on execution and operational excellence MCARTHUR RIVER/KEY LAKE Production Production from McArthur River/Key Lake was 19.1 million pounds; our share was 13.3 million pounds. This was 3% lower than our forecast for the year due to unplanned maintenance outages to repair the calciner at Key Lake. Annual production was unchanged from 2014. Licensing and production capacity In 2015, the CNSC approved our application to increase McArthur River's licensed annual production to 25 million pounds (100% basis) to allow flexibility to match the approved Key Lake mill capacity. The licence conditions handbooks for these operations now allow both operations to produce up to 25 million pounds (100% basis) per year. Key Lake extension and McArthur River production expansion In support of our strategy to maintain the flexibility to respond to market conditions as they evolve, we continue to advance projects that are necessary to sustain and increase production when the market signals that additional production is needed. The Key Lake mill began operating in 1983 and we continue to upgrade circuits with new technology to simplify operations and improve environmental performance. The extension project involved increasing our tailings capacity and the mill's nominal annual production rate to closely follow production from the McArthur River mine. As part of the mill upgrades, we continue to construct and commission a new calciner circuit, and expect to begin operating with the new calciner in 2016. The existing calciner circuit will remain in place until operational reliability of the new calciner is achieved. The calciner replacement project was planned in a way that temporarily allows us to use either calciner, which will help to mitigate risks to our production rate during the commissioning phase. In order to increase production at Key Lake, we also need to optimize and expand the solvent extraction and crystallization circuits in the mill (projects planned for 2017). At McArthur River, we must continue to successfully transition into new mine areas through mine development and investment in support infrastructure. We plan to: improve our dewatering system and expand our water treatment capacity as required to mitigate capacity losses, should mine development increase background water volumes expand the concrete distribution systems and batch plant capacity New mining areas New mining zones and increased mine production requires increased freeze capacity and ventilation. In 2015, we continued to upgrade our electrical infrastructure on surface as part of our plan to address these future needs. We advanced groundworks to prepare for the next freeze plant, which is scheduled to begin freezing the south end of the orebody (zone 4) in 2017. We also made changes in shaft 2 to increase air flow, resulting in a 15% to 20% improvement in ventilation capacity. The improved ventilation eliminates the need for a new ventilation shaft to support a higher production rate. Tailings capacity We expect to have sufficient tailings capacity to mill all the known McArthur River mineral reserves and resources, should they be converted to reserves, with additional capacity to toll mill ore from other regional deposits. PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE AT MCARTHUR RIVER/KEY LAKE Production We plan to produce 20.0 million pounds in 2016; our share is 14.0 million pounds. Expansion progress As previously disclosed in our 2012 Technical Report, we plan to reach an annual capacity of 22 million pounds by 2018. The capital required to do so is shown in our 2016 capital spending plan, and in our outlook for investing activities in 2017 and 2018, beginning on page 6. As we increase to 22 million pounds per year, we will optimize the capacity of both the Key Lake mill and McArthur River mine with a view to further increasing production to 25 million pounds per year (100% basis), as market conditions improve. Using this approach, we do not expect significant additional growth capital will be required to increase from annual production of 22 million pounds to an annual rate of 25 million pounds. We expect that this paced approach will allow us to extract maximum value from the operation as the market transitions. Exploration In 2015, underground drilling further delineated the zone A mineral resources. Underground definition drilling of zone B will be conducted in 2016 and 2017 to provide the information required for engineering work to develop more detailed mining plans. CIGAR LAKE Production Total packaged production from Cigar Lake was 11.3 million pounds U3O8; our share was 5.7 million pounds. The operation exceeded our forecast of 10 million pounds (100% basis) as a result of higher productivity and our intention to adjust annual production as necessary, based on our operating experience during rampup. During the year, we: completed commissioning of the equipment required to operate three JBS units at a production scale brought on additional slurry haul trucks to ensure a sufficient quantity of ore slurry can be transported to the McClean Lake mill completed final commissioning of underground processing circuits and updated our production rampup plan based on commissioning experience modified mine and project plans to reflect our decision to exclusively freeze from surface declared commercial production Commercial production Commercial production signals a transition in the accounting treatment for costs incurred at the mine. Cigar Lake met all of the criteria for commercial production, including cycle time and process specifications, in the second quarter of 2015. Therefore, effective May 1, 2015, we began charging all production costs, including depreciation, to inventory and subsequently recognizing them in cost of sales as the product is sold. Underground development As a result of our decision to exclusively use surface freezing going forward, and the resulting change in the mine plan, the bulk of the development and freeze drilling required for mining in 2016 is already complete. We are continuing to plan for future expansion of surface freezing infrastructure in late 2016. McClean Lake mill update Additional estimated expenditures of $50 million (100% basis, our share $25 million) are expected to be required at the McClean Lake mill in 2016, primarily to complete upgrades in the tailings neutralization area in support of the continued rampup to full production of 18 million pounds per year. PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE AT CIGAR LAKE Production In 2016, we expect to produce 16.0 million packaged pounds at Cigar Lake; our share is 8.0 million pounds. In 2016, we also expect to: extend the current surface freeze pad and advance planning for freeze plant infrastructure expansion to support future production advance underground development according to the new mine plan and backfill drifts no longer required for underground freezing operations continue ramping up towards the planned full annual production rate of 18 million pounds (100% basis) in 2017 Exploration We are planning to conduct delineation drilling from surface to confirm and upgrade resources contained in the western portion of the deposit. Approximately 65,000 metres of diamond drilling is planned over a three-year period, starting in 2016, in order to complete a detailed geological and geotechnical interpretation, a resource estimate, and a technical study for the western portion of the deposit. Rampup schedule In 2017, we expect to reach full annual production of 18 million pounds (100% basis, 9 million pounds our share). The McClean Lake mill's operating licence currently has an annual production limit of 13 million pounds. AREVA has submitted an application to the CNSC to increase the mill's licensed annual production limit; our 2016 and 2017 production outlook for Cigar Lake is therefore subject to AREVA securing the regulatory approvals necessary to increase mill production. Labour relations The current collective agreement between AREVA and unionized employees at the McClean Lake operation expires in May 2016. There is risk to our 2016 and 2017 production outlook for Cigar Lake if AREVA is unable to reach an agreement and there is a labour dispute. INKAI Production Total production from Inkai was 5.8 million pounds; our share was 3.4 million pounds. Production was 17% higher than our production in 2014. During 2015, the subsoil use law in Kazakhstan was amended to allow producers to produce within 20% (above or below) their licensed capacity in a year. As a result, Inkai produced 5.8 million pounds in 2015, 11% higher than its licensed capacity. The increase in production was the result of a higher head grade and an increase in wellfield development efficiency compared to 2014. Project funding As of December 31, 2015, Inkai had fully repaid the outstanding loan under our agreement to fund its project development costs related to blocks 1 and 2. In 2015, Inkai paid the remaining $0.8 million (US) in interest on the loan and repaid $55 million (US) of principal. We are currently advancing funds for Inkai's work on block 3 and, as of December 31, 2015, the principal amounted to $148 million (US). Under the loan agreement, Inkai is to repay Cameco from the net sales proceeds from the sale of production from block 3. Production expansion In 2012, we entered into a binding memorandum of agreement (2012 MOA) with our joint venture partner, Kazatomprom, setting out a framework to: increase Inkai's annual production from blocks 1 and 2 to 10.4 million pounds (our share 5.2 million pounds) and sustain it at that level extend the term of Inkai's resource use contract through 2045 Kazatomprom is pursuing a strategic objective to develop uranium processing capacity in Kazakhstan to complement its leading uranium mining operations. Their primary focus is now on uranium refining, which is an intermediate step in the uranium conversion process. A Nuclear Co-operation Agreement between Canada and Kazakhstan is in place, providing the international framework necessary for applying to the two governments for the required licences and permits. We expect to pursue further expansion of production at Inkai at a pace measured to market opportunities. Discussions continue with Kazatomprom. Block 3 exploration In 2015, Inkai completed construction of the test leach facility and began pilot production from test wellfields, as well as advancing work on a preliminary appraisal of the mineral potential of block 3 according to Kazakhstan standards. Block 3 licence extension The block 3 test leach facility is now operational and state commissioning of the test wellfields was accomplished during 2015. Our application for an extension of the block 3 evaluation period is still pending final approval from the Ministry of Energy of the Republic of Kazakhstan. Inkai continues working on the final appraisal of the mineral potential of block 3 according to Kazakhstan standards. Although a number of extensions of the licence term have been granted by Kazakh regulatory authorities in the past, there is no assurance that a further extension will be granted. Without such extension, there is a risk we could lose our rights to block 3, and a risk we will not be compensated for the funds we advanced to Inkai to fund block 3 activities. PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE AT INKAI Production We expect total production from blocks 1 and 2 to be 5.2 million pounds in 2016; our share is 3.0 million pounds. We expect to maintain production at this level until the potential growth plans are finalized with Kazatomprom. Block 3 exploration In 2016, Inkai expects to continue with pilot production from the test leach facility and to continue working on a final appraisal of the mineral potential according to Kazakhstan standards. RABBIT LAKE Production Production this year was unchanged from our 2014 production as a result of planned timing of production stopes, coupled with slightly improved ore grades. Development and production continued at the Eagle Point mine. At the mill, we continued to improve the efficiency of the mill operation schedule. Temporary mining restrictions On December 17, 2015, we announced that underground mining activities at Eagle Point were being restricted due to a rock fall in an inactive area of the mine. As a precautionary measure, non-essential personnel were removed from the mine while the condition of the affected area was evaluated. Mine production was suspended, although milling of previously mined and transported ore continued through to year end. The assessment determined that repairs were necessary to support the ground in the affected area of the mine. The repairs were completed, along with some further assessment of stability in other areas of the mine. The mine was reopened and normal operations resumed on February 3, 2016. PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE AT RABBIT LAKE Production We expect to produce 3.6 million pounds in 2016. The decrease compared to 2015 is the result of the restriction of mining activities at the end of 2015, which extended into 2016. Tailings capacity Under our current licence, we expect to have sufficient tailings capacity to support milling of Eagle Point ore until about late 2017, based upon expected ore tonnage, milling rates and tailings properties. Our plan for fully utilizing the available tailings capacity of the Rabbit Lake In-Pit Tailings Management facility requires regulatory approval in 2016 for which we have submitted the required applications. With these regulatory approvals and after we complete the necessary work on the existing pit, we expect to then have sufficient tailings capacity to support milling of Eagle Point ore until at least 2021 based upon expected ore tonnage, milling rates, and tailings properties. Exploration We plan to continue our underground drilling reserve replacement program in areas of interest north and northeast of the current mine workings in 2016. The drilling will be carried out from underground locations. Reclamation As part of our multi-year site-wide reclamation plan, we spent over $0.7 million in 2015 to reclaim facilities that are no longer in use and plan to spend over $0.5 million in 2016. FUEL SERVICES 2015 UPDATE Production Fuel services produced 9.7 million kgU, 16% lower than 2014. This was a result of our decision to decrease production in response to weak market conditions and the termination of our toll milling agreement with SFL in 2014. Port Hope conversion facility cleanup and modernization (Vision in Motion) The Vision in Motion project is currently in the feasibility stage and will continue with the CNSC licensing process in 2016, which is required to advance the project. Labour relations Approximately 100 unionized employees at Cameco Fuel Manufacturing Inc.'s operations in Port Hope and Cobourg, Ontario accepted a new collective bargaining agreement in the second quarter of 2015. The employees, represented by the United Steelworkers local 14193 agreed to a three-year contract that includes a 7% wage increase over the term of the agreement. The previous contract expired on June 1, 2015. PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE AT FUEL SERVICES Production We have decreased our production target for 2016 to between 8 million and 9 million kgU in response to the continued weak market conditions. Labour relations The current collective bargaining agreement for our unionized employees at the Port Hope conversion facility expires on June 30, 2016. We will commence the bargaining process in early 2016. Regulatory The current operating licence for the Port Hope conversion facility expires in February 2017. The CNSC relicensing process will take place in 2016. Caution about forward-looking information This document includes statements and information about our expectations for the future.

royalty and stream company by both gold revenues and number of gold assets.  The Company is gold-focused but also has the largest and most diversified portfolio of royalties and streams by commodity, geography, revenue type and stage of project.  The portfolio is actively managed with the aim to maintain over 80% of revenue from precious metals (gold, silver & PGM). The Company does not operate mines, develop projects or conduct exploration. Franco-Nevada's business model is focused on managing and growing its portfolio of royalties and streams. The advantages of this business model are: Market Exposure to the gold price and exploration optionality;  Limited exposure to many of the risks associated with operating companies;  A free cash-flow business with limited cash calls;  A high-margin business that can generate cash through the entire commodity cycle;  A scalable and diversified business in which a large number of assets can be managed with a small stable overhead;  A forward-looking business in which management focuses on growth opportunities rather than operational or development issues; and  A perpetual discovery option over large areas of geologically prospective lands with no cost other than the initial investment. Franco-Nevada's financial results in the short-term are primarily tied to the price of commodities and the amount of production from its portfolio of producing assets. From time to time, financial results are also supplemented by acquisitions of new producing assets. Over the longer-term, results are impacted by the availability of exploration and development capital applied by other companies to advance Franco-Nevada's advanced and exploration assets into production. Franco-Nevada has a long-term focus in making its investments and recognizes it is in a cyclical industry.  Franco-Nevada has historically operated by maintaining a strong balance sheet so that it can make investments during commodity cycle downturns. At year-end 2014, Franco-Nevada had $677.8 million in working capital and  an undrawn $500.0 million unsecured credit facility. Franco-Nevada's shares are listed on the Toronto and New York stock exchanges under the symbol FNV.  An investment in Franco-Nevada's shares is expected to provide investors with yield and more upside than gold ETF without exposure to operating cost inflation. Since its IPO over seven years ago, Franco-Nevada's share price has outperformed the gold price and all relevant gold equity benchmarks. Franco-Nevada Reports Q3 2015 Results and Declares Quarterly Dividend TORONTO, November 11, 2015 - Franco-Nevada Corporation (TSX: FNV; NYSE: FNV) today reported third quarter 2015 financial results realizing 85,637 Gold Equivalent Ounces (\"GEOs\")1 from its mineral assets and $7.8 million in revenue from its oil & gas assets. Net Income and Adjusted Net Income2 were $15.2 million, or $0.10 per share, and $19.4 million, or $0.12 per share, respectively, with Adjusted EBITDA3 being $78.0 million, or $0.50 per share. Prepared in accordance with IFRS and presented in U.S. dollars (unless otherwise noted). \"Franco-Nevada's diversified portfolio continues to perform well,\" said David Harquail, CEO. \"It is significant that these results are before any contributions from our $610 million Antamina silver stream investment which closed in October. We expect to begin recording revenues from the sale of ounces from Antamina in Q4 2015. Also, in November we began funding our gold and silver stream investment in the Cobre Panama project which we expect will be ramping up production in 2018. Franco-Nevada now has net debt of approximately $330 million, an undrawn credit facility of $270 million and remains well-positioned to continue to add to its portfolio.\" Revenues and GEOs by Asset Categories For the third quarter of 2015, revenue was earned 90% from precious metals (83% gold and 7% PGM) and 79% from the Americas (19% U.S., 23% Canada and 37% Latin America). Costs and expenses were impacted by higher depletion expense and costs of sales due to the Candelaria acquisition. Oil & gas production levels were stable with the associated oil & gas revenue decreasing significantly year over year due to lower average oil & gas prices in 2015. Cash provided by operating activities before changes to working capital was $72.4 million. Corporate Updates Antamina: On October 9, 2015, Franco-Nevada closed the previously announced Antamina silver stream with Teck Resources Limited by providing a $610.0 million upfront payment. The payment was funded through a combination of cash on hand and a partial draw of the Company's credit facility. Antamina is expected to contribute between 900,000 to 1,100,000 silver ounces (12,300 to 15,000 GEOs) in Q4 2015. Cobre Panama: Franco-Nevada and First Quantum finalized terms of a replacement precious metals stream agreement on the Cobre Panama project. On November 3, 2015, Franco-Nevada made a $337.9 million initial upfront payment under its $1.0 billion commitment which was funded through cash on hand and proceeds from a partial draw of its credit facility. Credit Facility: Franco-Nevada has entered into an agreement to increase its credit facility to $1.0 billion while maintaining a $250.0 million accordion and extending the maturity to November 2020. Closing is expected to occur prior to the end of November. Portfolio Updates Gold - U.S.: GEOs from U.S. gold assets increased to 14,618 GEOs mainly due to higher production at Goldstrike, Bald Mountain and Gold Quarry, partially offset by lower production at Marigold and fewer ounces under the Fire Creek/Midas fixed deliveries due to a reduction of the monthly ounce obligation in 2015 compared to 2014. Klondex Mines released an updated Mineral Resource estimate for its Midas Mine and Fire Creek project and announced positive drill results from recent underground and surface drilling at its Midas Mine. Gold - Canada: GEOs from Canadian assets decreased in the quarter due to lower production at Hemlo and Sudbury. In Ontario, Lake Shore Gold and Kirkland Lake Gold both announced positive drill results at their respective projects where Franco-Nevada holds various interests. Pretium Resources announced a $540 million construction financing package for its Brucejack project where Franco-Nevada has a 1.2% NSR. At the Phoenix gold project, where Franco-Nevada holds a 2% NSR, Rubicon Minerals announced the temporary suspension of underground activities while it reviews its geological model and develops an implementation plan Gold - Latin America: Candelaria had a strong quarter delivering 19,081 GEOs to Franco-Nevada. During the quarter, Lundin Mining released an updated mine plan for Candelaria which reflected a 26% increase in precious metal production over the next four years. Under the Guadalupe stream agreement, Franco-Nevada funded $4.0 million during the quarter and the final instalment of $8.0 million subsequent to the quarter. Gold - Rest of World: Contributions from Sabodala and Mine Waste Solutions represented approximately 60% of the total GEOs received from Rest of World gold assets for Q3 2015. True Gold announced the commencement of mining at its Karma project and remains on track for gold production at the end of Q1 2016. Franco-Nevada funded $10.4 million in the quarter and $9.7 million subsequent to the quarter under the Karma stream agreement bringing the total funded to $63.4 million. Perseus Mining announced it had signed a Mining Convention with the Ivorian government on its Sissingue project and expects to make a production decision in the fourth quarter of 2015. PGM: PGM GEOs were impacted by declining palladium and platinum prices relative to gold in the quarter. Oil & gas: Revenue from oil & gas assets was $7.8 million in Q3 2015 with similar production levels as Q3 2014. The decrease in revenue is the result of lower average oil & gas prices. On November 6, 2015, Franco-Nevada acquired an additional 0.29% working interest in the Weyburn Unit for C$6.2 million. Dividend Declaration Franco-Nevada is pleased to announce that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.21 per share. The dividend will be paid on December 17, 2015 to shareholders of record on December 3, 2015.

Goldcorp Delivers Strong Free Cash Flow as Third Quarter Gold Production Increases 42% October 29, 2015 (All amounts in $US unless stated otherwise) VANCOUVER, Oct. 29, 2015 /CNW/ - GOLDCORP INC. (TSX: G, NYSE: GG) today reported record third quarter gold production1 of 922,200 ounces, an increase of 42% compared to gold production of 651,700 ounces in the third quarter of 2014.  Adjusted quarterly revenues1 were $1.3 billion.  Adjusted operating cash flow1,2  was $374 million, compared to $399 million for the third quarter of 2014. Free cash flow3 was $243 million, compared to negative free cash flow of $355 million for the third quarter of 2014.  The reported net loss attributable to shareholders of Goldcorp for the quarter was $192 million, or $0.23 per share, compared to a net loss of $44 million, or $0.05 per share, for the third quarter of 2014.  The adjusted net loss1,4 was $37 million, or $0.04 per share, compared to adjusted net earnings of $70 million, or $0.09 per share, for the third quarter of 2014.  Included in the adjusted net loss is a reduction in the carrying values of inventory stockpiles of $40 million, or $0.05 per share. Third Quarter 2015 Highlights Gold sales1 of 942,600 ounces; gold production of 922,200 ounces.  Free cash flow of $243 million before dividends; $168 million after dividends. Revolving credit facility fully repaid. Adjusted revenues of $1.3 billion. All-in sustaining costs1,5 of $848 per ounce. Adjusted operating cash flow of $374 million. Adjusted net loss of $37 million, or $0.04 per share. 2015 production and cost guidance re-confirmed. Announced joint venture (50/50) with Teck Resources Limited (\"Teck\") to combine El Morro and Relincho projects into a single project.  \"Our third quarter results highlight the essence of Goldcorp's investment proposition: growing gold production, declining all-in sustaining costs and decreasing capital spending resulting in strong, sustained free cash flow, despite lower metals prices,\" said Chuck Jeannes, Goldcorp President and Chief Executive Officer.  \"Record quarterly gold production, successful cost containment efforts and the wind-down of a capital investment program that has brought two high-quality gold mines into commercial production this year contributed to quarterly free cash flow of $243 million.  The benefit of managing a strong portfolio of mines was illustrated in the quarter as good results at Penasquito, Cerro Negro and Musselwhite more than offset lower-than-expected production from Eleonore as the mine continues to ramp up.  As a result, we remain on track to meet the upper end of our production guidance of between 3.3 and 3.6 million ounces at all-in sustaining costs of between $850 and $900 per ounce.  Our focus over the balance of 2015 and into 2016 is on vigilant management of our costs in the current gold price environment, successful replacement of mined gold reserves and the prudent allocation of free cash flow to fortify our already-strong balance sheet and fund the next wave of Goldcorp's promising organic growth opportunities.\" Financial Review Third quarter gold sales were 942,600 ounces at an average realized gold price of $1,114per ounce on production of 922,200 ounces, compared to sales of 641,400 ounces at an average realized gold price of $1,266 per ounce on production of 651,700 ounces for the third quarter of 2014. Silver production totaled 11.3 million ounces compared to 7.8 million ounces in the prior year's third quarter.  All-in sustaining costs were $848 per ounce of gold for the third quarter of 2015 compared to $1,066 per ounce in the third quarter of 2014.   Excluding non-cash inventory impairments at Los Filos and Penasquito, all-in sustaining costs for the third quarter of 2015 would have been $802 per ounce. Adjusted revenues for the third quarter totaled $1.3 billion.  The reported net loss attributable to shareholders of Goldcorp for the third quarter was $192 million, or $0.23 per share, compared to a net loss of $44 million, or $0.05 per share, for the third quarter of 2014.  Adjusted net loss for the third quarter totaled $37 million, or $0.04 per share, compared to adjusted net earnings of $70 million, or $0.09 per share, for the third quarter of 2014.  The adjusted net loss for the third quarter of 2015 primarily excludes the unrealized losses from the foreign exchange translation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities ($158 million, or $0.19 per share). The adjusted net loss includes the impact of non-cash stock-based compensation expenses which amounted to approximately $14 million, or $0.02 per share, for the quarter.  Adjusted operating cash flow for the third quarter was $374 million, compared to $399 million for the third quarter of 2014.  Canada At Eleonore in Quebec, third quarter safe gold production totaled 86,700 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $974 per ounce.  Production increased over the prior quarter as a result of the expansion of underground mining from two to four horizons, in addition to successful mine optimization initiatives.  Stoping productivity and mining flexibility continued to improve, contributing to higher underground mine tonnage quarter over quarter.  Throughput during the quarter averaged 6,500 tonnes per day.  While recoveries in the third quarter were impacted by the presence of iron sulphides in certain production stopes, metallurgical studies are underway that are expected to minimize the effect on future recoveries.     As previously reported on September 8, 2015, initial production stopes at Eleonore are encountering folding and faulting resulting in higher dilution and therefore lower than planned mined grades and gold production. The folding is of varying intensities and is estimated to affect approximately 10% of the overall Eleonore deposit.  The Eleonore team continues to work on adjusting stope designs to minimize these impacts.  Work on the Eleonore crown pillar pre-feasibility study continued to advance during the third quarter.  Major activities included the successful completion of summer field work, underground and surface infrastructure and stope sequencing determination of the dike location, and permitting and stakeholder engagement efforts.  The pre-feasibility study is on track to be completed by the end of 2015.  Safe gold production at Red Lake in Ontario in the third quarter totaled 77,600 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $1,028 per ounce.  Production decreased over the prior quarter as a result of lower grades from remnant pillar mining at the Campbell Complex, the acceleration of development in the Sulphide Zones and lower-than-expected grades in the Footwall Zone.  An exploration drift to access the HG Young discovery at depth continued to advance north on the 14 Level at the Campbell Complex.  The drift provides a new platform for follow-up drilling down plunge of positive intercepts from the ongoing surface exploration program at HG Young.  At Cochenour, exploration drilling continued to assess the core area of the deposit as well as at the tram level, where there have been changes in the orientation of the veins from prior interpretations. Detailed interpretation and analysis is ongoing to support final mine planning and infrastructure. Processing of mill feed from the initial sill-development work was consistent with expectations. Work is ongoing to define the timing of initial stope production and ramp up of Cochenour feed for processing at Red Lake. At Porcupine in Ontario, safe gold production for the third quarter was 71,000 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $882 per ounce.  Production decreased over the prior quarter due to lower gold grades, driven primarily by the mining of lower-grade stopes at the Hoyle Pond underground,  partially offset by higher tonnage milled as a result of improved mill operations during the quarter.   The Hoyle Deep project, which will enable efficient access to lower portions of the Hoyle Pond deposit, continued to progress and remains on track to be fully operational in the first quarter of 2016.  At the Hollinger open pit, the environmental control berm was completed in mid-October, enabling mining to take place 24 hours a day.  At the Borden project 160 kilometres west of Porcupine, studies are underway to determine the optimization of a combined Borden-Porcupine operation.  Options to access the deposit from underground are currently being evaluated in preparation for permit applications.  Surface diamond drilling continued during the third quarter with seven drills on site.  The current exploration activity in this new gold district remains focused on in-fill drilling with a target to convert a portion of the resources into reserves at the end of 2015. Safe gold production at Musselwhite in Ontario increased over the prior quarter to 71,000 ounces as a result of higher mill throughput and increased grades.  Musselwhite's all-in sustaining cost continued to be among the lowest in the portfolio at $697 per ounce.  The focus of the exploration program during the third quarter was on reserve replacement. Drilling concluded late in the third quarter on the West Limb zone and the Upper Lynx zone with positive results showing continuity of mineralization in both areas.  All critical exploration development for the year is complete. Latin America At Penasquito in Mexico, safe gold production totaled 236,800 ounces for the quarter at an all-in sustaining cost of $467 per ounce.  Production was driven primarily by higher gold grades in sulphide as a result of positive model reconciliation.  In light of continued strong performance, production at Penasquito will exceed 2015 guidance of between 700,000 and 750,000 ounces. Construction of the Northern Well Field (\"NWF\") remained suspended throughout the third quarter of 2015 due to an illegal blockade by a local community.  Penasquito continues to seek a fair resolution of this matter with the community, while taking steps to enforce its contractual rights. Penasquito is also advancing alternatives for completion of the project without crossing through the affected community lands.  Contingency planning is ongoing for fresh water supply to the Penasquito mine until the NWF project is operational.  The Company believes that there will be timely resolution of this matter to meet the future water needs of Penasquito. The Metallurgical Enhancement Project (\"MEP\") feasibility study continued, which included completion of pilot testing, confirming capital estimates and concentrate marketing studies.  The feasibility study remains on schedule to be completed in early 2016.     At the Camino Rojo project, ongoing pre-feasibility study work is focused on the evaluation of Camino Rojo as a supplemental source of sulphide feed to the existing Penasquito facility, in addition to a smaller, stand-alone oxide heap leach facility.  An update of the geologic model continued during the third quarter and metallurgical testing of sulphide, transition and oxide zones is ongoing.  The pre-feasibility study is on track to be completed in 2016. Safe gold production at Los Filos in Mexico for the third quarter of 2015 totaled 70,300 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $1,442 per ounce.  Increased production over the prior quarter was a result of higher ore processed.   The 2015 exploration program to enhance deeper phases of the El Bermejal pit and extend high grade zones for underground mining was completed.  A new life-of-mine plan is progressing with a focus to maximize return on investment in the current lower price metals environment and is expected to be completed by the end of 2015. At Cerro Negro in Argentina, third quarter safe gold production totaled 135,700 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $731 per ounce, driven by the continued strong ramp-up at both the Mariana Central and Eureka mines.  Total tonnes milled increased resulting in an average throughput rate of 3,697 tonnes per day for the quarter.  Average milling rates for September surpassed the nameplate capacity of 4,000 tonnes per operating day.  Exploration in the third quarter continued to focus on surface resource confirmation drilling.  The current drilling program is progressing as planned, expanding resources at the Marianas Complex, particularly at the newly-discovered Emilia vein. The Bajo Negro expansion was completed in the third quarter and the results will be included within the year-end resource update.  On September 30, 2015, a work stoppage took place at Cerro Negro by miners represented by the Asociacion Obrera Minera Argentina, Province of Santa Cruz.  All work activity resumed on October 5, 2015 following the declaration of a mandatory minimum 15-day conciliation period by the Santa Cruz Provincial Secretariat of Labour.  Subsequent to the expiration of the conciliation period productive negotiations continue.  The Company remains committed to working cooperatively with union representatives and government authorities on a fair and equitable resolution. At the Pueblo Viejo joint venture in the Dominican Republic, Goldcorp's share of third quarter safe gold and silver production totaled 115,000 ounces and 502,700 ounces, respectively, at an all-in sustaining cost of $585 per ounce.  Gold production increased over the prior quarter as a result of higher tonnes processed, grades and recoveries.  Silver production increased primarily due to higher recoveries.  Tonnage processed was higher in the third quarter due to the prior quarter being impacted by autoclave and counter current decantation thickener maintenance.  Silver recoveries were higher due to the shut-down of the lime boil tanks during autoclave maintenance in the prior quarter.  At El Morro in Chile, an agreement was reached with Teck on August 27, 2015 to combine the El Morro and Relincho projects into a 50/50 joint venture. In addition, an agreement was reached with New Gold to acquire New Gold's 30% interest in the El Morro project for$90 million in cash upon closing, and a 4% gold stream on future gold production from the El Morro property. Closing of both transactions is expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2015.  The project will undertake extensive engagement with communities and other stakeholders to help guide the project's development. In combination with community consultation, a pre-feasibility study is expected to commence in mid-2016. 2015 Guidance Outlook The Company today reconfirmed 2015 production guidance, expected to be at the upper-end of between 3.3 and 3.6 million gold ounces.  All-in sustaining costs are expected to be between $850 and $900 per gold ounce; $500 and $550 per ounce on a by-product basis; and $625 to $675 per ounce on a co-product basis.  Depreciation, depletion and amortization (\"DD&A\") will increase to $450 per gold ounce from the previous guidance of$425 per gold ounce due primarily to production coming from our newer and higher DD&A per ounce sites and additional assets placed in service earlier than anticipated.  Capital spending guidance remains unchanged at between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion for 2015.  Corporate administration expense guidance, excluding share-based compensation, is expected to be approximately $170 million in 2015. Excluding the impacts of foreign exchange on current and deferred tax assets and liabilities and excluding the dilution and disposition gains on the sale of mining interests and the related taxes, the Company continues to expect an annual effective tax rate on adjusted earnings subject to income tax of 45% in 2015.

Mission To create sustainable value through increased commodity exposure on a per share basis, in high-quality and growing long-life deposits in mining-friendly jurisdictions. Competitive Strengths Growth in copper, gold and zinc production with exploration upside Consistent performance from reliable operations Disciplined and clear growth strategy already being executed Strong financial position Experienced management and operating team  Hudbay Announces Fourth Quarter 2015 Results February 24, 2016 TORONTO, ON -- (Marketwired) -- 02/24/16 -- HudBay Minerals Inc. (\"Hudbay\" or the \"company\") (TSX: HBM) (NYSE: HBM) today released its fourth quarter 2015 financial results. All amounts are in US dollars, unless otherwise noted. Summary: 2016 planned capital spending and operating expenses reduced by over $100 million compared to 2016 guidance, with no impact on production guidance. Commitments in place for credit facility amendments to provide more flexible financial covenants and extend all principal repayments to 2019, deferring $53.4 million in 2016 scheduled repayments. Copper sales volumes increased 850% year-over-year to a record 58,714 tonnes in the fourth quarter and copper concentrate logistical issues resolved. Operating cash flow before changes in non-cash working capital increased to $106.3 million, or $0.45 per share, from negative $2.0 million, or $(0.01) per share, in the fourth quarter of 2014. Net loss in the fourth quarter of 2015 was $255.5 million, or $1.09 per share, compared to earnings of $43.6 million, or $0.19 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2014, as a result of non-cash after-tax impairment charges of $198.8 million on Constancia and $114.5 million on Rosemont, primarily due to lower copper price expectations. In the fourth quarter of 2015, operating cash flow before change in non-cash working capital increased to $106.3 million from negative $2.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. \"With the successful ramp-up of our new mines in 2015, we delivered sector-leading growth in low-cost copper production, and are well-positioned to weather the current commodity price environment,\" said Alan Hair, president and chief executive officer. \"We have taken specific action already in 2016 to capitalize on mine optimization and sustainable cost reduction opportunities, and have strengthened our liquidity position to ensure that the business is positioned to respond to a volatile metal price environment.\" Net loss and loss per share in the fourth quarter of 2015 were $255.5 million and $1.09, respectively, compared to net profit and earnings per share of $43.6 million and $0.19, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2014. Financial and Operating Results Total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2015 was $336.6 million, $223.9 million higher than the same period in 2014. This increase was primarily due to higher copper, gold and silver sales volumes compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, which was a result of commercial production being achieved at Constancia and significant inventory drawdown. Higher sales volumes were partially offset by lower prices for all metals and the effect of higher treatment and refining charges. Operating cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2015 benefited from an increase in payable copper in concentrate sales volumes and significantly higher precious metal sales volumes compared to the same quarter last year. This resulted from the Constancia mine reaching commercial production in the second quarter of 2015 and sales volumes of most metals in the Manitoba business unit growing as the Lalor mine had its first full year of commercial production. The increase in sales volumes and associated economies of scale more than offset the sharp decline in realized sales prices of all metals compared to the same quarter last year. Net loss and loss per share in the fourth quarter of 2015 were $255.5 million and $1.09, respectively, compared to a net profit and earnings per share of $43.6 million and $0.19, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2014. The loss was due mainly to an after-tax asset and goodwill impairment charge of $313.3 million recorded in the Peru and Arizona business units. Partly offsetting this impact was a $52.1 million increase in gross profit compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 due to the growth in sales volumes discussed above, despite lower realized sales prices and higher depreciation charges. Additionally, there was a $37.0 million gain in the fourth quarter of 2015 arising from the sale of Balmat Holding Corporation.

Credit Facility Amendments Commitments have been received from lenders under Hudbay's two secured credit facilities to consolidate the lender groups and restructure the two facilities. The credit facility restructuring is intended to enhance Hudbay's liquidity position in the current commodity price environment and reflects the transition of the Constancia operation into commercial production. At December 31, 2015, Hudbay had a $400 million revolving credit facility, secured by its Manitoba assets (the \"Canada Facility\") and a $150 million standby credit facility, secured by its Peru assets (the \"Peru Facility\"), collectively referred to as the \"Facilities\". Commitments of $500 million have been received from existing lenders toward the restructured facilities, and syndication is ongoing to bring total commitments to $550 million. Subject to completion of definitive documentation and customary conditions, the Facilities will be structured as follows: Whereas the Canada Facility is currently repayable in full in March 2018 and the Peru Facility is currently repayable in quarterly installments which began in December 2015 and end in September 2018, both Facilities will now be repayable in full in March 2019. As a result, 2016 scheduled principal amortization payments of $53.4 million will be deferred. Both Facilities will be subject to the same set of financial covenants. The financial covenants will require that: Consolidated senior secured debt to EBITDA shall be no more than 3.25:1. Consolidated senior secured debt is defined to include amounts outstanding under the Facilities and any other secured financings. Consolidated EBITDA to interest expense shall be no less than 1.75:1 in 2016 and 2017, and 2.50:1 beginning with the 12 months ending March 31, 2018. Consolidated tangible net worth shall be no less than 75% of Hudbay's tangible net worth at December 31, 2015. The Peru Facility will become revolving in nature and both the Peru Facility and the Canada Facility will bear an interest rate of LIBOR + 4.5%, consistent with the interest rate on the current Canada Facility. The Canada Facility and Peru Facility will continue to be secured by Hudbay's Manitoba and Peru assets, respectively, and will not be cross-collateralized. At December 31, 2015, $50.1 million of letters of credit had been advanced under the Facilities. Including borrowings and letters of credit, a total of $347.1 million was drawn under the Facilities as at December 31, 2015. Closing of the amendments, which is not conditional on any further lender commitments, is expected in March 2016. Cost Reduction Initiatives Following the ramp-up of Hudbay's new mine production in 2015, an extensive review was launched as part of a company-wide efficiency improvement initiative. This ongoing review, combined with cost containment efforts, resulted in expected 2016 capital expenditure and operating cost reductions of more than $100 million, compared to 2016 guidance, with no effect on production guidance. Operating cost savings have been identified which are expected to reduce 2016 operating and general and administrative costs by approximately $55 million. Approximately $15 million relates to lower current prices for commodities such as diesel, propane and steel compared to budget expectations. Another $22 million relates to savings from renegotiated contracts for goods and services, and approximately $18 million relates to other operating efficiencies and lower discretionary spending, including reduced corporate spending. All of the operating cost reductions in 2016 are considered to be sustainable based on current prices for input costs. Planned sustaining capital expenditures in 2016 have been reduced by approximately $50 million, relative to initial guidance of $270 million, with no impact on production guidance. The planned reduction in spending reflects the deferral of a portion of sustaining capital expenditures from 2016 to 2017, and is comprised of $40 million in the Peru business unit and $10 million in the Manitoba business unit. Of the $40 million of reduced spending in Peru in 2016, $19 million relates to the deferral of certain tailings dam construction activities into 2017, and $14 million relates to the deferral of mobile equipment purchases for the development of the Pampacancha satellite deposit. In Manitoba, 2016 capital spending reductions relate partly to expenditures on underground equipment and development at the 777 mine. Planned 2016 Manitoba spending reductions of approximately $15 million are partially offset by approximately $5 million in equipment purchases carried over from 2015. Hudbay's sustaining capital spending in 2017 is expected to be moderately lower than revised 2016 spending of $220 million, as initial spending on the Constancia tailings dam nears completion. Sustaining capital spending in 2018 is expected to be substantially lower than 2016 and 2017 levels with the completion of the initial Constancia tailings dam raise in 2017, and lower capitalized development spending in Manitoba at the 777 and Reed mines based on the current life of mine plans. Capital expenditures related to Pampacancha and Snow Lake enhancements are not included in the sustaining capital estimates. As a result of these initiatives, Hudbay's guidance for capital and operating costs in 2016 have been revised as follows: Revised 2016 Capital Expenditure and Unit Operating Cost Guidance Capital Expenditures 1   Original  (Millions)   Revised  (Millions) Sustaining Capital         Manitoba   90   80 Peru   180   140 Total Sustaining Capital   270   220           Growth Capital         Arizona2   30   30 Total Growth Capital   30   30           Capitalized Exploration   3   3           Total Capital Expenditure   303   253 Combined Mine and Mill Unit Operating Costs 3   ($/tonne ore  processed)   ($/tonne ore  processed) Manitoba Operations - 777, Lalor and Reed   C$85 - 104   C$80 - 100           Peru Operations - Constancia   US$8.5 - 9.4   US$7.3 - 8.2 Excludes capitalized interest. Original estimated growth capital estimate for Rosemont related to spending during the first half of 2016; revised estimated spending is for the full year 2016. Reflects combined mine and mill costs per tonne of milled ore. Manitoba operating costs are presented in CAD, and include general and administrative (\"G&A\") costs and cost of ore purchased from joint venture partner at Reed mine. Peru operations combined mine and mill unit costs are presented in USD, include G&A costs and reflect the deduction of expected deferred stripping costs. Rosemont spending of $30 million in 2016 is now expected to occur over the full year, rather than the first six months. This amount is expected to be sufficient to advance a definitive feasibility study and the permitting process, and, upon receipt of permits, complete a mine plan of operations. Peru Operations Review During the fourth quarter of 2015, mining operations continued as planned and cost optimization is underway. Equipment availabilities are within design parameters, and both loading and hauling efficiencies remain consistent with expectations. Optimization of plant performance remains the primary focus, as more is understood about varying ore types. During the fourth quarter of 2015, shipments of copper concentrate from the Constancia mine to the port in Matarani increased with improved trucking capacity, resulting in significant inventory drawdown. The approximate concentrate inventory levels in Peru, including the mine site and port inventories, decreased from 74,000 dmt at the end of the third quarter of 2015, including 65,000 dmt at the mine, to a normal working level of approximately 28,000 dmt at the end of the fourth quarter, including 11,000 dmt at the mine. All of the excess copper concentrate was sold by year-end. Expansion at the port of Matarani is nearing completion, and initial shipments from the new \"Pier F\" facility began in mid-February 2016. Completion of the new facility is expected to alleviate port congestion as other mines ramp-up production. Constancia's production in the first quarter of 2016 is expected to be affected by the planned replacement of the trunnions on both the SAG and ball mills on one of the two grinding circuits. The trunnions were damaged due to a lubrication failure during the commissioning period, and the affected line is expected to be shut down at the end of February to begin an estimated six to eight week outage to replace the trunnions, during which the second grinding circuit should continue to operate normally. In 2015, metal production at Constancia was within the guidance range, and combined operating costs per tonne were below the guidance range. Manitoba Operations Review Ore production at the Manitoba mines for the fourth quarter of 2015 increased by 31% compared to the same period in 2014 primarily as a result of increased production from the main production shaft at the Lalor mine. Production in the fourth quarter of 2014 at the 777 mine was also impacted by an unscheduled two-week shutdown of the production shaft. Copper and gold grades in the fourth quarter of 2015 were lower compared with the grades in the fourth quarter of 2014 by 23% and 12%, respectively, and zinc and silver grades were higher by 46% and 2%, respectively, due to stope sequencing. Unit operating costs for the fourth quarter of 2015 declined by 4% compared to the same period in 2014 as a result of increased production at 777 and reduced operating costs at the Reed mine. Ore processed in Flin Flon in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 13% higher, while ore processed in Snow Lake was 39% higher compared to the same period in 2014 as a result of higher production at 777 and Lalor. Grades varied as a result of normal mine sequencing. Recoveries in Flin Flon were generally consistent in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 with the exception of zinc. Zinc recoveries in 2014 were impacted by lower mine head grades. In Snow Lake, copper, gold, and silver recoveries in the fourth quarter of 2015 were higher by 35%, 10% and 11%, respectively, as a result of achieving steady operations at Lalor and optimization of the copper circuit. Unit costs for the Flin Flon and Snow Lake concentrators decreased by 15% and 22%, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 as a result of increased production. In the fourth quarter of 2015, Manitoba's combined mine/mill unit operating cost decreased by 6%, compared to the same period in 2014, due to increased production. For the fourth quarter of 2015, production of copper and gold remained consistent compared to the same period last year, while zinc and silver increased by 69% and 35%, respectively, as a result of increased production at Lalor and increased zinc and silver grades at both the 777 and Reed mines. In 2015, production of all metals increased compared to 2014 as a result of increased production at Lalor and increased copper grades at Reed. Production of all metals and unit operating costs were within guidance ranges. Impairments During the fourth quarter of 2015, Hudbay recognized an after-tax impairment of $198.8 million ($264.4 million pre-tax) on Constancia goodwill and property, plant and equipment as a result of lower expected copper prices. In addition, a pre-tax and after-tax impairment of $114.5 million was recognized on Rosemont goodwill mainly as a result of lower expected copper prices and an expected delay in the start of construction on the Rosemont project. Engineering and permitting activities at Rosemont are progressing in accordance with expectations. Hudbay remains committed to advancing Rosemont, which is expected to be one of the first new copper projects to be built once copper prices and capital market conditions improve. The impairment analyses for Constancia and Rosemont assumed copper prices of $2.25/lb in 2016 and 2017, increasing to $3.00/lb in 2019 and thereafter. Real discount rates of 8.00% and 9.75% were applied for Constancia and Rosemont, respectively. The underlying operating assumptions in the impairment models were substantially the same as those used in the September 30, 2015 impairment tests. Other Recent Developments Effective January 1, 2016, Alan Hair became President and Chief Executive Officer, replacing David Garofalo, who announced his resignation in early December 2015. Mr. Hair has twenty years of experience with Hudbay and has worked in the mining industry for more than three decades. He previously served as Hudbay's Chief Operating Officer from 2012 to 2015, a role that is now held by Cashel Meagher. Mr. Meagher was previously Vice President, South America Business Unit from 2011 to 2015, where he led the successful construction and ramp-up of the Constancia operation. Hudbay declared a semi-annual dividend of C$0.01 per share on February 24, 2016. The dividend will be paid on March 31, 2016 to shareholders of record as of March 11, 2016. Non-IFRS Financial Performance Measures Operating cash flow per share and cash cost per pound of copper produced are included in this news release because the company believes that, in the case of operating cash flow per share, it helps investors and management to evaluate changes in cash flow while taking into account changes in shares outstanding, and in the case of cash cost per pound of copper produced, it helps investors assess the performance of the company's operations. These measures do not have a meaning prescribed by IFRS and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with IFRS and are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under IFRS. Other companies may calculate these measures differently. Operating cash flow per share The following table presents Hudbay's calculation of operating cash flow per share for the three months and years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014: $000s except shares and per share amounts)   Three Months Ended December 31   Year Ended December 31     2015   2014   2015   2014 Operating cash flow before stream deposit and change in non-cash working capital   106,305   (1,990)   222,140   16,771                   Weighted average shares outstanding - basic   235,231,688   233,631,382   234,675,080   209,023,666 Operating cash flow per share1 ($)   0.45   (0.01)   0.95   0.08 Operating cash flow per share is before stream deposit and change in non-cash working capital. It is a non-IFRS financial performance measure with no standardized meaning under IFRS. Reconciliation of Cash Cost, After By-product Credits (non-IFRS) to Cost of Sales (IFRS) Cash cost per pound of copper produced (\"cash cost\") is a non-IFRS measure that management uses as a key performance indicator to assess the performance of the company's operations. Hudbay's calculation designates copper as its primary metal of production as it has been, and is expected to be, the largest component of revenues. Two changes have been made to the cash cost calculation beginning with reporting for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015. First, the basis of measurement has been changed from pounds of copper sold to pounds of copper produced. This change has been made to better align the costs of production with copper produced in the same period and reduce the variation in cash cost due to inventory sales timing. Second, royalties have been removed from the cash cost. This change increases consistency between Hudbay's cash cost calculation and industry peers. The calculation is presented in two manners: Cash cost, before by-product credits - This measure is gross of by-product revenues and is a function of the efforts and costs incurred to mine and process all ore mined. However, the measure divides this aggregate cost over only pounds of copper produced, Hudbay's primary metal of production. This measure is generally less volatile from period to period, as it is not affected by changes in the price received for by-product metals. It is, however, significantly affected by the relative mix of copper concentrate and finished zinc production, and an increase in production of zinc metal will tend to result in an increase in cash cost under this measure. Cash cost, net of by-product credits - In order to calculate the cost to produce and sell copper, the net of by-product credits measure subtracts the revenues realized from the sale of the metals other than copper. The by-product revenues from zinc, gold, silver, and molybdenum are significant and are integral to the economics of Hudbay's operations. The economics that support Hudbay's decision to produce and sell copper would be different if the company did not receive revenues from the other significant metals being extracted and processed. This measure provides management and investors with an indication of the minimum copper price consistent with positive operating cash flows and operating margins, assuming that realized by-product metal prices are consistent with those prevailing during the reporting period. It also serves as an important operating statistic that management and investors utilize to measure Hudbay's operating performance versus that of its competitors. However, it is important to understand that if by-product metal prices decline alongside copper prices, the cash cost net of by-product credits would increase, requiring a higher copper price than that reported to maintain positive cash flows and operating margins. The tables below summarize consolidated cash cost in addition to reconciliations between cash cost, after by-product credits, to the most comparable GAAP measures of cost of sales for the three months and years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Cash cost, net of by-product credits per pound of copper produced, may not calculate based on amounts presented in the tables below due to rounding.

Lundin Mining Corporation (LUN: TSX) Lundin Mining is a diversified base metals producer. Our corporate goals include development of a high performance, motivated culture, achieving a safe, productive and healthy work environment, and to conduct our business activities ethically and transparently. Lundin Mining follows an annual reporting cycle and reports its Health, Safety, Environmental and Community performance using the reporting framework of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), including the G3 Guidelines and the Mining and Metals Sector Supplement. FEB 18, 2016 Lundin Mining Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results TORONTO, ONTARIO--(Marketwired - Feb. 18, 2016) - Lundin Mining Corporation (\"Lundin Mining\" or the \"Company\") (TSX:LUN)(OMX:LUMI) today reported positive cash flows of $107.1 million generated from operations in the quarter and $713.9 million for the year, not including the Company's attributable cash flows related to Tenke Fungurume, which aggregated to an additional $32.9 million in 2015. As a result of a significant decline of metal prices, a number of asset impairments were taken which result in a net loss attributable to Lundin shareholders of $377.7 million ($0.52 per share) for the quarter and $294.1 million ($0.41 per share) for the year ended December 31, 2015. Net loss for the quarter and the year included a non-cash, after-tax impairment charge of $278.0 million ($0.39 per share) as short-term metal prices negatively impacted estimated net recoverable values of our operating assets and exploration properties. Mr. Paul Conibear, President and CEO commented, \"For 2015 we are very pleased to have generated the highest cash flow in our Company's history. With all of our operations achieving or exceeding their annual production guidance and continuing to generate robust margins, the Company has been able to further improve its strong financial position despite the current commodity price environment. As we progress through 2016 and beyond, we intend to maintain our focus on consistent high performance of our operations, which are capable of providing positive margins at current metal prices, and disciplined capital investment, contributing to preservation of a healthy balance sheet.\" Three months ended Twelve months ended December 31, December 31, US$ Millions (except per share amounts) 2015 2014 2015 2014 Sales 316.0 443.0 1,701.9 951.3 Operating earnings1 101.0 144.1 712.1 304.3 Net (loss) / earnings (383.5 ) 36.6 (281.8 ) 123.4 Net (loss) / earnings attributable to Lundin shareholders (377.7 ) 25.8 (294.1 ) 112.6 Basic and diluted (loss) / earnings per share (0.52 ) 0.04 (0.41 ) 0.19 Cash flow from operations 107.1 68.4 713.9 187.4 Ending net debt position2 441.3 829.2 441.3 829.2 Operating earnings is a non-GAAP measure defined as sales, less operating costs (excluding depreciation) and general and administrative costs. Net debt is a non-GAAP measure defined as cash and cash equivalents, less long-term debt and finance leases, before deferred financing fees. Highlights Operational Performance For 2015, all of the Company's operations met or performed better than guidance on production, but financial results were negatively impacted by a lower metal price environment. Aggregate capital spending was well below guidance as a result of proactive spending restraint measures adopted in stages to react to declining metal markets. Candelaria (80%): The Candelaria operations produced, on a 100% basis, 181,040 tonnes of copper, approximately 1,874,000 ounces of silver, and 102,500 ounces of gold in concentrate, with copper and gold production exceeding expectations as a result of higher throughput. Copper cash costs1 of $1.25/lb for the year were lower than full year guidance of $1.35/lb. Eagle (100%): Eagle's operational results were excellent, with both nickel (27,167 tonnes) and copper (24,331 tonnes) production exceeding guidance. Nickel cash costs of $2.02/lb for the year were in-line with guidance of $2.00/lb. Neves-Corvo (100%): Neves-Corvo produced 55,831 tonnes of copper and 61,921 tonnes of zinc for the year ended December 31, 2015. Copper production exceeded the prior year by 9% due to higher average copper head grades and recoveries. Zinc production fell short of the prior year comparable period resulting from lower mill throughput and lower zinc recoveries. Significant improvements were achieved in stabilizing the existing zinc plant resulting in improved recoveries in the fourth quarter. Copper cash costs of $1.63/lb for the year were in-line with our latest full-year guidance ($1.60/lb) and were lower than the prior year of $1.85/lb. Zinkgruvan (100%): Zinc production of 83,451 tonnes at Zinkgruvan was a new record, exceeding prior year production due primarily to record tonnages of ore mined and milled. Lead production of 34,120 tonnes exceeded both expectations and 2014 production. Cash costs for zinc of $0.37/lb were lower than guidance ($0.40/lb) and in-line with the prior year ($0.37/lb). Aguablanca (100%): Aguablanca met production expectations for the year, though current year production of 7,213 tonnes of nickel and 6,221 tonnes of copper were lower than the prior year due to cessation of open pit mining in the first quarter and the suspension of underground mining operations in the third quarter of 2015. Cash costs of $2.72/lb of nickel for 2015 were slightly higher than full year guidance ($2.60/lb) due to the lower by-product credits. Tenke (24%): Tenke operations continue to perform well. Lundin's attributable share of annual production included 48,951 tonnes of copper cathode and 3,843 tonnes of cobalt in hydroxide. The Company's attributable share of sales included 50,826 tonnes of copper at an average realized price of $2.42/lb and 3,809 tonnes of cobalt at an average realized price of $8.21/lb. Tenke operating cash costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $1.21/lb of copper sold, higher than the latest guidance due to lower cobalt by-product credits. Cash distributions received by Lundin Mining in the year from Tenke were $24.6 million, slightly higher than expectations. An additional $8.3 million was received from the Freeport Cobalt operations, for total Tenke related distributions to the Company of $32.9 million for the year. Cash cost/lb of copper, zinc and nickel are non-GAAP measures defined as all cash costs directly attributable to mining operations, less royalties and by-product credits. Financial Performance Operating earnings for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $712.1 million, an increase of $407.8 million in comparison to the $304.3 million reported in 2014. The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of operating results from Candelaria ($383.4 million) and Eagle ($100.1 million) and favourable foreign exchange rates in the EUR and SEK ($74.8 million), partially offset by lower realized metal prices and price adjustments ($173.9 million) from our European operations. Sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $1,701.9 million, an increase of $750.6 million in comparison to the $951.3 million reported in 2014. The increase was mainly due to the inclusion of a full year of operating results from Candelaria ($692.9 million) and Eagle ($236.7 million), partially offset by lower realized metal prices and price adjustments from our European operations. Average London Metal Exchange (\"LME\") metal prices for copper, nickel and zinc were lower (20%, 30%, and 11%, respectively) in comparison to 2014. Operating costs (excluding depreciation) for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $962.7 million, an increase of $343.0 million in comparison to the $619.7 million reported in 2014. The increase was largely due to the inclusion of a full year of operating results from Candelaria and Eagle of $309.5 million and $136.6 million, respectively, partially offset by favourable foreign exchange rates. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $555.0 million, an increase of $346.3 million in comparison to the $208.7 million reported in 2014. The increase was attributable to the inclusion of a full year of operating results from Candelaria and Eagle of $238.2 million and $122.3 million, respectively. Cash flow from operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $713.9 million, an increase of $526.5 million in comparison to the $187.4 million reported in 2014. The increase was attributable to: a full year of operating earnings from Candelaria, net of deferred revenue recognized ($336.5 million), and Eagle ($100.1 million); and changes in non-cash working capital and long-term inventory ($226.6 million); partly offset by lower operating earnings at our European operations ($74.8 million); and higher net income taxes paid ($49.3 million). Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $281.8 million, a decrease of $405.2 million in comparison to net earnings of $123.4 million reported in 2014. Net losses were primarily a result of asset impairments connected to lower metal prices, as cost and production performance at mine operations met or exceeded expectations. Before the impact of impairments (net of tax), net loss for the current year was $3.8 million, compared with net earnings of $155.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Net loss, before asset impairments, was impacted by: net loss at Neves-Corvo and lower net income at Zinkgruvan largely due to lower metal prices ($55.4 million); and net loss at Eagle generated from a full year of operation in a poor economic environment ($32.1 million) and write-down of deferred tax assets ($22.9 million); and lower operating earnings from Aguablanca ($22.0 million), partially due to the suspension of underground mining operations in the third quarter; and full year of interest expense associated with the senior secured notes ($62.8 million); and lower income from investment in Tenke ($63.4 million); partly offset by a full year of operations at Candelaria ($106.9 million). Corporate Highlights On June 2, 2015, the Company announced that exploration drilling near the Eagle Mine had intersected a new zone of high-grade massive and semi-massive nickel-copper sulphide mineralization. On July 23, 2015, the Company announced approval of its Environmental Impact Assessment (\"EIA\") for Candelaria 2030, an initiative which includes a number of enhancements to support current and future operations, primarily the construction of the Los Diques tailings storage facility which represents an important step in extending the life of mine of the Candelaria operation. On July 29, 2015, the Company announced the completion of an updated mine plan and annual sustaining capital cost estimate for Candelaria. The new plan is expected to result in an improved production and operating cost profile over the next four year period. On January 28, 2016, the Company advised local authorities and employees of its intention to permanently close the Aguablanca mine. The closure was originally scheduled for early 2018. The decision to close the Aguablanca mine was due to the significant and sustained decrease in nickel and copper prices. Financial Position and Financing Net debt position at December 31, 2015 was $441.3 million compared to $829.2 million at December 31, 2014. The $387.9 million decrease in net debt during the year was attributable to operating cash flows of $713.9 million and distributions from Tenke and Freeport Cobalt of $32.9 million, partially offset by investments in mineral properties, plant and equipment of $277.7 million and interest paid on the senior secured notes of $77.5 million. The Company has a revolving credit facility available for borrowing up to $350 million. As at December 31, 2015, the Company had no amount drawn on the credit facility. A letter of credit in the amount of $19.4 million (SEK 162 million) is outstanding. Net debt as of February 18, 2016 was approximately $458 million. Outlook Market Conditions The Company is advancing production optimizations, cost savings and cost deferrals that are expected to protect cash flows and profits in 2016 and which are reflected in the guidance outlined below. To the extent that base metals markets improve, spending restraint plans will be re-assessed as certain expenditures and deferrals would be reconsidered in a moderately stronger metal price environment. 2016 Production and Cost Guidance With the exception of Tenke, production and costs guidance remains unchanged from that provided on January 21, 2016 (see news release entitled \"Lundin Mining Announces 2015 Production Results and Provides Operating and Capital Guidance\"). Guidance on Tenke's copper production and cash costs have been updated to reflect the most recent guidance from Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (\"Freeport\"). (contained tonnes) Tonnes Cash Costsa Copper Candelaria (80%) 118,000 - 123,000 $1.55/lb Eagle 20,000 - 23,000 Neves-Corvo 50,000 - 55,000 $1.65/lb Zinkgruvan 3,500 - 4,000 Tenke (24%)b 54,000 $1.32/lb Total attributable 245,500 - 259,000 Nickel Eagle 21,000 - 24,000 $2.25/lb Zinc Neves-Corvo 65,000 - 70,000 Zinkgruvan 80,000 - 85,000 $0.45/lb Total 145,000 - 155,000 Cash costs remain dependent upon exchange rates (forecast at EUR/USD:1.10, USD/SEK:8.50, USD/CLP:700) and metal prices (forecast at Cu: $2.05/lb, Ni: $4.15/lb, Zn: $0.70/lb, Pb: $0.70/lb, Au: $1,100/oz, Ag: $15.00/oz). Freeport has provided 2016 sales and cash costs guidance. Tenke's 2016 production is assumed to approximate sales guidance. Tenke's 2016 cash costs assume a cobalt price of $10.00/lb. Commentary on 2016 Production Guidance by Mine Candelaria: Attributable share of Candelaria production is expected to decline modestly from 2015 production levels, which benefited from better rock fragmentation and softer ore. Gold and silver production are expected to remain as significant by-product credits. Eagle: Consistent with original plans, year over year production levels of nickel and copper are expected to gradually decline as the highest grade ore is mined early in the mine plan. Neves-Corvo: Copper production is expected to be maintained above 50,000 tonnes per annum with a significant zinc by-product credit. The zinc expansion project has not been reflected in this outlook. Lead by-products are expected to increase as Lombador zinc ore is mined. Zinkgruvan: Planned expansion activities were initiated in 2015, but are not expected to impact production until the end of 2017. Tenke: Freeport expects 2016 copper cathode sales of 224,500 tonnes, an increase of about 10% over 2015 production. Cobalt sales are expected to remain relatively unchanged at 15,900 tonnes. 2016 Capital Expenditure Guidance Capital expenditures, excluding capitalized interest, are expected to be $220 million (excluding Tenke), lower than the $275 million of capital expenditures in 2015, as part of on-going efforts to defer or reduce non-essential spending as long as base metal prices remain low. Sustaining Capital: Americas: $130 million ($179 million in 2015), consisting of approximately $120 million for Candelaria, of which approximately $35 million is for capitalized stripping activities in the open pit, $70 million for construction of the expanded tailings storage facility project, and $15 million for replacement and rebuild of equipment and infrastructure, and $10 million for Eagle which is predominantly for underground development. Europe: $82 million ($86 million in 2015). Neves-Corvo's $55 million capital spending program includes approximately $20 million for underground development, $12 million for commencement of a water treatment plant, $10 million for replacement and rebuild of equipment and the balance for miscellaneous other sustaining capital investment and small projects. Zinkgruvan is expected to spend approximately $15 million for underground development and $12 million on expanded tailings storage and miscellaneous other sustaining capital investment and small projects. New Investment: $8 million ($10 million in 2015) for a processing plant expansion at Zinkgruvan. Exploration Investment The Company's exploration expenditures (not including Tenke) are expected to be in the range of $40 million in 2016 (2015 - $52 million). The majority of the planned activity is expected to be directed towards near mine targets at Candelaria and Eagle. Tenke The Company estimates its share of sustaining capital funding for 2016 at $25 million ($67 million in 2015). All of Tenke's capital expenditures and exploration programs are expected to be self-funded by cash flow from operations. At current metal prices, the Company believes it is reasonable to expect Lundin Mining's attributable cash distributions to range between $30 to $40 million in 2016, taking into account self-funding of capital and other expenditures such as exploration. Final decisions on capital investments and the amounts and timing of any cash distributions for 2016 are ultimately made by Freeport, the mine's operator.

Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc. (TSE: POT) Who we are PotashCorp is the world's largest fertilizer company by capacity, producing the three primary crop nutrients: potash (K), nitrogen (N) and phosphate (P). We are the world's leading potash producer by capacity and our Canadian operations represent nearly one-fifth of global capacity1. To enhance our global footprint, we also have investments in four potash-related businesses in South America, the Middle East and Asia. With operations and business interests in seven countries, PotashCorp is an international enterprise and plays an important role in helping the world grow the food it needs. What we produce Our potash, phosphate and nitrogen products help provide the primary nutrients that crops need. They are also used to make livestock feeds and industrial goods. Produced from mineral deposits (potash and phosphate) and from the air we breathe (nitrogen), our main products are: potash, in standard and granular grades DAP (diammonium phosphate), MAP (monoammonium phosphate) and phosphoric acid Ammonia and urea Why fertilizer? With world population rising, arable land per person diminishing and demand increasing for higher quality diets that include more fruits and vegetables and protein from crop-fed livestock, the need to maximize the efficiency of farmland has never been greater. Every crop harvested removes nutrients from the soil, which must be replaced to keep soil healthy and productive. Responsible for more than 40 percent of the world's total crop yield, fertilizers feed plants, which help to feed animals and people. Where we serve Our products serve customers throughout the global marketplace from China, the world's most populous nation and largest fertilizer consumer, to India, with its 1.2 billion people. From Latin America an agricultural superpower to the rice and oil palm producing fields of Other Asian countries and the breadbasket markets of North America. Together these five regions account for nearly three-quarters of the world's population and roughly 80 percent of the total fertilizer consumption. Delivering when we're needed As the world's food challenges become more pressing, we're taking an active role in meeting them, investing heavily in our assets to deliver quality product when and where our customers need it. We are adding to our current potash capacity without building a new mine - an advantage as demand is expected to rise. And through our partnerships and investments, we strive to better serve customers in emerging markets. How we do business We hold ourselves to the highest business standards and consider factors beyond financial performance when evaluating our success. Guided by our Core Values, we cultivate mutually beneficial relationships with our communities, customers, employees, investors and other people critical to our success. Acting with a long-term view, we make decisions that consider people and the planet, always looking for opportunities to improve. 28 January 2016 Q4 & Year-End: PotashCorp Reports Full-Year 2015 Earnings of $1.52 per Share Key Highlights Fourth-quarter earnings of $0.24 per share1; full-year total of $1.52 per share Annual cash provided by operating activities of $2.3 billion Indefinite suspension of Picadilly, New Brunswick potash operation in January 2016 Quarterly dividend reduced by 34 percent to $0.25 per share Full-year 2016 guidance of $0.90-$1.20 per share; $0.10-$0.20 for the first quarter CEO Commentary \"Weaker fertilizer prices late in the year reduced our earnings for the quarter, giving rise to a more cautious outlook for all three nutrients as we begin 2016,\" said PotashCorp President and Chief Executive Officer Jochen Tilk. \"Against this backdrop, our focus has been not only to navigate these challenges but to further strengthen our company for the future by: supporting our longstanding potash business model, including matching supply to demand; enhancing our best-in-class assets; and protecting our long-term financial health and flexibility. \"We made the very difficult decisions to suspend potash production in New Brunswick and realign our dividend. These actions are part of our thoughtful and holistic approach to strategically position the company and balance the interests of our shareholders, debtholders, employees and communities who depend on our enduring success. Longer term, we maintain our conviction that the drivers of fertilizer demand - rising global crop production and supportive farmer economics - will support improved market conditions.\" Saskatoon, Saskatchewan - Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc. (PotashCorp) reported fourth-quarter earnings of $0.24 per share ($201 million), bringing earnings for the full year to $1.52 per share ($1.3 billion). These totals for the quarter and full year trailed the $0.49 per share ($407 million) and $1.82 per share ($1.5 billion) earned in the same periods of 2014. Gross margin for the quarter ($386 million) and the year ($2.3 billion) was below 2014 levels ($746 million and $2.6 billion, respectively), due primarily to weaker nitrogen prices and lower potash volumes. Cash from operating activities of $623 million for the quarter and $2.3 billion for the year was below 2014 results by 13 percent and 11 percent, respectively. Quarterly and annual earnings before finance costs, income taxes and depreciation and amortization (EBITDA)2 of $482 million and $2.6 billion, respectively, were also lower than in the comparable periods of 2014. Investments in Arab Potash Company (APC) in Jordan, Israel Chemicals Ltd. (ICL) in Israel and Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile S.A. (SQM) in Chile contributed $27 million to our quarterly earnings, trailing the $31 million generated in the fourth quarter of 2014. Our earnings for the year from these three investments - plus a dividend from Sinofert Holdings Limited (Sinofert) in China - totaled $162 million, below the $210 million earned in 2014, which included a special dividend from ICL. The market value of our investments in these four publicly traded companies was approximately $3.5 billion, or $4 per PotashCorp share, at market close on January 27, 2016. Market Conditions Challenging conditions, including currency weakness relative to the US dollar in emerging markets, continued to weigh on fertilizer markets through the fourth quarter. Cautious buying patterns resulted in deteriorating prices across all three nutrients as the year ended. Global potash shipments for the fourth quarter remained relatively flat compared to 2014, with increased deliveries to China offsetting slightly weaker demand in most other markets. Nitrogen markets continued to feel the effects of falling energy prices. Lower production costs in key producing regions increased competitive supply, which - combined with a weaker-than-normal fall application season in the US and slower demand in Brazil - caused prices for nearly all nitrogen products to trend lower during the quarter. In phosphate, record Chinese exports, seasonally slow demand in India and the US and continued caution in Brazil weighed on prices for solid fertilizers. Prices for feed, industrial, and liquid fertilizer products were more resilient, supported by strong demand and tighter supply. Potash Reduced sales volumes and a softening price environment - particularly in the second half of 2015 - resulted in gross margin of $183 million for the quarter and $1.3 billion for the year, below 2014's comparative totals of $445 million and $1.4 billion, respectively. Sales volumes for both the quarter (down 31 percent) and the year (down 6 percent) trailed those achieved in the same periods of 2014. The most significant decline for both the quarter and full year was in North America, which reflected a pullback in demand from 2014's especially strong levels, as well as increased competition. Offshore, the majority of Canpotex's3 shipments for the quarter were to China (40 percent) and Other Asian markets outside of China and India (30 percent), while Latin America and India accounted for 18 percent and 4 percent, respectively. Our average realized potash price for the quarter was $238 per tonne, down considerably from $284 per tonne in the same period last year, reflecting the declining price environment in 2015. Inventory-related shutdowns at our Saskatchewan mines and the closure of our Penobsquis, New Brunswick operation reduced production volumes and resulted in per-tonne cost of goods sold for the quarter of $132, which was 26 percent higher than in the comparable period in 2014. For the year, per-tonne cost of goods sold of $111 was relatively flat with the previous year as the favorable impact of a weaker Canadian dollar was offset primarily by increased shutdown weeks. Nitrogen In nitrogen, weaker prices had a negative impact on our results for the fourth quarter and the full year. Gross margin of $142 million for the quarter and $706 million for the year trailed results from the same periods in 2014 by 39 percent and 30 percent, respectively. Our US operations accounted for 61 percent of our nitrogen gross margin for the quarter, with Trinidad providing the remainder. Sales volumes of 1.6 million tonnes for the quarter were similar to those in the same period of 2014. Extended expansion-related downtime, coupled with weaker demand, resulted in sales volumes for 2015 of 5.9 million tonnes, down 7 percent from the previous year. Our average realized price of $288 per tonne during the quarter was down significantly from the $405 per tonne achieved in the same period last year as lower energy costs and increased global supply weighed heavily on prices for all nitrogen products. Cost of goods sold for the fourth quarter was $199 per tonne, down 21 percent from 2014, driven largely by lower natural gas costs in the US and Trinidad. Phosphate Gross margin for the quarter totaled $61 million, down slightly from the $67 million earned during the same period last year, due to lower sales volumes and price realizations. For the year, we generated $241 million, up from the $202 million earned in 2014, primarily due to increased prices for liquid fertilizers. For the quarter, sales volumes of 0.8 million tonnes were relatively flat compared to the same period in 2014, while volumes for the year of 2.9 million tonnes trailed 2014, due primarily to the absence of production from the Suwannee River chemical plant. Our average realized phosphate price for the fourth quarter of $522 per tonne was similar to 2014's as improved prices for liquid fertilizers offset declining prices for DAP and MAP. Per-tonne cost of goods sold was $443 for the quarter, similar to last year. Financial Provincial mining and other taxes of $46 million for the quarter were lower than the $82 million in the same period last year, due to weaker potash earnings. For the year, provincial mining and other taxes totaled $310 million, 21 percent more than in 2014 because of a weaker Canadian dollar and changes in the timing of allowable deductions within Saskatchewan's potash taxation regulations. Income tax expense for the fourth quarter ($69 million) and full year ($451 million) was down from the same periods last year due primarily to lower earnings. Potash Market Outlook We expect global potash shipments in the range of 59-62 million tonnes, in line with 2015's total of approximately 60 million tonnes. In North America, lower dealer inventories and significant nutrient requirements following consecutive years of large crops are expected to support growth of potash shipments in 2016 to a range of 9.2-9.7 million tonnes In Latin America, we expect agronomic need and favorable crop economics to keep demand at elevated levels, although credit availability and currency weakness are anticipated to keep growth in this market relatively modest. For the full year, we forecast shipments of 10.8-11.3 million tonnes, slightly above 2015 levels. In China, elevated inventories are likely to keep demand below 2015's record of more than 15.0 million tonnes. We anticipate shipments in the range of 13.5-14.5 million tonnes, with strong consumption trends for bulk blends and compound fertilizers continuing. Demand in India is expected to strengthen in 2016. We forecast deliveries of 4.2-4.7 million tonnes to this market, a slight increase from 2015 when a weak monsoon and currency issues reduced demand late in the year. In Other Asian markets, supportive crop economics and substantial agronomic need are expected to keep demand fairly robust in 2016. We anticipate deliveries in the range of 8.5-8.8 million tonnes, slightly above 2015 levels. Financial Outlook Based on these market factors, we anticipate our 2016 potash sales volumes will be in the range of 8.3-9.1 million tonnes. For the year, we forecast potash gross margin of $0.8-$1.1 billion, down significantly from 2015 as the sharp decline in potash prices through the second half of that year is expected to weigh on margins in 2016. Our guidance reflects the suspension of our Picadilly potash operations announced in mid-January, including favorable impacts on our cost of goods sold of $40-$50 million and reduced capital expenditures of $50 million. The company has concluded that the announced change will not result in any impairment charges although our guidance does reflect approximately $35 million in severance and transition costs expected to be recorded in the first quarter of 2016. In nitrogen, we expect improved operating rates at our US facilities and our recently completed Lima nitrogen expansion to increase our sales volumes in 2016. Despite higher sales volumes and reduced costs from lower natural gas prices, a weaker pricing environment - driven by an increase in competitive supply - is expected to result in considerably lower gross margin. In phosphate, we anticipate weaker market fundamentals will keep prices for most products below 2015 levels, although our historically more stable feed and industrial products are forecast to be less impacted. We expect lower input costs and our focus on improved reliability will reduce costs and increase the amount of product available for sale, which we anticipate will help keep gross margin at a level similar to 2015. Given these considerations, we forecast combined nitrogen and phosphate gross margin will be in the range of $0.7-$0.9 billion in 2016. We estimate provincial mining and other taxes in the range of 22-24 percent of potash gross margin, similar to the 2015 percentage. Based on these factors, we forecast full-year 2016 earnings of $0.90-$1.20 per share, including first-quarter earnings of $0.10-$0.20 per share. Our quarterly guidance reflects the severance and transition charges related to the suspension of production at Picadilly and an expectation of some potash demand being deferred to the second quarter. Other annual guidance numbers - including those noted above - are outlined in the table below. 2016 Guidance Earnings per share Annual: $0.90-$1.20 Q1: $0.10-$0.20 Potash sales volumes 8.3-9.1 million tonnes Potash gross margin $0.8-$1.1 billion Nitrogen and phosphate gross margin $0.7-$0.9 billion Capital expenditures* $0.8-$0.9 billion Effective tax rate 25-27 percent Provincial mining and other taxes** 22-24 percent Selling and administrative expenses $240-$250 million Finance costs $210-$220 million Income from offshore equity investments*** $120-$140 million Annual Foreign Exchange Rate CDN$1.38 per US$ Annual EPS sensitivity to Foreign Exchange US$ strengthens vs. CDN$ by $0.02 = +$0.01 EPS * Does not include capitalized interest ** As a percentage of potash gross margin *** Includes income from dividends and share of equity earnings Dividend Our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend of US $0.25 per share payable May 3, 2016 to shareholders of record April 12, 2016. \"We are committed to preserving a strong balance sheet and investment-grade credit rating, but also believe in retaining a competitive dividend. In consideration of these objectives, we have decided to reduce our quarterly dividend by 34 percent,\" said Tilk. \"We believe this level - representing a payout ratio of close to 100 percent of 2016 earnings - remains highly competitive and balances the interests of our many stakeholders, including equity and debtholders.\" Notes All references to per-share amounts pertain to diluted net income per share.

On September 24, 2015, the Company announced that it had received Notices of Reassessment from the Canada Revenue Agency (the \"CRA\") for the 2005 to 2010 taxation years (the \"Relevant Taxation Years\"). Subsequent to the quarter, Silver Wheaton filed notices of objection for each of the Relevant Taxation Years. Asset Highlights Salobo had record attributable production of almost 33,000 ounces of gold net to Silver Wheaton in Q3, and the ongoing ramp-up continues to be on track to achieve 100% utilization in Q4 2015. Record attributable production from Penasquito. Record sale volume from San Dimas. Events Subsequent to the Quarter Silver Wheaton agreed to acquire from a subsidiary of Glencore Plc (\"Glencore\") an amount of silver equal to 33.75% of the silver production until delivery of 140 million ounces of silver and 22.5% of the silver production thereafter for the life of mine from the Antamina mine for an upfront cash consideration of US$900 million and ongoing payments of 20% of spot price per silver ounce delivered. \"Silver Wheaton hit record production for a third consecutive quarter, as the company produced 11 million silver equivalent ounces in the third quarter alone. Our cornerstone assets delivered solid results with Penasquito and Salobo setting new production records. With over 32 million ounces produced year to date, we remain well on track to deliver on our original production growth guidance of over 20% in 2015,\" said Randy Smallwood, President and Chief Executive Officer of Silver Wheaton. \"Clearly, not everything has been smooth sailing, as we have also faced persistently low commodity prices, along with the receipt of the Notices of Reassessment from the CRA. I once again want to reiterate our confidence in our structure and that we will vigorously defend our tax filing position; as such, we have filed notices of objections with the CRA in regards to the Reassessments.\" \"While our cornerstone operations have performed exceptionally well, we did take an impairment charge on 777 in the third quarter due to lack of exploration success combined with lower commodity prices. While the low commodity price environment has had its challenges, it has also created some great opportunities. This is clearly evidenced by the announcement of our acquisition of a silver stream on Antamina, one of the lowest cost, largest copper mines in the world. Antamina is an ideal asset for Silver Wheaton, one that readily fits in to our portfolio of top tier assets.\" Financial Review Revenues Revenue was $153.3 million in the third quarter of 2015, on silver equivalent sales of 10.2 million ounces (6.6 million ounces of silver and 48,100 ounces of gold). This represents an 8% decrease from the $165.9 million of revenue generated in the third quarter of 2014 due primarily to a 21% decrease in the average realized silver equivalent price ($15.03 in Q3 2015 compared with $18.98 in Q3 2014), partially offset by a 17% increase in the number of silver equivalent ounces sold. Costs and Expenses Average cash costs1 in the third quarter of 2015 were $4.58 per silver equivalent ounce as compared with $4.59 during the comparable period of 2014. This resulted in a cash operating margin1 of $10.45 per silver equivalent ounce, a reduction of 27% as compared with Q3 2014. The decrease in the cash operating margin was primarily due to a 21% decrease in the average realized silver equivalent price in Q3 2015 compared with Q3 2014. Earnings and Operating Cash Flows Adjusted net earnings1 and cash flow from operations in the third quarter of 2015 were $49.8 million ($0.12 per share) and $99.5 million ($0.25 per share1), compared with $72.6 million ($0.20 per share) and $120.4 million ($0.34 per share1) for the same period in 2014, a decrease of 31% and 17%, respectively. Earnings and cash flow continued to be impacted by lower gold and silver prices. Balance Sheet At September 30, 2015, the Company had approximately $81 million of cash on hand and $647 million outstanding under the Company's $2 billionrevolving term loan. On September 18, 2015 the Company announced it had received TSX approval to purchase up to 20,229,671 common shares (representing 5% of the Company's 404,593,425 total issued and outstanding common shares as of September 11, 2015) over a period of twelve months commencing onSeptember 23, 2015. The NCIB will expire no later than September 22, 2016.  During the three months ended September 30, 2015 the Company purchased 119,400 shares under the NCIB at an average price of $12.26 per share.  Subsequent to September 30, 2015, the Company purchased an additional 645,389 shares under the NCIB at an average price of $11.86 per share.  Asset Impairment On August 8, 2012, the Company entered into an agreement with Hudbay Minerals Inc. (\"Hudbay\") to acquire an amount equal to 100% of the silver and gold production from its currently producing 777 mine, located in Canada, until the end of 2016, and 100% of the silver and 50% of the gold production for the remainder of the mine life. During the third quarter of 2015, the Company's management was informed that as a result of an unsuccessful drilling program at 777, Hudbay's management believes that the mine life for 777 is unlikely to be extended beyond 2020.  As a result, during the third quarter of 2015, the estimate of future production from 777 was reduced, with this reduction representing an indicator of impairment related to the 777 silver and gold interests.  At September 30, 2015, Silver Wheaton's management estimated that the recoverable amount under the 777 silver and gold interests was$147.5 million, representing its fair value less cost to sell and resulting in an impairment charge of $154.0 million.     CRA Audit Update On July 6, 2015, the Company announced that it had received a proposal letter (the \"Proposal\") from the CRA in which the CRA was proposing to reassess Silver Wheaton under the transfer pricing provisions contained in the Income Tax Act (Canada) (the \"Act\"). Subsequent to the issuance of the Proposal, on September 24, 2015, the Company announced that it had received Notices of Reassessment (the \"Reassessments\") from the CRA for the 2005 to 2010 taxation years (the \"Relevant Taxation Years\"). The Reassessments are consistent with the Proposal and seek to increase the Company's income subject to tax in Canada for the Relevant Taxation Years by approximately Cdn$715.3 million which would result in federal and provincial tax of approximately Cdn$201.3 million. In addition, the CRA is seeking to impose transfer pricing penalties of approximately Cdn$71.5 million and interest and other penalties of Cdn$80.6 million for the Relevant Taxation Years. Total tax, interest and penalties sought by the CRA for the Relevant Taxation Years isCdn$353.4 million. The CRA's position in the Reassessments is that the transfer pricing provisions of the Act relating to income earned by the Company's foreign subsidiaries outside of Canada should apply such that the income of Silver Wheaton subject to tax in Canada should be increased by substantially all of the income of the Company's foreign subsidiaries. Management believes that the Company has filed its tax returns and paid applicable taxes in compliance with Canadian tax law, and as a result no amounts have been recorded for any potential liability arising from this matter. Silver Wheaton intends to vigorously defend its tax filing positions. As such, subsequent to September 30, 2015, Silver Wheaton has filed notices of objection for each of the Relevant Taxation Years.  The Company will be required to make a deposit of Cdn$176.7 million representing 50% of the reassessed amounts of tax, interest and penalties. Silver Wheaton will seek to post security in the form of a letter of credit for this amount as opposed to a cash deposit. Cash that has been deposited in respect of a reassessment will be refunded, plus interest, if the Company is ultimately successful in challenging that reassessment. Events Subsequent to the Quarter Antamina Subsequent to the quarter, Silver Wheaton, through its wholly owned subsidiary Silver Wheaton (Caymans) Ltd. (\"SWC\"), has agreed to acquire fromAnani Investments Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Glencore plc (\"Glencore\") an amount of silver equal to 33.75% of the silver production until delivery of 140 million ounces of silver and 22.5% of silver production thereafter for the life of mine silver production from the Antamina mine, located in Peru. SWC will pay Glencore cash consideration of US$900 million for the silver stream. In addition, SWC will make ongoing payments of 20% of spot price per silver ounce delivered. The silver stream is effective September 30, 2015, and as a result, production and sales attributable to Silver Wheaton are forecast for the fourth quarter of 2015. Silver production is expected to average 4.7 million ounces per year over the first 20 years. Closing of the transaction is expected to occur prior to the end of November 2015 and is subject to the completion of certain corporate matters and customary conditions.  (See Silver Wheaton's November 3, 2015 news release for full details.) Third Quarter Asset Highlights During the third quarter of 2015, attributable silver equivalent production was 11.0 million ounces (6.9 million ounces of silver and 54,500 ounces of gold), representing an increase of 24% compared with the third quarter of 2014. Operational highlights for the quarter ended September 30, 2015, are as follows: Salobo In the third quarter of 2015, Salobo produced a record 32,954 ounces of gold attributable to Silver Wheaton, an increase of approximately 216% relative to the third quarter of 2014. This increase was primarily due to the doubling of the percentage of gold that Silver Wheaton is entitled to and the increased throughput as a result of the expansion to 24 million tonnes per annum, which commenced production in mid-2014. According to Vale's third quarter of 2015 production report, the ramp-up of Salobo was weaker than expected in July and August but recovered in September with capacity utilization exceeding 90%. Salobo is expected to achieve 100% capacity utilization in the fourth quarter. Constancia In the third quarter of 2015, Constancia produced approximately 4,341 ounces of gold and 0.7 million ounces of silver attributable to Silver Wheaton as the mine declared commercial production on April 30, 2015, and it continues to ramp-up as expected. Penasquito  In the third quarter of 2015, Penasquito produced a record 2.1 million ounces of silver attributable to Silver Wheaton, an increase of approximately 28% relative to the third quarter of 2014 due to higher grades being mined as substantial mining took place in the heart of the deposit. As disclosed inGoldcorp Inc.'s (\"Goldcorp\") third quarter of 2015 MD&A, construction of the Northern Well Field project remained suspended throughout the third quarter of 2015 due to an illegal blockade by a local community.  Penasquito continues to seek a fair resolution of this matter with the community, while taking steps to enforce its contractual rights. Penasquito is also advancing alternatives for completion of the project without crossing through the affected community lands. Goldcorp believes that there will be timely resolution of this matter to meet the future water needs of Penasquito. The Metallurgical Enhancement Project feasibility study remains on schedule to be completed in early 2016.  San Dimas In the third quarter of 2015, attributable production from San Dimas was 1.4 million ounces of silver, an increase of approximately 22% relative to the third quarter of 2014.2 This growth was primarily due to increased production as a result of the expansion to 2,500 tonnes per day (tpd), which was completed early in 2014, as well as to the sharing threshold increasing to 6 million ounces3, partially offset by the cessation of Goldcorp's four-year obligation to deliver 1.5 million ounces of silver to the Company on August 6, 2014. Silver sales in the third quarter of 2015 from San Dimas were a record 2.0 million ounces, an increase of 72% relative to the third quarter of 20142, as silver inventories built up in the second quarter of 2014 were subsequently sold. As at September 30, 2015, approximately 0.2 million ounces of cumulative payable silver ounces have been produced at San Dimas but not yet delivered to the Company, representing a decrease of 0.6 million payable silver ounces during the third quarter of 2015. As reported by Primero on July 6, 2015, silver deliveries in the second quarter had been delayed due to the suspension of Primero's import and export licenses in May 2015 by the Mexican customs authorities due to a discrepancy over Primero's address related to its corporate office relocation from Mexico City to Durango, Mexico. As per Primero's August 6, 2015, news release, the import and export license was reinstated and normal course imports and exports resumed, including the sales of all inventoried silver. Finally, as per Primero's third quarter of 2015 MD&A, during the third quarter, Primero achieved key milestones at both the San Dimas mine and the mill, tracking towards the completion of its expansion from 2,500 tpd to 3,000 tpd by the accelerated April 2016 completion date. Primero successfully connected the tunnel between the Sinaloa-Graben and Central mining blocks, providing a critical de-bottlenecking in the flow of machinery through theSan Dimas mine. At the San Dimas mill, Primero has completed the construction of foundations for the new secondary crusher and demolition of the old foundry is well advanced. The installation of the additional tailings pump is now complete and control has been handed over to the operations team.  The new tailings filter and thickener are also in the process of fabrication and remain on-schedule for delivery to site in Q1 2016. Sudbury In the third quarter of 2015, attributable gold production from Vale's Sudbury mine was 5,967 ounces, a decrease of approximately 51% relative to the third quarter of 2014.  According to Vale's third quarter of 2015 production report, the decrease was primarily due to planned maintenance shutdowns in the Sudbury surface plants in August 2015. As per Vale, key work completed as part of the shutdown encompassed the rebuild of the SAG mill, the overhaul of the acid plant in preparation for the implementation of the AER project (atmospheric emissions reduction project), and the upgrade of the environmental equipment at the Copper Cliff Nickel Refinery. It should also be noted that production in Q3 2014 was at an elevated level, as Vale processed large inventories of feed stock that had built up in Q2 2014 due to planned maintenance of surface facilities.   Yauliyacu In the third quarter of 2015, attributable silver production from Yauliyacu was 0.7 million ounces, a decrease of approximately 20% relative to the third quarter of 2014, primarily due to lower grade being mined in the quarter. Barrick In the third quarter of 2015, attributable silver production from Barrick was 0.5 million ounces, an increase of approximately 27% relative to the third quarter of 2014, primarily due to higher grades at the Veladero mine and higher recoveries at the Lagunas Norte mine. 777 In the third quarter of 2015, 777 produced approximately 6,330 ounces of gold and 0.1 million ounces of silver attributable to Silver Wheaton, a decrease of approximately 48% and 37%, respectively, relative to the third quarter of 2014 primarily due to lower throughput and grades. Other Minto: In the third quarter of 2015, attributable gold production from Minto was 4,920 ounces, a decrease of approximately 29% relative to the third quarter of 2014, primarily due to lower grade being mined in the quarter.  According to Capstone Mining Corp.'s (\"Capstone\") third quarter production results, the Minto mill processed solely underground and stockpiled ore while transitioning to the next open pit mining area. In addition, Capstone reported that the Yukon Water Board issued the final Water Use Licence on August 5, 2015, and that stripping of the Minto North open pit commenced immediately. Stripping of Minto North is reportedly on schedule for first ore to the mill starting in December 2015, with high grade ore commencing in the second quarter of 2016.   Stratoni: In the third quarter of 2015, attributable silver production from Stratoni was 0.1 million ounces, a decrease of approximately 52% relative to the third quarter of 2014, primarily due to lower throughput as a result of fewer production stopes available in the mine as well as a five week suspension of operations in the quarter.  As per Eldorado Gold Corporation's (\"Eldorado\") news release dated August 20, 2015, operations at the Stratoni mine were temporarily suspended as a direct result of the revocation by Greece's Ministry of Energy of the technical studies of Eldorado's projects in Halkidiki,Greece. As per Eldorado's news release dated October 5, 2015, mining operations have resumed at Halkidiki. Subsequent to the quarter, the Stratoni silver purchase agreement dated April 23, 2007, was amended in order to incentivize additional exploration and potentially extend the limited remaining mine life of Stratoni. The primary modification is to increase the production price per ounce of silver delivered to SWC over the current fixed price by one of the following amounts: i) US$2.50 if 10,000 meters of drilling is completed outside of the existing ore body and within SWC's defined area of interest (\"Expansion Drilling\"), ii) US$5.00 if 20,000 meters of Expansion Drilling is completed, and iii) US$7.00 if 30,000 meters of Expansion Drilling is completed. Drilling in all three cases must be completed by December 31, 2020, in order for the agreed upon increase in production price to be initiated.4 Produced But Not Yet Delivered 5  As at September 30, 2015, payable silver equivalent ounces produced but not yet delivered to Silver Wheaton by its partners decreased by 0.1 million ounces to approximately 6.3 million silver equivalent payable ounces, as increases at Salobo and Constancia were more than offset by decreases at San Dimas, 777 and Penasquito. Payable ounces produced but not yet delivered to Silver Wheaton are expected to average approximately two to three months of annualized production but may vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of mining operation factors including mine ramp-up, delays in shipments, and so forth. Detailed mine by mine production and sales figures can be found in the Appendix to this press release and in Silver Wheaton's MD&A in the 'Results of Operations and Operational Review' section. Sherritt International Corporation (S: TSX) Sherritt is a world leader in the mining and refining of nickel from lateritic ores with projects and operations in Canada, Cuba and Madagascar.  The Corporation is the largest independent energy producer in Cuba, with extensive oil and power operations on the island. Sherritt licenses its proprietary technologies and provides metallurgical services to commercial metals operations worldwide. The Corporation's common shares are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol \"S\". Sherritt is committed to the highest standards of environment, health and safety practices at all of its operations, while making valuable contributions to local communities. Sherritt Announces Q4 and Year End 2015 Results February 10, 2016 TORONTO, ON --(Marketwired - February 10, 2016) - NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION TO UNITED STATES NEWSWIRE SERVICES OR FOR DISSEMINATION IN THE UNITED STATES Sherritt International Corporation (\"Sherritt\" or the \"Corporation\") (TSX: S), a world leader in the mining and refining of nickel from lateritic ores, today reported its financial results for the year ended December 31, 2015. \"This has been a year of profound base metal and oil price weakness, with nickel down 40% and fuel oil down 50% in 2015. Operationally, we were able to mitigate these price declines with increased nickel production, significant year over year cost reductions, and prudent, proactive management of our capital spending,\" said David Pathe, President and CEO, Sherritt International. \"Looking to 2016, a healthy balance sheet and maintaining liquidity remain our top priorities, and we will continue to enforce strict cost discipline and allocate capital judiciously.\" Q4 AND YEAR END HIGHLIGHTS (1)(2)(3) The nickel price erosion continued in the fourth quarter, with LME traded nickel hitting a new low of US$3.70/lb before recovering to US$3.93/lb at year end. At these prices and based on Wood Mackenzie published cash cost estimates (C1) for the year ended December 31, 2015, up to 70% of global nickel production is considered to be underwater on a cash cost basis before sustaining capital and debt service costs. Crude oil prices also hit multi-year lows, with WTI prices ending the year at US$36.60 per barrel, and Gulf Coast Fuel Oil 6 ending the year at US$21.80 per barrel. Preserving cash has been the Corporation's highest priority in the last half of the year, and cost discipline across all operations mitigated cash funding requirements despite the commodity price slide. At year end 2015, the Corporation had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $435.4 million, compared to $373.8 million at the end of Q3 2015. In the fourth quarter, Sherritt drew down an additional $65 million on its credit facilities, which accounted for most of the increased cash position. Adjusting for this drawdown, the cash decrease in the quarter was only approximately $5 million. During the fourth quarter 2015, the challenge period for financial completion expired, confirming that the Ambatovy project financing is now non-recourse to Sherritt and the other partners. Continuing cost discipline paid off in the fourth quarter, with the Moa JV reporting Q4 Net Direct Cash Cost (NDCC) of US$2.90 per pound, the lowest since 2009, and Ambatovy's Q4 NDCC being US$4.07/lb. For the full year, the Moa JV reported NDCC of US$3.88/lb while the Ambatovy JV reported NDCC of US$4.83 per pound. Sherritt's oil production maintained positive margins, with average realized prices of $29.53 per barrel of oil equivalent in Q4 and unit operating costs of $11.64 per barrel on a Gross Working Interest (GWI) basis. For the full year, average realized prices were $38.73 per barrel and unit operating costs were $10.69 per barrel. The Q4 2015 average realized prices were down 40% compared to year ago levels, while on a full year basis, the average realized prices were down 41%. Unit operating costs were stable on a quarterly comparison basis, being down 5% in Q4 2015 compared to the year ago quarter and up 13% for the year compared to 2014. Nickel production was up 8% in Q4 2015 over the prior year quarter, and for the full year was up 14% as the Ambatovy JV ramped up to approximately 80% of design capacity. On a 100% basis, the Metals division produced 80,976 tonnes of finished nickel in 2015. Cobalt production was up 27% in Q4 2015 over Q4 2014, and up 17% on a full year basis to 7,199 tonnes (100% basis). Oil production declined following natural reservoir declines and poor results in the wells drilled on the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) Extension lands. Fourth quarter 2015 Cuban oil production of 17,045 bopd (GWI basis) was down 9% from levels reported a year ago, and on a full year basis, production of 18,257 bopd was down 6% from the 19,456 bopd in 2014. Power production of 226GWh (33 1/3 % basis) in the fourth quarter was up 6% from the comparable quarter of 2014, and on a full year basis, production of 902GWh was also up 6% from the 847 Gwh produced during 2014. Production in 2015 benefited from a full year of power generation from the 150MW Boca de Jaruco Combined Cycle Project which was brought online in February of 2014. All amounts are Canadian dollars unless otherwise indicated. For additional information see the Non-GAAP measures section of this press release. Compared to the same period in the prior year. Shown on Sherritt's attributable share ownership basis. SIGNIFICANT ITEMS In the fourth quarter of 2015, Sherritt reported an impairment expense of $1.6 billion after tax on Ambatovy, consisting of $1.3 billion representing Sherritt's 40% share of Ambatovy's impairment and $0.3 billion from the incremental carrying value of Sherritt's Ambatovy assets, primarily related to mineral rights acquired from Dynatec in 2007. On a 100% base, the recorded impairment expense was US$2.4 billion, and was due to lower forecast nickel prices. This impairment resulted in a breach of the Financial Debt to Equity covenant in our credit facilities, for which waivers were obtained. Ambatovy Financial Completion was announced by press release September 21, 2015. AMBATOVY FUNDING In 2015, Sherritt provided funding to Ambatovy of US$105.6 million. Funding requirements were significantly impacted in the year by principal and interest payments on the Ambatovy Joint Venture Financing. As no funding was provided in Q4, this amount is unchanged from the funding that Sherritt reported at the end of Q3 2015. As a result of achieving financial completion, the US$1.6 billion Ambatovy Joint Venture Financing (balance as at December 31, 2015, 100% basis) became non-recourse to the Ambatovy partners. Pursuant to cash calls due in January, 2016, an additional US$30.0 million was provided to Ambatovy by Sumitomo Corp. and Korea Resources Corp. (KORES). Total cash calls of US$50.0 million were made, with Sherritt not funding its 40% pro-rata share (US$20.0 million). By agreement amongst the partners Sherritt's unfunded amounts remain payable to Ambatovy, with accrued interest. These amounts will be subtracted from future Ambatovy Joint Venture distributions, or may be set off by the Ambatovy Joint Venture against certain other amounts owed to Sherritt. Sherritt also has the option to pay the amounts in cash at any time, at Sherritt's election. Until the funding deficit is cured, and subject to continued discussions with the Ambatovy partners, Sherritt will not be exercising its Ambatovy voting rights. Sherritt determined not to fund further cash calls at this time to preserve liquidity and due to the current structure of the Ambatovy partner loans, which, at current nickel prices, effectively reduce Sherritt's 40% interest in Ambatovy to a 12% economic interest.(1) At this time, Sherritt continues to serve as operator, and constructive discussions are ongoing between partners and senior lenders regarding future funding of Ambatovy and modifications to the existing senior principal amortization. METAL MARKETS Nickel spot prices hit a multi-year low of US$3.70 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2015, and have since traded lower in February. These are price levels not seen since 2003. More significant supply disruptions have started to appear in January, with announced cuts from Votorantim and Mirabela in Brazil, and Panoramic and Mincor in Australia. Coupled with Chinese supply cuts announced in 2015, these cuts could impact 200,000 tonnes of nickel supply in 2016. So far, the LME nickel price has not shown any positive response to the supply cut news, as nickel was one of the worst performers in 2015 and published inventories remain at high levels buffering the impact of any supply disruptions. On the demand side, global stainless demand is estimated to have decreased marginally (by approximately 1.2%) in 2015; however, despite this slowdown, world nickel demand is projected to increase marginally in 2016. High levels of nickel stocks and the strengthening US dollar are factors that may cap price rallies in 2016. Sherritt's Moa JV and Ambatovy JV operations experienced steady demand for their nickel briquettes throughout 2015, despite the negative market sentiment and price decline. Higher nickel grades of stainless steel remain more profitable for steel mills, which is positive for both the Moa and Ambatovy JVs. Moa Joint Venture (50% interest) and Fort Site Adjusted EBITDA of $7.6 million in the fourth quarter was up $5.4 million from the level reported in Q3 2015, despite lower production of finished nickel and lower nickel average realized sales prices. Cost reductions and strong fertilizer sales following their normal seasonal patterns were the main drivers in maintaining Adjusted EBITDA levels that outperformed the weak nickel price environment. Finished nickel production of 4,098 tonnes (50% basis) for the fourth quarter of 2015 was down approximately 5% from production of 4,332 tonnes (50% basis) in the fourth quarter 2014, and down approximately 9% from third quarter production of 4,521 tonnes (50% basis). Moa's operations were negatively impacted late in the third quarter and part of the fourth quarter from unplanned maintenance in High Pressure Acid Leach (HPAL) operations resulting in lower process plant availability. The unplanned maintenance and lower availability was partially attributed to power failures stemming from a newly commissioned national power plant in Moa, which also contributed to premature component failures in the HPAL. Moa has addressed the component failures and taken measures to mitigate the impact of future power disruptions with operations returning to normal by the end of 2015. For the full year, finished nickel production of 16,853 tonnes (50% basis) was up 2% from last year's level. Finished cobalt production of 1,867 tonnes (50% basis) for the full year was up 16% over the prior year, reflecting higher utilization of cobalt-rich feeds. Nickel recovery at Moa has been steady at 89% all year, an improvement over the 87% level recorded for full year 2014. The NDCC of US$2.90 per pound of nickel in the fourth quarter of 2015 was an improvement of 35% (US$1.54 per pound) from the fourth quarter of 2014, and the lowest reported since the third quarter of 2009. The Moa JV continues to demonstrate that it is a world class laterite asset and is well positioned to meet our long term objective of being in the lowest quartile of nickel producers on a C1 basis as the fourth quarter 2015 was well within that target based on latest published data from Wood Mackenzie. For the full year, the Moa JV reported an average NDCC of US$3.88 per pound of nickel, down 22% (US$1.11/lb) from the previous year. In addition to cost reductions realized as a result of lower fuel oil and energy prices, a weaker Canadian dollar relative to the US dollar, and lower third party feed costs, efforts to focus on controllable costs have paid off. Capital spending of $20.5 million in the quarter and $64.1 million year to date is lower than its comparable quarter of 2014, but higher for the year than 2014, due to the once in 10 year planned maintenance shutdown at Fort Saskatchewan in the second quarter of 2015, and a weaker Canadian dollar, along with the expansion capital spent on the construction of the 2,000 tonne per day acid plant which is on track for full operation in the second half of 2016. Full year capital spending of $64.1 million was $10.9 million less than the guidance provided at the end of the third quarter of 2015, with the difference being carried over to the 2016 capital spending estimate coupled with deferrals in response to continual weakness in commodity markets. This year, Sherritt expects capital spending of US$38 million, covering Sherritt's 50% share of the Moa JV and capex required in the Fort Site fertilizer and utilities operations. The capital spending includes completion of the Moa JV acid plant, which has been financed by a Cuban financial institution. Ambatovy Joint Venture (40% interest) Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter was negative $(9.5) million during the quarter compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $ (7.5) million in the same quarter last year. Nickel reference prices averaged US$4.27/lb in the quarter, compared to US$7.17/lb in the same quarter a year ago, and down 11% from the US$4.78/lb average reference price in Q3 this year. Despite the profound slide in nickel prices, higher production and a significantly improved NDCC have mitigated the losses in the quarter. For the full year, Adjusted EBITDA of $ (9.4) million compares with $ (5.5) million last year. During the quarter, finished nickel production was 4885 tonnes (40% basis), down 6% from the Q3 2015 record production, but an improvement of 23% over last year. Finished cobalt production of 386 tonnes (40% basis) was up 39% from its level in the same quarter of 2014, and very close to the 392 tonnes cobalt produced in the third quarter. For the year, Ambatovy performed at close to 80% of design capacity, and twice achieved the \"90 for 90\" production test performance that was necessary to satisfy the financial completion criteria. The test required operating at 90% of design capacity for 90 days within a 100 day continuous period. While production and efficiency milestones were set and achieved in 2015, during the fourth quarter, Sherritt also received confirmation that finished nickel briquettes from Ambatovy qualified for delivery to London Metal Exchange (LME) warehouses. This recognition demonstrates the technical and metallurgical capabilities that Sherritt has contributed as operator during Ambatovy's ramp-up. LME delivery status allows Ambatovy or its customers the flexibility and commercial advantage of delivering nickel product to LME warehouses where logistics benefits exist or to mitigate short term variance in customer demand. LME certification should also have a positive impact on pricing. Ambatovy nickel was sold at an average realized price of $5.52/lb in the quarter (approximately US$4.14/lb at the quarterly average exchange rate), demonstrating that pricing is not suffering from discounting, and is approaching Moa JV average realized prices. The NDCC of nickel was US$4.07 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2015, continuing the strong decreasing trend achieved for each quarter this year, starting from US$5.74 per pound in Q1. Ambatovy is also demonstrating its potential to move into the lowest quartile of industry cash costs. Costs have responded positively to increased production as the operation has ramped up, improvements in maintenance costs and headcount, and falling input commodity prices. For example, autoclave turnaround times had been reduced from 42 days to 21 by the end of the year. In 2016, a two week total plant shutdown is scheduled for Q3, to complete inspections of pressure vessels in accordance with statutory engineering codes, and to carry out major opportune maintenance in various areas of the plant. Capital spending in 2015 was $23.8 million, which was approximately $11.2 million less than the guidance provided in Q3 2015. In 2016, capital spending is estimated to be US$25 million, which includes the continued build-up of mining fleet to support the mine plan, further mine development works including sediment control dam construction, and ongoing tailings dam expansion works. AMBATOVY FUNDING In 2015, Sherritt provided funding to Ambatovy of US$105.6 million. Funding requirements were significantly impacted in the year by principal and interest payments on the Ambatovy Joint Venture Financing. This amount is unchanged from the funding that Sherritt reported at the end of Q3 2015. As a result of achieving financial completion, the US$ 1.6 billion Ambatovy Joint Venture Financing (balance as at December 31, 2015, 100% basis) became non-recourse to the Ambatovy partners. Pursuant to cash calls due in January, 2016, an additional US$30.0 million was provided to Ambatovy by Sumitomo Corp. and Korea Resources Corp. (KORES). Total cash calls of US$50.0 million were made, with Sherritt not funding its 40% pro-rata share (US$20.0 million). By agreement amongst the partners Sherritt's unfunded amounts remain payable to Ambatovy, with accrued interest. These amounts will be subtracted from future Ambatovy Joint Venture distributions, or may be set off by the Ambatovy Joint Venture against certain other amounts owed to Sherritt. Sherritt also has the option to pay the amounts in cash at any time, at Sherritt's election. Until the funding deficit is cured, and subject to continued discussions with the Ambatovy partners, Sherritt will not be exercising its Ambatovy voting rights. Sherritt determined not to fund further cash calls at this time to preserve liquidity and due to the current structure of the Ambatovy partner loans, which, at current nickel prices, effectively reduce Sherritt's 40% interest in Ambatovy to a 12% economic interest.(1) At this time, Sherritt continues to serve as operator, and constructive discussions are ongoing between partners and senior lenders regarding future funding of Ambatovy and modifications to the existing senior principal amortization. Adjusted EBITDA of $9.7 million was 63% ($16.6 million) lower in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year period, with the average reference price for Gulf Fuel Oil 6 falling 52% from its year ago levels. The WTI and Fuel Oil 6 prices have continued to deteriorate since year end, with Gulf Coast Fuel Oil 6 now trading in a range of US$18 - US$21 per barrel in January of 2016. Fourth quarter GWI oil production in Cuba of 17,045 bopd was down 9% from the same quarter a year ago following natural reservoir declines and lower than expected production from the PSC Extension wells drilled earlier in 2015. Fourth quarter NWI oil production in Cuba of 10,145 bopd increased by 3% over the same quarter in 2014 despite the decrease in Cuban GWI oil production. This trend was also evident in the year over year comparison, with GWI oil production in Cuba down 6% for the full year, while net working interest production was up 1%. Cost recovery oil production in Cuba for both the quarter and the full year increased compared to 2014 because of lower oil prices. The allocation of cost recovery barrels in any particular period is limited to a fixed percentage of GWI volumes within each cost pool. Unit operating costs in Cuba increased by 9% ($0.88 per barrel) to $10.82 (GWI basis) for the fourth quarter (up 11% on a full year basis to $9.53 per barrel). This increase in unit operating costs is mainly attributable to lower than expected production combined with a weaker Canadian dollar, offset to some degree by lower workover costs. Quarterly free cash flow of $23.3 million was considerably higher than quarterly Adjusted EBITDA, benefiting from the collection of overdue receivables and limited capital spending. Although overdue receivables are still above normal levels at year end, approximately $48.8 million was collected during the quarter, and a schedule of payments has been agreed with the Cuban agency that shows receivables returning to current by year end 2016. In the third quarter of 2015, an impairment expense of $80.6 million ($0.27 per share) was recorded on Cuban and Spain oil assets in the quarter. The lower oil price forecast, combined with drilling results on the PSC extension that were below expectations, are the reasons for the impairment. Depletion, depreciation and amortization charges in the last quarter of 2015 were reduced accordingly, with Q4 depletion, depreciation and amortization charges of $10.9 million being $6.7 million lower than the Q4 2014 depletion, depreciation and amortization charges of $17.6 million. On a year to date basis, capital spending of $54.5 million is down 17% year over year, as further drilling was stopped in Q3 on the Extension areas after poor drilling results. Although the decision was made to stop further development within the PSC Extension areas, new capital spending is necessary to offset declines in existing production. The outlook for 2016 Cuban oil production of 14,500 bopd (GWI basis) is 21% lower than 2015 production, anticipating continuing natural reservoir declines, and no further drilling planned on the existing PSCs. The original PSCs expire in 2017 and 2018, with future production dependent on the ability to develop new prospective areas within the Cuban oil partnership. Drilling activity for 2016 is focused on the preparation and drilling of Block 10, where Sherritt has budgeted to drill two wells. Block 10 is one of two new PSC's which Sherritt signed in 2014 with the Cuban agency, covering 261 square kilometres for a 25-year term. Sherritt originally held Block 10 in the Bay of Cardenas, and drilled one well in June 1994. The well was drilled using an offshore drilling rig, and produced a discovery which tested at 3,750 barrels of oil per day. Since then, significant advances in horizontal drilling technology have made new drilling from onshore a viable prospect. Power Quarterly Adjusted EBITDA increased by 2% from Q4 2014 levels, while on a full year basis, Adjusted EBITDA was up 21%. Higher gas availability led to higher production, with Sherritt's share being 902 GWh for the full year. Production included the first full year of production from the 150MW Boca de Jaruco Combined Cycle Project, which was brought online effective February 2, 2014. The average-realized price of electricity was also higher for the quarter and for the full year period compared to 2014, mainly because of a weaker Canadian dollar. Operating costs increased by 48% ($11.06 per MWh) in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year period, with most of the increase being in non-base costs. These are mainly maintenance expenditures on the Boca de Jaruco and Puerto Escondido facilities. Operating costs fluctuate from a quarter to quarter basis with the timing of maintenance performed on gas and steam turbines. The weaker Canadian dollar also contributed to higher unit operating costs on both a three month and full year basis, as the Canadian dollar weakened from levels of approximately $1.14 in Q4 last year to $1.34 in Q4 of 2015, a change of 18%. Higher depletion, depreciation, and amortization expenses in both the quarter and the year compared to 2014 reflect the impact of a change in residual value estimate of the Varadero facility in Q1 2015, as well as the Canadian dollar decline. Free cash flow generation of $4.4 million in the quarter included a $2.8 million payment of interest on the Energas conditional sales agreement ($37.9 million year to date). Principal repayments of $7.9 million in the quarter were also received ($33.7 million year to date). OUTLOOK 2016 PRODUCTION AND CAPITAL SPENDING GUIDANCE In 2016, Sherritt has made certain modifications to how guidance is presented. For example, nickel and cobalt production expectations will continue to be published and reconciled to production guidance, but mixed sulphide production will not be part of the production guidance. This change was implemented recognizing that external stakeholders are focused on finished metal production with mixed sulphide production guidance having less utility. Secondly, capital spending estimates are being presented in US dollar denominated ranges, with the Canadian dollar estimate being presented for ease of comparison. The Canadian dollar estimate has been converted using the 2016 forecast conversion rate $1.36. This change in presentation is intended to align with Sherritt's capital budgeting practices, and to mitigate the change to capital that arises from translation to the Canadian dollar reporting currency. In 2015, capital spending revisions were generally explained in terms of their US dollar movement, as the fall in the Canadian dollar offset larger downward revisions to capital spending as the year progressed. This year, the presentation in US dollars and reporting against spending projections in US dollars is intended to mitigate the impacts of currency exchange volatility. Capital projects in the Metals business are generally US dollar expenditures, while in Oil & Gas, the expenditures are roughly 50% Canadian dollar denominated and 50% US dollar denominated.

Production at Moa and in the power operations is expected to remain steady, with a decline in Oil & Gas, reflecting natural reservoir declines and no further drilling activity on existing PSC's. The original PSC wells are scheduled to revert to Cuban ownership in 2017 and 2018. Longer term, new production in Oil & Gas is expected to come from the drilling of Block 10, where the drill program will progress at a pace driven by prudent capital spending, and the objective of running the business units to be cash flow neutral. Capital Spending Capital spending (excluding Corporate) in 2015 was approximately $147 million, up 39% from 2014 capex of approximately $106 million, but down 21% from guidance provided at the end of Q3 2015. Approximately US$12 million ($16.3 million) has been carried over to 2016 estimated capital spending of US$107 million. In the Moa JV, 2016 estimated capital spending is consistent with 2015 levels adjusting for carry-forwards. The acid plant construction at the Moa JV is nearing 75% completion at January 31, 2016, and is on track to be operating in the second half of 2016. Counting US$40.4 million spent (100% basis) from the construction re-start in 2013 to the end of 2015 and an additional estimated US$24.6 million (included in the 2016 capital spending estimate), the construction completion cost (since resuming construction in 2013) is forecast at approximately US$65 million which is in line with the 2013 approved budget and is being 100% financed by a Cuban leading institution. Ambatovy capital spending is similar to what was originally estimated for 2015. Oil and gas estimated capital spending is focused on the preparation and drilling of Block 10. Block 10 is covered by one of the two new PSC's which Sherritt signed in 2014 with the Cuban agency, encompassing 261 square kilometres in the Bay of Cardenas for a 25-year term. Sherritt originally held Block 10 and completed a drill hole on the block in June 1994. Sherritt drilled one well, using an offshore drilling rig, which produced a discovery which tested at 3,750 barrels of oil per day. Since then, significant advances in horizontal drilling technology have made new drilling from onshore a viable prospect. Power capital spending is forecast to be US$1 million (Sherritt's 33 1/3% share) in 2016. In addition, the cost to construct a new pipeline to increase gas availability is estimated at US$4 million (Sherritt's share) with construction starting and finishing in 2016. NON-GAAP MEASURES The Corporation uses combined results, Adjusted EBITDA, average-realized price, unit operating cost, and adjusted operating cash flow to monitor the performance of the Corporation and its operating divisions and believes these measures enable investors and analysts to compare the Corporation's financial performance with its competitors and evaluate the results of its underlying business. These measures do not have a standard definition under IFRS and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. As these measures do not have a standardized meaning, they may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other companies.

Teck Reports Unaudited Fourth Quarter Results For 2015 Vancouver, BC - Teck Resources Limited (TSX: TCK.A and TCK.B, NYSE: TCK) (\"Teck\") reported unaudited annual adjusted profit attributable to shareholders of $188 million, or $0.33 per share, compared with $452 million, or $0.78 per share in 2014. Fourth quarter adjusted profit attributable to shareholders was $16 million, or $0.03 per share, compared with $116 million, or $0.20 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2014. Total non-cash after-tax impairment charges for 2015 amounted to $2.7 billion, of which $536 million was taken in the fourth quarter. \"We were pleased with our operating performance in 2015, meeting our guidance, reducing our costs and raising nearly $1 billion through two streaming transactions to strengthen our balance sheet,\" said Don Lindsay, President and CEO. \"However, the commodity cycle continues to provide us with a very challenging environment such that our near-term priorities are to keep all of our operations cash flow positive, meet our commitment to Fort Hills with internal sources of funds, evaluate options to further strengthen our liquidity and maintain a strong financial position by ending the year without drawing on our lines of credit.\" Highlights and Significant Items Annual adjusted profit attributable to shareholders was $188 million, or $0.33 per share. Fourth quarter adjusted profit attributable to shareholders was $16 million, or $0.03 per share. Gross profit before depreciation and amortization in 2015 was $2.6 billion compared with $2.9 billion in 2014. Gross profit before depreciation and amortization was $614 million in the fourth quarter compared with $757 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Cash flow from operations, before working capital changes, was $1.7 billion in 2015 compared with $2.0 billion last year. Cash flow from operations, before working capital changes, was $428 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with $491 million a year ago. The loss attributable to shareholders was $459 million in the fourth quarter compared with a profit of $129 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Our quarterly loss included impairment charges of $736 million on a pre-tax basis, including $45 million on our steelmaking coal assets, $93 million on copper and $598 million on the Fort Hills oil sand project resulting in a $536 million after-tax charge. For 2015, total pre-tax asset impairment charges were $3.6 billion and $2.7 billion on an after-tax basis. Adjusted EBITDA for 2015 (not including the non-cash impairment charges) was $2.0 billion compared with $2.4 billion in 2014. Our liquidity remains strong with a cash balance of $1.8 billion at February 10, and US$3.0 billion available under our revolving credit facility which matures in 2020. Construction of the Fort Hills oil sands project is more than 50% complete and progressing substantially on schedule and on budget. As at February 10, our remaining cash funding to complete the project is $1.2 billion. We received a payment of $789 million (US$610 million) for the sale of a silver stream linked to our share of the Antamina mine. Cash unit production costs were reduced at all of our operations in 2015 compared with a year ago as a result of the highly focused efforts on our cost reduction program and lower diesel prices. We have reached agreements with the majority of our steelmaking coal customers for the first quarter of 2016, based on a quarterly benchmark of US$81 per tonne for the highest quality product, and we expect total sales in the first quarter, including spot sales, to be at least 5.5 million tonnes of steelmaking coal. We were recognized as one of the Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations for the fourth consecutive year by media and investment research company Corporate Knights. Operating highlights in 2015 included: all our operating mines, with the exception of Quebrada Blanca and Pend Oreille, remained cash positive in the fourth quarter and for 2015, we achieved record annual production at Trail for refined zinc and silver, and we achieved record annual mill throughput at Antamina. If we meet our full year guidance for production, costs and capital expenditures, assuming current commodity prices and exchange rates and no unusual transactions or events, we should complete 2016 with at least $500 million in cash without any material change in our overall U.S. dollar debt level.

Statements regarding anticipated steelmaking coal sales volumes and average steelmaking coal prices for the quarter depend on timely arrival of vessels and performance of our steelmaking coal-loading facilities, as well as the level of spot pricing sales. Turqoise Hill Resources Ltd. (TSE: TRQ) Turquoise Hill Resources (TRQ: TSX, NYSE & NASDAQ) is an international mining company with copper-gold and coal mines in the Asia Pacific region. Principal assets: A 66% interest in Oyu Tolgoi, one of the world's largest copper-gold-silver mines now producing and shipping concentrate to customers in China. A 22.63% interest in established Mongolian coal miner SouthGobi Resources (SGQ: TSX, 1878: HK). Turquoise Hill announces financial results and review of operations for the third quarter of 2015 VANCOUVER, CANADA - Turquoise Hill Resources today announced its financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. All figures are in US dollars unless otherwise stated. . HIGHLIGHTS Oyu Tolgoi achieved a strong safety performance with an All Injury Frequency Rate of 0.31 per 200,000 hours worked for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Oyu Tolgoi recorded revenue of $431.7 million in Q3'15 on sales of 226,000 tonnes of concentrate, a 2.5% increase over Q2'15, reflecting higher sales volumes partially offset by lower copper prices. Turquoise Hill reported income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders of $44.0 million. In Q3'15, a non-cash charge of $76.4 million was recorded within operating expenses for provision against non-current ore stockpile inventory. Turquoise Hill generated operating cash flow before interest and taxes of $171.7 million during Q3'15. Oyu Tolgoi's Q3'15 mine production was at record levels while concentrate produced and contained copper were on par with Q2'15 even considering the planned concentrator shutdown in July 2015. During Q3'15, mined production increased 8.5% over Q2'15 due to shorter hauling routes and ongoing productivity initiatives. Copper in concentrates for Q3'15 increased 1.3% due to higher head grades while gold in concentrates decreased 48.3% over Q2'15 due to slower than anticipated access to gold-rich ore. Increased copper and gold production is expected in Q4'15 compared to Q3'15 as higher-grade ore is accessed in the open pit. Turquoise Hill continues to expect Oyu Tolgoi to produce 175,000 to 195,000 tonnes of copper and 600,000 to 700,000 ounces of gold in concentrates in 2015. In August 2015, Oyu Tolgoi filed revised schedules for the 2015 Oyu Tolgoi Feasibility Study with the Mongolian Minerals Council. Underground pre-start activities are underway in parallel with an update to the feasibility study capital estimate, which is expected to be completed in Q1'16. Turquoise Hill continues to expect signing of project financing by the end of 2015 and the decision for underground construction in early Q2'16. Capital expenditure for 2015 is now expected to be approximately $120 million, of which approximately $115 million relates to sustaining capital, due to operational efficiencies, changes to the mine plan during the year and capital optimization. Operating cash costs for 2015 are now expected to be approximately $900 million reflecting operational improvements throughout the year and excluding one-time costs related to the May 2015 underground agreement as well as pre-start costs for underground development. Sales contracts have been signed for more than 80% of Oyu Tolgoi's expected 2016 concentrate production. In September 2015, Oyu Tolgoi surpassed 1.5 million tonnes of concentrate shipped. Turquoise Hill's cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2015 were $1.3 billion. FINANCIAL RESULTS In Q3'15, the Company recorded net income attributable to owners of Turquoise Hill of $21.2 million or $0.01 per share compared with net loss of $94.0 million or ($0.05) per share in Q3'14, an increase of $115.2 million. The increase is mainly attributable to a $227.3 million non-cash impairment charge recorded in Q3'14 on reclassification of SouthGobi to assets held for sale. Operating cash flows before interest and taxes in Q3'15 were $171.7 million compared with $256.3 million in Q3'14, reflecting continued production and delivery cost improvements and effective working capital management, offset by the impact of lower commodity prices on sales revenue. Additions to property, plant and equipment, excluding adjustments relating to asset retirement obligations ($9.7 million), were $31.1 million in Q3'15 all of which related to sustaining capital activities including the tailing storage facility. Turquoise Hill's cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2015 were $1.3 billion. OYU TOLGOI The Oyu Tolgoi mine is approximately 550 kilometres south of Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia's capital city, and 80 kilometres north of the Mongolia-China border. Mineralization on the property consists of porphyry-style copper, gold, silver and molybdenum contained in a linear structural trend (the Oyu Tolgoi Trend) that has a strike length extending over 26 kilometres. Mineral resources have been identified in a series of deposits throughout this trend. They include, from south to north, the Heruga Deposit, the Southern Oyu deposits (Southwest Oyu, South Oyu, Wedge and Central Oyu) and the Hugo Dummett deposits (Hugo South, Hugo North and Hugo North Extension). Mining of ore commenced in May 2012 and first concentrate was produced in January 2013. The Oyu Tolgoi mine has initially been developed as an open-pit operation. A copper concentrator plant, with related facilities and necessary infrastructure to support a nominal throughput of 100,000 tonnes of ore per day, has been constructed to process ore mined from the Southern Oyu open pit. Long term development plans for Oyu Tolgoi are based on a 95,000-tonne-per-day underground block-cave mine. In August 2013, development of the underground mine was delayed pending resolution of matters with the Government of Mongolia. On May 18, 2015, Turquoise Hill, the Government of Mongolia and Rio Tinto announced the signing of the Oyu Tolgoi Underground Mine Development and Financing Plan, which addressed key outstanding shareholder matters and set out an agreed basis for the funding of the project. Preparation for underground development Following the filing of revised schedules for the 2015 Oyu Tolgoi Feasibility Study with the Mongolian Minerals Council in August 2015, pre-start activities are underway in parallel with an update to the capital estimate, which is expected to be completed in Q1'16. Pre-start activities include ramp-up of the owners and EPCM team, reestimate activities, detailed engineering and early procurement for equipment and materials required for necessary critical works that are key enablers for recommencement of underground lateral development mining activity. Care and maintenance activities have continued for Shaft #1, facilities and mobile equipment. Turquoise Hill expects the decision for underground construction in early Q2'16. The Company continues to expect signing of project financing by the end of 2015. In September 2015, the Government of Mongolia signed the request of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) for host country approval (HCA) with respect to guarantees to be issued by MIGA in connection with the Oyu Tolgoi project financing. The signing of the HCA was a significant milestone in the project financing timeline. In October 2015, the project financing information circular was provided to the banking syndicate allowing for each institution's respective internal consideration and approval. Prior to the suspension in August 2013, underground lateral development at Hugo North had advanced approximately 16 kilometres off Shaft #1. Sinking of Shaft #2, the primary operations access and initial production hoisting shaft, had reached a depth of 1,168 metres below surface, 91% of its final depth of 1,284 metres. The 96 metre-high Shaft #2 concrete headframe has been constructed. Sinking of Shaft #5, a dedicated exhaust ventilation shaft, had reached a depth of 208 metres, 17% of its final depth of 1,174 metres. Surface facilities, including offices, mine dry, and workshop, are in place to support initial pre-production development and construction. Q3'15 performance Safety continues to be a major focus throughout Oyu Tolgoi's operations and the mine's management is committed to reducing risk and injury. Oyu Tolgoi achieved a solid safety performance with an All Injury Frequency Rate of 0.31 per 200,000 hours worked for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Revenue in Q3'15 increased 2.5% over Q2'15. Higher revenues reflect higher volumes of copper-gold concentrate sales, partially offset by a fall in copper prices. The Q3'15 mix of revenue by metals is the result of inventory with higher contained copper and gold drawn down during the quarter from concentrate produced in Q2'15. Gross margin at 41.6% for the quarter reduced from 46.4% in Q2'15 due to the effect of lower copper prices. Production and delivery costs include primarily the cash costs in inventory sold as well as allocated mine administration costs. Depreciation and depletion includes the depreciation and depletion in inventory sold as well as any depreciation of assets used in the selling and delivery process, including the depreciation of capitalized production phase stripping costs. A non-cash charge of $76.4 million was recorded in Q3'15, within operating expenses, for additional provision against non-current ore stockpiles, following re-estimation of realizable value to reflect lower copper and gold prices and updated assumptions for timing of processing. Total additions capitalized to property, plant and equipment, on an accruals basis, for Q3'15 were $31.1 million (Q3'14: $38.3 million) all attributed to sustaining activities, including the tailings storage facility and deferred stripping. Total additions for Q3'15 include an adjustment of $4.0 million, which reduced the carrying amount of underground evaluation costs capitalized in previous quarters to be in accordance with the Company's accounting policy on the recognition of exploration and evaluation costs. Total cash operating costs at Oyu Tolgoi in Q3'15 were $222.5 million. Following transition to IFRS, the 5% royalty payable to the Government of Mongolia, previously deducted from revenue, is reflected as a cash operating expense, and production phase stripping costs, previously included within cash operating expense, are capitalized and depreciated. During Q3'15, Oyu Tolgoi continued to improve and optimize operations in order to reduce costs across the mine's operation. Oyu Tolgoi's C1 costs in Q3'15 were $0.40 per pound, compared with $0.73 per pound in Q2'15. The decrease was mainly due to a $22.1 million charge in Q2'15 for settlement of amounts not previously paid or provided for in relation to Mongolian Tax assessments, following signature of the underground agreement on May 18, 2015, and a net reduction in inventory (excluding non-cash write-down) as sales volumes exceeded production. Oyu Tolgoi's open-pit mine has a high-grade zone containing a large proportion of gold in addition to copper; Turquoise Hill anticipates quarterly fluctuation of C1 costs as the quantity of gold in concentrates sold varies after ore from this zone is fed through the mill. All-in sustaining costs in Q3'15 were $1.52 per pound, compared with $1.26 per pound in Q2'15. The increase was mainly due to a non-cash charge for additional provision against non-current ore stockpile partially offset by royalty expenses returning to regular operational levels following the Q2'15 adjustment upon signing of the underground agreement. Oyu Tolgoi's Q3'15 mine production was at record levels while concentrate produced and contained copper was on par with Q2'15 even considering the planned concentrator shutdown in July. During Q3'15, mined production increased 8.5% over Q2'15 due to shorter hauling routes and ongoing productivity initiatives. Copper in concentrates for Q3'15 increased 1.3% due to higher head grades. Gold in concentrates for the quarter decreased 48.3% over Q2'15 due to slower than anticipated access to gold-rich ore. Funding of Oyu Tolgoi by Turquoise Hill In accordance with the ARSHA dated June 8, 2011, Turquoise Hill has funded Oyu Tolgoi's cash requirements beyond internally generated cash flows by a combination of equity investment and shareholder debt. For amounts funded by debt, Oyu Tolgoi must repay such amounts, including accrued interest, before it can pay common share dividends. At September 30, 2015, the aggregate outstanding balance of shareholder loans extended by subsidiaries of the Company to Oyu Tolgoi was $6.8 billion, including accrued interest of $1.4 billion. These loans bear interest at an effective annual rate of LIBOR plus 6.5%. In Q3'15, Oyu Tolgoi repaid a total amount of $180.0 million with respect to these loans, including accrued interest of $57.9 million. In accordance with the ARSHA, a subsidiary of the Company has funded the common share investments in Oyu Tolgoi on behalf of Erdenes. These funded amounts earn interest at an effective annual rate of LIBOR plus 6.5% and are repayable, by Erdenes to a subsidiary of the Company, via a pledge over Erdenes' share of Oyu Tolgoi common share dividends. Erdenes also has the right to reduce the outstanding balance by making cash payments at any time. As at September 30, 2015, the cumulative amount of such funding was $751.1 million, representing approximately 34% of invested common share equity; unrecognized interest on the funding amounted to $214.9 million. Operational outlook Increased copper and gold production is expected in Q4'15 when compared to Q3'15 as higher-grade ore is anticipated to be accessed in the open pit. Turquoise Hill continues to expect Oyu Tolgoi to produce 175,000 to 195,000 tonnes of copper and 600,000 to 700,000 ounces of gold in concentrates in 2015. The Company expects copper production to be at the top of the range while gold production is expected to be in the middle of the range. Capital expenditure for 2015 is now expected to be approximately $120 million, of which approximately $115 million relates to sustaining capital. The Company previously expected capital expenditure of approximately $230 million, of which approximately $185 million related to sustaining capital. The reduction is the result of operational efficiencies, changes to the mine plan during the year and capital optimization. Operating cash costs for 2015 are now expected to be approximately $900 million. The Company previously expected operating cash costs of approximately $1 billion. The reduction reflects changes from operational improvements throughout the year and excludes one-time costs related to the May 2015 underground agreement as well as pre-start costs for underground development. Sales contracts have been signed for more than 80% of Oyu Tolgoi's expected 2016 concentrate production. Q3'15 exploration Oyu Tolgoi's exploration strategy is focused on developing a project pipeline prioritized in areas that can impact the current development of the Oyu Tolgoi orebodies, seeking low-cost development options; in particular looking for shallower targets. Historical datasets are added to and reinterpreted to enable future discovery. SOUTHGOBI On April 23, 2015, the Company completed sale of 48.7 million shares in SouthGobi to Novel Sunrise Investments Limited (NSI) at a price of C$0.35 per common share payable in cash, and on June 3, 2015 a further 1.7 million shares were sold to NSI at a price of C$0.35 per share. Half of the aggregate cash proceeds, representing C$8.5 million in total, were received at closing; the balance of approximately C$8.5 million was received on August 4, 2015. At September 30, 2015, Turquoise Hill owned 52.4 million SouthGobi common shares, representing approximately 21.3% of the issued and outstanding SouthGobi shares at that date. The carrying value of this interest at September 30, 2015 was $14.6 million based on the quoted share price. At September 30, 2015, SouthGobi is classified as an investment in associate within assets held for sale in the Company's financial statements. OTHER EXPLORATION Desk top studies, data compilation and detailed satellite imagery interpretation are in progress for an orbit Area approximately surrounding Oyu Tolgoi. An induced polarization and magnetotellurics survey on Turquoise Hill's Teregt licence (bordering the south of the Oyu Tolgoi licences) was conducted. The results have been analyzed and the interpretation downgraded the previous induced polarization targets. Additional soil and rock geochemical sampling has been done to test for shallow exploration targets. A service agreement is in place with Rio Tinto Holdings (Exploration), under which they provide exploration services to the Company. This agreement benefits Turquoise Hill by allowing access to Rio Tinto's global expertise, knowledge base and skills. CORPORATE ACTIVITIES Management change In September 2015, Turquoise Hill announced the resignation of Stewart Beckman, Senior Vice President, Operations and Technical Development, effective October 1, 2015 due to Mr. Beckman having accepted a new position within Rio Tinto. The Company is conducting a search for Mr. Beckman's replacement, which will be announced in due course. Mr. Beckman will provide support in the interim to ensure a smooth transition. NON-GAAP MEASURES The Company's financial results are prepared in accordance with IFRS. In addition, the Company presents and refers to the following measures (non-GAAP measures) which are not defined in IFRS. A description and calculation of these measures is given below, and may differ in some aspects from equivalent measures provided by other issuers. Cash operating costs This measure comprises Oyu Tolgoi cash operating costs, and is presented in order to provide investors and other stakeholders in the Company with a greater understanding of performance and operations at Oyu Tolgoi. The measure of cash operating costs excludes: depreciation and depletion; exploration and evaluation; charges for asset write-down (including write-down of materials and supplies inventory), and includes management services payments to Rio Tinto, and management services payments to Turquoise Hill which are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements of the Company. C1 cash costs C1 cash costs is a metric representing the cash cost per unit of extracting and processing the Company's principal metal product to a condition in which it may be delivered to customers, net of by-product credits. It is provided in order to support peer group comparability and to provide investors and other stakeholders' useful information about the underlying cash costs of Oyu Tolgoi and the impact of by-product credits on the operations' cost structure. C1 cash costs are relevant to understanding the Company's operating profitability and ability to generate cash flow. When calculating costs associated with producing a pound of copper, the Company includes gold and silver revenue credits as the production cost is reduced as a result of selling these by-products.Turquoise Hill's principal metal product is copper, and C1 cash costs are reported for Oyu Tolgoi only. All-in sustaining costs All-in sustaining costs (AISC) is an extended cash based cost metric, providing further information on the aggregate cash, capital and overhead outlay per unit, and is intended to reflect the costs of producing the Company's principal metal product over the life-cycle of its operations. The measure seeks to reflect the full cost of copper production from current operations and as a result development project capital is not included. AISC allows Turquoise Hill to assess the ability of Oyu Tolgoi to support sustaining capital expenditures for future production from the generation of operating cash flows. QUALIFIED PERSON Disclosure of a scientific or technical nature in this MD&A in respect of the Oyu Tolgoi mine was prepared under the supervision of Bernard Peters (responsibility for overall preparation and mineral reserves), B. Eng. (Mining), FAusIMM (201743), employed by OreWin as Technical Director - Mining and Kendall Cole-Rae (responsibility for mineral resources, geology and exploration), B.Sc.

(hereinafter \"Rocky\") today reported its financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2015. SUMMARY OF THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015 *Total revenues decreased by 2.9% to $285.6 million. *Used equipment sales increased by 16.1% to $92.7 million. *Gross profit decreased by 4.9% to $37.5 million (13.1% of sales). *Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share(1) declined by 21.9% to $0.25. *Adjusted EBITDA(1) declined 16.6% to $9.0 million. *Inventory increased by $10.1 million to $499.8 million.

(2) - Excluding $43.6 million of inventory acquired through the Chabot acquisition. During 2015, Rocky was able to deliver strong gains in several key areas in what was a challenging operating environment. Among other factors, the impact of the U.S. exchange rate on new equipment prices dictated a different approach to equipment purchasing in 2015, bolstering demand for used equipment and product support within our agriculture segment. Strategic initiatives undertaken by Rocky in response to these changes focused resources and efforts on these areas of demand, resulting in revenue growth and improved cash flow. The continued demand for lightly-used equipment helped drive down inventory levels by $68.9 million during 2015, excluding inventory acquired through business combinations. On the Industrials front, the persistence of the depression in oil prices continued to negatively impact economic activity in Alberta. Cost containment initiatives undertaken by Rocky in 2014 and 2015 helped to curtail losses in that regard during the year. \"Rocky was able to leverage the market conditions that prevailed in 2015 to further our existing initiatives to reduce inventory and build our product support business,\" remarked Garrett Ganden, President & Chief Executive Officer of Rocky.  \"As we continue to grow our installed-base of agriculture equipment and customers, we anticipate further demand for our product support business, which posted another strong year in 2015. We were also pleased to see the consistency in our same-store agriculture revenue year-over-year, despite softer overall equipment demand. \"In addition to these operational initiatives, Rocky was able to further grow its footprint in 2015 by acquiring Chabot Implements, a long-standing dealer of Case IH products in Manitoba. This strategic acquisition allowed us to further consolidate our position as a major equipment distributor in the Manitoba region. We were also able to enhance our product and service offering in the area of geomatics and precision farming through our acquisition of NGF Geomatics. As farms get larger and more technologically sophisticated, we feel that Rocky is well positioned to meet their equipment and technology demands. \"The cost containment strategies that we enacted during the year offset much of the incremental SG&A associated with our acquisitions. As part of this process, we undertook initiatives to reduce our fixed charges by amalgamating locations in certain regions. We believe that the steps taken in this regard will allow us to uphold the level of service and territory coverage that our customers expect, at a reduced cost. Due to investments we have made in process and efficiency, we were able to both grow our sales territory and shrink our \"bricks and mortar\" footprint, with little interruption to our core business. \"Our Industrial segment lost some of the traction that they had gained in 2014, due primarily to the precipitous drop in oil prices, and its effect on the Alberta economy. While Rocky's Industrials segment is not reliant on doing business directly with Alberta's oil industry, we still are prone to the indirect effects that this downturn has created. We continue to work on initiatives to further our brand and ultimately achieve profitability despite these challenges.\" Mr. Ganden concluded his comments by saying, \"Our focus continues to be the safe, dependable equipment partner of choice for our agriculture and industrial customers. We continue to lay the groundwork for maintaining and growing customer relationships across our network. To that end, in 2015 we were pleased to open a new, state-of-the-art store in Neepawa, Manitoba, and we are looking forward to the completion of our new, larger store in Yorkton, Saskatchewan, in the coming weeks. Through these investments in our facilities and in the communities we operate, we hope to maintain the continued annuity of business that these relationships can create.\" Annual Meeting of Shareholders Rocky also announced today that its Annual Meeting of Shareholders (\"AGM\") will take place at 2:00 pm on Tuesday, May 3, 2016, in the showroom of Rocky Mountain Equipment, 260180 Writing Creek Crescent, Rocky View County, Alberta.

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET SUMMARY   SELECTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION  (1) - See further discussion in \"Non-IFRS Measures\" and \"Reconciliation of Non-IFRS Measures to IFRS\" sections below. NON-IFRS MEASURES We use terms which do not have standardized meanings under IFRS.  As these non-IFRS financial measures do not have standardized meanings prescribed by IFRS, they are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Our definition for each term is as follows: *\"Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share\" is calculated by eliminating from net earnings, the after-tax impact of the losses (gains) arising from the Company's derivative financial instruments and DSUs, as well as the expense (recovery) associated with its SARs. These items arise from changes in the Company's share price as well as fluctuations in interest rates and are not reflective of the Company's core operations.  The Company also adjusts for any non-recurring charges (recoveries) recognized in net earnings. Management deems non-recurring charges (recoveries) to be unusual or infrequent items that the Company incurs outside of its common day-to-day operations. Adjusting for these items allows management to isolate and analyze diluted earnings per share from core business operations. For the periods presented, no non-recurring charges (recoveries) have been identified. *\"EBITDA\" is a commonly used metric in the dealership industry. EBITDA is calculated by adding interest on long-term debt, income taxes and depreciation to net earnings. Adding back non-operating expenses allows management to consistently compare periods by removing changes in tax rates, long-term assets and financing costs related to the Company's capital structure. *\"Adjusted EBITDA\" is calculated by eliminating from EBITDA, the impact of the losses (gains) arising from the Company's derivative financial instruments and DSUs, as well as the expense (recovery) associated with its SARs. These items arise from changes in the Company's share price as well as fluctuations in interest rates and are not reflective of the Company's core operations.  The Company also adjusts for any non-recurring charges (recoveries) recognized in EBITDA.  Management deems non-recurring charges (recoveries) to be unusual or infrequent items that the Company incurs outside of its common day-to-day operations. Adjusting for these items allows management to isolate and analyze EBITDA from core business operations. For the periods presented, no non-recurring charges (recoveries) have been identified. *\"Operating SG&A\" is calculated by eliminating from SG&A, the impact of the losses (gains) arising from the Company's derivative financial instruments and DSUs, as well as the expense (recovery) associated with its SARs. These items arise from changes in the Company's share price as well as fluctuations in interest rates and are not reflective of the Company's core operations.  The Company also adjusts for depreciation of property and equipment and any non-recurring charges (recoveries) recognized in SG&A. Management deems non-recurring charges (recoveries) to be unusual or infrequent items that the Company incurs outside of its common day-to-day operations. Adjusting for these items allows management to assess discretionary expenses from ongoing operations. For the periods presented, no non-recurring charges (recoveries) have been identified. We target a sub-10% Operating SG&A as a percentage of total sales on an annual basis.   During the year, the Company changed this metric such that the aforementioned charges (recoveries) on its derivative financial instruments, DSUs and SARs are also eliminated from SG&A in calculating Operating SG&A.  *\"Floor Plan Neutral Operating Cash Flow\" is calculated by eliminating the impact of the change in floor plan payable (excluding floor plan assumed pursuant to business combinations) from cash flows from operating activities. Adjusting cash flows from operating activities for changes in the balance of floor plan payable allows management to isolate and analyze operating cash flows during a period, prior to any sources or uses of cash associated with equipment financing decisions.  RECONCILIATION OF NON-IFRS MEASURES TO IFRS Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA  Operating SG&A  Floor Plan Neutral Operating Cash Flow  (1) - Includes change in floor plan payable classified as liabilities associated with assets held for sale.

In a physically rugged and draining Cup final, they beat South Africa 19-14 to claim the inaugural Canada Sevens in Vancouver. Led by the indefatigable DJ Forbes, New Zealand played a tactically smart game to stymie South Africa, who were the favourites, and win their third tournament out of six in the series. \"It was a huge team effort. I'm absolutely stoked,\" said man of the match Sam Dickson. New Zealand showed their hand with the inclusion of Liam Messam in the starting seven and proceeded to play it tight, mixing a short passing game with direct running and some judicious long kicking. And yet it was Rosko Specman who scored first for South Africa. He crossed the line but there was no clear evidence he had grounded the ball in the tackle of Kurt Baker and Sherwin Stowers. Not to worry, as Dickson hit back two minutes later, after Messam got on the outside of his man and timed the pass perfectly. Dickson then leapt two-handed to claim the kickoff, brilliantly, and set Baker away with the assist. New Zealand again looked composed but could not shake South Africa, but they had the bit between the teeth when Lewis Ormond scored out wide following a patient build-up of controlled sevens. At one point New Zealand had completed 43-7 passes to seven, which highlighted their manipulation of possession in the encounter. Seabelo Senatla scored almost at the death, but the kickoff sailed out on the full, handing New Zealand a gritty and well-thought-out victory, which leaves them just a point behind South Africa and two behind Fiji on the World Series standings. New Zealand 19 (Sam Dickson, Kurt Baker,Lewis Ormond tries; Gillies Kaka 2 con) South Africa 14 (Rosko Specman, Seabelo Senatla tries; Justin Geduld 2) NZME ##Story Name## Dmcfadden15 Successive defeats to begin the NRL season have not dented Andrew McFadden's belief in himself and the Warriors. McFadden was answering fans' criticism about losses to the Tigers and Broncos which have revved up the early-season calls for a coaching change. \"I don't waiver here. I am really determined and I am very confident with what we are doing,\" McFadden told the Crowd Goes Wild Breakfast. \"The pressure of being a coach is all part of the job so it is something I am more than willing to walk into.\" The game with the Broncos was strong on quality and very physical and both sides struggled to break down the other until the Warriors lost two outside backs to injury. \"They took advantage with two quick tries and we couldn't peg them back, they were too good.\" McFadden defended the Warriors' fitness and said injuries hurt their interchange roster. \"Both teams were gassed in the first half if you look at them. They got some momentum in the second half and took advantage of it. \"At the end of the game most of our guys were pretty exhausted.\" He was prepared for a week of mounting pressure as the Warriors prepared to host the Storm. The squad had to work hard and focus on what needed doing. \"There was a lot to like about our performance against Brisbane,\" he said. \"They were at full strength, they couldn't have been any more full strength than they were. It was a high quality game and they only just got over us in the last 15 minutes. \"We will get a lot of confidence out of that and if we had played a lot of most other teams we would have rolled over the top of them,\" McFadden declared. Patterns were still a little disjointed and players like Isaac Luke and Shaun Johnson would continue to improve as combinations gelled further. Johnson did not run the ball as much as the coaching staff wanted but those instincts would develop along with the team confidence. The effort was consistent against the Broncos but the team performance had to be more co-ordinated. McFadden said his side need to slug out a result to give them the impetus they needed. NZME ##Story Name## Dsailing15 Two medal-winning crews from the London Olympics headline the first batch of New Zealand sailors named for Rio yesterday. Olympic champions Jo Aleh and Polly Powrie will return to defend their 470 crown at the August Games, while four-time 49er world champions Peter Burling and Blair Tuke, who have not been beaten since claiming silver in Weymouth, were another feature of the announcement. The pair were among five crews Yachting New Zealand named yesterday - all in the double-handed classes. Alex Maloney and Molly Meech will represent New Zealand in the women's skiff event, which makes its Olympic debut in 2016, as does the mixed gender multihull Nacra 17 where Gemma Jones and Jason Saunders will compete. Paul Snow-Hansen and Daniel Willcox will race in the men's 470. New Zealand has qualified a berth in all 10 Olympic classes, with the remainder of the team to be named in May following key selection regattas in Europe. Yachting New Zealand's high performance director Jez Fanstone said the crews named today had worked hard over the past three seasons to ensure the decision for the selectors was a straight-forward one. \"They've had to prove that they are capable of performing to a high level on the world stage and doing so consistently, that's why it's so exciting being here today because those 10 people have done that, and I know they will continue to work hard over the next five months going into Rio,\" said Fanstone. Fanstone said all the sailors will head to Rio at least twice before the Olympic regatta in August to familiarise themselves with conditions and ensure they are comfortable with the venue. Burling, who will be attending his third Olympics after making his debut at just age 17 in Beijing, said it is still a special feeling being named in an Olympic team. \"You don't get too many chances to go to an Olympics in a lifetime, so it is always a massive privilege to be named,\" he said. \"We've got a really clear goal and that is to win gold in Rio. I think getting this [team naming] out of the way early gives us a lot of motivation and really helps us out to keep training and improving to make sure we reach that goal.\" For first-time Olympians Maloney and Meech, the confirmation they are heading to Rio was \"an amazing feeling\". \"It's a great feeling to have this milestone ticked off, and we're just really looking forward to the next six months,\" said Maloney. The single-handed classes are less clear-cut for the selectors, with a dog-fight brewing in both the Finn and Laser fleets for the one spot. Josh Junior and Andrew Murdoch are locked in a fascinating battle for the Finn spot, while in the Laser class Andy Maloney and Sam Meech are going head-to-head. Yachting New Zealand are unlikely to send representatives in the boardsailing and Laser Radial classes. NZME ##Story Name## Dblack sticks15 Black Sticks men's head coach, Colin Batch, has made four changes to his side for this week's four-test series against Korea at Lloyd Elsmore Hockey Stadium in Auckland. Following a series win over Malaysia in Tauranga, the Black Sticks continue their development in the lead up to the Rio Olympic Games in August. Veteran defender Bradley Shaw and striker Stephen Jenness come into the side, along with 18-year-old Central midfielder Hayden Phillips. Striker Simon Child captains the team of 18 and will bring up his 250th test for New Zealand in tomorrow's opening game against Korea at 7pm. Batch said it was an exciting time and the next four matches would further test their combinations and preparation. \"This is another strong group and we go into this series having answered a few questions of ourselves against Malaysia,\" Batch said. \"The addition of Bradley and Stephen will add another dynamic within the group, while we are really excited about seeing a fantastic young talent in Hayden test himself at senior international level. \"We have an open selection policy and aren't afraid to look at our options even at this stage of our campaign. The most important thing for us is that we are able to assess our players and find the best group to send to the Rio Olympics.\" Marcus Child, Jacob Smith and Jared Panchia come out of the extended team of 21 which played against Malaysia, along with defender Alex Shaw who had successful surgery on Thursday to repair a fractured cheek and eye socket he suffered in the third test. The Sticks play Korea tomorrow and Thursday at 7pm, with a further two games on Saturday and Sunday at 3pm. NZME ##Story Name## 15hulls Hawke's Bay Airport staff be warned ... beef up the security today. One of the biggest hauls of gold will pass through the gates. That's the five gold medals won by Hawke's Bay athletes Georgia Hulls and Briana Stephenson at the six-day Australian Junior Athletics Championships which ended in Perth on Sunday. Havelock North High School 16-year-old Hulls lowered her 200m qualification time of 23.98s for the July 20-24 World Junior Championships in Poland with her under-18 win in 23.80s on Friday. This was a world qualifying time by 0.2s and was 0.05s away from beating the New Zealand under-20 record. This time also smashed the Australian National Championship meet record by 0.15s. On Sunday she won gold in the under-18 100m with a time of 12.07s. \"I was hoping to lower my world championship qualifying time of 11.98s,\" Hulls said. \"With winds swirling about and and the temperature 37 degrees celsius conditions could have been better. Athletes feet were literally burning after races,\" Hull said. Hulls and her Hastings Athletics Club clubmate, Stephenson, combined with Brooke Somerfield of Tauranga and Aucklander Natasha Eady to win gold in the under-20 4 x 100m relay in convincing fashion with a time of 46.13s. Hulls ran the last leg and was five strides ahead of the second placegetter. \"I wasn't expecting the win because this isn't our usual team,\" Hull said afterwards. The fact the Kiwis' baton changes were so smooth reflected the training the team members had done with the New Zealand under-20 relay programme. Napier Girls High School 16-year-old Stephenson, who will be trialling for the New Zealand Secondary Schools netball team later this month, had earlier won golds in the under-18 high jump and long jump events. Her personal best high jump of 1.75m was just outside the qualifying standard for the world junior championships. Stephenson won her long jump with a dramatic last jump of 5.98m which was short of the 6.20m qualifying mark. ##Story Name## 15school Karamu High School's Nick Palmer was the standout performer at Wednesday's East Coast North Island secondary schools' athletics championship. Palmer won all three throwing events in his intermediate age group, easily surpassing the selection standard for next month's North Island championship in all three. His discus throw was 40.81m, shot put 15.40m and hammer 51.66m. They earned him the male athlete of the meeting award. Palmer's best shotput of 15.40m demolished the champs record of 14.87m, that Dannevirke's Jesse Quaife previously held, and made the North Island standard of 12.50m look laughable. His hammer throw added almost 10m to his own champs record set last year - a remarkable throw for an intermediate and further than the long-standing senior record Tane Edwards, of Hastings Boys' High set in 2001. Female athlete of the meeting award went to Woodford House's Eva Goodisson who won the senior 1500m and the open girls' 2000m steeplechase. The New Zealand secondary schools' steeplechase champion, Goodisson clocked 7:30.76 to win by a wide margin to eclipse her own East Coast champs record by about 17 seconds. She came within 0.4 of a second (4:50.71) of breaking the the 1500m record of former Napier Girls' High runner, Holly Mannin, who is studying in the United States on a scholarship. The outstanding newcomer award went to Briana Irving (Gisborne Girls' High ) who won the junior 1500m and 3000m. Irving finished second in the mixed junior boys' and girls' 3000m race behind Will Tidswell, of Havelock North High. Her time of 10:18.43 eclipsed schoolmate Olivia Corrin's record of 10:35:13 set in 2014. Putting that in perspective, Corrin a fortnight later smashed a North Island champs record. HNHS pupil Georgia Rathbone added 50cm to schoolmate Deborah Edwards' pole vault record, scaling the bar at 3m to win. Rathbone also won the intermediate high jump, clearing the bar at 1.54m. The other records on the day came in the girls' javelin events, which are in their third year with the new 500g weight for all age groups. Junior grade winner Johanna Neiwenhuis (CHB College) threw 26.94m (the old 600g record belonged to Dannevirke's Jennifer Greatbatch at 25.16m). Intermediate grade winner Teegan Geary (Woodford House) established a new mark of 35.82m, less than 3m behind the 600g record from 1981. Twenty-five colleges competed on Wednesday with 20 claiming titles. A team will now be selected to represent the region at the North Island secondary schools' champs at Mt Smart Stadium, Auckland, from April 1-3. - Steve Armon ##Story Name## briefs15 Briefly Dixon seventhMOTORSPORT: Defending champion, Aucklander Scott Dixon, finished seventh in the opening race of the new IndyCar season. Juan Pablo Montoya won the race for the second consecutive year to continue the Team Penske dominance on the streets of St Petersburg in Florida. The win by Montoya was the eighth in 12 tries for Penske drivers. Ploe-sitter Will Power withdrew before the start. Schwartzel master GOLF: South Africa's Charl Schwartzel has tuned up his bid for a second Masters title with a playoff victory in the US PGA Tour's Valspar Championship in Florida. The 2011 Masters champion closed with a four-under 67, the best score of the final round, and then beat American Bill Haas on the first extra hole at the Copperhead Course at Innisbrook Resort in Palm Harbour. Slater pulls outRUGBY LEAGUE: The under-siege Warriors have plenty to deal with - but that won't include Melbourne Storm fullback Billy Slater for their match at Mt Smart on Sunday. The 32-year-old's comeback from shoulder surgery has hit an early problem. Slater withdrew just before the Storm's round two match against the Titans on Sunday and is out indefinitely. Prop cited RUGBY: Wales prop Tomas Francis has been cited for allegedly making contact with the eyes of England counterpart Dan Cole during the Six Nations match at Twickenham. The citing commissioner also issued a warning to England flanker James Haskell for a neck-roll tackle early in the match which England won 25-21 on Saturday. Francis's disciplinary hearing will be held by an independent committee later this week. Not risking Coles RUGBY: The Hurricanes won't rush injured captain Dane Coles back into Super Rugby. The All Blacks hooker has made positive strides over the past few days, showing his calf strain may be fully healed to face the Western Force on Friday. However assistant coach Jason Holland says they're taking a cautious approach to his return. He says he had a run in the weekend and pulled up well, but things need to be 100 percent before they risk him. Julian Savea remains in a moon-boot but Holland is optimistic he'll play, while Nehe Milner-Skudder is still awaiting a scan on his dislocated shoulder. ##Story Name## DDDDAu Pair Story Teen tells of interrogation ordeal A FRENCH au pair who was deported from New Zealand and held in a jail cell overnight over fears she might work as a babysitter has told how she was given a dirty blanket, no pillow and just one slice of bread and an apple. Manon Pache, 18, spoke to the Herald from Italy yesterday, after returning to Europe following her ordeal. The teenager flew to New Zealand from the Gold Coast for a one-week visit in December with her employers Pip and Paul Johnston, their two children, aged 2 and 4, and Mr Johnston's parents. Ms Pache had been offered the option of accompanying the family on their holiday in Queenstown as a Christmas present from them. She was not expected to work and would not be paid during the trip. Once in the country, however, immigration officials at the Queenstown Airport noted the Johnstons were paying Ms Pache's travel and accommodation, and Ms Pache admitted during an interview she would undertake childminding, although she also maintained she would not be paid. \"They asked me are you going to work here and I said 'No, I'm not, I am going on holidays but if maybe one night they want to go for a couple's dinner to have a little time together, I am happy to stay with the girls',\" she said. The teen was taken into an interrogation room for questioning during which she maintained she would not be working for the family while in New Zealand. \"I didn't understand what was going on and I would never have thought this would happen. For me I was not going to work so I didn't need a working holiday visa. [The immigration officer] said to me 'I can't believe they paid for all this and you are not going to work for them'. \"In the end I was crying and asking but why and I didn't understand. \"[Then] he said you are going to sleep at the police station because we cannot hold you in the airport for the night.\" Escorted by a police officer, Ms Pache was taken to the local police station where her belongings, including her cellphone and any items she had on her person, were confiscated. \"It was terrible. I asked them why they were punishing me because I didn't do anything wrong. I said I didn't want to sleep there but they told me I had no choice. \"I asked for a blanket and a pillow ... because it was freezing cold ... and they said sorry we don't have that here. [Eventually] they gave me a blanket and it was dirty and smelly and they didn't have any pillow. I didn't eat since the day before because I didn't have time because of the flights and everything so I asked [an officer] for some dinner and they came out with a piece of bread and an apple.\" Ms Pache was permitted to call the Johnstons and inform them of her whereabouts. \"[Mrs Johnston] didn't know I was in the police cell, nobody called her. Pip was so angry. Then I asked to call the French embassy and one of the police officers said it wouldn't be worth it because it would be closed.\" The next morning at midday the teen was taken back to the airport where she was put on a flight back to Australia. She said she was given no reassurances that she would be sent back to the Gold Coast where she had arrived from and was instead told it would be her problem to find her way back to where she was staying if she was sent elsewhere. \"I told them I didn't have the money to fly [back to the Gold Coast] I can't afford it and I said you have to send me back where I came from, I don't know anyone in Australia, I don't have any family, what am I going to do? \"Then I got lucky because the guy that was going to print my ticket was actually a French guy from my high school and ... he helped me and found me a flight to the Gold Coast.\" Ms Pache, who returned to her hometown in France last month, has since received a letter of apology from Immigration New Zealand.

Now while you're still silently mouthing how to say the latter, the former is pronounced \"zwhy - geld\" (sort of) and according to Wikipedia, it's also known as Rotburger and should not be confused with Rotberger.

The Black Caps seamer, returning from a right shoulder cuff injury, is a timely return for the Devon Hotel-sponsored Stags who are seeking their second victory in the Budget Rental Plunket Shield competition. \"Dougie's coming back not 100 per cent for bowling so we're going to manage his loads but, from a batting perspective, he's already 100 per cent,\" CD coach Heinrich Malan said last night from Hamilton before they play the SkyCity Northern Districts Knights at Seddon Park from 10.30am today. In the other changes, Dean Robinson, of Taranaki, returns to the fray after a lean patch as an opening batsman following injury to Ben Smith, of Wanganui. In the narrow loss away to Mondiale Auckland Aces in the previous round, the Stags had an A&E Department look about their playing roster. Middle-order batsman George Worker, promoted to open in place of Smith in the second innings, left the field with a season-ending broken hand. Manawatu rookie Mitch Renwick showed potential but this is an opportune time for in-and-out Robinson to put his hand up with Greg Hay and Smith, who is the second highest run scorer in the shield competition, still in the equation. Seamer Liam Dudding, of Hawke's Bay, also comes into Malan's matrix after a solid display in the provincial side's six-wicket loss to Bay of Plenty in the Hawke Cup match in Napier at the weekend. \"Liam is someone we had identified during the Chapple Cup competition [late last October],\" Malan said of Dudding who was 12th man in the last round but with Navin Patel and Kurt Richards unavailable he could be making his debut. Like Robinson, he sees Dudding's chances as a window of opportunity through injuries. ND and CD sit on equal 56 points in fourth and fifth places, respectively, on the table, with the net run rate favouring the hosts today. They will be without hamstrung strike bowler Scott Kuggeleijn, who is the highest wicket taker on 34 in the format, with CD spinner Ajaz Patel three behind. Patel epitomises a summer where tweakers are up there with seamers as Jeetan Patel, Tarun Nethula, Todd Astle and Ish Sodhi push for honours. Malan said Ajaz Patel had embraced his role well in a two-year project to recognise the variables of two innings in a match and what approach was required from day one to four in a first-class match. \"He has confidence in what to do and has taken ownership.\" ND coach James Pamment said he had watched Patel closely in the past few games and his organisational skills stood out. \"He's been asking some difficult questions so it doesn't matter what type of surface he plays on he'll test the skill and patience of batsmen,\" said Pamment who said if Northern Districts won the toss they would consider factors such as cloud cover that would offer swing and prompt thoughts of bowling first. He was mindful of Bracewell \"returning home to ND\". \"It doesn't matter if he's 50 per cent or 100 per cent, he's always a good bowler ...\" Pamment said ND were feeding off the buzz from BOP's Hawke Cup victory. After the win, Brett Hampton got a recall to ND, which boasts five players from BOP, never mind those in the Black Caps squad. Asked what was paramount in the game from today, ex-BOP coach Pamment replied: \"We want to win.\" ##Story Name## Dworld cup15 Two men who could be the most significant figures in New Zealand's World T20 cricket opener this week had good workouts over the weekend. New Zealand lost their second and final warm-up game by six wickets to England in Mumbai but thumped Sri Lanka by 74 runs in their first. All four wickets went to spinners Mitchell Santner and Nathan McCullum, and there were handy figures too, Santner taking 2-24, McCullum 2-25, off their four overs as England reached 170/4 to win with four balls to spare. New Zealand face India in Nagpur early tomorrow morning (NZT) and the strong expectation is there will be support for the spinners. Worryingly, New Zealand got into a bind against England's slow men, legspinner Adil Rashid (3-15 off four overs) and offspinner Moeen Ali. With captain Kane Williamson flying to 63 off 39 balls, New Zealand were 78/1 at seven overs, but 101/2 at 10 became 123/5 at 15, as the batsmen became befuddled. No one else reached 20, then England openers Jason Roy (55) and Alex Hales (44) got their side into a solid position. They needed 42 off the last four overs, 20 off the last two and wicketkeeper Jos Buttler (24 not out off nine balls) saw them home. \"It's definitely tougher over here against spinners but everyone's got their own game plan against spin, whether using their feet or going back in the box,\" Santner said. \"We're pretty confident with our batters that, confronted with spin, they can play all right.\" Santner didn't see the loss as reason for concern. \"It was a good hit-out. Obviously there's aspects we want to work on but good things came out of it. \"We're pretty happy with the performance.\" NZME ##Story Name## 15bothcrickteamz Skycity Northern Knights v Devon Hotel Central Districts Stags for rd 8 of the Budget Rental Plunket Shield match at Seddon Park, Hamilton, from today: ?ND KNIGHTS: Daniel Flynn (c, BOP), James Baker (Hamilton), Dean Brownlie (BOP), Anton Devcich (Hamilton), Zak Gibson (Waikato), Tony Goodin (BOP), Brett Hampton (BOP), Daryl Mitchell (Hamilton), Bharat Popli (BOP), Tim Seifert (wkt, Waikato), Joe Walker (Hamilton), BJ Watling (Hamilton). ?CD STAGS: Will Young (c, Taranaki), Doug Bracewell (Hawke's Bay), Tom Bruce (Taranaki), Dane Cleaver (wkt, Manawatu), Liam Dudding (Hawke's Bay), Greg Hay (Nelson), Ajaz Patel (Hawke's Bay), Mitch Renwick (Manawatu), Dean Robinson (Taranaki), Bevan Small (Manawatu), Ben Smith (Wanganui), Blair Tickner (Hawke's Bay).

West Ham playmaker Dimitri Payet looked to be sending the 11-times Cup winners tumbling out of the competition with a stunning, 30-metre curling free kick in the 68th minute. But with time running out, United's young French starlet Martial hooked Ander Herrera's cross on the volley back into the net from the narrowest of angles. Just like holders Arsenal's exit earlier yesterday in a 2-1 home defeat by Watford that heaped more pressure on manager Arsene Wenger, a United exit would have raised more questions about the future of boss Louis van Gaal. With United 2-0 down after a dismal first leg performance in their Europa League last 16 tie with Liverpool on Friday and 13 points adrift of Leicester City in the Premier League title race, Martial's strike offered blessed relief for Van Gaal. \"I am very happy that my team showed their spirit after a nasty week,\" a relieved Van Gaal told BT Sport. \"We have played a game against Liverpool on Thursday and they (West Ham) had the whole week to prepare. I have to give a lot of compliments to my team. They were mentally tired after Liverpool and also in the body.\" Both Van Gaal and his West Ham counterpart Slaven Bilic agreed it had been a thrilling finale, with Payet's extraordinary skill with the dead ball decorating proceedings. \"It was one of the best free kicks I've scored, and to score in one of the most beautiful stadiums in the league, it's a great day for me,\" said Payet. Now, United face a tough task in a replay. Reuters ##Story Name## 15bowlshavelock The Havelock North Bowling Club is turning 100 years old in October and celebrations are in the pipeline to make it a memorable one. \"We're a vibrant family club and very much part of the community,\" says club publicity officer Ivan Hill before the club marks its centennial celebrations on Labour Day weekend of October 21 to 23. \"Anyone can come to our centenary celebrations,\" said Hill of the club that has 186 members, comprising about one-third who are female players. He says the plan is to entice people from around the country and even overseas who may have had an affiliation with the club in any shape or form. \"They could have been people who have visited the club to take part in competitions or even known our members,\" he said. The club is still in the process of trying to list dignitaries and details on what will be staged at its location in the heart of the village down Porter Drive. It's humble beginnings is steeped in Hawke's Bay history. The Havelock North Sports Association acquired eight acres (3.2ha) of Lucknow Estate land in 1909 initially as a recreational spot, according to research a club member, Robyn Phillips, conducted in 2010. Alongside the priority of ploughing the prime property for rugby and cricket was setting aside a parcel of land for cultivating a decent bowling green. \"This did not eventuate and in 1916 the present site in Porter Drive was sold to the club by JH Joll at eight per cent interest,\" says Phillips in her research. That purchase spawned a croquet, tennis and bowling club as well as the establishment of the first committee. It was a labour of love with myriad grass types sown in the quest for an ideal surface and water was drawn from the Lucknow Rd Creek to help cultivate the greens. \"Members used pitch forks to aerate as mechanical machines did not go deep enough,\" she says. It wasn't until 1944 that the Havelock North Ladies Bowling Club was established. Says Hill: \"Uniform consisted of white frocks to be worn at a certain length and was measured regularly.\" Jewellery was a no-no amid strict etiquette that also prevented females from playing with males. Men were allowed to wear shorts at an AGM in 1963. The club rooms were extended in 1972 and facilities upgraded. A year later water was discovered near the greens and a well was sunk. Havelock North was the first club in the province in 1986 but a decade later it was replaced. Today it has two world-class Dale carpet greens. The men and women's clubs were amalgamated in 1999, giving rise to new uniforms. The club has hosted the Astrograss National Winter Bowls and NZ Blind Bowls championships. It lays claim to having the longest continuous playing record of all Havelock North sporting teams dating back to 1904. Each February it open doors to 32 teams to compete in its business house competitions held over six weeks. ##Story Name## 15cheater French tennis player Kristina Mladenovic has launched a scathing attack on Maria Sharapova, saying the four-time grand slam winner is just a cheater and everybody on the tour knows it. \"All the other players are saying she's a cheater,\" Mladenovic told French newspaper Le Parisien. \"You sure doubt and think that she didn't deserve all she won until now. \"That's dreadful, but it's good that it's finally out. \"As far as I am concerned if I take an aspirin I worry 10 times about what I do. \"She's been taking this drug for 10 years and it's a serious drug. \"She has played with the rules and thought, if it's not banned, then I can take it. \"For me that's very disappointing. \"I don't like the mentality to be the best by playing with the rules.\" Sharapova tested positive to meldonium during the Australian Open in January. The former world No1 has taken the medication over the past 10 years and claims it was used to combat flu-like symptoms and reduce the risk of diabetes. She also denied she was warned five times about meldonium being banned, a mitigating factor her lawyer John J Haggerty believes can see her escape punishment. Sharapova took to Facebook on Sunday to defend herself against claims she had adequate warning about the implications of taking meldonium. \"In order to be aware of this warning you had to open an email with a subject line having nothing to do with anti-doping, click on a web page, enter a password, enter a username, hunt, click, hunt, click, hunt, click, scroll and read,\" she wrote. \"There was also a wallet card distributed at various tournaments at the beginning of 2016, after the ban went into effect. This document had thousands of words on it, many of them technical, in small print. Should I have studied it? Yes. But if you saw this document (attached) you would know what I mean.\" But the 22-year-old Mladenovic feels no sympathy. \"She can play with words and find a good lawyer but, on the principles of the situation, she's wrong,\" Mladenovic said. \"She has no excuse that can defend what she's done.\" AAP ##Story Name## 15respak AthleticsFrom the Napier club track-and-field meeting at Marewa Park, last Wednesday: Boys 7yrs: 60m Jack Litherland 1, Charlie Allan 2, Martin Bickers, 3 Isaac Allan 4; 100m Jack Litherland (18.81) 1, Charlie Allan (18.83) 2, Martin Bickers (20.82) 3; long jump Charlie Allan (2.82) 1, Jack Litherland (2.72) 2, Martin Bickers (2.32) 3. 8yrs: 60m Jett O'Brien (12.92) 1, Sam McHale (13.10) 2, Phoenix Turner 13.37) 3; 100m Jett O'Brien (16.48) 1, Phoenix Turner (16.73) 2, Sam McHale (17.36) 3; shotput Phoenix Turner (7.57) 1, Jett O'Brien (5.57) 2, Luke Hawkins (5.40) 3. 9yrs: 60m Joseph Hay-Mackenzie (13.37)1, Freddie Saltar (13.46) 2; 100m Joseph Hay-Mackenzie (16.88) 1, Freddie Saltar (17.69) 2; discus: Joseph Hay-Mackenzie (11.91) 1, Freddie Saltar (9.87) 2. 10yrs: 100m Ryan Shotter (14.14) 1, Cohen Batterham (15.08) 2; 400m Cohen Batterham (1m 16) 1; long jump Ryan Shotter (4.68) 1, Cohen Batterham (4.14) 2, Kahn Grigsby (2.93) 3; discus Ryan Shotter (21.54) 1. 12yrs: 100m Coby Price (15.18) 1, Daniel Wallace (17.99) 2; 400m Coby Price (1m 15) 1, Daniel Wallace (1m 31) 2; shotput Cameron Dawson (8.31) 1; high jump Coby Price (1.25) 1, Daniel Wallace (1.15) 2, Cameron Dawson (1.15) 3. 14yrs: 100m Ronan Brown (14.43) 1; 400m Ronan Brown (1m 11) 1; high jump Ronan Brown (1.20) 1.

Australian Broadcasting Corporation television reporter Linton Besser and camera operator Louie Eroglu were arrested in the city of Kuching on Saturday after approaching Prime Minister Najib Razak on the street. They were detained by Malaysian police for six hours and told to remain in Kuching while authorities decided whether they should be charged, ABC said. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop suggested the detention was part of a Malaysian crackdown on press freedom and said Australia was raising their case at the \"highest levels within the Malaysian government.\" \"I'm always concerned where there are instances of a crackdown on freedom of speech in democracies, particularly, and I'm also concerned about the freedom that journalists have to carry out their work in places around the world,\" Bishop said. The Malaysian news agency Bernama cited police chief Khalid Abu Bakar as saying officials would discuss with Attorney-General Mohamed Apandi Ali whether to charge the pair. AP ##Story Name## DDDDEu Turkey Explosion A suicide car bomb went off near bus stops in the heart of Turkey's capital yesterday, killing at least 34 people and wounding around 125 others, officials said. Two of the dead are believed to be the assailants. A senior government official told The Associated Press that police suspect that Kurdish militants carried out the attack, which occurred on Ankara's main boulevard, close to ministries. At least one of the bombers was a woman, he said. The official spoke on condition of anonymity on the grounds that the investigation was ongoing. The bombing was the third in the city in five months and came as Turkey is grappling with a host of issues, including renewed fighting with Kurdish rebels, threats from the Islamic State group and a Syrian refugee crisis. Earlier, Turkish authorities said they were imposing curfews on two mainly Kurdish towns where Turkey's security forces were set to launch large-scale operations against Kurdish militants. Russia also accused Turkey of sending its military across the Syrian border to prevent Kurdish groups from consolidating their positions. The attack came just three weeks after a suicide car bombing in the capital targeted buses carrying military personnel, killing 29 people. A Kurdish militant group which is an offshoot of an outlawed rebel group, the Kurdistan Workers' Party , or PKK, claimed responsibility for the February 17 attack. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan issued a statement vowing to bring \"terrorism to its knees\" and said Turkey would use its right to self-defence to prevent future attacks. \"Our people should not worry, the struggle against terrorism will for certain end in success and terrorism will be brought to its knees,\" Erdogan said. Saudi state television said that a Saudi woman and three children were among those wounded in the attack. Saudi Arabia's King Salman condemned the bombing and extended his condolences to the Turkish people, according to the state-run Saudi news channel Al-Ekhbaria. At least 19 of the wounded were in serious condition, Health Minister Mehmet Muezzinoglu said. He said that 30 of the victims died at the scene. Interior Minister Efkan Ala said the attack wouldn't deter the country from its fight against terrorism. He confirmed the blast was the result of a car bomb at bus stops close to Kizilay square. Ala said authorities had evidence pointing to the group behind the attack, but said an announcement would be made after an investigation. AP ##Story Name## DDDbriefs Presidential protestBRAZIL: Brazilians ratcheted up the heat for embattled President Dilma Rousseff yesterday, turning out by the tens of thousands for demonstrations across the country calling for her ousting. The biggest protest took place in Brazil's economic capital, Sao Paulo, a bastion of simmering dissatisfaction with Rousseff and her governing Workers' Party. The respected Datafolha polling agency estimated about 500,000 people took part in the Sao Paulo demonstration, while police estimates put turnout at nearly three times that number. Trump ignores clashes US: Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump is refusing to take responsibility for clashes at his campaign events and has criticised protesters who have dogged his rallies and forced him to cancel one in Chicago last week. When a protester interrupted his speech yesterday at an airport hangar in Bloomington, Illinois, minutes after it began, Trump derided him as a \"disrupter\" and told the cheering crowd: \"Don't worry about it - I don't hear their voice.\" \"Our rallies are so big and we have so many people, I never hear their voices. I only hear our people's voices saying: 'There they are, there they are,\"' the billionaire businessman said as the audience roared approval and some 2000 protesters waited outside. Expensive vote AUSTRALIA: A study estimating a plebiscite on same-sex marriage would cost more than A$500 million is \"skewed\", conservative senator Eric Abetz claims. The Liberal senator criticised the research by accounting firm PwC Australia, which found a compulsory vote on marriage equality would cost the Australian economy A$525 million. It estimates that a plebiscite not held on the same day as a federal election would cost the taxpayer A$158 million to organise, A$66 million for the community to fund the for and against campaigns and A$281 million in lost productivity as people take time out to vote. Officer killedUS: A US police officer has died after a gunman opened fire on a Prince George's County police station in the Maryland suburb of Washington in what authorities say was an unprovoked attack. The accused gunman suffered non-life-threatening injuries in an ensuing gunfight with officers, and is being treated at a nearby hospital, police say. The second suspect was taken into custody a short time later. ##Story Name## ddddpacaust aid to fiji helps Aid helps relationsAustralia's multi-million dollar aid commitment to Fiji is helping to boost once-terse relations with its Pacific neighbour. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop (left) held formal talks with Fijian Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama (right) in Suva yesterday. The duo discussed how Australian soldiers helping to restore storm-ravaged regions of Fiji after Cyclone Winston would remain for the long-term. The formal meeting was the first since 2014, when Canberra moved to normalise relations a month after Fijian elections confirmed the military leader's rule. Travel bans for all members of the Fijian government imposed after the 2006 coup were lifted. Bishop says the cyclone recovery partnership struck over the last three weeks shows why it's important for Australia to maintain strong and close ties with Fiji. \"Our defence engagement is strong. We are looking to increase trade and investment. \"We are supporting Fiji in development assistance,\" she told reporters. ##Story Name## 15Quality-Inn A 30-year lease on the 60-room Quality Inn Napier on Marine Parade is up for grabs, with the asking price $1.2 million and annual rental of between $440,000 to $460,000. It was built in the 1970s as the Napier Travel Inn and its last refurbishment in 2013 lifted it to a four-and-a-half star Qualmark rating. Bayleys agent Bill Brown said revenue out-performed market averages, rising 8.6 per cent and profit 11.5 per cent in the 2014/15 financial year compared with the previous year. The increase was mainly due to increased patronage. Statistics New Zealand figures show international visitors for the 2015 calendar year were up 16.1 per cent on 2014. Domestic guest nights rose 4.6 per cent for the same period. He said it was the preferred accommodation provider in Napier for government departments such as the police, the ACC and the Department of Conservation. Corporate clients included Air New Zealand , ANZ bank and DB Breweries . Annual rent depended on accommodation revenue. A 56-seat restaurant and bar underneath some of the Quality Inn Napier's waterfront-facing rooms was separately tenanted. \"The hotel already has strong advance booking numbers right through until Christmas - thereby delivering an instant cash-flow to any new ownership,\" Mr Brown said. \"A number of competing accommodation properties in Napier have chosen to take profits out of their businesses over the past decade in periods when times were good. In contrast, Quality Inn has re-invested a considerable portion of its profits back into its operations through maintenance and marketing. \"That strategy has paid off - with the property consistently recording above-average occupancy rates compared to several other hotels which have, in effect, become run-down and are now missing out on corporate bookings which demand higher levels of accommodation.\" ##Story Name## DBds-world Week Ahead Fed Meet Monetary meeting set for intense market scrutiny FOLLOWING hot on the heels of European Central Bank President Mario Draghi's more-generous-than-expected additional stimulus measures, US Federal Reserve policy makers gather tomorrow for their much-anticipated two-day meeting. However, the message from Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen is expected to be very different than Draghi's as a recent string of better-than-expected US economic data has made investors realise multiple US rate hikes might be on the menu this year after all. \"Financial markets for a while were completely out in the weeds, running around looking at things that turned out not to be real risk,\" Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank, said. The Federal Open Market Committee ends its two-day meeting on Thursday, and investors will scrutinise its statement and economic projections, as well as comments during a press conference by Yellen. \"It's going to be a session with parsing individual words in the statement about how likely the market believes the Fed is to move, how quickly they are going to move for the next hike,\" said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital Associates in Greenwood, South Carolina. Last week, markets on both sides of the Atlantic rallied. In Europe, a 2.6 per cent rise in the Stoxx 600 index helped it post a gain of 0.1 per cent for the week. The initial leap in the wake of Draghi's fresh rate cuts and additional bond-buying, announced on Friday, faded as soon as he told reporters in a post-decision news conference that he saw no future rate cuts. \"Draghi made the mistake of essentially saying that the ECB [European Central Bank ] was done with stimulus,\" said Teis Knuthsen, chief investment officer at Saxo Bank's private-banking unit in Hellerup, Denmark. \"At the end of the day, the ECB delivered more than expected and is pumping a lot of money into the system. A few years ago this would have marked the start of a significant rally, but now there seems to be a widespread fatigue with monetary policy.\" Wall Street gained too, last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1.3 per cent, while the Standard & Poor's 500 Index climbed 1.6 per cent, and the Nasdaq Composite Index increased 1.9 per cent. The advance helped Wall Street to post a gain for the week, with the Dow up 1.2 per cent, while the S&P 500 up 1.1 per cent, and the Nasdaq up 0.7 per cent. This week will also offer meetings and policy decisions at the Bank of Japan today and the Bank of England , on Friday. Meanwhile People Bank of China's governor Zhou Xiaochuan last week said the central bank would maintain a \"prudent\" policy. He also noted a gradual \"return to normalcy and rationality\" in the yuan. \"The current monetary policy is prudent with a slight loosening bias,\" Zhou said in Beijing on Sunday on the sidelines of the annual parliament session. \"We also want to stress that monetary policy should be adjusted dynamically depending on the judgment towards the economic situation.\" In Britain, Finance Minister George Osborne will announce plans tomorrow to sell ?16 billion worth of bank assets which were rescued from Bradford & Bingley by the government during the 2008 financial crisis. The UK budget also will be announced this week. BusinessDesk ##Story Name## lklk Mining giant Rio Tinto plans to cut around 170 jobs at its Pilbara operations in Western Australia over the next few months, unions have been told. The Western Mineworkers Alliance (WMWA), which represents workers at Rio's Pilbara operations, says it had been informed about the proposed job losses, and was in talks with Rio's management on the best way to handle them. \"Job cuts are never good news. However, given the current industry climate, the news is unfortunately not surprising,\" union representative Stephen Price said in a statement. \"Through our discussions with Rio we understand that most of the job losses will come from support roles.\" The WMWA expects about 300 roles will also be cut from Rio's Perth offices, but no details have been announced yet. AAP ##Story Name## Dbiz briefz Growth rebound in Q4The New Zealand economy may have extended its rebound in the fourth quarter, confirming growth accelerated after a weak first half in 2015. Gross domestic product rose 0.7 per cent in the final three months of 2015, based on market consensus and the Reserve Bank, which is projecting that rate of growth, on average through until March 2019. The economy probably expanded 2.1 per cent in the year.Annum launched in NZFonterra yesterday launched its international infant formula brand, Anmum, in New Zealand, and said it wants to become one of the top three brands in the $76.9 million local market within three or four years. Fonterra Brands New Zealand managing director Leon Clement said Anmum was already a $200 million established brand in Fonterra's Asian markets and paediatric nutrition was the fastest-growing dairy category in the world. Services sector expandsNew Zealand's services sector activity expanded at a faster pace in February, as a better employment outlook made up for a deteriorating jobs picture among manufacturers. The BNZ-BusinessNZ performance of services index rose 1.5 points to a seasonally adjusted 56.9 last month, snapping two declines. The series has been above 50, which separates expansion from contraction, for five-and-a-half years. Among the sub-indices, employment increased 2.4 points to 53.5. That's in contrast to a contraction in employment in the PSI's sister survey, the performance of manufacturing index released on Friday. Greece's refugee costThe cost of managing the migrant crisis in Greece will exceed a previous estimate of ?600 million ($991 million) as more and more refugees are forced to remain in the country, Bank of Greece Governor Yannis Stournaras said. More than 41,000 refugees and migrants are stranded in Greece, their plans to travel north blocked by border shutdowns throughout the Balkans. ##Story Name## DDBds-nz Calf Prices Hit Recor Prices for weaned calves at the start of the new sales season in New Zealand are hitting record highs amid increased demand and lower supply. Sales of six-month-old weaner steers and heifers this month at Stortford Lodge in Hastings, an early benchmark ahead of the peak sales period in April, rose between 17 and 29 per cent on 2015, which was itself at record levels, according to AgriHQ. Weaner sales generally finish early May. Farmers who shed stock ahead of summer last year on concern about the impact of a dry El Nino weather pattern were now seeking to restock as rain in many areas through January stimulated pasture growth. Cow numbers are also declining, with industry body Beef + Lamb New Zealand forecasting the national breeding cow herd fell below 1 million for the first time last year. That led to fewer weaner calves being born last spring with early estimates forecasting a drop of 50,000 head to 1.043 million, according to AgriHQ's 'Weaner Fair Outlook 2016' report. \"There is just so much demand for the cattle,\" said AgriHQ analyst Mel Croad, who authored the report. The first two Stortford Lodge fairs in early March mustered just over 1250 head, close to 200 head down on 2015 volumes. Some 49 per cent of the 445 steers made more than $1000 a head, with a top price of $1125 for a line of 280kg South Devon cross. That compares with the corresponding sale in 2015 when the highest exotic steer price was $940 a head, which Croad said was \"phenomenal\" growth. The average exotic steer price in the first sale of 2016 was $892 a head, up from $765 a head last year despite weights being back 12kg on last year. At the traditional steer fair the following day, 41 per cent of the 737 head surpassed the $1000 head mark, with the top price of $1170 a head going to a line of 280kg Angus and Angus-Hereford steers. That compared with a top price last year of $905 a head for 297kg Angus steers. The average price in the traditional breeds sale was $920 a head, well up on the average in 2015 of $712 a head.BusinessDesk ##Story Name## 15Drew Hawke's Bay Today's newest columnist is New Zealand Institute of Economic Research economist Aaron Drew, who has moved to Hawke's Bay to also be chief investment officer with Hastings-based wealth manager Stewart Financial Group. Mr Drew has previously managed modelling and research teams with the Reserve Bank of New Zealand and was a consultant to the IMF and spent four years in France as an OECD economist. He spent seven years with the New Zealand Superannuation Fund, where he developed asset and investment strategies and was a member of its investment committee. FONTERRA expects to pay out $3.90 per kg/MS for the upcoming season. At these levels the majority of dairy farms in New Zealand will struggle to cover their operating costs, which DairyNZ estimates is around $5.25 for the average farm, let alone the cost of debt servicing. The hope is that prices will recover to limit distress in the sector, and spill-over risks to the rest of the economy. The interest rate cut last week by the RBNZ to record lows illustrates they are concerned, and history also does not provide much comfort. From a statistical perspective commodity prices are what economists call a \"near random walk\". The fundamental drivers of demand and supply conditions only weakly exert their impact on prices over a long-term horizon. Over shorter timeframes, which may run into several years, the best guess of tomorrow's price is the price observed today. Present dairy price levels are unsustainable, and any meaningful cut back from our shores should raise world prices. Should is the operative word. Oil drilling activity on North American shale grounds has declined a massive 40 per cent since the peak in 2014, but despite these resources being the world's key marginal supply source oil prices remain below their break-even costs. Many other hard commodity prices remain in the doldrums. From an investment perspective there are several lessons that can be drawn from this experience. The first is to avoid the trap of assuming favourable long-term demand trends translate to ever-increasing prices. Time and time again history suggests that high profitability levels for commodity producers do not last forever - supply eventually catches up. This seems obvious, but the lesson appeared to have been forgotten in the euphoria of the Chinese demand story. Dairy farm prices rose steadily with pay-out levels. NZIER modelling of dairy farms suggests dairy land prices still embed a strong recovery of payout levels over the medium term. The second lesson is to take \"expert\" forecasts with a grain of salt and ensure that an investment proposition remains viable under a range of downside risks. Would dairy farmers have taken on as much debt, or banks have been as prepared to lend, if they had of put more stock in sustained low pay-out risk scenarios? Finally, sometimes the best thing to do is sit on the sidelines. It is notable that the New Zealand Superannuation Fund made most of its dairy farming investments over 2010 to 2012 when dairy farm prices were considerably lower. We should feel for the younger dairy farmer who felt compelled to jump into the first farm on the fear of forever missing out. We should hope that the prospective first-time property buyer in Auckland is paying attention. ##Story Name## 14Workshops Two morning workshops this week, one with a free breakfast, will prepare employers for tough legislation changing the business landscape, the Health and Safety at Work Act, which comes into effect on April 4. Wednesday's Crowe Horwath workshop in Hastings is presented by Kate Ashcroft from Copeland Ashcroft Law. Friday's Napier workshop and breakfast has four presenters at the Hawke's Bay Business Hub. BDO Central HR consultant Kimberly McKay will speak on changing a company's health and safety culture. Bramwell Grossman lawyer Scott Smith will explain jargon and discuss liability.

It was to be one of New Zealand's largest and most advanced medical practices, including after-hours emergency care. With patients retaining their existing healthcare relationship the new centre was planned to employ 40 doctors, 50 nurses and 70 other staff for 38,000 patients. The current Bunnings site in King St was purchased for the centre by Big Tree Development Ltd, a company 64 per cent owned by Hastings Health Centre and 36 per cent owned by Totara Health. A completion date for 2017 was announced April last year but last month Totara Health general manager, also a shareholder in the company, said it was \"very early days for the project\" and plans were still being considered. She confirmed the project cancellation after further questions from Hawke's Bay Today. \"Medical rooms are an expensive build and the numbers didn't work,\" she said. \"One of the critical aspects of the integration was the financial implications for both organisations. \"After careful consideration and a significant amount of work, we have agreed that the financial implications do not work for either organisation in the current health economic environment. \"We will continue to work together as part of the Hawke's Bay health sector to improve the health of our enrolled populations.\" Health Board chief executive Dr Kevin Snee said similar developments have been tried many times, both nationally and internationally, \"and often don't happen because of the complexity involved, despite the best intentions of everyone\". He said it wasn't a wasted exercise. \"I am optimistic the learnings and knowledge gained can be applied to other initiatives such as a health and social care network concept the district health board is working on,\" he said. \"These networks will bring all sorts of health and social care organisations together to form a kind of community health hub for different communities in Hawke's Bay.\" Hastings Health Centre chief executive Hayley Anderson has resigned and an interim chief executive appointed in her place. Ms Anderson's replacement will be former Hawke's Bay District Health Board general manager of planning and performance Andrew Lesperance, currently working in the South Island. Ms Foster said no decision had been made on what to do with the King St site. ##Story Name## 15chatterbox Our story \"Ratepayers may get say on water deal\" has prompted the following comments on the Hawke's Bay Today website. Purplehaze: This is a staggering amount of money and it's not the HBRC's money, it's ratepayers' money. It is therefore right and proper that ratepayers be consulted. And if the answer is no, then that should be the end of the matter. Whether HBRC respects a democratic decision remains to be seen, of course. Kim: Audit New Zealand needs to get more involved here and find out answers as to why this happened. Does the Hawke's Bay Regional Council CEO, Andrew Newman, actually know what he is doing and what the rules are for consultation with regard to public money? Or was it the hapless five - Chairman Fenton Wilson, Christine Scott, Alan Dick, Debbie Hewitt and Dave Pipe who voted for something that needed public consultation? Either way this has shown very clearly the Hawke's Bay Regional Council doesn't know what it is - and is not - allowed to do with public money and surely that is of major concern to every person in Hawke's Bay. This is tens of millions of dollars of our money that these wombles don't know what they are doing with. ##Story Name## 15bible quote ?O Lord ... be not silent. Do not be far from me, O Lord.

We in New Zealand are good at biology. We did not invent the green revolution - we can thank Nobel Prize winner Norman Borlaug for that - but we did adapt the technologies to our advantage. The new age of genetics has opened up unparalleled opportunities. The question for us is can we adapt this science on offer and maintain our leadership? Will we be allowed to? We have many farming systems in New Zealand from organics to precision agriculture. But there is one tool of biotechnology we dare not use and that is genetic modification. At least we dare not to admit we use it and certainly no crop or animal has made it to release through the tough laws we have here. However GM technology, where it has been approved, has been taken up enthusiastically by farmers. In the United States the uptake has been dramatic - from no crops in 1996 to over 90% of all corn, cotton and soybean in 2014. Compare that with organics which over the same time and with the same opportunity has barely reached one per cent of hectares grown. According to the ISAAA over 18 million farmers in 28 countries planted a record 181 million hectares of biotech crops in 2014. A global meta- analysis of 147 studies over 20 years indicates that biotech crops have on average reduced chemical pesticide use by 37%, increased crop yields by 22% and farmer profits by 68%. The reduction in CO2 production in 2013 alone because of biotech crops was equivalent to taking 12 million cars off the road while production increases have effectively saved 132 million hectares of land for conservation biodiversity. Is this a future to be feared? Perhaps. Any casual search of the internet will reveal farmer suicides in India, cattle dying in Germany, rats developing tumours in France, pigs with inflamed stomachs, poor yields and allergies - all from GM crops and the list goes on. We have also heard that our markets will be destroyed if we use any GM in New Zealand and that coexistence of GM and non GM is not possible. Federated Farmers supports all forms of agriculture from organics to modern biotechnology. It is important that we are honest about the expectations of the farming methods we choose. Farming becomes a fundamentalist religion if we cling to our assumptions in spite of the evidence. To ensure we have an honest debate we need a public who are science literate. In the public discourse on fluoridation, immunisation and 1080 we are seeing the public starting to back science and reject the worn out and unsupported rhetoric of the anti-science campaigners. In the debate and science of genetics the world is thundering past us. But while 15,000 anti-GM submissions on the NES for plantation forestry might suggest otherwise, there are signs the much-needed discussion and reconciliation with science is happening in GM too. If we are to see agriculture prosper we must avail ourselves of all the tools of modern science and technology. Some researchers have told me that as much as 15% of their resources are spent on paperwork involving use of low-risk GMOs. These are the same low-risk GMOs which are deregulated in Australia. Opportunities exist for New Zealand agriculture to benefit from each of these GM technologies if only the regulations reflected the real risk. Our dream of a pest-free New Zealand could be realised through the use of gene editing to produce possums or rabbits who only have male offspring. Like the techniques being used against the Egyptian mosquito in the fight against Zika, these genes would spread through the population ending in eradication of these mammalian pests from New Zealand's shores. No guns, no poison, no traps, no pain. Should we be cautious about these technologies? Yes of course we should. We need good regulation appropriate to the risk. Should we fear the future. No. Just as the Royal Commission said fifteen years ago we should proceed with caution. We stand at the dawn of the biology revolution. If we are to contribute to the global challenges of food production and climate change, if we are to achieve better outcomes for our society, our economy and our environment we must play our part. We must be cautious, we must be responsible but we must not be paralysed by fear. ?Dr William Rolleston is President of Federated Farmers.

His claim of \"real benefits from the dam scheme\" will be lost on a lot of the farmers in CHB. This is a pipe dream and the farmers who have signed up to the council's Ruataniwha Dam must be having nightmares. The dairy-conversion bubble has burst now that Fonterra has slashed the payout to dairy farmers to the point that they won't be able to pay the interest on their farm debt. The National Government has been selling the idea of irrigation for intensified farming, and HBRC has bought the spin and taken up a $120 million loan to help make the scheme fly. But TrustPower walked away, and now ACC has walked away. And ACC's Chief Investment Officer has told the regional council-owned Hawke's Bay Regional Investment Company (HBRIC) \"We had some problems with your consenting process\". [Business section of HB Today March 8] If I was one of the farmers who've signed binding contracts with HBRIC for irrigation water for the next 35 years, I would be feeling seriously worried about my next meeting with my bank manager. With $37 billion of farm debt already out there, and Fonterra pulling the rug from underneath all their farmer-shareholders, the only people who will be happy about this bursting bubble will be speculators, people like Saudi sheep farmers and the \"land-banking\" investors from Auckland and places like China. Real farmers know what horse manure smells like. Surely it's time to say \"enough.\" Pauline DoyleNapier Change is good Forty years ago I visited the United Kingdom.

Despite a late start owing to some glitches with seating arrangements at Pettigrew Arena, my wife and I thought last Wednesday's Sol3Mio concert was absolutely fabulous. In fact, it ranks as one of the most memorable concerts we have ever attended. These guys are absolutely refreshing. They delivered with generosity of spirit, marvellous engagement with the audience, absolute sincerity, sometimes tinged with pathos, and all was underlaid by the sheer beauty of the soaring tenor voices of Pene and Amitai, harmonising sublimely with each other and with the rich baritone of Moses. As if that were not enough, all was delivered with marvellous humour and spontaneity and we were also treated to their accomplished playing of a range of stringed instruments, piano and percussion. All who attended just love song, and what a magnificent touch for the audience to be so warmly invited to join with them in the singing of popular songs towards the end of the programme.

Suffice to say we probably have not seen such polarisation of America since those days. There has been much talk of a revolution in the US from both ends of the spectrum. The so-called Washington Establishment (the hierarchy of both Democratic and Republican parties) is being targeted by disgruntled conservative and liberal Americans who want change. Some on the one side think Vermont Senator and avowed socialist Bernie Sanders is the man for the job while many conservatives believe the only person to stop Hillary Clinton (who seems assured of the Democratic vote despite Sanders' popularity) is the brash celebrity billionaire Donald Trump. While the rest of the world is aghast that Trump has made it this far and seems likely to get the GOP nomination, more and more Americans seem to think he can \"make America great again\". Trump certainly knows what to say and gets away with slogans rather than well-thought through policies. He promises to undo what he believes is all the wrong President Barack Obama has done and to make America feared and respected again. The problem is that when one sees the fervour, jingoism and blind loyalty of his followers to the man, one does wonder what would happen to our world with Trump as US President. It is enough to make any right-thinking person shudder. ##Story Name## 15roger HOW ironic that a couple of days ago the words I was saying to myself were basically a criticism of the ever-so-slightly wayward verbal habit I was engaging in. \"I'm talking to myself again,\" I said as I left a bookshop, to the mirth of a visitor to town (he had a camera around his neck) who simply remarked \"Oh, we all do that.\" I mused on that response and said to myself, \"Do we really all do that?\" Luckily he'd moved on or he would have started talking to himself, telling his inner self that people in this seaside town were crazy and spent too much time talking to themselves. But I have always talked to myself, and of course when someone interjects and reminds me I am doing it I roll out the tired old reply \"I'd be more worried if I started answering myself\" ... which I occasionally actually do. It has never landed me in real trouble but did cause some mild concern on at least one occasion while I was walking through town. I rounded a corner and saw three cute little sparrows nibbling away at some spilled crumbs on the footpath near a cafe where the tables and chairs shared their paved dining domain. \"Ooh some dear little dicky birds having some yummy tucker,\" I said aloud, but to myself. The expressions on the faces of two elderly ladies seated there could best be described as \"daggers\". I didn't go back that way for about seven months. It's when I'm in the bomb site I call my shed working space that I generally spark into conversation with no one at all. \"Ok, so how do we get this thing to attach to this properly?\" A minute or two will pass and then I generally remark to none and unsundry \"this isn't going to work at all\". There was one occasion when I called myself up on my cellphone from the landline because I couldn't find the little mobile slice. Oh yes, it rang and I tracked it to the back of the chair, but I picked it up and answered it with a weary \"hello?\" As there was no answer I hung up. I suspect some of this solo chattering goes back to the many voyages I took across the land aboard motorcycles when I was young enough to wear my \"Easy Rider Peter Fonda\" sunglasses without looking slightly cartoonish. Because you have no one else to talk to but yourself on a motorcycle. \"What's this dope up to?\" I'd ask myself as some car would come worrying close to my exhausts on a slightly fast stretch. My next words on one occasion were \"I'm sorry officer I'm still not used to this miles per hour and kilometres per hour thing ... keep getting them confused.\" So I would continue my journey and again start talking to myself. \"Where the hell am I going to find a hundred bucks for the ticket?\" Am I alone in this pursuit? Was the bemused visitor who assured me \"we all do that\" on the button? Or was he trying to reassure me that while I was veering toward fruitcake land it was not such a terrible thing. No one would come to any harm ... unless they were elderly ladies sprinkling the crumbed remains of blueberry scones onto the footpath by their feet for the dicky birds to eat. I have heard it said that it is healthy and even therapeutic to converse with oneself. Because if you are attempting to do something you're not sure you can do then hearing a voice saying \"I think I can do this\" is a lot more encouraging than hearing nothing at all. Whilst sitting here examining that last line I've just heard myself ask myself \"does that kind of make sense?\" And I've just heard myself reply to myself \"don't answer that.\" Had I then replied and asked myself \"why not?\" then I fear I could have an issue. But there's nothing to be concerned about - the only concern emerges when people get animated and start talking to people who aren't there or begin howling expletives for no good reason. And I take heart from the words of a psychologist by the name of Dr Ellen Hendriksen who writes that you are not going crazy if you occasionally talk to yourself. \"You are simply thinking out loud which is not only normal but beneficial.\" I couldn't have said it better myself. In fact, I just have and the bloke sitting nearby has started to look at me in an odd sort of way. ?Roger Moroney is an award-winning journalist for Hawke's Bay Today and observer of the slightly off-centre. ##Story Name## DDDDClapper Visit The US director of national intelligence, James Clapper, is in New Zealand on a visit to speak with spy chiefs and the Government in the wake of a security agency review. His visit follows the release last week of a report by Sir Michael Cullen and Dame Patsy Reddy recommending significant changes to the way New Zealand's spy agencies operate. Mr Clapper is the chief intelligence adviser to President Barack Obama and oversees the 16 agencies within the US intelligence community, including the CIA and National Security Agency. Last week's report recommends that the Government Communications and Security Bureau (GCSB) be given the power to spy on New Zealanders under its own warrant, a significant expansion of its current powers. At present it is limited to using its high-tech interception capabilities only when helping other agencies under their warrants, in the case of cyber security threats or when a New Zealander is acting as the agent of a foreign power. Mr Clapper has made at least one other previous visit to New Zealand, in March 2011, when he met with Prime Minister John Key and spy agency chiefs. It was revealed earlier this year that Mr Clapper's personal emails had been hacked by a teenager. Mr Key said he would be meeting Mr Clapper after his post-Cabinet press conference. Mr Clapper was then heading to Australia. Mr Key denied the visit was related to any potential visit by President Barack Obama to New Zealand.

The council's environment committee will on Thursday be presented with a proposed animal bylaw, capping the number of cats a person can own without council consent. People wanting to have more than three will need council permission first. Committee chairwoman Iona Pannett said it's about making sure cat owners are staying responsible. She said cats are wonderful but people who own them need to keep in mind the consequences. Ms Pannett says it's not quite the cat curfew top economist Gareth Morgan wants. She said the public will be asked for their opinion on a curfew, but at the moment it's not part of the bylaw. In 2013, Mr Morgan launched a campaign to eradicate domestic cats and last year, he called for all cats to be microchipped and registered so councils had the ability to monitor cat behaviour. He claimed a recent study of cat behaviour in Auckland revealed the number of times cats trespassed on other people's properties was 300 million a year. ##Story Name## DDDbriefly Cannabis loophole A loophole that allows people to bring medicinal cannabis products into New Zealand is extremely unlikely to be used, Associate Health Minister Peter Dunne says. New Zealand law allows anyone who is prescribed a medicine overseas to bring one month's supply into the country for their own use - including cannabis products. The Cannabis Party issued a press release saying the \"massive\" loophole could \"open the floodgates\" for raw cannabis to be brought to New Zealand. Mr Dunne said it was possible for a person to bring in a prescribed medicine, but the number of conditions on that allowance meant it was unlikely cannabis would be brought into New Zealand.

The defendant, a commander, is charged with the indecent assault of the female lieutenant. Both have name suppression. The court martial at Devonport Naval Base yesterday heard evidence of the alleged groping, which took place in the base's bar after a dinner on the HMNZS Canterbury on May 17, 2012. The complainant said she was standing with a group when the first of about five gropes to her buttocks took place. \"The first one was quite a deep feel. The other smaller ones were pinches I guess,\" she said. She told the court she was sure the defendant was the one responsible. \"There wasn't anybody else behind me ... there wasn't anybody else that acknowledged I turned around,\" she said. \"I said 'hey' ... he gave me a sly look back and a laugh.\" After allegedly being molested, the woman said she told her senior officer to \"f*** off\", which he treated as \"part of the game\". On questioning from defence counsel Major Peter Brock, she estimated the \"grabs\" took place over a couple of hours and eventually resulted in her sitting down. \"The whole point of sitting down was that felt like protection,\" the lieutenant said. She admitted she had had \"a few drinks\" but was of sound mind at the time. \"I put it to you you've made a mistake here. You've joined up the dots on this incorrectly,\" Major Brock pressed. \"That's your opinion, sir,\" the complainant said. The court martial is likely to last the week. NZME ##Story Name## 15boat-ramp New boat ramp at Akitio built as erosion had made access dangerous THE SAFETY of recreational fishermen and the economic survival of commercial fishing boats at Akitio are now better thanks to the local community and tradesmen pulling together to build the new boat access ramp. After a combination of seasonal spring tides, a build up of driftwood over much of the beach and the loss of sand cover, the only boat access on to the beach was completely eroded and not able to be used. Erosion had taken away much of the sand and there was a drop of 1.5m and continual scouring from waves. \"Akitio ratepayers were concerned there would be problems over the very busy summer and commercial fishermen based at Akitio were worried the lack of access because of the erosion was affecting their livelihoods,\" Akitio Ratepayers Association chairman Peter Greatbatch told the Dannevirke News. \"Sergeant Bill Nicholson the Central Districts Search and Rescue (SAR) co-ordinator also strongly supported our bid for a new ramp as SAR responses rely heavily on this access for incidents at Akitio and as far north as Herbertville.\" Rescues and searches are undertaken with the support of Akitio residents and in particular the cray boats and private boats which operate off the beach. Late last year the Tararua District Council agreed to pay $30,000 towards the cost of the new access. \"It's a matter of life or death,\" councillor Jim Crispin said. And Tararua District mayor Roly Ellis said there was no doubt something had to be done. \"It [the access] was dangerous. The work was a real necessity because the access is very heavily used by local fishermen and the public,\" he said. \"The work has been a great success and the project carried out extremely quickly and I'd like to thank Horizons Regional Council and local iwi for their help with the resource consent. \"Peter (Greatbatch) as project manager, did a wonderful job co-ordinating it all and I think there was a realisation by everyone that the new ramp needed to be in by Christmas.\" Mr Greatbatch said everyone is very happy they can get on to the beach. \"There's a real peace of mind, knowing it's accessible now. Before this work was carried out the only way to get boats out was along the beach by the toilets, but with rocks exposed it was a case of playing dodgems and it was dangerous. \"The big thing with this project is that locals and tradesmen went out of their way to support it, supplying labour, machinery and materials at reduced rates.\" Since completion, boats have been called on to help with rescues and Mr Greatbatch said the ramp \"has made such a difference. \"So many people stepped up to help, we worked like mad men. It was quite a mission, but now it's working so well there's a real sense of achievement.\" ##Story Name## sidebar ?Hine Carberry, on behalf of Rangitane o Tamaki nui a Rua, sent a letter of support as part of the consent application to Horizons Regional Council. ?Akitio Boating Club, Akitio Fisheries and McRae Fishing pledged to cover the balance of the costs to complete the project. ?Hayden Hape, on behalf of Ngati Kahungunu ki Tamaki nui-a-rua, pledged a donation, as did Anita Broughton of Te Hika O Papauma Mandated Iwi Authority. ?Local residents Bill Fergus, Bill Whitta, Eion Russell, Wayne Sorensen and Dennis Henricksen were the supervisory team on site to oversee the delivery of rock and to help with excavation work. ?Ed Kight of Akitio Station supplied bulk rock for the first stage of the project, including a further 120 tonnes when required, with digger operator Gonzo Ross placing it into position. ?Contractor Ernie Christison delivered 115 tonnes of rock to the site. ?Hugh Ramsden of Moanaroa Farming Company supplied the digger and operator Tim Eriksen. ?Greatbatch Building staff did the initial foundation work and with Morris and Bailey staff poured and levelled concrete. ##Story Name## 15court-name An appeal against a District Court judge's decision to allow identification of a police officer who was last month found not guilty of accidentally shooting an arrested man in Hastings could be delayed several months.

The 58-year-old victim was left with \"a nasty head wound\" after the home invasion which occurred about 3am yesterday. The man told police he had been woken by three men at the door of his home in Onekawa's commercial area. Police said the trio kicked their way inside the Niven St property and demanded money. When the victim could not provide any, he was tied up with his own clothes and his property was ransacked. A number of the man's belongings were taken, including his black wallet containing his identification, cheque and deposit books and men's jewellery. During the incident the man sustained a nasty head wound after being hit with a blunt object, and was also kicked in the head. The victim was now recovering after his ordeal, police said. The offenders were described as men wearing dark-coloured, hooded sweatshirts. They were heavily disguised wearing bandannas across their faces, had their hoods up and wore gloves. Two of them were believed to be aged in their teens, with the third in his early to mid-20s. The ethnicity of the men is unknown. Detective Sergeant Craig Vining said police believed the incident was unprovoked, but there could be a possibility the victim knew the offenders. Police said it was likely the offenders travelled to the Onekawa property in a vehicle, and were asking for sightings of any cars entering and exiting Niven St between about 2.45am and 3.45am on Monday. If you have a premises accessible to Niven St with CCTV which shows the street, contact the police.

The victim needed his finger amputated as a result of trying to prevent the men entering his home. ?Contact Hawke's Bay police on 831 0700 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 with information. ##Story Name## 15havelockRoad After a $1.9 million spend and months of roadworks, travellers along Havelock Road have their thoroughfare back - and better than ever. The upgrade of the cycle and pedestrian path along the Southern side of Havelock Road was part of the Hastings District Council's long term plan and evolved out of a corridor management plan produced in 2010. The New Zealand Transport Agency funded 61 per cent of the cost of the work, with the rest coming from the Hastings District Council. The work builds on Hawke's Bay's existing cycleways which are getting national and international recognition, says Hastings deputy mayor Cynthia Bowers. The new pedestrian and cycle path is wider - allowing it to be safely shared by walkers, runners and cyclists, and the work has included resurfacing Havelock Road and laying empty ducts under the works, which will allow for future infrastructure expansion by utilities companies. What has appeared to be an \"extra lane\" running down the centre of the road has now been painted with cross-hatching and is - for now - a median strip, says Ms Bowers. \"At this stage it is a safety measure so people can pull into the centre when they are turning,\" Ms Bowers said. \"In the longer term it is future proofing the road. In the future that middle strip could be used for public transport. Several years ago there were plans sketched out that included a tram. \"That still could happen but it would be a long way off. There is also an option to use the extra strip to cope with increased traffic flow during peak time, turning it temporarily into a second lane, going one way in the morning and the other way in the evening.\" Last year the traffic flow on Havelock Road was measured at 16,000 to 18,000 vehicle movements a day. This has posed safety issues for cyclists needing to cross the road from the northern side cycleway to the cycleway on the southern side, once they came into Heretaunga Street East. \"Now, cyclists can start out on the correct side of the road and remain there without crossing over, which is much safer,\" said Ms Bowers. Eventually, the wider style of pathway could be extended to Heretaunga Street, says Ms Bowers, \"but there are a lot of issues - including private property - to be considered so that would be in the very long term. \"The completion of the Havelock Road pedestrian and cycle path is the latest stage of a council vision that began five years ago - that 20 per cent of short trips be undertaken using alternate means of transport. \"We wanted to get people out of their cars and walking, riding bikes or using public transport. We have nice flat topography in Hastings and good weather, we just need to break the cycle of people getting into their cars without a second thought. We have come a long way towards that and this newest link is exciting.\" The Havelock Road pedestrian and cycle path will be officially opened at 11am on Saturday March 19, with a ribbon cutting and two bike rides. The ceremony will be held on the corner of Havelock Road and St George's Road with both cycle rides going down St George's Road, before splitting in to a shorter ride returning the same way and a longer ride going to Havelock Bridge, along Karamu Stream to Crosses Road Bridge and returning to the start point on St George's Road. ##Story Name## 15Theft Catherine Stoney's dream wedding has been crushed after her car was gutted of its possessions, including her engagement ring. The 20-year-old Salvation Army worker was enjoying a dip at Ocean Beach with her fiance and friends on Sunday afternoon. When they returned to their car at about 5pm, they saw the window smashed and the car's contents gone. Among the stolen items were three surfboards, four Iphones, an engagement ring, wallets, a bag of clothes, three Gopros, roof racks, oil skins, diving gear and a wedding band. Ms Stoney said she estimates the value of everything to be at least $6000. \"Even our half drunken E2 was taken, they must have been pretty desperate.\" Ms Stoney said she is deeply upset by the incident and was up late Sunday night vomiting. \"We are so upset, I worked so hard to save up all my money and buy my partner a surfboard just like he did to buy me a ring.\" The couple's plans have now been thrown into disarray. \"We wanted to buy a house and get married next year but now we have to spend our money on other things,\" she said. She had been to Ocean Beach almost every weekend this summer without incident. The group were down the northern end of the beach. \"When we pulled up we saw a dodgy looking truck but just didn't really think much of it.\" It was an \"old and rusty\" white Mitsubishi flat deck well side 4x4. She said the offender left a Warriors bucket hat, which she hoped someone would recognise and notify police. ##Story Name## 15tourism Hawke's Bay's tourism industry is booming as international and domestic visitors flock to the region. Napier Motel Association secretary and Palm City Motor Inn owner Helen Young said they had seen a huge increase in visitors in January, which she thought was partly due to a \"cracking summer\". \"I think Hawke's Bay Tourism is doing a lot to promote the region, and with the developments on Marine Parade - word is getting out.\" There had also been an increase of international visitors, Ms Young said, which she thought was because of the influx of overseas tourists to New Zealand. According to figures reported by the Commercial Accommodation Monitor, there was a 13 per cent increase in Hawke's Bay visitor nights in January compared with January 2015 - with 18,794 more visitor nights. Hawkes' Bay is now one of New Zealand's five best performing regions, recording the largest guest night increases year on year. Hawke's Bay Tourism general manager Annie Dundas said the increase reflected the general upswing of tourism, which had now taken over dairy as the largest foreign exchange earner. Napier mayor Bill Dalton said he was very aware of a substantial increase in tourism. \"When people travel, there is nowhere better to visit than Hawke's Bay\", he said. \"We're offering an incredible product for travellers.\" Mr Dalton said the challenge was to keep offering the region as a tourist destination, to make sure people who visited Hawke's Bay wanted to come back.\" Hastings deputy mayor Cynthia Bowers said she thought the increased numbers had to be good for Hawke's Bay. \"There seems to have been a lot of visitors around the place,\" Ms Bowers said. \"I think it's been vibrant around Hawke's Bay, you can see it and feel it. \"And why wouldn't there be? We have so much to offer.\" Ms Dundas said this season had been particularly good with record numbers due to a larger number of people coming into New Zealand, and Kiwis travelling throughout the country. The Commercial Accommodation Monitor showed the increase was made up of a leap in both domestic and international visitor nights. International visitor nights rose 20.9 per cent to 41,357 with domestic visitor nights recording a 10.5 per cent increase, totalling 122 433. The overall occupancy rose from 50 per cent to 58.9 per cent. Hastings Motel Association president and Claremonte Motor Lodge owner Julie Smith said they had been getting more Kiwi visitors. \"This year has been up on any other year\", she said. \"We've been here for 10 years, and this January was the best month in any of them.\" ##Story Name## 15newbase After nearly six months of lodging in with their print media counterparts in Tennyson St, the NZME Napier radio crew have moved into NZME's smartly refurbished new offices on the corner of Dickens and Dalton St and the print media and sales team have joined them. The two-storied Art Deco building, which has been the home of radio in Napier for more than 40 years, was vacated last September as the major refurbishment got under way. The result, which is the new, unified base for NZME radio and print (Hawke's Bay Today and Napier Courier), as well as Grab One, was greeted with smiles yesterday as the staff moved in. \"It is just awesome for the staff and especially for our customers to come into,\" NZME Radio Eastern Regional manager James Cooper said of the revamped space. \"And to have print, radio and Grab One all together means we can share ideas and get the best results for our customers.\" Before the major revamp, the workplace had been showing the wear and tear of age. So in stepped building owner Simon Tremain, director of Tremains Real Estate. He bought the building about six years ago. \"I was looking for something at the time and this came up,\" Mr Tremain said. He said he was keen to keep NZME as a long-term \"very good\" tenant and recognised its workplace needed a spruce-up job. So the contractors were called in and the entire second floor was vacated, except for the studios where The Hits hosts Martin and Sarah were able to keep broadcasting from as the hammering contractor crews worked around their show times. \"It is fantastic to get to this day, to see it finished,\" Mr Tremain said, adding that the next stage would be a stunning makeover of the exterior. He has worked with the Art Deco Truston the design. A smart new corporate meeting room, interview room, front reception and a kitchen area have been created, along with plenty of good open-plan office space for staff and with plenty of good lighting after previously obscured windows were opened up. A skylight, which had also previously been hidden, has also been restored. Hawke's Bay Today general manager Russell Broughton said it had been the goal for the past couple of years to integrate the print and radio components of what is now NZME. \"I'm thrilled to see this. We have all our Napier-based sales representatives under one roof, so come and see us,\" he said. \"It is a tremendous new area and we can't thank Simon enough for doing this. It is just great.\" ##Story Name## 15policestations Work on Napier's new police station is expected to start within a month. Replacing the 50-year-old, three-storey Station St building with a single-storey building, described by police as a \"satellite\" station and fronting Dalton St, it follows the well-advanced demolition of cells, vehicle garages and other outbuildings on the site. Site excavation is scheduled to start in early April and a two-metres-high perimeter wall, which formerly supported Dalton St bus-stop sheltering will be removed as the new station is built. It is expected to be completed by December. The Napier cell block closed late last year and Hastings is now the base for all custodial arrests in the two cities. The Napier and Hastings stations, built in the early 1960s, will both be demolished as part of a project costing more than $24 million, including development of a multiple-floored Eastern District and Hawke's Bay area police headquarters in Hastings, at a cost of about $19 million. The cost of the Napier satellite station is put at more than $5 million. The district headquarters have previously been in Napier, in leased floors of Dalton House, on the corner of Dalton and Vautier streets. ##Story Name## 15wineshow Getting a large group of the Gimblett Gravels wine growing region \"family\" together at one time can be thirsty work, so wine commentator and presenter Yvonne Lorkin was in the perfect spot yesterday. She and her Thirsty Work series television crew were at Te Awa Winery off State Highway 50 near Hastings to meet with many of the names behind the fine Gimblett Gravels names and as she said, it was indeed the prefect spot for what she was after. She was back in the Bay, her home province, for a week's filming on the fourth series of her show Thirsty Work which profiles the personalities and colourful landscapes of the New Zealand wine and beverage industry. What makes the new series extra special is that it has been picked up by TV3 which will begin screening the eight episodes in July. It had previously been shown on the Food Channel as part of Sky's line-up. \"I'm very excited it has all come together,\" she said. To give the TV3-based series the best possible start, she returned to the Bay, with episode one to be centred around the Gimblett Gravels, the unique region which now hosts about 800 hectares of vineyards. Getting the core of the Gravels' personalities together in one place for filming had been a lot of work and she praised the input of the Gimblett Gravels Association's Lucy Chambers. Ms Lorkin said she was delighted to have got Chris Pask and Joe Babich along for the day, as Mr Pask had been the first to plant vines on what was seen as a stony wasteland in 1981. Babich managing director Joe Babich was among the first group of winemakers to follow Mr Pask's lead. Gimblett Gravels has gone on to become an internationally recognised name in quality wine production. The entire first episode of the new series will be focused on the Gravels; its wines and its people. \"And like in the other series, we'll get to meet the families, the kids, the pets. Everyone.\" The unique Bridge Pa winemaking region will also feature when Ms Lorkin calls at Ash Ridge Wines. Having completed three seasons, and now embarking on the fourth, she said there was plenty to see and plenty of people to meet. \"Oh yes, there are a lot more places and people to reach yet.\" ##Story Name## 15 chopper Due to unprecedented demand for tickets to this year's Cocktail Party in aid of the Hawke's Bay Rescue Helicopter Trust, the Hastings Karamu Rotary Club is \"delighted\" to announce a change of venue. Now in its 25th year, this special anniversary party was due to take place at the Graeme Lowe Rescue Helicopter Hangar on Orchard Road on April 15, but will now take place at the A&P Showgrounds Exhibition Hall on the same date. John Roil, director of Community Service at the Hastings Karamu Rotary Club said, \"This year, there has been a huge demand for tickets in advance of the event, which has meant that we have had to consider an alternative venue for the evening.\" Ian Wilmot, General Manager at the Trust said \"Because of the higher than expected number of guests for this year's party, it quickly became apparent that we couldn't keep to the original plan of hosting the event at the hangar, and continue to keep our Rescue Helicopter services operational throughout the event\" Mr Roil added, \"This is a great position for us to be in, as the more people who attend the event, the more vital funds will be raised to support our local life-saving Rescue Helicopter Service\" Every dollar raised from the event will go towards helping to keep the Hawke's Bay Rescue Helicopter operational, free of charge at point of use, and available 24/7 to everyone in Hawke's Bay. Tickets are just $95, and this is promising to be \"the best year yet\" as the event showcases 25 years of entertainment and support for the community. ?To buy your tickets see thecocktailparty.co.nz or call into ticket outlets at Thomsons Suits Hastings, Grieve Diamond Jewellers Hastings, Advintage Havelock North, House of Travel Havelock North, or Unichem Pharmacy Waipukurau. ##Story Name## 15Hammer A young woman was left shaken but soldiered on to finish her shift after being robbed at hammer point yesterday afternoon. Police are still looking for the two men who allegedly held up the Greenmeadows Four Square with a hammer at about 3.30pm. Detective Sergeant Daryl Moore said the two men entered the shop wearing hoodies, and with bandanas covering their faces. He said one them was armed with a hammer, and had threatened the female assistant with it. The men then gained access to the till, stealing cash and also some cigarettes before fleeing the store along Guppy Rd. Mr Moore said at this stage they were not aware of how much had been taken from the store. It had been store owner Jaimin Patel's wife who had been threatened by the offenders. \"I had just gone home for lunch at that time, and a nap,\" he said. \"When I heard what happened I got up and ran to the shop.\" His wife had been shocked after the incident, Mr Patel said, but had decided to continue working until the end of her shift. Mr Patel said they had closed the store for a couple of hours while police investigated the scene, and he had watched the CCTV footage of the incident. He said his wife had done well, as she hadn't reacted much to the men. \"She just did what they said, which was good.\" The owner said he was shocked the incident had happened at such a busy time of the day. \"We're on a main street, it's quite a busy road, and it was after school\", he said, \"Just five minutes before we had four or five customers in the store.\" The store had a good security system, which meant Mr Patel's wife was able to press a panic button which alerted her husband and he was able to call police. Manager Maulik Patel said staff were well trained on how to deal with such situations. There had not been any recent incidents of robbery at the Four Square. Mr Patel, who has worked at the shop for two years, was only promoted to manager a week ago. \"It's not a great start,\" he said. Mr Patel said CCTV footage had been given to police. He described the alleged perpetrators as tall and wearing full-length coats. They were both carrying large bags and had their faces concealed. Mr Moore said the two men were still at large and police would be continuing with their enquiries. In 2014 in the Eastern District there were 80 robberies, 720 incidents of unlawful entry, 1456 thefts and 276 thefts of motor vehicles, Statistics New Zealand data revealed. Police are asking anyone who saw suspicious activity around the Greenmeadows Four Square yesterday afternoon to contact Hawke's Bay Police on 831 0700 or anonymously via Crimestoppers. ##Story Name## 15index Local newsp1-7 Dannevirkep8 Bitep9 Lettersp11 Chatterboxp12 Businessp13-18 Nation/Worldp19-21 Puzzlesp22-23 Televisionp24 Weatherp25 Classifiedsp26-27 Sportp28-32 Family noticesp31 ##Story Name## 15robot Riding on the back of their success at last year's regional event, the Central Hawke's Bay College VEX Robotics team has returned from the national VEX Robotics competition with an award recognising the pioneering education work being done by the school. This was the first year the college had been involved in the competition and the team qualified for the nationals as the No1 team in the Central North Island region, after a competition held in Palmerston North in December. Computer Science teacher Ian Kenny says the event is the biggest and fastest growing classroom-based robotics competition in the world, of which New Zealand has been world champion for the past seven years. Held annually, the competition involves an engineering challenge presented in the form of a game. Students, with guidance from their teachers and mentors, use the VEX Robotics Design System to build innovative robots designed to score the most points possible in qualification matches, elimination matches and skills challenges. Mr Kenny said that with New Zealand schools being so successful at the world championships held in the United States, the standard at the nationals, held recently at the Vodafone Events Centre in Auckland, was always going to be tough. This was proven, with the CHB College team eventually knocked out at the division elimination semi-final stages by the eventual winners. Although they did not claim the top prize, the school was recognised for its pioneering work in STEM education in the Hawke's Bay region, Mr Kenny said. STEM is an acronym for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics and STEM Education fosters a collaborative, hands-on, problem-based learning that draws on knowledge from all four disciplines. \"It promotes the student as the innovator and critical thinker, who is also able to make meaningful connections between school, community, work and global issues,\" Mr Kenny said. The VEX Robotics platform is now offered as part of the curriculum at CHB College as well as an extra curriculum club. The school also runs a full computer-science programme offering achievement standards at all levels covering computer programming, robotics and PC hardware and servicing. \"I've been lucky to have the backing from the college to set up these programmes to this extent,\" said Mr Kenny. \"But the students are definitely benefiting from them, not just for VEX, but also for the ever changing career paths that are now on offer. \"It would be great to see more schools in Hawke's Bay embrace computer science and VEX Robotics.\" Mr Kenny is also part of a new initiative called \"The Digital Circus,\" that has been set up to help other Hawke's Bay schools experience robotics and expose their students to a different form of learning. Working closely with EIT, Mr Kenny said he hoped some of the hundreds of technology companies in Hawke's Bay could see the importance of this initiative and get involved. ##Story Name## leftovathumbs15march Thumbs up: To Councillor Andrew Watts for exposing the murky workings of the CHB District Council.

In the fourth stage, she had to be satisfied with second place, but the points she secured throughout the tour meant she won the Queen of the Mountains jersey and overall General Classification.

This battle was part of a series of major engagements fought between the British, French and Allied armies and the German Imperial Army during World War 1. Although the New Zealand division was successful in achieving its objectives on the Somme it cost New Zealand 8000 casualties, including 2000 dead or missing. This was not far off the country's total death toll on Gallipoli. Central Hawke's Bay lost 42 local boys during 1916, and four local soldiers who were killed in 1916 will be profiled at the exhibition. They are Thomas Fox from Waipukurau, Douglas Thodey from Waipawa and the Fletcher brothers from Ongaonga. The museum is also hosting a special digitising unit from the Auckland War Memorial Museum. The He Pou Aroha unit travels around the North Island giving people access to the Online Cenotaph, a comprehensive online hub for stories of New Zealand service personnel, developed by Auckland Museum. It contains the records of about 140,000 men and women who served for New Zealand from the 19th century to today. The kiosk allows people to search the Online Cenotaph, lay a virtual poppy against a specific person's name and contribute additional information to the database. Each kiosk contains an object photo booth that enables you to digitise your family's war-related items such as medals, diaries and letters. The digitised objects are uploaded to the relevant service person's Online Cenotaph record for the world to see and future generations. Head to the museum to contribute to the Online Cenotaph with your story. The digitising kiosk will be there from March 13 - June 13, 2016. The popular Survivor WWI game is also back on. Last year 29 schools with more than 800 students participated in this game as a part of the museum's educational programme that was developed for the WWI exhibition They Answered the Call. The game, created by Wellington exhibition designer Juliet Cooke, will be available until the end of the World War 1 commemorations in 2018. ? The exhibition will open on Friday, March 18 at 5.30pm when Jeremy Ballantyne will talk about the Battle of the Somme.

The tour has been running for about eight years, and is the only one of its kind in the country featuring races in four grades - under-19, under-17, under-15 and under-13, for both boys and girls. The first race, the 3.2km prologue, starts at Pukeora Estate on Saturday morning and follows the old main road around the bottom of the hill, ending at the top of the hill. Cycling CHB member Tim Mackie says the kids love this course, which is another unique aspect of this tour with its hill-top finish. \"It's different from the usual time trials which tend to be run on longer, flat roads - this has got a grunty hill finish which they enjoy.\" After the prologue, a number of road races will be held on Saturday in the vicinity of Hatuma Lime Company. In a change from previous years, the criterium on Sunday will be held in Otane, rather than starting at CHB College. Tim says this is a one kilometre circuit near the Otane village and again this particular part of the tour is unique in that it's open for both boys and girls at the same time. Pukeora Estate is the main accommodation venue for the tour that attracts competitors and their families from the north of Auckland to Wellington, and sometimes the South Island. \"This is a fun, friendly event that is well organised,\" says Tim. \"We are lucky that we have quiet country roads that are challenging enough for all age groups, and give them a taste of competitive cycling.\" Past winners who have gone on to achieve big things include Patrick Bevin (who is currently coming third in the Paris to Nice classic), Campbell Stewart (who won the under-19s last year and has since gone on and won two junior world champ track gold medals), Georgia Williams (who is now in the NZ track team) and of course CHB's own multi-international gold medal winner Regan Gough. Campbell will be back to contest his title this year, likely battling it out with another frontrunner, Robert Stannard, who won this year's Cycling CHB Tour de Beautiful. Some of the local riders to watch out for this year include Jack Curruthers (under-19 boys), Thomas Higgins (under-17 boys), Hana Peacock (under-15 girls, last year's under-13 girls winner), and Laura Bickers (under-17 girls). Organisers thanked all the sponsors of the event, including Pukeora Estate and Hatuma Lime Company, the Cycling CHB volunteers who drive vehicles and perform marshall duties, and the volunteers who helped prepare the road beneath Pukeora Hill. ##Story Name## 15stewart This week is Brain Injury Awareness week, and for the last 10 years the Stewart Centre @ EIT has been providing rehabilitation for people with brain injuries in Central Hawke's Bay. In a new initiative the Centre is starting a group programme in Waipukurau. Working with the Paul Hunter Centre in Waipukurau, the Stewart Centre @ EIT will be meeting on land that is presently not being used behind Paul Hunter Centre. The Centre will initially establish gardens and other activities. The group will be run three afternoons a week and clients will work with a rehabilitation coach on activities that are enjoyable and encourage independence, such as gardening, wood and stone carving, swimming, gym programmes and computer courses. Stewart Centre @ EIT supported living services co-ordinator Kerry Harper says the activities arose from a philosophy that it is best for people with brain injuries and those who have had strokes to be integrated in the community and be as independent as possible. ACC and the Ministry of Health also promote this. Living skills coaches work with people in their homes and in the community one-to-one. Their role is to scaffold supports around a client, says Kerry. \"Living skills coaches are not caregivers. The clients are doing the work; our role is to prompt and encourage. We call it 'cuing not doing'.\" Like the clients, coaches come from all walks of life and their work is about keeping it real for clients, enabling them to live at home and supporting them to be part of the community and responsible for themselves. Self responsibility is encouraged. While having a brain injury is traumatic, people still need to be socially responsible. Coaches assist clients in managing their home, which may involve supporting with housework, getting children to school and clients to therapy or to Stewart Centre @ EIT programmes. Kerry also provides input to the National Certificate in Health Disability and Aged Support - Level 3 with EIT tutors in Waipukurau. The Stewart Centre @ EIT has 96 clients throughout Hawke's Bay and their main service operates from their facility on the EIT campus in Taradale. Forty clients are receiving supported living services provided by 20 coaches who are matched to the clients they work with. The Stewart Centre @ EIT provides a weekly programme of activities that are meaningful and purposeful including communication and education courses, men's and women's groups, woodwork, cooking sports and gym programmes. The overall aim is to provide a safe environment where clients can improve skills in communication, build self confidence, improve problem solving and planning skills, learn to set goals and learn teamwork. The EIT campus allows clients to get involved in a diverse environment. ? In New Zealand, about 90 people sustain a brain injury every day and the impact can be significant. A traumatic head injury may be the result of a car accident, sports injury, assault, fall or knock to the head. Injuries can also result from strokes, heart attacks, meningitis, infections or poisoning from drugs, alcohol, gases, solvents or pesticides. ##Story Name## ttrisk In the current environment, farmers are frequently exposed to the vagaries of weather, prices and disease. They often live on the edge of extreme uncertainty about, for instance, whether rainfall will be good over the season or what prices they will receive for produce sold. These risks are not under the control of farmers, so developing a way to cope and manage them is a good business strategy. A recent survey conducted by Crowe Horwath asked farmers, rural professionals and others involved in the New Zealand agribusiness for their views on the industry's key influences. Respondents were most concerned about the negative impact of commodity prices, regulation (at a local and central government level), succession issues, climatic conditions and human resources. These issues are generally out of the control of New Zealand farmers, but a focus can be put on building a more resilient farm system, putting in place a strong farm system decision-support process, and using advisors to assist in key decisions. Farmers must have all the necessary information to make informed decisions. For example, for input prices and output prices, this means having reliable data like farm records and off-farm information, agricultural statistics and publications. There are some steps farmers can take to reduce the chances of a bad outcome: ? identify possible sources of risk ? realise possible outcomes ? decide on alternative strategies available ? assess the consequences of each possible outcome ? evaluate the trade-off between the cost of the risk and the gains that can be made. Some farmers are willing to accept more risk than others (some are more risk adverse), so the process can be subjective based on personal feelings as well as the information presented. It is best to focus on those things that farmers can influence and having all information to hand in making key choices. Having new technology and farm management systems is something farmers can influence. Reviewing, managing and improving systems enables farmers to have a sense of control in a current market where there is lots of uncertainty. Reacting to unfavourable events after they occur is not good risk management. ?If you need help on improving your systems to aid in decision making, contact the Crowe Horwath team on 858 5540. ##Story Name## ttdairy Two Central Hawke's Bay dairy farm workers are finalists in this year's New Zealand Dairy Awards for the Hawke's Bay/Wairarapa region. Dairy farm manager Ray Johnson is up for the region's Dairy Manager of the Year title, pitted against four others in the category who were judged throughout January and February. Ray manages a dairy farm owned by Dean Nikora, between Waipukurau and Takapau. This year is his second year as farm manager for Dean, who he has worked for for the last four years. \"I started off at the bottom and worked my way up,\" he says, of his progression from herd manager to second in charge and then manager. Ashley Baker, who works on a Hawke's Bay Pastorals Limited farm at Takapau is in contention for the region's Dairy Trainee of the Year award. Ashley says she's only been in the industry for the last year, and at her current job for the last nine months. The awards dinner where the Hawke's Bay/Wairarapa winners will be announced is being held on March 21 in Masterton. More than 450 people entered the national awards that, as well as recognising dairy managers and dairy trainees also recognise the Share Farmer of the Year. All regional winners will compete for the New Zealand titles, which will be announced in May. ##Story Name## ttshearing Piopio shearing contractor Mark Barrowcliffe is proactive about keeping the members of his shearing gang in good shape, and is enlisting the support of Hawke's Bay-based company, Movement Works to cope with the physical demands of the job. Movement Works is run by Laura Hancock, a specialist in increasing and maintaining movement capacity and physical function. She says Barrowcliffe is leading the way with his use of expertise in areas such as physiotherapy and shearing manufacturing to upskill his staff and push the idea of prevention rather than cure. \"I have been working with Barrowcliffe's gang, treating them in the evenings after work. \"As well as treatment sessions I also work on giving them each a more comprehensive understanding of their own bodies and the biomechanical demands of their job and how to ward off and deal with the detrimental effects that accompany the physically challenging nature of this rural industry.\" Although she runs other workshops, the one Barrowcliffe is making use of is specific to the shearing industry, Laura says. \"It is designed specifically to help shearers, crutchers, rousies and pressers. \"They are taught to use spiky balls for self-massage, swiss balls for mobilisation and exercises for movement enhancement and maintenance of physical health and mobility. \"Attendees can then use these techniques on a daily basis to increase the body's ability to cope with the extremely high physical demands placed upon it within the shearing industry,\" she says. As well as helping out with day-to-day health maintenance, Laura recently worked as part of the team attempting to break the three-stand, eight-hour strong wool lamb world record. The shearers were Ringa Paewai, Peter-Lee Ratima and Craig (Hack) Fagan, and the attempt was held at Mike Carter's woolshed just outside Piopio, but called off at lunch time as the required tally was unavailable. Laura says she uses an in-depth understanding of the biomechanical movements required of the body during shearing. \"I look for dysfunctional movement patterns and restricted range of motion. I spent a couple of days before the attempt watching the boys shear and analysing their movement and technique, and treating them accordingly. \"I worked with a combined approach of sports massage, strapping and kinesio taping to improve their movement, mechanics, function and performance, as well as reduce pain and treat injuries before the attempt, as well as between runs.\" When running the workshops, Laura says she can do them both on-farm or from her base at Pilates Works in Havelock North. Workshops are available to be run on behalf of any contractor for their staff at any required location, and as well days can be booked for treating employees. ##Story Name## ttletter1 We want to acknowledge the community's frustration at the length of time it is taking to finalise the Ruataniwha Water Storage Scheme. It is taking longer than we anticipated, but we want to get this right for the benefit of the entire region. As directors of the HBRIC Ltd we have been tasked with investigating this proposal and bringing it back to the Hawke's Bay Regional Council, who will ultimately decide whether it goes ahead. What keeps us going is the fact that this irrigation scheme will give Hawke's Bay the lift it needs to hold its own in regional New Zealand. Coupled with HBRC's Tukituki Plan Change, the Ruataniwha Scheme will give the region a range of economic, environmental and social benefits including: ? Creating more than 2000 ongoing jobs ? Breathing life into Waipukurau and Waipawa ? Injecting at least $200 million a year into the region's GDP ? Strengthening the social fabric of communities ? Giving us a better river. As directors we do believe we are nearly there. ? We have the consents for the scheme confirmed. ? We have a financially viable design and construction contract. ? We are very close to forming an investor group to fund the scheme. The final step is to have farmers commit to purchasing water from the scheme and our research tells us the demand is there. In the next few days farmers in the irrigation footprint will receive an updated Foundation Water User Agreement and will have until April 18, 2016 to sign it. We're nearly there and we believe it will be worth it.

He and wife Trish and other staff members manned the stall outside the Kiwibank/NZ Post building on Ruataniwha Street almost all day on Tuesday, with lots of willing takers for their free treats. Nigel had just turned 16 when he was offered a job at the Waipawa Post Office by the postmaster Frank Golder. He says he did the postie run for 18 months in Waipawa, decked out in his grey uniform and carrying a whistle to let elderly residents know their post had been delivered. Frank then approached him again to see if he wanted a clerk position. Again, Nigel accepted and worked in that position until the Waipawa Post Office shut down and he transferred to Waipukurau on a promotion. He says a lot changed over the years. In the 1970s, the business was the Post Office Savings Bank, which was later split into banking, postal and telephone services in the same building. \"I had the choice of which branch I wanted to work in but my passion was always post,\" he says. Later Kiwibank was introduced and that is now a core part of the business. Nigel's efforts with home loan referrals has been recognised with certificates from the company. In 2008 he also received a CHB Promotions award, recognising him as a CHB ambassador, selling CHB to the world with his positive attitude. ##Story Name## 15scouts A Waipukurau Scout leaders initiative is seeing greater co-operation between the scout group and the CHB branch of Forest and Bird. The two groups provide lessons on conservation, a part of the Scout Award scheme, to instil a greater respect for the environment. On Thursday, February 25 the scout troop met members of Forest and Bird at Lindsay Bush. After a game, the troop divided into three age groups. The youngest learned about, then identified three native flora, Matai, Kahikatea and Titoki. The older scouts headed further into the bush, learning about native plants. The next meeting will be a planting day at Lindsay Bush in June. ##Story Name## 15childrensday Children's Day was a great success in both Waipukurau and Otane on Sunday, March 6 with lots of activities and children getting involved. In Waipukurau, thanks to the efforts of volunteers and community groups, children enjoyed anything from water play to bouncy castles, Highland dancing demonstrations and hand painting. Plunket CHB community development co-ordinator Sally White said the event received great sponsorship from New World, Waipukurau, and the children also all received a free book, donated by CHB district libraries, Milly Molly publishers and Gecko Press. In Otane, about 12 children and 20 adults enjoyed some old fashioned fun and games at the Children's Day celebration organised by Pleroma Social Services. Otane School's big trees gave the picnic goers and game players shade. Balloons and temporary tattoos were given away along with donated books and toys adding to the fun of three-legged races, and races involving spoons and water, which adults enjoyed just as much as the children. Christine Renata of CHBDC and Safer CHB spoke to the crowd giving feedback gathered from the Street by Street barbecue survey held late last year. ##Story Name## 15reserve Waipawa resident Charlie Hutchison says that far from having his fears allayed about work being carried out on High Street Reserve to tidy up dangerous trees, he's more concerned than ever. Over the last two weeks two independent geo-technical engineers have come and looked at the large track that's been cut through the reserve to allow machinery in to cut and shred the trees. \"After discussions with them I'm now concerned that it's not only the public land that's at risk of slipping, it could affect houses on private land on top of the hill as well - we are in deep doo doo,\" says Charlie. He again questioned why such a wide track had to be cut through the hill, and refuted claims by council utilities manager Brett Way that the track had not been made bigger, rather only had the surface scraped off. \"For 20 years that was an access track that was only three quarters of a metre wide. If you are going to scrape it, why use a 30 tonne digger and make it three metres wide?\" In fact, he added, why could the trees not have been removed like they had been in the past, without the need for a track and the damage caused to the site. The presence of bentonite soil on the hill was likely to exacerbate the problem, and Charlie was still very concerned that as it stood the situation was serious \"and we haven't even had any major rain yet\". As of last week he was considering requesting an independent public inquiry into the processes that led to the track being cut in the first place. He also suggested there be a moratorium on cutting any trees in the reserve, except for ones that posed a danger to public safety, for the next 10 years. Council chief executive John Freeman said independent engineers had been brought in to assess the information from a geo-tech point of view, and would give their qualified report within a fortnight. He acknowledged that local knowledge of the area was very useful in cases like this, but to ensure the best use of ratepayer money, a professional opinion was needed before any action taken. ##Story Name## 15briefs There's been a lot of interest in the fate of Lake Hatuma since Cyril Parker raised the issue of its degradation and called for it to be restored to its former glory.

Of late the topic appears to have gained some traction with the ludicrous suggestion being we five, myself included, vote irresponsibly for everything to do with Ruataniwha. Nothing could be further from the truth. The reality is that the majority of council votes are actually unanimous and well tempered, with the exception of a few RWSS headlines that seem newsworthy on the day. I suspect the increased noise of late is more to do with the politics of election year than responsible representation. As your elected representative, I always ensure that each and every council decision I make is absolutely based on its merits at the time. I go to great lengths to evaluate and analyse information, and I stand steadfast in endeavouring to make an informed decision that is in the best interests of our whole community. I have been immersed in the Ruataniwha project for six years now. I have a huge grasp of the project. I also chaired the community stakeholder group that led the way for social, environmental and cultural expectations and outcomes for the project. Comprising people from Wakarara to Wanstead, Waipukurau, Waipawa, and the main cities through to Wairoa, we represented all walks of life. As such, I have a tremendous appreciation and respect for the RWSS project from many diverse and varied angles. To date I have seen every project hurdle successfully navigated and negotiated by a team which has constantly displayed vision, leadership, courage and conviction. I'm proud to be associated with RWSS. I'm a firm believer in the fact that drought-proofing this region, while providing for significant environmental enhancement, is one of the most tremendous legacies we can be leaving. !As always, please feel free to give me a call if there are any regional council issues you would like to discuss. ?

At the end of last year, the council received 50 replies to a letter sent by CHB Mayor Peter Butler to about 60 tradespeople asking for feedback about their dealings with the department. Forty of those were critical, and 10 complimentary. Last week Mr Butler said about 30 letter writers had agreed to participate in the audit, which was hoped to be completed by the end of March or early April. Council chief executive John Freeman said the audit would cover such matters as consent processing and procedures, inspections and whether there were enough people in the right roles, the department's customer focus and a benchmark comparison between the CHB department and those in Hastings, Napier and Tararua. CHB Building Consent Authority (BCA) staff would be interviewed, as well as councillors, and the people who had written letters who were willing to participate. Once this was completed a draft report would be presented to the council's sub-committee considering the issue, and then a presentation would be made to the full council, he said. It had not been decided whether sub-committee meetings would be public, he said. \"That will depend on what they are talking about, and if they are talking to a particular builder or staff member.\" As reported last week Mr Watts said he had concerns about the use of the company Morrison Low as, among other things, it had done past work and is currently contracted to the council on other asset management matters. ##Story Name## 15fire A Waipawa family was lucky to come through relatively unscathed after a house fire that almost completely destroyed their Shanley Street home on Friday, March 4. On Tuesday last week, occupant Thomas Junior Houkamau's arms were still bandaged from burns received trying to put the fire out, after spotting flames at about 9pm in a room being used for storage and a sleepout. A smoke alarm that had been recently installed through the Safer Homes CHB project also did its job to alert Thomas who was sitting outside at the back after dinner when he saw light coming from the room at the front of the house. \"I took a closer look and opened the door to see the top mattress on a bunk was burning. I started trying to put it out with my hands and then I saw a towel and was throwing that at it. \"I heard glass popping and breaking in the other rooms - the heat was wicked, and once the windows went it really started roaring.\" Meanwhile the rest of the family, his partner Lisa Clair and their four children, had made their way across the road and the fire service arrived shortly afterwards. Waipawa brigade senior fire fighter Alison Ludlow said two crews each from Waipawa, Otane, and Waipukurau, as well as a command vehicle from Hastings, attended and took about two hours to completely extinguish the blaze. \"We had six teams in BAs (breathing apparatus) going in and coming out in 30-minute shifts.\" Thomas said he was amazed at how quickly the fire spread, taking only about three minutes to get into the ceiling and engulf the next door kitchen area. Just over half of the interior of the house ended up being burnt out, with the remaining area seriously smoke damaged and the building now unliveable. It was thought the fire started from an overloaded multi-board in the storage room. Waipawa chief fire officer Brian Edwards said the Safer Homes CHB project, that aims to have smoke alarms installed in every house in CHB, was paying off with this the third fire in a house where smoke detectors put in by the fire service had helped save lives. He praised the family for getting out of the house and Thomas for backing off when he saw it was too big to deal with. It was also a timely reminder to check that smoke alarms were working, and with winter approaching to check fire boxes and get chimneys cleaned. \"It also shows the importance of not overloading multi-boards and if they are getting old and you have doubts get them replaced with a good quality product with a circuit breaker.\" He also said it was a reminder to make sure families had an evacuation plan in the event of fire, with a designated safe place outside the house to head to. Thomas and Lisa said the community had been very supportive and they had been flooded with replacement household items, and offered accommodation around the corner. \"We want to thank everyone for their overwhelming generosity with donations and support - we have been very spoilt,\" they said. ##Story Name## 15contacts Contact the CHB Mail 76 Ruataniwha St, Waipukurau 4200 Phone: 858 8166 Reporter: Nicki Harper Display advertising: Judi Ellingham, Rebecca Patterson, advertising@chbmail.co.nz Classified: classifieds@chbmail.co.nz Editorial: editorial@chbmail.co.nz Photos: To order photos, go to newspix.co.nz CHB Mail is published by Hawke's Bay Newspapers ##Story Name## 15letters Flushing flows As I understand it, RWSS water is to be used to create flushing flows for the Waipawa and Tukituki rivers. This is to move periphyton , slime and algae growth down the river and out to sea. Poor water quality promotes growth of these undesirables. Plan Change 6 has been designed to improve our water quality, with limits for urban and rural water users, and to provide greater minimum flows. When users become compliant with PC6 will flushing flows still be needed? Murray Howarth Ashley Clinton Pick up pooA dog owner recently told me how he easily picked up his dog's poo in public places.

Really simple if the dog owner is responsible.Ron Collinson OtaneInquiry failedFor several years now I have been confident that the Ruataniwha Water Storage Scheme in its present form would fall over. Surely, I thought, the Board of Inquiry would find that the environmental cost to not only the Makaroro River but also the whole Tukituki catchment would outweigh the blue-sky economic forecasts? Surely Hawke's Bay ratepayers would see that it would be a financial black hole rather than the money machine the promoters are only now back-pedalling on? Surely the High Court would rule in Forest and Bird's favour that DOC cannot divest itself of 22 hectares of conservation land, let alone the other 220 hectares of ecologically sensitive habitat for threatened and at-risk species? In my opinion, the Board of Inquiry failed (apart from making it more difficult for irrigators to pollute than HBRC wanted), HBRC disenfranchised hundreds of submitters in the consultation process so got the $80m subject to a number of conditions, and just recently the High Court set an alarming precedent that the Conservation estate can be sold off or exchanged (although Forest and Bird may yet appeal this retrograde decision.) It would seem that one of the strongest lines of hope now is that there are enough farmers in CHB who consider the water is too expensive (despite the ratepayer-subsidised inducements for them to sign up early) and that it will get even more expensive each and every year (the price will be CP-indexed). Isn't it ironic that, in the end, it may be economics that save the Makaroro River.

Judy Mathews at 021 1241700 or (06) 874 7787. Judy Mathews A vote for the river The Ruataniwha Water Storage Scheme (RWSS) has been a body of work that has occupied discussions around the region for some years now. Its sheer size and the technical nature of most of the issues have meant it has been an easy target for misinformation and scaremongering. I think it's time to remind the public just what the Ruataniwha Water Storage Scheme could do for this region if it goes ahead. The plan to store water in winter and use it in summer was put forward to negate the economic effects of limiting water takes for irrigation from the river as one control to help the river. As history shows 20 different sites were tested before the Makaroro was confirmed as the workable option. So what does the dam mean? Outside investment of $500 million in our region, 2000 or more new jobs, a river returned to natural flows. The plan change manages a reduction in nutrients with mitigation measures of riparian planting and land use regulation. The concept of adding environmental flows at the council's last meeting is as simple as this. The council will receive many tens of millions of income from our investment in the scheme over the next 70 years (if the scheme goes ahead). Additional environmental flows are possible if we decide to take some of that income in water instead of cash. We can guarantee a top Tukituki River every summer regardless of drought. We can revitalise Lake Hatuma and return it to health and vitality. We can do this with no impact on rates.

The meeting was the second of four that Hawke's Bay regional councillors Rex Graham, Rick Barker, Peter Beaven and Tom Belford are holding around the region to air their concerns about the dam. In Waipawa, their criticism was targeted at what they claimed were dubious predictions for economic growth in CHB, the cost of water for CHB farmers versus potential returns, nutrient management measures for the health of the rivers, and the lack of consultation on spending $43m on environmental flows. \"This dam is not the vision of CHB farmers - it's not farmer conceived or driven and it's not farmer-owned like South Island dams,\" Mr Graham said. \"The investors own this dam and sell the water to get a commercial return - the economics don't stack up for anyone.\" Mr Belford said that consultants' reports on the economic benefits of the scheme were each built on ones before, accepting the previous assumptions without challenge. Those reports were predicated on the price of water being 20c per cubic metre, but last week the figure presented by HBRIC had risen to 27c per cubic metre, he said. \"The latest report going to CHB farmers this week projects the same land use as models of three to four years ago, but the water is 38 per cent more expensive now. \"These reports also said that for farmers to make a return from buying dam water they would need to be in the top 20 per cent of farmers using best practice for optimum productivity. \"If you only have average productivity, it's very risky - farmers who are not willing or able to be in the top 20 per cent will either need to decline the water, sell their farm or transfer the management to other people.\" All the councillors were critical of the lack of consultation around the council approving a \"provisional decision\" on entering the region into a 35-year water user agreement, subject to the scheme proceeding, at a cost of $43 million to ratepayers. Mr Barker said the money could be better spent on other issues in CHB such as dealing with the build up of shingle in the Tukituki River. Audience members were keen to ask questions. BEL Group chief executive Justine Kidd asked the councillors what vision they had for economic development in the region without the dam? Mr Graham responded that water storage was a big factor but that it could be on-farm rather than a big community scheme. Waipukurau dentist John Jukes got hearty applause when he said that the ecological problems around intensified farming should be solved first, before talking about the dam. Former CHB mayor and Hawke's Bay regional councillor Tim Gilbertson said the councillors were giving a slanted view full of half-truths. He objected to claims that only 150 farmers would benefit from the dam, saying it was a long-term plan that would deliver returns over time. \"There was no jumping up and down about spending $50 million on new tug boat for Napier Port, and this investment will be returning on the $80 million for the next 70 to 80 years.\" At the end of the meeting HBRC chairman Fenton Wilson said from his perspective there had been no fatal flaw in the process so far and confirmed the council would be consulting with the public before spending the $43 million on environmental flows. ##Story Name## Dbrotherhood Brotherhood in Death by JD Robb, Hachette, $34.99 JD Robb, aka Nora Roberts, certainly doesn't need any introduction, or any lessons in how to write a gripping thriller. Brotherhood in Death follows the career of Lieutenant Eve Dallas from the NYPSD and her sidekick, profiler Charlotte Mira, along with her husband Roarke. When they are landed with a bizarre killing, it becomes personal from the get-go, as Charlotte's husband Dennis is injured while his erstwhile cousin Edward is spirited away from the family house they were meeting at. It isn't long before Edward is found dead, and seriously abused by what seems like deranged killers. But this is just the start of a series of deaths, all of them alumni of Yale University and with connections to a mysterious brotherhood. Step by step, Eve and her team investigate the murders and identify other prospects while finding the link that provides the answers to the deaths. Just another day at the office for JD Robb, and another satisfying read. Tony Nielsen ##Story Name## Dsheep and goats The trouble with Sheep & Goats by Joanna Cannon, Imprint: Borough Press, $34.99 This novel reminds me of a film you might see at a film festival, slow to start with, but becoming more and more engrossing as it moves on and one that stays with you for quite a time afterwards. Luckily it is not a film because the writing is so good at times it almost reads like poetry. It is the story of the community trying to get through the extreme hot summer of 1976. It is told through the eyes of 10-year-old Grace. After attending church with her neighbour and younger friend Tilly, they become concerned about God. Church was a new experience for them. They were impressed by the vicar's homily, especially that God looks after the sheep, bringing them back into the fold rather than letting them wander everywhere like goats. At the same time Margaret Creasy, one of their neighbours on the avenue, has gone missing. Bored by never-ending heat they set themselves a mission to find both Mrs Creasy and God. They visit their neighbours and through their eyes the reader is made aware of old animosities, relationships and one or two more sinister happenings. These people know each other well, or think they do. It is unlike most of our communities today. For all its foibles or shortcomings, at least the avenue could be called a community. God is finally solved for them, Mrs Creasy reappears and the mystery probably solved for the reader by one telling line at the end. A quiet slow and thoroughly satisfying read.Margaret Reilly ##Story Name## Dfalling detective The Falling Detective by Christoffer Carlsson, Scribe Publications, $33 The background, and indeed the foreground, of this political thriller is race relations in contemporary Sweden - the often violent clashes between extreme right-wing groups which oppose all immigration, especially from the Middle East, and the left-wing opposition groups which want to welcome and integrate these people into society. A left-wing sociologist is found murdered, stabbed in the back in a Stockholm courtyard where he had gone to meet an interviewee for a theses. On the scene is Leo Junker, the detective of the title, recently restored to the homicide unit after suspension. He suffers from physical and mental problems and is reliant on medication. This is a complicated book, demanding concentration because of the many characters and the frequent shifts to incidents in the past. It is not so much a thriller as a well-written crime novel which gives an insight into one of the greatest humanitarian problems of our time.Graeme Barrow ##Story Name## D23nov15thriller Liar Liar By M.J.Arlidge, PenguinRandomhouse, $37 Detective Inspector Helen Grace, of the Southampton Police, leads the hunt to identify and capture a sadistic serial killer.

Arlidge does a great job here, garnishing what is clearly evil with a sprinkling of compassion.

It's not surprising her books are best-sellers. An easy read. Rosie Sanderson ##Story Name## Dseuss Peter Shand delves into the newly discovered Dr Seuss stories published after the author's death. What Pet Should I Get? Dr Seuss, Harper Collins, $24.99 Talk about being a kid in a pet shop. Books being resurrected from Theodor Seuss Geisel's long-lost manuscripts would seem - on the title jacket at least - a literal El Dorado, pure gold in terms of reading pleasure for children. However, just like the brother and sister sent into the pet shop by Dad to buy just ONE pet, I feel kind of ambivalent. On one hand, I'm delighted that the late author's wife, Audrey Geisel, and his longtime secretary and friend, Claudia Prescott, discovered the illustrations and text while cleaning out his office in 2013. They fashioned the raw material - a feat in itself involving, for example, painstaking research into the colours Geisel was using at the time - into a finished book that looks and sounds like a bona fide Dr Seuss. But it's NOT The Cat In The Hat, Green Eggs and Ham, or even How The Grinch Stole Christmas, which makes me wonder if there was a good reason why Geisel left the manuscript in his bottom drawer, so to speak. BUT a recurring theme to Dr Seuss books is persistence pays off, and eight pages of 'notes from the publisher' at the end make this book, which became an instant bestseller in America, totally worthwhile. The notes delve into the life of this bestselling author, including his relationships, especially with pets (he chose dogs), and an intriguing backstory to the book and how it was compiled from bits of text taped to uncoloured sketches. Now THAT'S pure gold. Here's an extract that really resonated with me: \"Ted Geisel was a perfectionist. He could spend months developing a character; days talking about the placement of a comma. 'I know my stuff looks like it was rattled off in 28 seconds,' he said, 'but every word is a struggle and every sentence is like the pangs of birth'.\" Horton and the Kwuggerbug (and More Lost Stories) Dr Seuss, Harper Collins, $24.99 Despite what I said in the above review, these Dr Seuss manuscripts must have been genuinely lost because they're THAT good. The genius of Dr Seuss is on the loose, you might say. And each of the four stories hits that Goldilocks zone of bedtime reading: Not too long to stretch your voice and give you a headache after a long day and not too short to have your child begging for another at its conclusion. However, all Kiwi adults concerned about the TPPA should read the title story, Horton and the Kwuggerbug. . The theme is, never enter into a deal with someone unless you are fully aware of ALL the ramifications. Dr Seuss, aka Theodor Seuss Geisel, obviously thought it was an important lesson for kids not to get in over their heads when someone promises them riches. In this case, the coveted Beezlenut tree that the crafty bug persuades Horton to carry him to is over a crocodile-infested lake, up a sheer mountain and across a terrifying crevasse. Horton obliges because a deal (for half the nuts) is a deal and he \"must see a deal through\". A half-dead Horton realises the full extent of the rort only when the Kwuggerbug hands him his half - the shells of the nuts. Brilliant, Dr Seuss. ##Story Name## 15FrenchFilm A middle-aged Kiwi called Lynn Paterson is circumnavigating New Zealand by kayak in an attempt to be the first female to do so, and to raise funds for the Mental Health Foundation of New Zealand. When she was younger, Lynne spent a couple of years in Hawke's Bay doing a hairdressing apprenticeship and she was back again in November, as part of her journey down the east coast. Lynn is undertaking this challenge to raise awareness of the work of the Mental Health Foundation and to draw attention to the challenge faced by carers such as herself and the underlying strength required to do the job. Having set out from Takapuna in October, heading south down the east coast, she has recently completed circuiting Stewart Island and is starting out on the long stretch northwards in the hope of arriving back home in Auckland in April. In conjunction with the upcoming Alliance Franaise French Film Festival at Cinema Gold in Havelock North, the Hawke's Bay French Association is jumping on board with Lynn by organising a special promotion in connection with the film The Sweet Escape on Saturday, April 2, in aid of the Mental Health Foundation. In this charming comedy, a Frenchman suffers a mid-life crisis and decides to go off on an adventure, kayaking through some of France's most beautiful countryside. The organisers of the film festival are offering a glass of sparkling wine at 5.15pm, before the screening of the film at 6pm, while local outlets such as La Petite Chocolat, Monsieur Macaron, Port o'Call, The Coffee Club and Picnic/FGSmith/Albion Canteen are offering tastings of some of their sweet goods. Action Outdoors Napier will be mounting a display of kayaking clothing and equipment, some members of the Hawke's Bay Kayak Racing Club will do a presentation and there will also be a photo display of Lynn's kayaking exploits. A supplement of $3 has been added to the normal price of cinema tickets which are now on sale at Cinema Gold in Havelock North. A similar promotion last year entitled Handmade with Love in Hawke's Bay, involving artisans from the Hastings Farmers' Market , was a huge success, with some local suppliers still experiencing spin-offs from that event. To further boost the donation to the Mental Health Foundation, a $5 raffle is being held with prizes donated by local businesses and individuals. These include a five-course degustation dinner, with wine pairings for two, at Pacifica, an original artwork by Jules Clarke and original glassware by Vicky Harris (both pieces with a kayaking theme), family packages from The National Aquarium of New Zealand and Ocean Spa, a copy of John Kirwan's book All Blacks Don't Cry from Paper Plus Taradale and a Devonshire tea for two from Port o' Call. There is also a LED light headlamp from Action Outdoors Napier, a Helmut Hirler B/W Aotearoa calendar from Artmosphere Gallery, a bouquet inspired by the colours of the sea from The Flower Barrow and two one-hour hire sessions of kayak, paddle and life jacket from Pandora Kayaks, as well as three double passes for Cinema Gold in Havelock North to be won. Tickets for the raffle, to be drawn following the screening, will be available on the night and there will be several spot prizes, including bags of muesli from Peggy Daring, products from Te Mata Figs and a gateau from Picnic/FGSmith/Albion Canteen. ##Story Name## 15kleinpaste If well-known nature champion Ruud Kleinpaste (aka The Bugman) was responsible for education, Hawke's Bay's natural environment would be our classroom. Ruud Kleinpaste is the ambassador for the Cape to City ecological restoration project. He is leading the education part of the programme with Department of Conservation's education programme coordinator Robyn McCool, with additional support from a range of partners including the Hawke's Bay Regional Council. Cape to City aims to 'teach the teachers' and inspire, encourage and equip them to \"reconnect students with nature\". Last year three schools participated in Cape to City programmes and the future plan is to involve six schools each year, in either student or teacher programmes. Robyn said the positive response and feedback from schools involved has helped confirm that the programme is worth expanding into other schools. Ruud says the course content has been developed in ways that encourages creative hands-on education using the environment as a context for learning across the curriculum. He adds that most of the school curriculum can be taught in a nature context. \"It's easy to get inspired by nature. When we are teaching the teachers, we just take them outside and walk around and as they start to observe the environment the questions start coming and they form their learning and content from there. There are so many teachable moments outside.\" \"Nature is one of the best learning environments we have. It's cheap, as there's no need for a physical classroom and all the materials are free, such as spiders and birds. \"For example we did a challenge around silk. We asked children to come up with how many creatures produce silk and to write down all the things that we can do with silk. It's pretty uplifting when you get back a sheet full of observations and ideas. \"We can cover off numeracy, literacy, science, social studies among others using nature as the education source from year one onward. Art is another obvious topic.\" Ruud said. Ruud and Cape to City hope to see the programme adopted by all schools within the Cape to City catchment area as well as schools in other regions and cities. Ruud has already started a similar programme with schools in Auckland. Robyn McCool, Cape to City Education programme coordinator is working with EIT Hawke's Bay on an education partnership which will see nature-time teaching principles integrated into the curriculum for year 2 and 3 candidate teachers. \"Schools already involved are keeping up their good work and have plans to expand their biodiversity enhancement learning. This is great and will ensure the Cape to City five- year education plan will have an impact on both young lives and the future of our region's biodiversity,\" said Robin. ? Cape to City is a five-year, $6 million project, a partnership between Hawke's Bay Regional Council, DOC, Cape Sanctuary, Landcare Research, various landowners and businesses as well as iwi and hap. The project has funding from the Aotearoa Foundation. ##Story Name## 15RachelB Kingfish with sauted sweet and sour capsicumsThe meatiness of kingfish teams well with robust flavours and this capsicum saut is a perfect match.

Alan says New Zealand is growing the best apples in the world. \"We are already number one for our international competitive edge and this season is going to be exceptional. \"Global demand is for bigger apples and over this last month New Zealand's apples have been feeding off the perfect growing conditions with plenty of sunshine. \"Our oceanic climate is perfect for apple growing. We have a coastal sea breeze keeping apples cool during the night and are experiencing day after day of sunny and warm temperatures in the mid to high 20s.\" \"In January we forecasted New Zealand would produce a record export crop of $700-million. We were expecting, given the relatively cool spring conditions that trees would grow slightly smaller apples. \"But a month of perfect growing conditions has seen fruit really come on. It's going to be an outstanding season and all our growing regions will prosper,\" Alan says. \"New Zealand's apple industry is entering an exciting time capturing significant growth, investment and profitability. It's great news for our apple growing regions of Hawke's Bay, Nelson and Central Otago, Gisborne, Waikato, Wairarapa and South Canterbury.\" ##Story Name## 15podiatrist An urge for a lifestyle change meant a bonus for the Bay when podiatrist and founder of Auckland's largest podiatry group, Alex MacLeod, moved from Auckland - where he has 13 podiatry clinics - to Havelock North. Moving here just over 18 months ago Alex, director and co-owner of Healthy Steps podiatry group, says he chose the region because of the environment and because he liked the choice of schools for his youngest daughter, aged 7. The move coincided with a chance to buy local podiatrist Julie Clarke's practice, while keeping Julie on staff as national clinical manager. Starting with a Taradale clinic, Alex and his Hawke's Bay team - now numbering three podiatrists and four admin staff - have branched out across Hawke's Bay, with a clinic in Havelock North at Peak Fitness with a special focus on sports podiatry, and general clinics in Hastings, Havelock North and a part-time practice at the Tukituki Medical Centre in Waipukurau. While Healthy Steps has a firm skill base across all aspects of podiatry, the Havelock North clinic for example incorporates gait analysis equipment, a particular passion for the team is diabetic foot care. \"Healthy Steps has several contracts for diabetic podiatry treatment across Auckland and over the last 10 years we have helped contribute to a really low amputation rate there. We want to get the amputation rate down in Hawke's Bay also,\" says Alex. Healthy Steps completed an auditing process with the Hawke's Bay DHB and gained the contract for diabetic podiatry from Central Hawke's Bay to Wairoa. A key focus for the team is to prevent damage to diabetic feet, by education and early intervention. \"As a podiatrist, you only have to spend a day at the hospital looking at ulcers and feet about to be amputated, to become passionate about helping,\" Alex says. \"You look at the patients and how it affects them - physically and emotionally - and somewhere along the line it could have been prevented. \"Diabetes has been referred to as 'the next health tsunami'. People are often unaware of the implications of some of their lifestyle choices. We want to put resources into diabetic education, teach people about the complications and prevent them.\" Diabetes affects the bloodstream and the nerve supply. This means patients may not feel damage or injury to their feet but it also means once damage has occurred it does not easily heal. \"This leads to ulceration, which leads to amputation. Our mission is to reduce the number of below the knee amputations due to diabetes.\" While diabetes used to be \"typically a middle-aged problem\" Alex says it is now across all ages, all ethnicities and all populations. Healthy Steps wants all diabetics and their families to be aware of the complications and they want all diabetics to get their feet checked. \"The check is free. If we find they have high risk factors, further treatment is free. If they have low risk factors we have an affordable fee structure so they can continue to see us. We want to prevent problems before they happen.\" Healthy Steps has made the process simple by using just one 0800 number - 0800myfoot (0800 693668) - and they have letter, text and phone call follow-up to make sure patients remeber appointments. They can also make referrals to dieticians, physiotherapists and whanau support. \"We'd rather refer at a low level and get people on track than see them in hospital\" Alex says. ?If you have foot pain or concerns about your feet - from sports injuries to cracked heels, corns or plantar faciitis - and want to investigate general or diabetic podiatry care, call Healthy Steps on 0800 693668 for an appointment with a clinic near you. ##Story Name## 15eyes One of the most common conditions we see in optometry practice is an inflammatory condition of part of the eyelid called blepharitis. Symptoms include dryness, burning, itching, stickiness, watering, light sensitivity, red eyes, frequent styes and intermittent blurred vision. Many people with blepharitis suffer no discomfort or symptoms at all but, if left unmanaged, it can cause dry-eye symptoms and eyelid inflammation. The most common form of eyelid blepharitis is meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD), also termed posterior blepharitis. The meibomian glands are located in the eyelids and they secrete the oily layer of the tear film that is crucial in preventing rapid evaporation of tears. The oil glands become blocked with thickened secretions, and chronically clogged glands eventually become unable to secrete oil which results in permanent changes in the tear film and dry eyes. Your oil glands have gone on strike. There are other forms of blepharitis - some caused by microscopic mites and their waste materials or one that creates flaking and scaling - including on the eyelids. There are others too. Chronic blepharitis in any form left untreated will cause meibomian gland dysfunction. Although blepharitis is quite common, unfortunately it often goes undiagnosed. Even when diagnosed it is often not treated or is not treated effectively until it has become chronic or severe. Eyelid hygiene is the cornerstone of treatment for most cases of blepharitis and, in most cases, needs to be an ongoing commitment at home. Besides a programme of eyelid hygiene, the severity of the blepharitis and related symptoms may require supplemental treatment with topical and oral medicine, nutritional supplements such as omega-3 fatty acids, and lubricant eye drops. However, for cases of meibomian gland dysfunction optometrists, or ophthalmologists, may also offer in house treatments such as meibomian gland expression and IPL. IPL is a fairly new treatment for meibomian gland dysfunction that uses polychromatic pulsed light to stimulate the meibomian glands in order for them to return to their normal function. For those who suffer dry eye related to meibomian gland dysfunction IPL treatment can give relief that lasts for months. During an eye examination your optometrist can diagnose blepharitis and dry eye, and differentiate between the different forms so that treatment is targeted most appropriately to the cause. ##Story Name## 15abundant You may have heard of Co enzyme Q10 (CoQ10). Over the next month we will discover what it is, how it works and when it can be beneficial to add as supplements. Sometimes CoQ10 should be taken as a separate supplement; sometimes it is best when combined with other compounds. The main role of CoQ10 is in our cell energy engines - our amazing mitochondria. CoQ10 is essential for making the energy our bodies need. It acts a little like both the fuel line and spark plugs in your car. It is used to transport energy within mitochondria and then acts like a spark plug to ignite energy. Ageing, some drugs, especially cholesterol-reducing drugs and several diseases reduce CoQ10 levels, which can have dire consequences for our health. CoQ10 is what chemists call a \"redox\" agent. This means it can switch between its oxidised state as ubiquinone then change to its reduce state of ubiquinol. It does this by gaining and losing electrons. When it loses electrons it becomes fully oxidised ubiquinone. When it gains electrons it becomes fully reduced ubiquinol. The reality is both work well from supplements and the body freely switches as needed. Historically the best CoQ10 is made by one company, the Kaneka Corporation in Japan who developed the complex process to make nature identical CoQ10. Any product using Kaneka Q10R will be outstanding though generally be a little more expensive. The most common reason I recommend CoQ10 is to be taken alongside statin medications to protect against the muscle weakness and pain, low energy and depressed mood associated with these drugs.

Dr Popovic is an internationally acclaimed specialist on brain health and how people can improve their brains at any age. The Alzheimers Societies of Napier and Hastings are promoting the benefits of healthy brains by bringing Dr Popovic to speak to an expected large audience. Alzheimers Napier and Alzheimers Hastings Managers, Tania Roebuck and Cheryl Robinson say the session, Boost your Brain and Defy Dementia, is an inspirational seminar about how people can take positive action and achieve extraordinary results. The Alzheimer societies say this is a seminar that anybody who is interested in the long-term health of their brain and general well-being as they age should go to. Dr Popovic has proved that at any age we can sharpen thinking, improve concentration and memory and expand creativity. The emerging field of neuroplasticity, or how the brain can change its own structure and function according to what we do, how we behave and we think, is at the heart of Dr Popovic's work. Dr Popovic knows that helping people in these ways reduces the risk of developing depression, anxiety disorders and Alzheimers disease. Education to help look after your brain is relevant to any age and it is part of the Alzheimers Societies' work to promote inclusion of brain health in an overall healthy lifestyle. Dr Popovic is a popular business speaker in Australia and does a lot of work helping people improve their employees' performance. ? Tickets for Dr Popovic's seminar are available at the Municipal Theatre, Napier or online through Ticketek. ##Story Name## 15Health2 Are you a woman in her 40s, 50s or 60s? The physical and psychological changes that occur during these midlife years can cause emotional stress that may lead to unwanted weight gain. Do you feel overweight, sluggish and when you look in the mirror - if you dare - not like what you see? Our midlife years can be challenging for us at the best of times. We may have financial burdens, face retirement, an empty nest, a parent's illness or death, career moves and residential changes. All this plus the side effects of menopause, mood swings, hot flushes, slowed metabolism and the redistribution of body weight. This time of our lives can be the most frustrating for us in terms of maintaining an ideal body weight. So what's a girl to do? During long-term stress your body sets in motion a chain of events that reads like a whodunnit. Your hormones play tag with each other, releasing cortisol into your body. This prepares your body for an instant state of readiness in the classic \"fight or flight\" response. You know these feelings - nervous, jittery, tense, tearful, on edge - and when you feel this way other hormones direct us to find food, or alcohol, for comfort. Food like chocolate becomes our saviour. We eat and we feel better ... for a while. Once the stressful situation has passed our hormones settle down and we're left with feeling \"normal\" for a while ... until another stressful situation arises and has us reaching for that block of chocolate or that glass of alcohol. Strategies for dealing with stress should include exercise as part of a balanced approach. Exercise is a powerful tamer of emotional stress and menopausal symptoms. Fortunately, in Hawke's Bay we have access to beautiful walking spaces, a variety of gyms, sports clubs and activity options. Eating healthy meals and staying away from sugary and processed food is hard to do at the best of times and when you are stressed these are the very foods you turn to for comfort. Keep a food diary and see if you can identify your \"emotional eating\" times. Then resolve to change them one by one by, say, replacing the chocolate with a piece of fruit - not as exciting, however the goal is to look great and feel better and taking one step at a time is how to do it. Midlife emotions can be a challenge, so take control and navigate your way to a healthier, happier you. ##Story Name## 15DianeStride Following the success of last year's event, the Women's Health Series is back this year. All the proceeds of the evening will again be going to Child Cancer Hawke's Bay, so invite a friend and go along for a fun and informative evening. \"We had such a great turnout last year, with more than 200 women coming out to listen to our experts. It really highlighted the need for this type of information to be available,\" says Diane Stride, a dietitian based in Havelock North at the Village Health Centre and organiser of the event. This time Diane will be speaking about nutrition. \"My topic is called Nutrition versus Intuition: The art of eating. This is a topic that I am really passionate about, as it plays such an important role in what we eat. \"We are living in a time with 'information overload' about nutrition, and people are getting really confused. I want to simplify things by taking it back to basics for people, so that they understand how all the components of diet fit together. \"The way people view food has changed and knowledge and values around food is different from how it was years ago. These factors are often subconscious or forgotten, and affect us to a greater or lesser extent. The talk will be a mixture of scientific facts, research information and practical challenges and tips to make it more relevant,\" Diane says. Dr Derek Goodisson, a surgeon in Hawke's Bay specialising in head and neck surgery, including facial reconstruction and head and neck cancer, will be speaking about early detection of skin cancer. He has a special interest in skin cancer, and due to its high incidence in Hawke's Bay he wants to get the message out. His session will be interactive and will cover a range of topics including screening for skin cancer, prevention, where and when people should go for assistance and what some of the treatments are. \"This is a fantastic opportunity to hear first hand from a leading expert in the field,\" says Diane. The evening's panel of experts includes gynaecologist Dr Keith Harrison and endocrinologist Dr Ole Schmiedel and the format will be slightly different. People can submit questions anonymously to diane@dietitianconsultant.co.nz Questions chosen will be around topics that are of interest to a wide range of people, for example adrenal fatigue - how is it diagnosed? Cortisol - how do I know if my levels are low and how does that affect me? Pre-diabetes, hormone replacement therapy, endometriosis and more. The Women's Health Series is suitable for women of all ages, but particularly women aged 16 years and up, as many of the issues discussed are not age-related. Even though it is called the Women's Health Series, men can come too, says Diane, as they may find some of the topics interesting. Last year the tickets sold out. All the specialists are giving their time for free, with all proceeds from the evening going to the Child Cancer Foundation. \"We are delighted to be involved with Diane and her colleagues once again, which will not only benefit children with cancer and their families, but will be great interest to many Hawke's Bay residents,\" Vicky Rope, business development manager for the Child Cancer Foundation in Hawke's Bay says. Women's Health Series - at the Village Baptist Church Auditorium, 147 Te Aute Road, Havelock North. Thursday March 17 at 7pm (doors open at 6.45pm).

Stead has invited award winning poets Gregory O'Brien, Chris Price and Paula Green to share this evening with him as guest readers. National Library spokesman Peter Ireland says this cultural event is an important and popular occasion in Hawke's Bay. \"Poets' Night Out is a wonderful chance for Hawkes' Bay to be part of this special occasion honouring the Poet Laureate in Havelock North, the birthplace of the Poet Laureate programme.\" Stead will receive his hand-carved tokotoko during a special ceremony at Matahiwi marae earlier in the day. Each Laureate receives their own tokotoko - a ceremonial carved walking stick - symbolising their authority and status. The National Library holds the matua, or parent tokotoko, to signify their guardianship of the New Zealand Poet Laureate Award. The tokotoko is a link to the Hawke's Bay origins of the award, and is created by Haumoana artist Jacob Scott. The National Library assumed responsibility for the New Zealand Poet Laureate Award from Te Mata Estate Winery in 2007. Hawke's Bay poet Marty Smith, winner of the Jesse McKay award in the 2014 national book awards, says the evening always has a special kind of magic. \"Poetry travels though poets like electricity, and the sequence of readings from CK Stead and his guests is a chance to hear exciting poets shock us sideways into other ways of looking. \"Music and poetry are closely linked, and it's our pleasure to support Project Prima Volta by showcasing these talented young singers who represent the future of the arts. This big shout out to the Poet Laureate will be a stunning evening of celebration.\" ?

William designed many of the wonderful old buildings around Havelock North, including Iona College. He was also a highly accomplished artist, often described as one of New Zealand's most important early painters, whose watercolours of Hawke's Bay and Taupo depict the history of New Zealand in an illuminating and fascinating manner. His late daughter, Helen Lester, an Iona Old Girl, donated 50 of his works from her private collection to Iona, and over the weekend of March 19 and 20, these will be sold to raise funds for the Iona Heritage Room refurbishment. The works will be on display for the first time, in the award-winning Blyth Performing Arts Centre at Iona - recently judged the best NZ building of 2015 and awarded the New Zealand Architecture Medal. In capturing many of his favourite scenes around New Zealand, Rush has preserved in perpetuity the natural beauty of the historic landscape. These paintings are meticulously and skilfully executed, an outstanding reminder of Hawke's Bay heritage. The public are invited to view the works of William Rush and take the chance to acquire their own slice of New Zealand history. The exhibition runs Saturday March 19 from 10am to 3pm and Sunday March 20 from 1pm to 3pm. All 50 works are available for purchase at a fixed price during the exhibition. ##Story Name## 15gala Originally excavated with help from the students in 1915, the original Hereworth swimming pool will be upgraded with funds to be raised at the school's French fair on Sunday March 20. The pool is believed to be one of the earliest school pools built in Hawke's Bay, although records are sketchy about the exact date it was completed. School historian Railene Mabin says learning how to swim in the early 1900s was vital, due to the large number of drownings at river crossings. \"Building a school pool was seen to be ahead of its time in those days, however it was quickly viewed as a very good investment in the boys' health and welfare.\" Before the school pool was built, the boys swam in the Waikoko Lake, now the Hastings Showgrounds. The school had suffered a tragedy in 1897 when the headmaster William Rainbow drowned while attempting to rescue two students on a school picnic at a local river. Hereworth Parents' Association president, Hugh Ritchie, says maintaining the pool is as important as ever, as many school pools around New Zealand have been decommissioned. \"It's great to see the facility being used, particularly by the boarders who are really enjoying the improvements so far.\" The Hereworth Old Boys' Association, led by president James Nilsson, began work on the pool during the summer holidays, getting it painted and ready to swim in for the start of the school year. \"The biggest part of the project was having to grind out nearly 200 linear metres of cracks and seal them, to stop the leaking.\" Hereworth headmaster Steve Fiet says celebrating the history of the school pool is a vital part of the school's ongoing success. \"We would love to hear from anyone who has information on the history of the school swimming pool or any memorabilia, particularly photos, from those early days.\" The Hereworth French Affair Gala will be held on March 20 with the gates open at 10am. The Hereworth grounds will come alive with all the flavours of a French fair including a wide array of food stalls, fresh produce, Easter treats, French cars, bric-a-brac, pre-loved haute couture, plus good old-fashioned children's entertainment, a cricket machine and pony rides. An art auction featuring works from well-known and emerging artists, along with a number of celebrity lots will start at 12.30pm with auctioneer Simon Tremain in charge of proceedings. Auction organisers say there are some real gems up for grabs, including paintings from Angus Walker and Anna Jepson, and photography from Lee Warren. A percentage of the proceeds from the art auction will be donated to the Limitless Hope Charity. ##Story Name## 15toughKids Last week 2500 students crawled through cargo nets, climbed over cable drums and tested their balance to prove they were Hawke's Bay's toughest kid. Children from Years 3 to 8 competed in a 26-piece obstacle course for the third annual Mitre 10 MEGA Tough Kid at Hawke's Bay Regional Sports Park. The event went off without a hitch, organiser Kerry Meehan said, where students and the hundreds of parents who came to watch had a great time. \"It was absolutely brilliant,\" she said. \"It worked well, everyone had fun and there was a good atmosphere.\" Of the 45 schools which entered, the two toughest schools with the highest percentage of entrants, were Havelock North Primary school and Taradale Intermediate school. With obstacles ranging from tyres, a climbing wall, and cargo nets, the students seemed to have some favourites. \"They absolutely loved the water slide, and the fire truck hosing them down,\" Ms Meehan said. \"They got quite muddy and soapy. It was messy business.\" Ms Meehan said they had a few minor hiccups, such as the inflatables trying to make a break for it in yesterday's high wind, but everything else \"went according to plan\". Aside from seeing the students' enjoyment, Ms Meehan said a highlight of the day was seeing them all work together. \"Kids would fall but they'd pick themselves up again, and their friends would be encouraging them,\" she said. \"The schools really stuck together. They would hold hands and look out for each other ... there was good sportsmanship.\" She said some of the pieces were \"a bit scary\", but the kids helped each other get past the obstacles. Another highlight was the estimated $8000 raised for Breath HB from the event. Some of this came from the 3000 sausages brought by Rapid Relief, which were donated and cooked to raise more money"}, {"title": "RME Rocky Mtn Dealerships earns $11.29-million in 2015", "article": "Rocky Mountain Dealerships Inc (TSX:RME) Shares Issued 19,384,086 Last Close 3/15/2016 $5.95 Tuesday March 15 2016 - News Release Mr. Garrett Ganden reports ROCKY MOUNTAIN DEALERSHIPS INC. (TSX:RME, OTCQX:RCKXF) ANNOUNCES 2015 FOURTH QUARTER AND YEAR-END RESULTS Rocky Mountain Dealerships Inc. has released its financial results for the quarter and year ended Dec. 31, 2015. Summary of the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2015: - Total revenues decreased by 2.9 per cent to $285.6-million. - Used equipment sales increased by 16.1 per cent to $92.7-million. - Gross profit decreased by 4.9 per cent to $37.5-million (13.1 per cent of sales). - Adjusted diluted earnings per share declined by 21.9 per cent to 25 cents. - Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization declined 16.6 per cent to $9.0-million. - Inventory increased by $10.1-million to $499.8-million. Summary of the year ended Dec. 31, 2015: - Total revenues increased by 1.0 per cent to $975.5-million. - Same-store agriculture sales held flat despite softer industry demand. - Used equipment sales increased by 24.4 per cent to $377.5-million. - Gross profit decreased by 2.5 per cent to $142.0-million (14.6 per cent of sales). - Adjusted diluted earnings per share declined by 26.8 per cent to 71 cents. - Adjusted EBITDA declined 18.9 per cent to $28.6-million. - Inventory decreased by $69.8-million to $499.8-million. - Expanded the sales territory through the acquisition of Chabot. - Completed the construction of its new facility in Neepawa, Man. During 2015, Rocky was able to deliver strong gains in several key areas in what was a challenging operating environment. Among other factors, the impact of the U.S. exchange rate on new equipment prices dictated a different approach to equipment purchasing in 2015, bolstering demand for used equipment and product support within the company's agriculture segment. Initiatives undertaken by Rocky in response to these changes focused resources and efforts on these areas of demand, resulting in revenue growth and improved cash flow. The continued demand for lightly used equipment helped drive down inventory levels by $68.9-million during 2015, excluding inventory acquired through business combinations. On the industrials front, the persistence of the depression in oil prices continued to negatively impact economic activity in Alberta. Cost containment initiatives undertaken by Rocky in 2014 and 2015 helped to curtail losses in that regard during the year. \"Rocky was able to leverage the market conditions that prevailed in 2015 to further our existing initiatives to reduce inventory and build our product support business,\" remarked Garrett Ganden, president and chief executive officer of Rocky. \"As we continue to grow our installed base of agriculture equipment and customers, we anticipate further demand for our product support business, which posted another strong year in 2015. We were also pleased to see the consistency in our same-store agriculture revenue year over year, despite softer overall equipment demand. \"In addition to these operational initiatives, Rocky was able to further grow its footprint in 2015 by acquiring Chabot Implements, a long-standing dealer of Case IH products in Manitoba. This strategic acquisition allowed us to further consolidate our position as a major equipment distributor in the Manitoba region. We were also able to enhance our product and service offering in the area of geomatics and precision farming through our acquisition of NGF Geomatics. As farms get larger and more technologically sophisticated, we feel that Rocky is well positioned to meet their equipment and technology demands. \"The cost containment strategies that we enacted during the year offset much of the incremental SG&A [sales, general and administration] associated with our acquisitions. As part of this process, we undertook initiatives to reduce our fixed charges by amalgamating locations in certain regions. We believe that the steps taken in this regard will allow us to uphold the level of service and territory coverage that our customers expect, at a reduced cost. Due to investments we have made in process and efficiency, we were able to both grow our sales territory and shrink our bricks-and-mortar footprint, with little interruption to our core business. \"Our industrial segment lost some of the traction that they had gained in 2014, due primarily to the precipitous drop in oil prices, and its effect on the Alberta economy. While Rocky's industrials segment is not reliant on doing business directly with Alberta's oil industry, we still are prone to the indirect effects that this downturn has created. We continue to work on initiatives to further our brand and ultimately achieve profitability despite these challenges.\" Mr. Ganden concluded his comments by saying: \"Our focus continues to be the safe, dependable equipment partner of choice for our agriculture and industrial customers. We continue to lay the groundwork for maintaining and growing customer relationships across our network. To that end, in 2015, we were pleased to open a new, state-of-the-art store in Neepawa, Man., and we are looking forward to the completion of our new, larger store in Yorkton, Sask., in the coming weeks. Through these investments in our facilities and in the communities we operate, we hope to maintain the continued annuity of business that these relationships can create.\" Annual meeting of shareholders Rocky also announced today that its annual meeting of shareholders (AGM) will take place at 2 p.m. on May 3, 2016, in the showroom of Rocky Mountain Equipment, 260180 Writing Creek Cres., Rocky View county, in Alberta.

Today, aviation in remote locations is a hallmark of Canadian aviation industry around the world. The next big step is to do some of these most challenging tasks with Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), where we can once again lead the world in innovation in operating in remote areas. As Canada's national non-profit association representing public and private innovation in unmanned vehicle systems, Unmanned Systems Canada has spearheaded initiatives which have resulted in the dramatic growth of the UAS industry in Canada. However, we are now at an impasse. With modest, but immediate government action, this impasse can and will be bridged with substantive impacts on the economy, and renewed innovation with novel applications of UAS technology. The growth of the Canadian UAS sector in Canada has benefited from our close collaborative efforts over many years of work with Transport Canada. The \"UAV Program Design Working Group\" co-chaired by Transport Canada and Unmanned Systems Canada is an industry and government stakeholder committee formed in 2010, tasked with developing a suite of proposed regulations enabling routine unmanned aircraft operations (aka \"file and fly\") in Canada. The regulations development process was divided into four distinct phases as a function of risk: UAS under 25kg., operating within visual line of sight of the pilot; UAS under 25kg., operating beyond visual line of sight of the pilot; UAS between 25 and 150kg., operating beyond visual line of sight; and UAS over 150kg operating beyond visual line of sight. Phase 1 was completed in 2012 and has resulted in a Notice of Proposed Amendment which is expected to become law in 2017. However, these regulations will only address UAS operations within Visual Line of Sight of the operator. Clearly, monitoring the integrity of Canadian pipelines and hydro lines, measuring the bulk value of our forests, environmental monitoring of the Arctic, are but some of the applications where operations must be conducted Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS). The Phase 2 working group report on recommended changes to Canadian Aviation Regulations to enable BLVOS operations has been completed. It now requires the resources for implementation. Today, UAS operations are authorized by Transport Canada with the issuance of a Special Flight Operations Certificate (SFOC). Whereas virtually no SFOCs were issued when we started working in earnest with Transport Canada, by 2012 that number had grown to 345, then 945 in 2013 and 1,672 in 2014: we expect that the 2015 tally will follow that growth curve. These SFOCs are being achieved by industry and the regulator working to the results of the Phase 1 work, while awaiting formalization in law. What this means is, that the regulatory efforts to date, have already realized the remarkable economic growth which Unmanned Systems Canada had projected! Every day, somewhere in Canada UAS are: o Rapidly providing police with high quality airborne data for accident scene reconstruction, significantly reducing the time for reopening our transportation arteries; o Undertaking monitoring of structures such as industrial flare stacks and cell phone towers, improving safety while lowering costs; o Increasing crop yields while reducing the use of pesticides and herbicides and growing the discipline of precision agriculture; o Used for environmental monitoring ranging from non-intrusive surveillance of bird sanctuaries to industrial facilities in our energy sector; o Used on film sets to improve the quality of their product, while enhancing the competitiveness of our film industry; and o Site planning, project monitoring, aggregate pit measurements and a host of other applications in the construction industry. In addition, at least 20 Canadian academic institutions and companies now offer training programs on UAS systems; there have been major steps taken by the insurance industry to address risk management, and so much more. While our industry has grown exponentially, there has been little or no growth in the critical Government staff required to support this federally regulated economic sector. All of the existing federal government personnel resources assigned to the UAS sector will be occupied for at least the next 18 months on the review and approval of the new regulations noted above. The direct impact is that the draft BVLOS regulatory recommendations and standards resulting from the completion of the second phase of the working group with TC continue to await staff availability for formal staffing and approval within the Department. The recommendations and standards proposed in this phase are critical to the future of our industry and will truly release the economic potential. Some technology development remains to meet the \"sense and avoid\" capability to fully permit BVLOS operations; however publishing the standards recommended by the working group will provide industry and R&D organizations with the required design objectives. In addition, because BVLOS technology and operations experience is exportable for mining survey, environmental monitoring and a host of other applications, we risk losing a world-leading opportunity. Therefore, we propose that: o The federal government immediately increase the staffing levels of experts at Transport Canada with a mandate to proceed without delay to review, approve and implement the BVLOS guidelines; o That the federal government identify specific funding through Innovation, Science and Economic Development and the National Research Council to enable BVLOS operations by working with and funding Canadian companies to test, and if needed close technology gaps with improved 'sense and avoid' systems; o Financial incentives be created for small aircraft operators and equipment manufacturers to install Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) equipment into all aircraft. ADS-B promises to greatly improve aviation safety, and in particular the safe integration of UAS into our airspace as an existing aid in sense and avoid technology; and o Ensure that interdepartmental (e.g. Statistics Canada, Global Affairs, ISED, TC) resources are assigned to a collaborative effort to measure this new economic sector in order to support evidence-based public policy making and investment by the private sector. Policy must also encourage growth in this new economic sector through targeted Industrial Technology Benefits (ITB) requirements on any federal government UAS procurements. Canadian industry has worked diligently and persistently with the federal government to create hundreds of new companies and commercial initiatives and the creation of a Canadian UAS industry in only a few years. However, we risk being rapidly overtaken by our competitors without commensurate support from the federal government. Other jurisdictions, notably the UK, US and European governments and regulatory bodies are investing heavily and working closely with industry to test how technologies can facilitate safe BVLOS operations in preparation for rulemaking. With the timely implementation of our modest recommendations, we can ensure that the economic outcomes of Canadian innovation can continue apace, and, we can keep Canadian companies in a position of world leadership.

The deal comes two years after Canada's largest grocery-store operator, Loblaw (L.T), acquired Rexall rival Shoppers Drug Mart for C$12.4B. The added financial heft allows the drug-store chains to expand their product lines and generate better terms from suppliers. MCK, whose primary business is as a drug wholesaler, rises 2.3% to $160.19, hitting a 1-month high.

(kevin.kingsbury@wsj.com; @kevinkingsbury) 9:17 ET - Culture gets a lot of attention from company leaders these days, especially in financial-services firms trying to get in front of compliance problems. But even those who espouse its importance may not understand what culture is--even at their own companies. Deloitte surveyed more than 7K executives in a variety of industries for a new report on workplace and human-capital trends and found while 87% of them believe culture is an important business priority, just 28% admitted they understand their organization's culture and only 12% believe their companies are driving the \"right culture.\" Deloitte defines culture as a firm's values, beliefs and behaviors. Finra, Wall Street's self-regulatory organization, recently sent large brokerages an 8-question survey asking them to assess their internal cultures, hoping ultimately to establish a set of best practices.

Diane Saxe accepted an invitat ion from Ontario Federation of Agriculture (OFA) president Don McCabe to join him and other OFA representatives on a two-day tour of Southwestern Ontario's farm country. The g roup made stops at a number of the region's agri-businesses, farms, greenhouse operations and grain handling facilities, as well a visit to Sarnia's Western University Research Park. Saxe, a long-time Toronto environmental lawyer, was appointed the province's top environmental boss in Dec. and shortly after raised the ire of some in the rural community when she suggested revisiting the tax exempt status of coloured diesel fuel, which largely benefits farmers. McCabe sa id the OFA's goal in inviting the commissioner on the tour was to provide her with some insight into modern agricultural technology and allow her the opportunity to see farmers doing their best in terms of meeti ng sustainabi l it y goals on their farms. \"We require all the tools in the tool box to maximize our ability to hit sustainability goals which are profit, planet and people,\" he said. \"Farmers have to be making money to afford the tools needed to take care of the environment in the way it should.\" The f irst stop on the tour was at Ad- vantage Farm Equipment's London-area outlet where Jaap Kroondijk, the company's precision farming specialist, provided the commissioner with a power-point presentation on Precision Agriculture and its relationship to sustainable agriculture. He explained the concept and practice of applying fertilizer and other inputs only when and where they are needed through the magic of UBS technology. The commissioner, who peppered the presenter with lots of questions, appeared to grasp the concept and later said she was impressed with the measures farmers are taking to protect the environment. McCabe pointed out that most consumers today are far removed from the farm gate and are increasingly demanding. However, he said in spite of the costs to farmers in protecting the environment, consumers don't pay any more for agricultural products. \"Issues such as climate change and phosphorous going into Lake Erie concerns farmers as well, there is no argument about that,\" said Mc-Cabe, noting that phosphorus comes from the landscape and also originates from sources other than agriculture. McCabe pointed out to the commissioner that it is also not the desire of farmers to have phosphorus run into the lakes, rather they paid for it"}, {"title": "Tackling ag issues with humour; Dan Needles and Rob Saik go about it in different ways but they both get laughs", "article": "There was a contrast of styles between the last two presenters at the Ontario Processing Vegetable Grow ers on February 2 but both got laughs.

Dan Needles followed, focusing the cultural rural roots of Southwestern On tario in a self-deprecating manner. Progress on his ru ral property, he said, would be to drive a tractor with power steering around his yard. Needles, who penned the Wingfield Farm series and other works celebrating things rural, offered the fol lowing observation before he took command of the microphone. \"After that last presenta tion, my check-engine light came on.\" Saik, founder of the crop input consulting firm Agri- Trends Inc., got the audience revved up with his spirited defense of \"modern agri culture\" and attacks on the naysayers. \"I swim with the swim; that's the kind of guy I am,\" Saik declared. \"I'm not a shill.\" He made the following points: The top considerations for agricultural sustainabil- ity are the soil and water-use efficiency. The world is a place of abundance and has never been as peaceful as it is today. In order to feed the world, farmers need access to sci entific advances. Thanks to genetic engi neering, pesticide use has fallen, as measured by the weight of products applied. Plant breeding has ad vanced more in the past five years than in the previous 5,000. The value of data farm ers collect can only be fully realized through it analysis and by establishing bench marks which allow them to compare with other farmers. Precision agriculture will move forward as all its related technologies - \"vari able rate everything\" - are brought together. Most Canadians are so removed from agriculture that it's become a concern for the industry. If people were to attempt to grow their own food in gardens, their appreciation for pesticides would in crease. Saik was born in rural Northeastern Alberta. His views were featured in a lengthy particle in the Febru ary 9 edition of this publica tion. He's currently looking to raise another $500,000 to fund the film \"Know GMO\" being directed by his son, Nick Saik. Donations for the movie can be directed through Farm and Food Care Canada.

A&L Canada Laboratories of London, Ontario has developed and equipped the first-of-its-kind drone with the sensors, equipment, and software that will let farmers easily collect and interpret valuable data that will help them make good crop and business management decisions. \"We have built a plane that is a full solution - easy to fly, affordable, and with reliable software that works seamlessly,\" explains Greg Patterson, certified crop advisor and president of A&L Canada Laboratories. \"We can have data from a plane onto a tablet on the edge of the field in 10 minutes.\" The company has also developed a multispectral sensor that can fit either into the UAV it has developed or can be retrofitted into other drones. A&L's multispectral sensor picks up more bandwidths of light than the currently used infrared sensors, enabling farmers to collect and extract more data - data that can be used to determine crop yields, identify nutritional disorders in plants, or detect the presence of disease in a field. \"We're about selling a technology that is useful to farmers in gathering crop production data, offering a solution that is practical and easy for anyone to use,\" says Patterson. \"Not only does our technology collect data, but we also offer the agronomy support for interpreting that data, which no one else in the industry currently does.\" Drone technology has been growing in popularity in North America in recent years for both recreation and business uses. Agriculture, with its large cropland areas, is particularly emerging as an industry for which the technology can have beneficial applications. A report by the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International predicts commercial drones will create more than $80 billion USD in economic impact over the next decade, and that precision agriculture will be responsible for the biggest portion of that growth. A&L Canada began experimenting with UAV technology in 2009, but challenges linked to finding suitable equipment and reliable software convinced the company to design their own system from the ground up with the needs of their agricultural client base in mind. The beta version of the UAV was on display at Canada's Outdoor Farm Show in Woodstock last September and A&L has been taking orders for spring 2016 delivery of the units. A&L is also planning to offer customized data collection services using UAVs. The technology will be marketed by Aero Insights Inc., a division of A&L Canada Laboratories.

Barrick Gold Corporation (TSE: ABX) - Chairman John Thornton Outlines Vision and Strategy at Investor Day - 23/2/2016 Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. This will be a little bit unusual for me--I'm going to work off a script, so that it's crystal clear what I want to get across, and we can hand it out to you later on if you don't want to take notes. This is our first investor day in five years. From now on we will have this day every other year or possibly even every year, depending on the circumstances, and whether or not you all are interested in it. This will be one of a number of steps we will take to be transparent and build trust with you. Transparency is the currency of respect. It is a core feature of a company founded on a culture of partnership. As your partners and fellow owners, we will be straightforward and open with you, so that you understand and believe in the process by which we arrive at our decisions. For example, one of the things we will be showing you today is the sensitivity of our significant mineral resource base to both higher and lower gold prices. We carried out this analysis not only to improve our own understanding of our resources, and allow for better planning--just as importantly, we wanted to provide you, our partners and fellow owners, with a clearer picture of our mineral endowment and how it is affected by changing gold price assumptions. We want you to have a very clear understanding of the options we have from our current assets. A year ago, we told you we would bring Barrick \"back to the future\"--which meant we would recapture and make relevant the original, authentic DNA of this company as existed when Peter Munk and his partners created it. Specifically, the phrase referred to re-establishing four core strands: one, a partnership culture; two, a lean, nimble, decentralized business model; three, an intensive focus on creating long-term value as measured by cash flow per share; and four, financial rigor and prudence as evidenced by discerning portfolio management and a healthy balance sheet. The best and most important news of the year--we did exactly what we said we would do. We reduced our debt by $3 billion, nearly a quarter of our total debt. We reduced our all-in sustaining costs from $864 to $831 per ounce. We simplified our head office, eliminated management between it and the mines, and accelerated the pace at which information flows between them. We pared down our portfolio, implemented a new system for allocating capital with strict investment criteria, and sold, canceled, or deferred several projects that did not meet those requirements. I want to spend a few moments on our partnership culture and our renewal of talent. As you know, we have intentionally eschewed the traditional hierarchical organizational model, in favor of our authentic partnership model. We believe that complex matters are better understood and managed by a team of partners working together, especially in assessing and reducing risk. Kelvin, as president, is, by definition, the primus inter pares within the partnership. Five of our seven most senior partners have joined Barrick in the last fifteen months. We also identified truly outstanding talent within Barrick and made them partners--in particular, people with exceptional technical talent or a demonstrated ability to build relationships of trust with host governments and other partners. At the Board level, we will be announcing two new non-executive directors in the upcoming Proxy. These are in addition to the two directors we recently appointed, Rob Prichard and Kelvin. As of the Proxy, assuming all directors are elected, eight of my fellow thirteen directors will have joined the Board since I became Chairman, and three of those eight have spent their entire careers in mining--taken together they have 115 years of experience in the industry. Those facts give you an indication of the scale and the pace at which we are attracting talent and building a first-class team. All of our partners will, over time, become meaningful owners whose net worth is tied to the shares. It is our intention that, over time, every single person at Barrick will become a shareholder and owner. We have also put in place a structure for governance and management that makes best use of our talent and ensures that your focus is our focus. The Board, as owners and as the voice of all owners, sets the company's priorities in keeping with its purpose and values. It is then my job--as Chairman, as representative of the Board and the owners, and as a meaningful owner myself--to ensure that the partnership executes on those priorities to the highest possible standard. I do this through a weekly meeting I chair of our seven most senior partners. We go around the table, one by one, and I monitor progress, clarify any confusion, and emphasize priorities. The discussion begins with our obsession with talent, engaging Darian Rich, and proceeds to an insistence on best-in-class with Richard Williams; portfolio optimization with Kevin Thomson; financial prudence and capital allocation with Shaun Usmar; and strategy and intellectual underpinning with Catherine Raw and her searing voice of the owner. I'd like to say about Catherine, you can take the woman out of BlackRock, but you can't take BlackRock out of the woman--and that's very good news for all of us in this room. The discussion then proceeds to the strength of our partnerships, and ends with new or outstanding priorities with Kelvin and Kathy Sipos. These discussions are collective, open, spirited, and lengthy. On occasion, they are supplemented with other partners to address particular projects of concern or opportunity. For instance, special discussions on cost-containment at Pascua-Lama, or a review of the detailed facts underlying a decision on whether to sell part or all of a specific asset, or a review of the details of how we are handling the management of a particularly sensitive relationship with any number of partners. All of this continues in 2016. The approach I just outlined is how we will stay true to our original, authentic DNA--how we will ensure that the fundamental endures and never changes. It is also helpful and healthy to cast our collective eye on the longer term future. We start with one immutable truth--everything we do is focused on one goal: creating, in a responsible manner, value per share for our owners, as measured by cash flow per share. In a minute, you will hear in some depth what one might call the base case for how we will achieve this over-arching objective. In itself, that base case is solid, impressive, and reassuring. It rests on two fundamental principles. One is a profound understanding of and commitment to the idea that in the twenty-first century, our core business is building partnerships of depth and trust with host governments, local communities, NGOs, indigenous people, and others. At their invitation and with their support, we are permitted to take their minerals out of their ground, and in so doing create wealth for all. Two of our recent appointments to the Board, Brian Greenspun and Mike Evans, were made in meaningful part because of their extensive experience building exactly these kinds of relationships. Also, one of the two new non-execs has similar world-class experience. The other foundational principle of the base case is a relentless commitment to operational excellence, such that we will bring down our all-in sustaining costs to below $700 per ounce by the end of 2019. However, we must and we will go beyond that base case. We will do so primarily in two ways. One, we will, over time, prove to you that we are not only discerning sellers--as we began to demonstrate this past year with the sale of various interests in seven of our assets, accomplished, as we all know, in difficult markets. We will demonstrate that we are also discerning buyers, capable of consistently creating per share value for our owners. Two, we will also, over time, transform Barrick into a mining company for this century by reconceptualizing the essence of how one builds value in the industry. We have already intentionally chosen a model that is different from our peers. I am reminded of John Templeton's admonition, \"If you want superior performance, you must be different.\" We agree. It is who we are and who we were--until we lost our way in recent years. It is in Barrick's authentic DNA. We will embody that DNA in a way that is all the more relevant by making the best use of technology and data, embedding it into our every fiber. It will make us better, it will make us faster--and it will make us safer. We will do this carefully, deliberately, and with an uncompromising eye on return on invested capital. But we will do it. In the end, we want to be among the very best twenty-first century companies, not just in our industry, but in any industry. In the fullness of time, we believe Barrick will be both the lowest-risk investment of its kind and the one creating the most value. The gold mining sector has yet to drag itself out of the last century, and at Barrick we are restless. We will be a twenty-first century mining company--one creating value for all owners, with conviction and the courage to be different. As Kelvin indicated earlier, I will be happy to take your questions when we get to the end of this section, or at any time over the course of the day--feel free to pull me aside. And thank you very much for listening. Barrick Gold Corporation (TSE: ABX) - Barrick Reports Project Study Results - 22/2/2016 TORONTO, February 22, 2016 -- Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:ABX)(TSX:ABX) (Barrick or the \"company\") today reported the results of four studies on projects that have the potential to add or accelerate gold production at Cortez, Goldrush, Lagunas Norte and Turquoise Ridge. Based on our current asset mix and subject to potential divestments, we expect to maintain annual gold production of at least 4.5 million ounces of gold through 2020. These projects represent attractive opportunities to maintain and grow free cash flow beyond 2020. In 2015, all of our projects were put through a rigorous review process by the company's newly constituted Investment Committee. We looked at them through a new lens, challenging traditional assumptions and exploring different development scenarios in pursuit of value creation. Our approach today prioritizes free cash flow, risk-adjusted returns and capital efficiency across every area of the business, underpinned by a more rigorous risk management process. These are dynamic projects that continue to evolve. They are evaluated against our 15 percent hurdle rate as they advance through each stage of the development process. We assess returns using our long-term gold price, currently set at $1,200 per ounce. We are focused on continually strengthening the economics of our projects as we incorporate further design improvements identified through detailed engineering and by the potential addition of new reserves and resources. Capital estimates contained within prefeasibility studies may increase or decrease as a result of changes incorporated at the feasibility study stage. We will continue to update our shareholders on key milestones as these projects advance through stages of development. For certain related risk factors, please see the cautionary statement on forward-looking information at the end of this press release. Cortez Underground Expansion Project Overview: Expand underground mining into the Deep South zone below currently permitted levels  Work has now been completed on a prefeasibility study for expanded underground mining in the Deep South zone, below currently permitted areas of the Cortez Hills underground mine. The project has the potential to contribute average underground production of more than 300,000 ounces per year between 2022 and 2026 at average all-in sustaining costs of approximately $580 per ounce. Initial capital costs are estimated to be $153 million. This expansion will enable the company to access approximately 1.7 million ounces of proven and probable reserves in the Deep South zone, which were upgraded from measured and indicated resources as of December 31, 2015.2 The prefeasibility study timeline assumes permitting will take approximately three to four years and we expect to commence this process in the first half of 2016. On this basis, following the receipt of permits, dewatering and development work could begin as early as 2019 or 2020, with initial production from the Deep South zone commencing in 2022 or 2023. The expansion of the underground mine will help to offset the impact of the end of mining in the Cortez Hills open pit, which is expected to conclude in 2018. The prefeasibility study incorporates a number of enhancements that have improved the economics of the project compared to the initial scoping study. Switching the mining method from cut-and-fill to long-hole stoping has reduced anticipated mining costs, while processing costs are also expected to be lower as a result of a higher proportion of oxide ore. Spending of approximately $10 million in 2016 will focus on advancing the feasibility study to further understand geotechnical parameters and the nature of the mineralization. Mineralization in the Deep South zone is primarily oxide. The limits of the Cortez underground deposit have not yet been defined, and drilling has indicated the potential for new targets at depth. Goldrush Project Overview: Development of an underground mine at Goldrush  Barrick has completed a pre-feasibility study for an underground mine at the company's Goldrush deposit, located six kilometers from the Cortez Hills mine. The study contemplates an estimated initial capital investment of approximately $1 billion to access 8.6 million ounces of gold currently classified as measured and indicated resources.2 Based on current plans, average annual production for the first full five years of operation is expected to be 440,000 ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of $665 per ounce. Refractory ore would be transported to Goldstrike for processing. The prefeasibility study contemplates a mine life of 21 years, with first production as early as 2021, and sustained production in 2023. The economics of the project have been strengthened by eliminating a concurrent open pit option, the addition of new ounces to the geologic model and lower processing and transportation costs as compared to the initial scoping study. We expect to commence the permitting process for Goldrush in late 2017 and have assumed a permitting timeline of three to four years. Underground development and production activities would begin following permit approval. Work in 2016 and 2017 will focus on advancing the feasibility study and finalizing the project permitting strategy with a budget of $28 million. The Goldrush deposit remains open in a number of directions. Construction on a twin exploration decline to allow for further drilling of the ore body is planned for early 2017. This drilling will support the conversion of existing measured and indicated gold resources to proven and probable reserves, while also allowing us to conduct additional exploration drilling with the potential to add new resources. In addition, the company has identified a new target known as Fourmile, located one to three kilometers north of the Goldrush discovery. This area is geologically similar to the high grade Deep-Post and Deep-Star deposits in the Goldstrike area. Early drilling has intersected mineralization well above the average grade of the measured and indicated resources at Goldrush.3 Lagunas Norte Refractory Ore Mine Life Extension Project Overview: Installation of refractory ore processing circuit to extend life of mine by nine years  We have completed a prefeasibility study on a plan to extend the life of Lagunas Norte by approximately nine years by mining the refractory material below the oxide ore body in the current open pit. The refractory material cannot be economically processed using heap leaching due to low recoveries. The plan contemplates an initial capital investment of approximately $640 million for the installation of a 6,000 tonnes per day grinding-flotation-autoclave and carbon-in-leach processing circuit to treat the refractory material. As contemplated by the study, average annual production in the first five years is expected to be 240,000 ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of $625 per ounce. Based on the prefeasibility study results, approximately 2.1 million ounces of measured and indicated gold resources have been upgraded to proven and probable reserves as of December 31, 2015.2 An evaluation of project development options has identified a two-stage feasibility study process as the optimal path forward. The first stage will focus on the preparation of an amendment to the mine's environmental impact assessment to address the permitting requirements of the project. The second stage will focus on detailed engineering, which will allow us to defer spending that is not immediately required to advance the project. Permitting and completion of detailed engineering are expected to take up to four years (2016-2019). Construction and commissioning of the new circuit is expected to take approximately two years (2020-2021), with first gold production expected in late 2021. While the current mine plan ends in 2018, the site plans to continue secondary leaching of existing oxide material through 2021. The addition of a refractory processing facility could also unlock other potential refractory ore sources in the region surrounding Lagunas Norte. Turquoise Ridge Underground Expansion Project Overview: Expand underground mining through construction of an additional production shaft  At the end of 2015, the Turquoise Ridge mine contained 4.2 million ounces in reserves (75 percent basis) at an average grade of 15.3 grams per tonne -- the highest reserve grade in the company's operating portfolio and among the highest in the entire gold industry.2 The mine also has 11.4 million ounces of measured and indicated resources (75 percent basis).2 The Turquoise Ridge deposit remains open to the northeast, with significant potential to add additional reserves and resources through drilling. We have completed a feasibility study for the development of a third shaft, which has the potential to increase output to an average of 500,000 ounces per year (100 percent basis) at all-in sustaining costs of about $625-$675 per ounce. The project would require initial capital expenditures of approximately $300-$325 million (100 percent basis) for additional underground development and shaft construction. Concurrent with this feasibility study work, and as part of the Best-In-Class program, Turquoise Ridge has improved underground productivity and throughput by upgrading its underground ventilation system and increasing top cut mining widths. Greater equipment standardization and improvements in maintenance have enhanced reliability and therefore mining intensity. This has enabled the mine to achieve throughput of up to 1,825 tonnes per day for limited periods, the maximum allowable under the mine's current processing agreement with Newmont's Twin Creeks facility. Average throughput in 2015 was 1,500 tonnes per day. Given the positive impact of early Best-in-Class efforts, we have determined the optimal path forward is to defer the construction of an additional shaft in favor of a three-phase approach for the development of Turquoise Ridge. The first phase, underway now, contemplates additional improvements to sustain a throughput rate of 1,825 tonnes per day at the lowest possible cost. In support of this goal, we are currently evaluating continuous mining, increased automation, additional ventilation modifications, and other alternative mining methods. The second phase, which is a subset of the feasibility study, contemplates the installation of a new ventilation shaft. Adding a ventilation shaft would allow Turquoise Ridge to maintain throughput of 1,825 tonnes per day as mining moves deeper and further away from the existing shaft and ventilation infrastructure. Costs for the installation of a ventilation shaft are already included in the life of mine plan and construction could commence in 2017. The proposed shaft would be centrally located over reserves to be mined in future years, and would also open new areas to exploration drilling and mining. The third phase, representing full implementation of the feasibility study, contemplates the conversion of the ventilation shaft into a full production shaft. The full scope of work, including the ventilation shaft, conversion to a production shaft, and associated underground development and infrastructure, would require total capital expenditures of approximately $300-$325 million (100 percent basis). Costs for a ventilation shaft are roughly half of this total. Conversion to a full production shaft would allow the mine to increase production to 500,000 ounces of gold per year. All necessary permits are in place to complete this work. However, additional processing capacity would be required for production rates above 1,850 tonnes per day.

Zhao Abstract Full-face tunnel boring machine (TBM) tunnelling has unparalleled advantages over conventional drill-and-blast (D&B) techniques in terms of higher advance rates and lower risk levels in favourable ground conditions. However, there are only a few successful TBM applications in mines. The aim of this paper is to discuss the technical challenges of using TBMs in mining since the pioneering work in the 1960s. It starts with a description on the genesis of hard rock mines and coal mines and the differences of TBM tunnelling in mining and civil engineering projects. The historical applications of TBMs in mines are critically reviewed and the reasons for the unsuccessful applications are summarised and analysed from a geological point of view. Challenges, such as cutter wear, jamming and steering difficulties in difficult grounds with water inrush, fractured and faulted zones, high in-situ stresses, and gas, are explored in depth through case histories. Moreover, the corresponding mitigations measures to cope with complex grounds in mines are provided. A prospect of TBM applications in mining is presented at the end. The Industry Mining Facts Minerals and metals are the building blocks of the computers and smartphones we rely on, of the vehicles and public transit that get us places, of the buildings where we live and work, and of green technologies that help make the world a more sustainable place. Just as we as individuals depend on mining to support our daily lives, Canada relies on the industry to keep the economy humming. Mining is one of Canada's most important economic sectors and a major job creator. A major employer: Approximately 380,000 people across Canada work in the mining and mineral processing industries. Mining is the largest private sector employer of Aboriginal peoples in Canada on a proportional basis, and employment is poised to increase. Canada has one of the largest mining supply sectors globally with more than 3,400 companies supplying engineering, geotechnical, environmental, financial and other services to mining operations. Those who work in mining enjoy the highest wages and salaries of all industrial sectors in Canada with an average annual pay exceeding $110,000, which surpassed the average earnings of workers in forestry, manufacturing, finance and construction by a range of $31,000 to $46,000 for those sectors. An economic engine: Mining contributed $54 billion to Canada's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2013. The industry accounted for 19.6% of the value of Canadian goods exports in 2013. Canada's value of mineral production was nearly $43.6 billion in 2013. The mining industry's payments to Canadian federal and provincial governments total $71 billion in taxes and royalties over the last decade (2003-2012). A global leader: Thanks to its rich geology, Canada is one of the largest mining nations in the world producing more than 60 minerals and metals. Canada ranks in the top five countries in the global production of 11 major minerals and metals: First in potash Second in uranium and cobalt Third in aluminum and tungsten Fourth in platinum group metals, sulphur and titanium Fifth in nickel and diamonds 57% of the world's public mining companies are listed on the TSX and TSX-Venture Exchanges. Together, the two exchanges handled 48% of global mining equity transactions in 2013, and accounted for 46% of global mining equity capital for that year. Globally, Canada is recognized for its leadership in safety and sustainability. Mining companies in Canada were the first in the world to develop an externally-verified performance system for sustainable mining practices with the creation of MAC's Towards Sustainable Mining initiative in 2004. Leading Companies Agnico Eagle Mines Limited Agnico Eagle's mission is to run a high quality, easy to understand business, that generates superior long-term per share returns for our shareholders, creates a great place to work for our employees, and that is a leading contributor to the well-being of the communities in which we operate. Agnico Eagle Reports Record Third Quarter 2015 Gold Production; Strong Operating Performance Leads to Increased Production Guidance and Reduced Costs for 2015 October 28, 2015 Stock Symbol: AEM (NYSE and TSX) (All amounts expressed in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted) TORONTO, Oct. 28, 2015 /PRNewswire/ - Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (NYSE:AEM, TSX:AEM) (\"Agnico Eagle\" or the \"Company\") today reported quarterly net income of $1.3 million, or net income of $0.01 per share for the third quarter of 2015. This result includes losses on financial instruments of $16.6 million ($0.08 per share), a non-cash foreign currency translation loss on deferred tax liabilities of $8.1 million ($0.04 per share), various mark-to-market and other adjustment losses of $9.5 million ($0.04 per share), non-cash stock option expense of $4.1 million ($0.02 per share), non-cash foreign currency translation losses of $0.9 million (nil per share), and non-recurring gains of $1.3 million ($0.01 per share). Excluding these items would result in adjusted net income of $39.2 million or adjusted net income of $0.18 per share for the third quarter of 2015. In the third quarter of 2014, the Company reported a net loss of $15.1 million or a net loss of $0.07 per share. Based on the exploration success in the first half of the year at several of the Company's projects, it was previously announced that exploration expense would increase in the second half of the year. Total exploration expense for the third quarter was $37.1 million. As a result of this increased exploration expense the Amaruq project in Nunavut yielded a significant increase in inferred resources (see August 19, 2015 news release) and an initial resource is expected to be reported by mid-February 2016 at the El Barqueno project in Mexico. For the first nine months of 2015, the Company reported net income of $40.1 million, or $0.19 per share. This compares with the first nine months of 2014 when net income was $104.3 million, or $0.55 per share. Financial results in the 2015 period were negatively impacted by much higher investment in exploration (approximately 102% higher); lower gold prices (approximately 9% lower) and lower by-product metals revenues. Third quarter 2015 cash provided by operating activities was $143.7 million ($217.8 million before changes in non-cash components of working capital). This compares to cash provided by operating activities of $71.2 million in the third quarter of 2014 ($129.2 million before changes in non-cash components of working capital). The increase in cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital during the current period was mainly due to an increase of 26% in gold production. For the first nine months of 2015, cash provided by operating activities was $475.5 million ($547.4 million before changes in non-cash components of working capital), as compared with the first nine months of 2014 when cash provided by operating activities was $504.4 million ($472.8 million before changes in non-cash components of working capital). The increase in cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital during the period was mainly due to a 20% increase in gold production. \"In the third quarter of 2015, we set a new record for quarterly gold production and lowered unit costs which resulted in strong operating cash flow. This has allowed us to continue to invest in our exploration and development pipeline, which represents the long-term future of our business,\" said Sean Boyd, Agnico Eagle's Chief Executive Officer. \"Our increased level of exploration activity continues to pay dividends as witnessed by the new discoveries at Kittila, Amaruq and El Barqueno. These projects are expected to be significant contributors to our production profile in the coming years,\" added Mr. Boyd. Third Quarter 2015 Highlights Include: Strong performance of Abitibi operations drives record quarterly gold production and low costs - Payable gold production1 in the third quarter of 2015 was 441,124 ounces of gold at total cash costs2 per ounce on a by-product basis of $536 and all-in sustaining costs3 on a by-product basis (\"AISC\") of $759 per ounce Two new production records set at Canadian Malartic - New quarterly records were set for average tonnes processed per calendar day (53,703 tonnes on a 100% basis), and ounces of gold produced in a quarter (153,206 ounces on a 100% basis) 2015 production guidance increased and cost forecasts reduced - Expected gold production for 2015 is now forecast to be approximately 1.65 million ounces (previously 1.6 million ounces) with total cash costs on a by-product basis of approximately $590 to $610 per ounce (previously $600 to $620) and AISC of approximately $840 to $860 per ounce (previously $870 to $890) expected Amaruq drilling expands scope of known mineralization - Drilling indicates that the Whale Tail and Mammoth zones form a single mineralized system at least 2.3 kilometres long. In addition, the V zone (part of the IVR area) has been identified as a substantial mineralized structure, locally with abundant visible gold Drilling extends new parallel zone at Kittila - Two recent drill holes have confirmed continuity within the new parallel lens (now called the \"Sisar lens\"). Highlights include: 8.1 grams per tonne (\"g/t\") gold (uncapped) over 8.0 metres at 1,235 metres depth; and 5.5 g/t gold (uncapped) over 3.3 metres at 950 metres depth and 560 metres farther north along strike Improved financial flexibility - In the third quarter, the Company's credit facility was amended and $25 million was repaid. In addition, a 10-year, $50-million term note was issued to Ressources Quebec, a subsidiary of Investissement Quebec. Capital expenditures in 2015 are also forecast to be approximately $50 million lower than previously reported due to positive foreign currency adjustments and deferrals into future periods A quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share was declared Third Quarter Financial and Production Highlights In the third quarter of 2015, strong operational performance continued at the Company's mines. Payable gold production in the third quarter of 2015 was a record 441,124 ounces compared to 349,273 ounces in the third quarter of 2014. The higher level of production in the 2015 period was primarily due to increased throughput levels at LaRonde, Goldex and Canadian Malartic, increased mill capacity at Kittila and higher grades at LaRonde, Meadowbank, Goldex, Kittila, Pinos Altos and La India. A detailed description of the production and cost performance at each mine is set out below. Total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis for the third quarter of 2015 were lower at $536 compared to $716 per ounce for the third quarter of 2014. The reduction in total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis in the third quarter of 2015 was a result of higher silver production, higher gold production at the majority of the Company's mines and weaker local currencies compared to the third quarter of 2014. In the third quarter of 2015 the average value of the Canadian dollar, Euro and Mexican Peso were 8%, 4%, and 23% lower, respectively than the Company's 2015 currency price assumptions (see February 11, 2015 news release). Payable gold production for the first nine months of 2015 was 1,249,012 ounces, compared to payable gold production of 1,041,753 ounces in the comparable 2014 period (which only included 76,639 ounces from Canadian Malartic for production from June 16 to September 30, 2014). For the first nine months of 2015, total cash costs on a by-product basis were $574 per ounce. This compares with $627 per ounce on a by-product basis in the first nine months of 2014. The lower costs in the 2015 period are due to the higher levels of production and favourable currency movements compared to the 2014 period. AISC for the third quarter of 2015 was lower at $759 versus $1,059 per ounce for the third quarter of 2014. The lower AISC is primarily due to higher production, lower total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis, lower general and administrative expenditures and lower capital expenditures. For the first nine months of 2015, AISC was $808 versus $947 per ounce for the 2014 period. The lower AISC in the 2015 period is due to the same reasons set out above. Cash Position Remains Strong; Continued focus on Debt Reduction; Credit lines extended for an additional year through 2020 Cash and cash equivalents and short term investments increased to $208.1 million at September 30, 2015, from the June 30, 2015 balance of $164.0 million. The outstanding balance on the Company's $1.2 billion credit facility was reduced from $375 million at June 30, 2015 to $350 million at September 30, 2015. This results in available credit lines of approximately $850 million, not including the $300 million accordion facility. On September 30, 2015, the Company amended its $1.2 billion Credit Facility to extend the maturity date from June 22, 2019 to June 22, 2020 and improve the pricing terms. On September 30 2015, a private placement of a $50 million, 10-year senior unsecured note (the \"Note\") with a maturity of September 30, 2025 was completed with Ressources Quebec, a subsidiary of Investissement Quebec. The Company has agreed to use the net proceeds from the issuance of the Note at its mining projects in the Province of Quebec. Total capital expenditures made by the Company in the third quarter of 2015 were $122.4 million, including $24.8 million at Meliadine, $19.7 million at Meadowbank, $15.1 million at LaRonde, $14.1 million at Kittila, $13.3 million at Goldex, $12.5 million at Pinos Altos, $9.3 million at Canadian Malartic (50% basis), $7.0 million at La India, $1.2 million at Creston Mascota and $1.1 million at Lapa. Total capital expenditures for the first nine months of 2015 were $316.8 million including $50.6 million at LaRonde, $47.4 million at Meadowbank, $44.6 million at Meliadine, $41.8 million at Pinos Altos, $38.4 million at Kittila, $35.3 million at Goldex, $29.8 million at Canadian Malartic (50% basis), $15.5 million at La India, $5.5 million at Lapa and $1.6 million at Creston Mascota. Total sustaining capital expenditures made by the Company in the third quarter were $72.0 million, including $19.5 million at Meadowbank, $15.1 million at LaRonde, $10.6 million at Kittila, $8.2 million at Canadian Malartic (50% basis), $7.0 million at La India, $6.7 million at Pinos Altos, $2.6 million at Goldex, $1.2 million at Creston Mascota and $1.1 million at Lapa. Total sustaining capital expenditures for the first nine months of 2015 were $214.7 million including $50.6 million at LaRonde, $47.2 million at Meadowbank, $30.7 million at Kittila, $28.0 million at Canadian Malartic (50% basis), $24.0 million at Pinos Altos, $15.5 million at La India, $11.6 million at Goldex, $5.5 million at Lapa, and $1.6 million at Creston Mascota. For 2015, capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $489.0 million, representing approximately a $50 million decrease from the previously announced figure. The decrease is primarily due to favourable currency movements and capital expenditure deferrals into future periods. The Company recorded an income and mining taxes recovery of $15.3 million on the consolidated statements of income for the third quarter of 2015. This was primarily a result of applying effective tax rates on a regional tax basis which were well in excess of the statutory tax rate based on IFRS tax calculation methodology. The Company continues to guide an effective tax rate range between 40% and 45% for 2015. Revised 2015 Guidance - Production Increased and Costs Lowered As a result of strong operational performance in the third quarter of 2015, production guidance for 2015 has been increased to approximately 1.65 million ounces of gold (previously 1.6 million ounces) with total cash costs on a by-product basis of approximately $590 to $610 per ounce (previously $600 to $620) and AISC of approximately $840 to $860 per ounce (previously $870 to $890). NORTHERN BUSINESS OPERATING REVIEW ABITIBI REGION, QUEBEC Agnico Eagle is currently Quebec's largest gold producer with a 100% interest in three mines (LaRonde, Goldex and Lapa) and a 50% interest in the Canadian Malartic mine. These mines are located within 50 kilometres of each other, which provides operating synergies and allows for the sharing of technical expertise. LaRonde Mine - Increased Production Driven by Higher Grades in Lower Mining Area, Phase 1 Commissioning of Coarse Ore Conveyor Underway The 100% owned LaRonde mine in northwestern Quebec achieved commercial production in 1988. The LaRonde mill processed an average of 5,992 tonnes per day (\"tpd\") in the third quarter of 2015, compared with an average of 4,634 tpd in the corresponding period of 2014. Throughput in the 2014 period was lower due to an approximate four week shutdown related to the upgrade and commissioning of the production and service hoist drives at the Penna shaft. Minesite costs per tonne4 were approximately C$101 in the third quarter of 2015, lower than the C$111 per tonne experienced in the third quarter of 2014. The higher costs in the 2014 period were primarily due to the scheduled shutdown noted above. For the first nine months of 2015, the LaRonde mill processed an average of 6,145 tpd, compared to 5,668 tpd in the first nine months of 2014. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$101, compared to C$100 per tonne in the first nine months of 2014. LaRonde's total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis were $558 in the third quarter of 2015 on payable production of 71,860 ounces of gold. This compares with the third quarter of 2014 when total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis were $861 on production of 37,490 ounces of gold. Production in the 2015 period increased as a result of higher throughput and higher gold grades (primarily from the 293 mining pyramid) compared to the 2014 period. Costs in the 2015 period were lower due to higher gold production (partially offset by lower by-product revenues) and favourable foreign exchange rates. In the first nine months of 2015, LaRonde produced 194,760 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $620 on a by-product basis. This is in contrast with the first nine months of 2014 when the mine produced 145,336 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $701 on a by-product basis. Production in the 2015 period was higher and costs were lower due to the factors mentioned above. During the quarter, work was completed on the installation of the coarse ore conveyor system that extends from the 293 level to the crusher on the 280 level. The first phase of commissioning involving the discharge point and rock breaker is underway. The ore pass feeding the rock breaker is expected to be commissioned in the first quarter of 2016. The new conveyor should help to improve mining flexibility and reduce congestion in the deeper portions of the mine. Studies are continuing to assess the potential to extend the mineral reserves and carry out mining activities between the 311 and 371 levels at LaRonde. At present, the mineral reserves extend to the 311 level, which is 3.1 kilometres below the surface. Drilling is ongoing to further expand the known mineral resource between the 311 and 341 levels. Additional holes are also being drilled to evaluate the extent of the mineralization down to the 371 level (a depth of 3.7 kilometres below the surface). Canadian Malartic Mine - New Quarterly Production Records Established In June 2014, Agnico Eagle and Yamana Gold Inc. (\"Yamana\") acquired all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Osisko Mining Corporation (\"Osisko\") and created the Canadian Malartic General Partnership (the \"Partnership\"). The partnership owns and operates the Canadian Malartic mine in northwestern Quebec through a joint management committee. Each of Agnico Eagle and Yamana has an indirect 50% ownership interest in the Partnership. Canadian Malartic had very strong operational performance in the third quarter of 2015. New records were set for quarterly tonnes milled (4.94 million tonnes), tonnes processed per day (53,703 tonnes), and ounces produced (153,206 ounces on a 100% basis). On September 22, 2015, the mine poured its two millionth ounce of gold. During the third quarter of 2015, the Canadian Malartic mill processed an average of 53,703 tpd (on a 100% basis) compared with an average of 52,539 tpd in the corresponding period of 2014. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$22 (C$19.32 excluding royalties) compared to the C$22 (C$19.60 excluding royalties) per tonne experienced in the third quarter of 2014. The costs in the 2015 period were in line with the costs in the 2014 period. Throughput was higher in the 2015 period due to improved crusher operating time. The average stripping ratio in the third quarter of 2015 was 2.04 to 1.0. For the first nine months of 2015, the Canadian Malartic mill processed an average of 52,139 tpd compared with an average of 50,580 tpd in the corresponding period of 2014 (on a 100% basis). Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$23 (C$19.72 excluding royalties) compared to the C$22 (C$19.42 excluding royalties) per tonne experienced in the corresponding period of 2014. The 2014 tonnage and costs are not considered to be representative as they only reflect the period of June 16 through September 30. For the third quarter of 2015, Agnico Eagle's share of production at the Canadian Malartic mine was 76,603 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $544 on a by-product basis. This compares with the third quarter of 2014 when total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis were $735 on production of 64,761 ounces of gold. Production was higher in the 2015 period due to increased mill throughput and higher grades. Costs in the 2015 period were lower due to increased production and favourable foreign exchange rates. In the first nine months of 2015, Agnico Eagle's share of production at the Canadian Malartic mine was 212,937 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $593 on a by-product basis. This is in contrast with production from June 16 to September 30, 2014 which only included 76,639 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $717 on a by-product basis from Canadian Malartic. The Partnership continues to work on initiatives to optimize the operations. Current opportunities include: Improving SAG mill and crusher liners to attempt to reduce the number of planned shutdowns to three per year (currently four per year). New liners were installed in Q3 2015 Improving gyratory crusher availability by redirecting ore containing scrap steel to a separate crusher Maintaining mining throughput levels at two million tonnes per month in the North zone (which contains higher grades) Acquiring an additional remote excavator for use in the North zone Adding two larger production drills which is expected reduce drilling costs Increasing rate of waste rock backfilling of the Gouldie pit which reduces haulage distances and noise Permitting activities for the Barnat Extension and deviation of Highway 117 are continuing. An Environmental Impact Assessment (\"EIA\") for this project was submitted in February 2015. An initial series of questions were received by the Partnership, and final responses were submitted in September 2015. A second round of questions from the government is expected to be received later in the fourth quarter of 2015. Public hearings are then expected to be held in the spring of 2016, with receipt of the necessary permits potentially by year-end 2016. In parallel, the Partnership is currently working on the permitting for improving the efficiency and environmental performance of the existing mobile crusher. At this point, milling levels are expected to be approximately 53,000 tpd through year-end 2016. In March 2015, the Partnership increased its interest in the Malartic CHL property to 100% by acquiring the remaining 30% interest from Abitibi Royalties Inc. The Malartic CHL property adjoins the Canadian Malartic mine to the east and hosts part of the Odyssey North discovery. At the end of the third quarter of 2015, 28 holes (24,537 metres) of drilling had been completed on the Odyssey zones. Drilling and data compilation will continue in the fourth quarter. Update on Pandora and Kirkland Lake Projects Canadian Malartic Corporation, a company in which each of Agnico Eagle and Yamana has an indirect 50% interest, is exploring a portfolio of properties in the Kirkland Lake area of Ontario and the Pandora property in the Abitibi region of Quebec. In the Kirkland Lake area, an internal technical study on the Upper Beaver property is being reviewed. Elsewhere in the region, compilation work is ongoing and a select number of targets are being drilled. At Pandora, underground development on the 101-W exploration drift from the adjacent Lapa mine commenced in February 2015 and approximately 691 metres of development was completed by the end of the third quarter of 2015. For the full year, approximately 940 metres of development is planned. In mid-June 2015, underground drilling resumed from the 101-W exploration drift and approximately half of the proposed 2015 program (approximately 7,000 metres) was completed by the end of the third quarter. The focus of the current exploration program is to test for extensions to the Branch zone and C zone on the Pandora property. Lapa - Zulapa Z7 Zone Continues to Deliver Higher Grades and Recoveries The 100% owned Lapa mine in northwestern Quebec achieved commercial production in May 2009. The Lapa circuit, located at the LaRonde mill, processed an average of 1,583 tpd in the third quarter of 2015. This compares with an average of 1,703 tpd in the third quarter of 2014. Throughput in the 2015 period was lower because of downtime related to repairs carried out on the Lapa ball mill. Repairs were completed in August 2015. During the repair time, excess ore was stockpiled and there is sufficient mill capacity that should allow the Company to meet its annual throughput rate (tonnes and ounces) over the balance of 2015. Minesite costs per tonne were C$114 in the third quarter of 2015, compared to the C$104 in the third quarter of 2014. Costs in the 2015 period were higher due to mining at deeper depths and lower throughput compared to the same period in 2014. For the first nine months of 2015, the Lapa mill processed an average of 1,553 tpd, compared to 1,747 tpd in the first nine months of 2014. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$119, above the C$106 per tonne in the first nine months of 2014 due to the reasons explained above. Payable production in the third quarter of 2015 was 25,668 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $522. This compares with the third quarter of 2014, when production was 24,781 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $606. In the 2015 period, production was higher primarily due to better recoveries (up 8.7%) related to a higher component of free gold in the Zulapa Z7 ore zone. Costs were lower primarily due to increased production and favourable foreign exchange rates. In the first nine months of 2015, Lapa produced 71,038 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $581 on a by-product basis. This compares to the first nine months of 2014 when the mine produced 67,011 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $689 on a by-product basis. The higher production and lower costs in the 2015 period are due to the reasons outlined above. At Lapa, 2015 is the last full year of production based on the current life of mine plan. Commercial production is forecast to end at the mine in the third quarter of 2016, but exploration activities (primarily on the Pandora property) are expected to continue. The permanent employees are expected to be relocated to the Company's other operations where they will replace contract positions. Studies are underway to evaluate other internal opportunities to utilize the Lapa mill, which is located at the LaRonde Metallurgical complex. Goldex - Development Rates Expected to Double by Year End; M Zone Yields Better Than Expected Grades The 100% owned Goldex mine in northwestern Quebec began operation in 2008 but mining operations in the original orebody, the Goldex Extension Zone (\"GEZ\"), were suspended in October 2011. In July 2012, the M and E satellite zones were approved for development. Mining operations resumed on the M and E satellite zones in September 2013. Mining operations at GEZ remain suspended. The Goldex mill processed an average of 6,199 tpd in the third quarter of 2015. This compares with an average of 5,851 tpd in the third quarter of 2014. The higher throughput in the 2015 period was due to more mature mining fronts and productivity improvements compared to the 2014 period. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$34 in the third quarter of 2015, which was slightly higher than the C$32 per tonne experienced in the third quarter of 2014. The increased cost in the 2015 period is primarily due to increased development in the M3 and M4 zones and extensions to the E Zone. For the first nine months of 2015, the Goldex mill processed an average of 6,377 tpd, compared to 5,647 tpd in the first nine months of 2014. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$34 in the first nine months of 2015 which is in line with C$33 in first nine months of 2014. Payable gold production in the third quarter of 2015 was 32,068 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $479. This compares with the third quarter of 2014, when production was 27,611 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $582. The higher production in the 2015 period was largely due to increased tonnage and better grades (especially in the M Zone) and higher recoveries. The decrease in total cash costs in the 2015 period was largely a result of increased production and favourable foreign exchange rates compared to the 2014 period. In the first nine months of 2015, Goldex produced 87,780 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $546 on a by-product basis. This compares to the first nine months of 2014 when the mine produced 70,970 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $661 on a by-product basis. The higher production and lower costs in the 2015 period are due to the same reasons as outlined above. In late July 2015, the Company announced production approval for the Goldex Deep 1 project (see July 29, 2015 news release). Mining will focus on the lower part of the Dx zone and the top of the D zone from a depth of 850 metres to 1,200 metres (level 120). The Company plans to undertake development from the current Goldex infrastructure, with existing equipment and personnel. The planned mining method is long-hole stoping with cemented paste backfill, which is the same method currently used at Goldex M & E zones. Gold production from the Goldex Deep 1 project is currently expected to average in excess of 100,000 ounces per year from 2018 through 2024. In the third quarter of 2015, approximately 1,462 metres of development were carried out in the Deep zone. The ramp has now reached Level 115 on its way to an ultimate depth of level 120. In addition, full restoration of the surface ramp is expected to be completed by the end of this year. This ramp will improve on the ability to move equipment and supplies from the surface into the underground workings. The advancement of the Deep 1 project at Goldex also has the potential to unlock other significant value creating opportunities including: Potential for additional mineral resource conversion in the Deep 1 zone Potential for mining at the Deep 2 (below level 120) Potential to develop the South zone (a narrow high-grade zone accessible via Deep 1 infrastructure) Potential development of the Akasaba West deposit, which is approximately 30 kilometres to the East of Goldex An EIA on the Akasaba West deposit was submitted during the quarter, which allows the environmental review process to commence. The Company anticipates the EIA approval in late 2017 or early 2018. FINLAND AND SWEDEN Agnico Eagle's Kittila mine in Finland is the largest primary gold producer in Europe and hosts the Company's largest mineral reserves. Exploration activities continue to expand the mineral resources and studies are underway to evaluate the potential to cost-effectively increase production. Kittila - Focus Remains On Optimizing Future Production Levels and Exploration Potential of the New Parallel Zone The 100% owned Kittila mine in northern Finland achieved commercial production in 2009. The Kittila mill processed an average of 3,937 tpd in the third quarter of 2015 compared to the 2,559 tpd in the third quarter of 2014. Throughput in the 2014 period was lower due to a planned shutdown to complete the mill expansion. Minesite costs per tonne at Kittila were approximately EUR72 in the third quarter of 2015, compared to EUR86 in the third quarter of 2014. Costs decreased in the third quarter of 2015 due to the increased throughput when compared with the 2014 period. For the first nine months of 2015, the Kittila mill processed an average of 3,981 tpd, compared to 2,895 tpd in the first nine months of 2014. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately EUR75 in the first nine months of 2015, compared to the EUR79 per tonne in the comparable 2014 period. Throughput was higher and costs were lower in the 2015 period due to the reasons outlined above. Since the expansion, the mill has shown potential to operate in excess of 4,000 tpd and efforts are ongoing to optimize throughput and recovery rates. In addition, the Company is also working to optimize underground mining rates and evaluate the potential to develop new mining areas. Unit costs are expected to decrease once steady state operations are achieved. Third quarter 2015 payable gold production at Kittila was 46,455 ounces with total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $639. In the third quarter of 2014, the mine produced 28,230 ounces at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $951. The higher production in the 2015 period is a result of the increased mill capacity compared to the 2014 period and the planned 2014 shutdown. Costs decreased in the third quarter of 2015 primarily due to increased production and a favourable foreign exchange rate. In the first nine months of 2015, Kittila produced 133,095 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $696 on a by-product basis. This is in contrast to the first nine months of 2014, when the mine produced 98,612 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $861 on a by-product basis. The lower cash costs in 2015 are mainly due to reasons described above. Drilling Extends New Parallel Zone at Kittila Previous drilling from the surface at Kittila has outlined a significant zone of deep mineralization at Rimpi with potentially wider widths and better grades than those currently being mined. The main underground ramp at Kittila is being extended to reach the Rimpi zone and a new surface ramp is also being developed to access the shallower portions of the Rimpi deposit. The surface ramp had advanced a total of 825 metres to 134 metres depth by the end of September. In April and July, the Company announced that drilling had encountered a mineralized lens east of the main Kittila ore zone, within the sheared and altered structure that hosts the known Kittila deposits (see April 30, 2015 and July 29, 2015 news releases). The intercepts lay within an area approximately 800 metres long north to south between 975 and 1,300 metres below surface, approximately 100 to 150 metres east of the main ore zone. These intercepts indicate a new parallel lens (now called the \"Sisar lens\" which in English means \"sister lens\"), that could extend upwards to a similar elevation as the main exploration ramp (currently at 800 metres depth) being driven towards Rimpi. This new lens could provide additional tonnage should further drilling outline an economic deposit. Two recent holes drilled from the exploration ramp have confirmed continuity within the Sisar lens. The table below shows the intercepts of the two new holes as well as those reported previously from the Sisar lens. Pierce points for all these holes are shown on the Kittila composite longitudinal section and two cross sections (500 metres apart). All intercepts reported for the Kittila mine show uncapped grades over estimated true widths, based on a current geological interpretation that is being updated as new information becomes available with further drilling.  midpoint below surface (metres) Estimated true width (metres) Gold grade (g/t) (uncapped)  Kittila composite longitudinal section Kittila composite cross sections - 7538000mN and 7538500mN Hole ROD15-703 intersected two lenses in the main zone and one in the Sisar lens. In the main ore zone, this hole intersected 14.3 g/t gold over 6.1 metres at 1,028 metres depth, and 5.8 g/t gold over 3.5 metres at 1,077 metres depth. The upper intercept verifies, widens and increases the grade of the probable reserves between the Suuri and Roura trends, while the lower one extends the mineralization to the north, and will help to convert future resources. The hole then intersected 8.1 g/t gold over 8.0 metres at 1,235 metres depth in the Sisar lens, approximately 150 metres east of the main ore zone, strongly confirming the continuity of the lens. This intercept is between two previously reported intercepts at approximately the same depth: it is approximately 116 metres north of hole ROU10-037 and 250 metres south of hole ROD14-003. At shallower depths and approximately 560 metres farther north, hole ROU15-600 intersected 5.5 g/t gold over 3.3 metres at 950 metres below surface, approximately 100 metres east of the main zone mineralization. This intercept is approximately 130 metres south of the previously reported intercept of hole ROU15-603. Additional holes have been drilled in the vicinity of the new Sisar lens intercepts, and assays are pending. A second underground deep drill rig is expected to start operating in the fourth quarter 2015 and carry on into 2016 to determine continuity and test for extensions of the Sisar lens. At the Kuotko deposit, located approximately 15 kilometres north of Kittila, drilling continues with a focus on infilling and expanding the existing inferred resource of approximately 170,000 ounces (1.8 million tonnes at 2.9 g/t gold). In addition, new mineralized zones have been identified outside of the known resource areas. Metallurgical testing is ongoing and unlike Kittila, the gold mineralization is free milling. Upon completion of the drilling, studies will be carried out to assess the viability of mining the deposit as a satellite open pit. Barsele Project - Drilling Now Underway on the Central Zone On June 11, 2015, Agnico Eagle acquired a 55% interest in the Barsele project in Sweden. The Company can earn an additional 15% interest in the project through the completion of a pre-feasibility study. The Barsele property is known to contain intrusive-hosted gold mineralization and gold-rich volcanogenic massive sulphide mineralization. In 2015, the Company plans to spend approximately $3.25 million on exploration to further evaluate the mineral potential of the property. In September 2015, trenching and mapping programs were carried out that confirmed that the known intrusive-hosted deposits plunge to the southeast. A 16-hole (9,300-metre) drill program commenced in early October to test the depth extension of the Central Zone to 400 to 500 metres below surface. NUNAVUT REGION With the Company's largest producing mine (Meadowbank) and two significant development assets and exploration projects (Meliadine and Amaruq) located in Nunavut, Agnico Eagle has the potential to build an operating platform that could have the ability to generate strong production and cash flows over several decades. Meadowbank - Increased Waste Stripping Capacity Provides Production Flexibility The 100% owned Meadowbank mine in Nunavut, northern Canada, achieved commercial production in March 2010. The Meadowbank mill processed an average of 10,824 tpd in the third quarter of 2015, compared to the 11,492 tpd achieved in the third quarter of 2014. Mill throughput levels were lower in the 2015 period due to a higher percentage of Vault ore processed which has a higher hardness factor, which has an impact on both the primary and secondary grinding circuit efficiency. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$72 in the third quarter of 2015, which compares to C$74 per tonne in the third quarter of 2014. The lower costs in the 2015 period were primarily due to an increase in capitalized versus expensed waste stripping compared to the respective 2014 period. For the first nine months of 2015, the Meadowbank mill processed an average of 11,009 tpd, compared to 11,365 tpd in the first nine months of 2014. Mill throughput levels were lower in the 2015 period primarily due to the reasons outlined above. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$72 in the first nine months of 2015, which was similar to the C$73 per tonne in the comparable 2014 period. Payable production in the third quarter of 2015 was 99,425 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $598. This compares with the third quarter of 2014 when 91,557 ounces were produced at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $777. The higher production in the 2015 period compared to the 2014 period was primarily due to the processing of higher grade ore (an increase of approximately 15%) and slightly better recoveries. Costs in the 2015 period were lower due to increased production and favourable foreign exchange rates. In the first nine months of 2015, Meadowbank produced 279,224 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $646 on a by-product basis. In the first nine months of 2014, the mine produced 366,162 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $561 on a by-product basis. The lower production (down 24%) in the 2015 period compared to the previous period was primarily due to processing fewer tonnes at lower grades and lower mill recoveries (down 2.3%). During the first six months of the 2014 period, the Company encountered ore grades that were higher than expected in both the Portage and Goose pits. In 2013, approximately 246,000 ounces were removed from mineral reserves at the Vault deposit due to a change in the gold price assumption used to calculate mineral reserves at December 31, 2013. Given the current US dollar to Canadian dollar foreign exchange rate (which yields favourable revenues and costs in Canadian dollar terms), lower fuel costs, and the growing significance of the Amaruq Project, the Company made a decision in July 2015 to proceed with the expansion of the Vault pit. With the expansion, the Meadowbank mine is now expected to be in production until the third quarter of 2018 (approximately one year longer than originally forecast). The extension of the Meadowbank mine life is expected to help bridge the production gap between the end of production at Meadowbank and the potential start of production at a satellite operation at Amaruq (not yet approved for construction). Amaruq Project - Drilling Expands Scope of Whale Tail Deposit; Positive Results from the V Zone Area; Phase Two Exploration Program Now Completed Agnico Eagle has a 100% interest in the Amaruq project. The large property consists of 114,761 hectares, approximately 50 kilometres northwest of the Meadowbank mine. In August 2015, the Company announced an updated inferred mineral resource estimate as of June 30, 2015 of 2.0 million ounces gold (9.7 million tonnes grading 6.47 g/t gold). The phase two drilling program for 2015 was completed in mid-October. Total drilling at Amaruq for the year was 108,000 metres (378 holes) completed. This release incorporates some of the drill results received since the last results were released on August 19, 2015. The latest drill results are from the main Whale Tail deposit including the east-plunging high-grade shoot and the former gap area between Whale Tail West and Mammoth Lake. As well, there are recent exploration drill results from the V zone. The 2016 drill program is expected to start in February. Phase Two Drill Results Continue to Expand Mineralized Zones The phase two 2015 drilling program at the Amaruq project began in July with several purposes, including step-out drilling to link Whale Tail and Mammoth Lake mineralization; testing the down-plunge extent of the ore shoot in the east of Whale Tail; and extending the I, V and R zones. Recent intercepts from the project are set out in the table below and the drill hole collars are located on the Amaruq project local geology map. The Whale Tail deposit pierce points are shown on the Whale Tail composite longitudinal section, while the coordinates from the V zone drill-hole collars are given in a second table. All intercepts reported for the Amaruq project show capped grades over estimated true widths, based on a preliminary geological interpretation that is being updated as new information becomes available with further drilling. Amaruq local geology map Whale Tail Deposit Composite Longitudinal Section Recent drilling has confirmed that the Whale Tail and Mammoth zones form a single mineralized system at least 2.3 kilometres long, between surface and locally to a depth of 450 metres. A new intercept lies in between several previously reported intercepts filling the former gap between Whale Tail and the Mammoth Lake mineralization. Hole AMQ15-450 yielded 4.5 g/t gold over 16.9 metres at 166 metres depth including 7.6 g/t gold over 6.7 metres. This area will continue to be investigated in 2016. The mineralized system remains open at depth and along strike. Drilling from the opposite direction (north to south) has enhanced the understanding of the geometry of the deposit. Within the Whale Tail deposit is a thickened higher-grade ore shoot that is at least one kilometre long. This cigar-shaped shoot extends from surface (Whale Tail West) plunging shallowly eastward to a depth of 380 metres (Whale Tail East). The ore shoot remains open. Six recent intercepts within this shoot, from west to east, are hole AMQ15-369 that intersected 8.4 g/t gold over 18.4 metres at 176 metres depth, hole AMQ15-463 that yielded 6.8 g/t gold over 29.7 metres at 293 metres depth, hole AMQ15-422 that intersected 5.7 g/t gold over 29.9 metres at 270 metres depth, hole AMQ15-442 that intersected 8.1 g/t gold over 12.9 metres at 296 metres depth, hole AMQ15-470 that intersected 6.9 g/t gold over 16.1 metres at 357 metres depth and hole AMQ15-444, which yielded two intercepts 6.3 g/t gold over 14.8 metres at 359 metres depth, and 5.8 g/t gold over 10.3 metres at 378 metres depth. (Note that holes AMQ15-369 and AMQ15-444 were drilled from the south.) The results described for the Whale Tail deposit are expected to have a positive impact on the size of the upcoming resources estimate for the Amaruq project. Recent drilling and mapping has shown that the V zone is a significant mineralized structure dipping shallowly to the southeast, with locally abundant visible gold. The structure has been identified from outcrop on surface to a depth of 155 metres in recent drilling; it remains open at depth and laterally. Hole AMQ15-390 intersected the structure yielding 30.1 g/t gold over 5.2 metres at 40 metres depth. Approximately 100 metres to the south of this intercept, hole AMQ15-461 yielded 7.9 g/t gold over 23.4 metres at 115 metres depth. Approximately 150 metres southwest of hole AMQ15-390 was a third high-grade intersection in the V zone: hole AMQ15-491 intersected 21.1 g/t gold over 3.6 metres at 155 metres depth. Other results from the V zone are included in the intercepts table above. These results will lead to a reinterpretation of the I, V, and R zones, which could have a positive impact on the year-end resource estimate. Although additional drilling will be required, the Company believes that the V zone could potentially be a second source of open pit ore at Amaruq. Engineering and environmental baseline studies are underway to support the permitting process for the Amaruq project as a satellite open pit operation to the Meadowbank mine. The most recent drilling at depth in Whale Tail also indicates that this deposit hosts high-grade intercepts below the preliminary ultimate pit shell, suggesting that Whale Tail has underground potential. An application to construct an all-weather access road between Meadowbank and the Amaruq site was filed in the first quarter of 2015 and is currently working its way through the Nunavut permitting process. Meliadine Project - License B Granted; Regional Land Holdings Expanded The Meliadine gold project was acquired in July 2010 and is the Company's largest development project based on mineral reserves and mineral resources. The Company has a 100% interest in the 111,757-hectare property, which is linked to the town of Rankin Inlet in Nunavut by a 25-kilometre all-weather access road. In March 2015, the Company completed and filed with Canadian securities regulators an updated National Instrument 43-101 (\"NI 43-101\") technical report on the Meliadine gold project. The updated technical study was based on extracting only the 3.3 million ounces of gold in proven and probable mineral reserves (13.9 million tonnes of ore at 7.44 g/t gold), which is all contained in the Tiriganiaq and Wesmeg deposits. The Meliadine property also hosts 3.3 million ounces of measured and indicated mineral resources (20.2 million tonnes at 5.06 g/t gold), and 3.5 million ounces of inferred mineral resources (14.1 million tonnes at 7.65 g/t gold). In addition, there are numerous other known gold occurrences in the 80-kilometre-long greenstone belt that require further evaluation. Internal studies are ongoing to evaluate the potential to extract additional ounces from the Tiriganiaq and Wesmeg/Normeg deposits, which could potentially extend the mine life, improve the project economics, and increase the after-tax internal rate of return. These studies are expected to be completed in the first half of 2016. At the end of the third quarter of 2015, approximately 1,960 metres of underground development had been completed, and additional underground equipment has been transported to site to complete the 2015 plan that calls for total underground development of approximately 2,500 metres. This development will allow for more cost-effective exploration and conversion drilling of the deeper parts of the Tiriganiaq and Wesmeg/Normeg deposits and help to optimize potential mining plans. On July 13, 2015, the Kivalliq Inuit Association and Agnico Eagle signed the Inuit Impact Benefit Agreement (\"IIBA\") for the Meliadine gold project. The IIBA addresses protection of Inuit values, culture and language, protection of the land, water and wildlife, provides financial compensation to Inuit over the mine life, and contains provision for training, Inuit employment and contracting. On October 5, 2015, the Nunavut Water Board issued the permit (License B) for Meliadine pre-development work. License A, which is required for production activities, is expected to be granted in the second quarter of 2016. The timing of future capital expenditures on the Meliadine project beyond 2015 and the determination of whether to build a mine at Meliadine are subject to approval by Agnico Eagle's Board of Directors, which will be based on prevailing market conditions and outcomes of the various potential scenarios being evaluated. Acquisition of New Properties in Nunavut Agnico Eagle is currently studying options and alternatives in Nunavut to capitalize on the large and growing mineral resource in the region. As part of this initiative, the Company has recently staked claims totaling 68,012 hectares on properties to the west-northwest of the project, on the continuation of the greenstone belt that hosts the Meliadine deposits. This summer, an airborne VTEM magnetic and electromagnetic survey was flown over the new properties. A field crew initiated prospecting and sampling of areas with geophysical signatures typical of iron formation-hosted Archean/Proto-Proterozoic deposits, similar to those recognized at Meadowbank, Amaruq and Meliadine projects. Close to 800 rock samples have been collected from the properties. Initial results have identified a 2-kilometre-long structure from which 21 rock samples returned values above 1.0 g/t gold including seven values in excess of 10.0 g/t gold, with a maximum value of 42.0 g/t gold. The new properties appear to be geologically similar to the Meadowbank, Meliadine and Amaruq projects where our exploration team has demonstrated the effectiveness of a systematic exploration approach and the strong mineral potential of this part of Nunavut. Assembling and analyzing the data collected this summer will assist in preparing a drill program for 2016 to further investigate the higher potential areas on the new properties. SOUTHERN BUSINESS OPERATING REVIEW Agnico Eagle's southern business operations are focused in Mexico. These operations have been the source of growing precious metals production (gold and silver), stable operating costs and strong free cash flow since 2009. Pinos Altos - Strong Performance Driven by Higher Mill Throughput and Grades The 100% owned Pinos Altos mine in northern Mexico achieved commercial production in November 2009. The Pinos Altos mill processed 5,403 tpd in the third quarter of 2015, compared to 5,040 tpd processed in the third quarter of 2014. During the third quarter of 2015, approximately 49,300 tonnes of ore were stacked on the leach pad at Pinos Altos, compared to 143,500 tonnes in the comparable 2014 period. Minesite costs per tonne at Pinos Altos were $48 in the third quarter of 2015, which is in line with $48 in the third quarter of 2014. Although minesite costs per tonne are unchanged on a year-over-year basis, these costs are subject to variations in the proportion of heap leach ore to milled ore and open pit ore to underground ore, currency exchange rates and routine movements in the waste to ore stripping ratio in the open pit mines. For the first nine months of 2015, the Pinos Altos mill processed an average of 5,638 tpd, compared to 5,311 tpd processed in the first nine months of 2014. Approximately 238,500 tonnes of ore were stacked on the Pinos Altos leach pad during the first nine months of 2015, compared to 436,800 tonnes in the prior year period. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately $46 compared to $48 per tonne in the first nine months of 2014 with variance due to the proportion of heap leach to mill ore and the proportion of underground ore to open pit, variations in the proportion of waste to ore mined and variations in the currency exchange rate. Payable production in the third quarter of 2015 was 47,725 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $392. This compares with production of 41,155 ounces at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $545 in the third quarter of 2014. Higher production in 2015 is largely due to higher mill throughput and higher grades processed over the comparable prior year period. The decrease in the year over year total cash costs per ounce is largely due to increased gold production and higher silver production (offset in part, by a decline in realized silver prices) and favourable foreign exchange rates compared to the prior year period. In the first nine months of 2015, Pinos Altos produced 148,478 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $378 on a by-product basis. This is in contrast to the first nine months of 2014 when the mine produced 130,350 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $513 on a by-product basis. The lower cash costs in the first nine months of 2015 are primarily due to favourable foreign exchange rates and higher gold and silver production compared to the prior year period. The Pinos Altos shaft-sinking project remains on schedule for completion in 2016. The shaft is currently at a depth of approximately 573 metres, and activities during the third quarter of 2015 focused on the development of loading stations on levels 27 and 28. When the shaft is completed (final depth of approximately 603 metres), it will allow better matching of the mill capacity with the future mining capacity at Pinos Altos once the open pit mining operation begins to wind down, as planned over the next several years. The Company continues to evaluate a number of regional satellite opportunities. A 6,000-metre in-fill and conversion drill program on the Sinter deposit is 95% complete with assays still pending from about 50% of the holes. Results received to date indicate that there is good potential to add this deposit to the Pinos Altos mine plan beginning in 2020. Creston Mascota Deposit at Pinos Altos - Initial In-pit Drilling Results Indicate Potential to Extend Mine Life The Creston Mascota deposit at Pinos Altos has been operating as a satellite operation to the Pinos Altos mine since late 2010. Approximately 434,300 tonnes of ore were stacked on the Creston Mascota leach pad during the third quarter of 2015, compared to approximately 469,200 tonnes stacked in the third quarter of 2014. In the 2015 period, fewer tonnes were stacked mainly due to the adverse impact of the rainy season on roads, loading and dumping zones, and the crushing circuit. Minesite costs per tonne at Creston Mascota were $14 in the third quarter of 2015, compared to $17 in the third quarter of 2014. Costs in the 2015 period were lower due to currency fluctuations, lower fuel consumption and reduced power requirements compared to the 2014 period. For the first nine months of 2015, approximately 1,569,800 tonnes of ore were stacked on the Creston Mascota leach pad, compared to 1,242,900 tonnes in the prior year period. In the 2015 period, additional ore was encountered outside the block model, which resulted in more tonnes being stacked in the first half of the year compared to the 2014 period. For the first nine months of 2015, mine site costs per tonne at Creston Mascota were $12, compared to $17 per tonne in the first nine months of 2014. Costs were lower in the 2015 period due to more tonnes stacked and the other reasons outlined above. Payable gold production at Creston Mascota in the third quarter of 2015 was 12,716 ounces at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $436. This compares to 13,377 ounces at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $556 during the third quarter of 2014. Production was lower in the 2015 period due to fewer tonnes stacked, compared to the 2014 period. Cash costs were lower in the 2015 period based on lower minesite costs per tonne (see above), increased silver production (partially offset by a lower realized silver price) and a favourable foreign exchange rate compared to the 2014 period. Payable gold production for the first nine months of 2015 was 40,770 ounces at total cash costs per ounce of $425 on a by-product basis. This compares to 34,853 ounces at total cash costs per ounce of $587 on a by-product basis in the first nine months of 2014. The higher production in the 2015 period was due to more tonnes being stacked (especially in the first half of 2015) compared to the 2014 period. The lower costs in the 2015 period are due to higher gold production, increased silver production (partially offset by a lower realized silver price) and a favourable foreign exchange rate compared to the 2014 period. In the third quarter of 2015, preparation and top soil recovery at the Phase IV heap leach pad were completed. The earthworks have been initiated, with commissioning expected by year-end 2015. Over its mine life, Creston Mascota has added approximately 50% (179,000 ounces of contained gold) to its mineral reserves through infill drilling and improved geological understanding. In April 2015, higher grade mineralization was encountered at the bottom of the pit and outside the Creston Mascota block model. An infill drill program was completed in the third quarter of 2015 with encouraging results, and the interpretation of drill hole assays is ongoing. In September 2015, a 3,500-metre infill and conversion drill program commenced on the Bravo satellite zone. This program is expected to be completed by year-end 2015. The results of recent infill drilling in the pit and the potential of nearby satellite deposits such as Bravo could extend the projected life of the Creston Mascota operations beyond 2018. La India - New Record Set for Quarterly Gold Production The La India mine property in Sonora, Mexico, located approximately 70 kilometres from the Company's Pinos Altos mine, was acquired in November 2011 through the purchase of Grayd Resources, which held a 56,000-hectare land position in the Mulatos Gold belt. Commissioning of the mine commenced ahead of schedule in the third quarter of 2013 and commercial production was declared as of February 1, 2014. Approximately 1,193,900 tonnes of ore were stacked on the La India leach pad during the third quarter of 2015, compared to approximately 1,190,100 tonnes stacked in the third quarter of 2014. Minesite costs per tonne at La India were $11 in the third quarter of 2015, compared to the $10 in the third quarter of 2014. The increase in minesite costs reflect slightly higher maintenance costs and cyanide consumption (due to the rainy season) partially offset by lower costs for fuel and labour, and favourable foreign exchange rates. In the first nine months of 2015, approximately 3,931,900 tonnes of ore were stacked on the La India leach pad, compared to approximately 3,346,500 stacked in the first nine months of 2014. Minesite costs per tonne at La India were $9 in the first nine months of 2015, compared to the $8 in the first nine months of 2014. Tonnage stacked in the 2014 period was lower given that the operation was still ramping up to full capacity. The slightly higher costs in the 2015 period are primarily due to the reasons outlined above. Payable gold production at La India in the third quarter of 2015 was 28,604 ounces at total cash costs per ounce of $436 on a by-product basis were. Production in the third quarter of 2014 was 20,311 ounces at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $547. Production in the 2015 period was positively impacted by rain flushing residual ounces from the heaps and significantly higher ore grades placed on the heaps than planned. Total cash costs in the 2015 period were favourably impacted by higher production volumes and favourable foreign exchange rates. For the first nine months of 2015, La India produced 80,930 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $422 on a by-product basis. This compares to 51,820 ounces at total cash costs per ounce of $483 on a by-product basis in the first nine months of 2014. The higher production and lower costs in the 2015 period are primarily due to the reasons outlined above. During the third quarter of 2015, construction activities on the heap leach expansion were negatively affected by the extraordinary rains during the period. However, any delays related to the rains are not expected to affect future production plans or capital costs. Approximately 77% of the earthworks have been finished with full completion expected later in the fourth quarter of 2015. This leach pad expansion will provide the capacity for the current planned life-of-mine production at La India and approximately 5.0 million tonnes of additional stacking. Construction of the Main Zone haul road was completed during the third quarter of 2015. In the third quarter of 2015, several activities were undertaken to improve the La India block model and potentially expand the mineral reserves and mineral resource. Infill drilling and favourable reconciliation data from the first full year of mining have led to an improved geological model for the Main Zone oxides. In addition, ongoing metallurgical investigations and field-proven production experience with the North Zone sulphides have shown that some of the transition and sulphide material in the Main Zone and La India Zone may also be amenable to heap leaching. Inclusion of sulphide material into the pit designs at the La India mine has the potential to add further oxides as well as sulphides into the year-end 2015 mineral reserve and mineral resource estimate expected to be reported in mid-February 2016. Any additions could potentially extend the mine life beyond 2020. El Barqueno - Drilling Continues with a Focus on Resource Delineation and Defining New Target Areas Agnico Eagle has a 100% interest in the El Barqueno project. The 32,840-hectare property is in the Guachinango gold-silver mining district, Jalisco State, Mexico, approximately 150 kilometres west of the state capital of Guadalajara. It consists of three blocks of land: the original El Barqueno package (El Barqueno I, II and III) acquired from Cayden Resources in November 2014, and two adjacent blocks acquired from Soltoro Limited in June 2015 (El Rayo and El Tecolote). The Company last reported exploration results from this project in a news release dated September 21, 2015. The El Barqueno project contains a number of known mineralized zones and several prospects that require further evaluation. There are currently 10 drill rigs working to define the limits of the Azteca-Zapoteca, Angostura and Pena de Oro prospects, and delineate an initial mineral resource estimate for these deposits. Several other prospects are also under evaluation. An additional drill rig is testing the Zapote-Mixteca prospect, which has been shown to be gold-bearing by recent rock sample and trench results. To the end of the third quarter, 171 holes (42,940 metres) had been drilled. Drilling will continue at El Barqueno until the end of the year. The Company expects that this drilling will lead to the estimation of an initial inferred mineral resource at the Azteca-Zapoteca, Angostura and Pena de Oro areas to open-pit mineable depths. The resources are expected to be reported in mid-February 2016. Conceptual design studies and additional metallurgical testing are underway at El Barqueno. The project may host gold-silver deposits that could potentially be developed into a series of open pits utilizing heap leach processing, similar to Creston Mascota and the La India mine. While it is too early to estimate the extent of the mineral resources and the number of deposits with economic potential at El Barqueno, the Company already has the experience of developing cost-efficient mining operations in Mexico, and increasing their size through successful exploration as well as metallurgical innovation. This body of knowledge will be applied as El Barqueno continues to be explored and studied. Exploration expenditures at El Barqueno in 2015 are currently expected to total approximately $22 million. Quarterly Dividend Declared Agnico Eagle's Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.08 per common share, payable on December 15, 2015 to shareholders of record as of December 1, 2015.

Note Regarding Certain Measures of Performance This news release discloses certain measures, including ''total cash costs per ounce'' and ''minesite costs per tonne'', \"all-in sustaining costs per ounce\" and \"adjusted net income\" that are not recognized measures under IFRS. These data may not be comparable to data presented by other gold producers. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable financial information presented in the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS and for an explanation of how management uses these measures, other than adjusted net income, see \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Performance Measures\" below. The total cash costs per ounce of gold produced is presented on both a by-product basis (deducting by-product metal revenues from production costs) and co-product basis (before by-product metal revenues). The total cash costs per ounce of gold produced on a by-product basis is calculated by adjusting production costs as recorded in the consolidated statements of income (loss) for by-product revenues, unsold concentrate inventory production costs, smelting, refining and marketing charges and other adjustments, and then dividing by the number of ounces of gold produced. The total cash costs per ounce of gold produced on a co-product basis is calculated in the same manner as the total cash costs per ounce of gold produced on a by-product basis except that no adjustment is made for by-product metal revenues. Accordingly, the calculation of total cash costs per ounce of gold produced on a co-product basis does not reflect a reduction in production costs or smelting, refining and marketing charges associated with the production and sale of by-product metals. The total cash costs per ounce of gold produced is intended to provide information about the cash-generating capabilities of the Company's mining operations. Management also uses these measures to monitor the performance of the Company's mining operations. As market prices for gold are quoted on a per ounce basis, using the total cash costs per ounce of gold produced on a by-product basis measure allows management to assess a mine's cash-generating capabilities at various gold prices. All-in sustaining costs are used to show the full cost of gold production from current operations. The Company calculates all-in sustaining costs per ounce of gold produced as the aggregate of total cash costs on a by-product basis, sustaining capital expenditures (including capitalized exploration), general and administrative expenses (including stock options) and reclamation expenses divided by the amount of gold produced. The all-in sustaining costs per ounce of gold produced on a co-product basis is calculated in the same manner as the total cash costs per ounce of gold produced on a by-product basis except that no adjustment is made for by-product metal revenues. The Company's methodology for calculating all-in sustaining costs may differ from to the methodology used by other producers that disclose all-in sustaining costs. The Company may change the methodology it uses to calculate all-in sustaining costs in the future, including in response to the adoption of formal industry guidance regarding this measure by the World Gold Council. Management is aware that these per ounce measures of performance can be affected by fluctuations in exchange rates, and, in the case of total cash costs per ounce of gold produced on a by-product basis, by-product metal prices. Management compensates for these inherent limitations by using these measures in conjunction with minesite costs per tonne (discussed below) as well as other data prepared in accordance with IFRS. Management also performs sensitivity analyses in order to quantify the effects of fluctuating exchange rates and metal prices. This news release also contains information as to estimated future total cash costs per ounce, all-in sustaining costs and minesite costs per tonne. The estimates are based upon the total cash costs per ounce, all-in sustaining costs and minesite costs per tonne that the Company expects to incur to mine gold at its mines and projects and, consistent with the reconciliation of these actual costs referred to above, do not include production costs attributable to accretion expense and other asset retirement costs, which will vary over time as each project is developed and mined. It is therefore not practicable to reconcile these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable IFRS measure.

The scientific and technical information relating to Agnico Eagle's mineral reserves and mineral resources contained herein has been approved by Daniel Doucet, Senior Corporate Director, Reserve Development, Ing., and a qualified person as defined by NI 43-101. Cautionary Note To U.S. Investors - The SEC permits U.S. mining companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose only those mineral deposits that a company can economically and legally extract or produce. Agnico Eagle reports mineral resource and reserve mineral estimates in accordance with the CIM guidelines for the estimation, classification and reporting of mineral resources and mineral reserves in accordance with the Canadian securities regulatory authorities' NI 43-101. These standards are similar to those used by the SEC's Industry Guide No. 7, as interpreted by Staff at the SEC (\"Guide 7\"). However, the definitions in NI 43-101 differ in certain respects from those under Guide 7. Accordingly, mineral reserve information contained herein may not be comparable to similar information disclosed by U.S. companies. Under the requirements of the SEC, mineralization may not be classified as a \"reserve\" unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically and legally produced or extracted at the time the mineral reserve determination is made. A \"final\" or \"bankable\" feasibility study is required to meet the requirements to designate mineral reserves under Industry Guide 7. Agnico Eagle uses certain terms in this news release, such as \"measured\", \"indicated\", and \"inferred\", and \"resources\" that the SEC guidelines strictly prohibit U.S. registered companies from including in their filings with the SEC. In prior periods, mineral reserves for all properties were typically estimated using historic three-year average metals prices and foreign exchange rates in accordance with the SEC guidelines. These guidelines require the use of prices that reflect current economic conditions at the time of mineral reserve determination, which the Staff of the SEC has interpreted to mean historic three-year average prices. Given the current lower commodity price environment, Agnico Eagle has decided to use price assumptions that are below the three-year averages. The assumptions used for the mineral reserves estimates at all mines and advanced projects as of December 31, 2014 (other than the Canadian Malartic mine), reported by the Company on February 11, 2015, are $1,150 per ounce gold, $18.00 per ounce silver, $1.00 per pound zinc, $3.00 per pound copper, $0.91 per pound lead and C$/US$, US$/Euro and MXP/US$ exchange rates of 1.08, 1.30 and 13.00, respectively. For the mineral reserves estimate at the Canadian Malartic mine, the Company has decided to continue to report the mineral reserves estimated as of June 15, 2014, reported by the Company in a news release dated August 13, 2014, minus the production to the end of 2014. The assumptions used were $1,300 per ounce gold, a cut-off grade between 0.28 g/t and 0.35 g/t gold (depending on the deposit), and a C$/US$ exchange rate of 1.10. NI 43-101 requires mining companies to disclose mineral reserves and mineral resources using the subcategories of \"proven\" mineral reserves, \"probable\" mineral reserves, \"measured\" mineral resources, \"indicated\" mineral resources and \"inferred\" mineral resources. Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. A mineral reserve is the economically mineable part of a measured and/or indicated mineral resource. It includes diluting materials and allowances for losses, which may occur when the material is mined or extracted and is defined by studies at pre-feasibility or feasibility level as appropriate that include application of modifying factors. Such studies demonstrate that, at the time of reporting, extraction could reasonably be justified. Modifying factors are considerations used to convert mineral resources to mineral reserves. These include, but are not restricted to, mining, processing, metallurgical, infrastructure, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental factors. A proven mineral reserve is the economically mineable part of a measured mineral resource. A proven mineral reserve implies a high degree of confidence in the modifying factors. A probable mineral reserve is the economically mineable part of an indicated and, in some circumstances, a measured mineral resource. The confidence in the modifying factors applying to a probable mineral reserve is lower than that applying to a proven mineral reserve. A mineral resource is a concentration or occurrence of solid material of economic interest in or on the Earth's crust in such form, grade or quality and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade or quality, continuity and other geological characteristics of a mineral resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge, including sampling. A measured mineral resource is that part of a mineral resource for which quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics are estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the application of modifying factors to support detailed mine planning and final evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. Geological evidence is derived from detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing and is sufficient to confirm geological and grade or quality continuity between points of observation. An indicated mineral resource is that part of a mineral resource for which quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics are estimated with sufficient confidence to allow the application of modifying factors in sufficient detail to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. Geological evidence is derived from adequately detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing and is sufficient to assume geological and grade or quality continuity between points of observation. An inferred mineral resource is that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of limited geological evidence and sampling. Geological evidence is sufficient to imply but not verify geological and grade or quality continuity. Investors are cautioned not to assume that part or all of an inferred mineral resource exists, or is economically or legally mineable. A feasibility study is a comprehensive technical and economic study of the selected development option for a mineral project that includes appropriately detailed assessments of applicable modifying factors together with any other relevant operational factors and detailed financial analysis that are necessary to demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that extraction is reasonably justified (economically mineable). The results of the study may reasonably serve as the basis for a final decision by a proponent or financial institution to proceed with, or finance, the development of the project. The confidence level of the study will be higher than that of a Pre-Feasibility Study. Agrium Inc.

One of the greatest challenges the global community has ever faced is how to sustainably feed a rapidly growing population. This challenge is complex and won't be solved quickly, but we believe we're stronger working together. By collaborating with multiple groups, we build long-term, impactful programs and solutions that we continually learn from and build upon. So that, together, we can feed the world responsibly and improve the lives of future generations. Agrium reports strong fourth quarter results TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 09, 2016 CALGARY, ALBERTA--(Marketwired - Feb. 9, 2016) - ALL AMOUNTS ARE STATED IN U.S.$ Agrium Inc. (TSX:AGU) (NYSE:AGU) announced today 2015 fourth quarter net earnings from continuing operations of $200-million ($1.45 diluted earnings per share), compared to $70-million ($0.46 diluted earnings per share) in the fourth quarter of 2014. The increased net earnings were driven by strong performance from our Wholesale business unit, which achieved reduced cost of production and higher overall sales volumes for all three nutrients. Retail's fourth quarter earnings were also higher than last year, despite the wet weather in the U.S. during the fall application season. On an annual basis, 2015 net earnings from continuing operations were $988-millon ($6.98 diluted earnings per share) compared to $798-millon ($5.51 diluted earnings per share) in 2014. Highlights: Fourth quarter adjusted net earnings of $209-million or $1.52 per share (see page 2 for adjusted net earnings reconciliation)1, the second highest fourth quarter results on record. Our results include an $18-million restructuring expense ($0.10 per share) associated with the portfolio review and cost reduction measures undertaken, which was not included in the adjusted net earnings reconciliation on page 2. Wholesale's fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA2 of $372-million demonstrates improved nitrogen and potash production performance, delivering higher sales volumes and significantly lower production costs. The Canpotex proving run for the Vanscoy expansion was highly successful. We demonstrated our nameplate capacity within a year of mechanical completion, which increased our allocation to 10.3 percent of total Canpotex shipments starting in 2016. Retail EBITDA2 was higher than the same quarter last year as a result of strong year-end rebates for crop protection products and seed as well as lower operating expenses as a result of cost reduction initiatives implemented in 2015. On an annual basis, Retail U.S. normalized comparable store sales was up 2 percent versus a 2 percent decline in 2014. On an annual basis, 2015 free cash flow3 increased to $1.2-billion, or $8.59 per share, compared to $841-million, or $5.85 per share in 2014. Agrium has announced a 2016 annual guidance range of $5.50 to $7.00 diluted earnings per share (see page 3 for further details). \"Agrium achieved a strong finish to 2015, despite lower nutrient prices and challenging commodity markets. A key differentiator for the company was our integrated strategy, which helped provide stability in our earnings. We also benefited from the proactive steps we took to further strengthen the company over the past year, including a renewed focus on execution and controlling our controllables. These benefits flowed through to our bottom line, helped us to generate $8.59 of free cash flow per share and drive increased returns to shareholders, while still investing in future earnings growth,\" commented Chuck Magro, Agrium's President and CEO. Quarter effective tax rate of 20 percent used for adjusted net earnings and per share calculations. These are non-IFRS measures which represent net earnings adjusted for certain income (expenses) that are considered to be non-operational in nature. We believe these measures provide meaningful comparison to the earnings of other companies by eliminating share-based payments expense (recovery), gains (losses) on foreign exchange and related gains (losses) on non-qualifying derivative hedges and significant non-operating, non-recurring items. These should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS and may not be directly comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. EBITDA is earnings (loss) from continuing operations before finance costs, income taxes, depreciation and amortization while Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA before finance costs, income taxes, depreciation and amortization of joint ventures. These are non-IFRS measures. Refer to section \"Non-IFRS Measures\". This is a non-IFRS measure. Refer to section \"Non-IFRS Measures\". \"Nutrient prices have been under pressure globally but we are optimistic we will see a strong spring application season across North America. We remain focused on Operational Excellence and our growth strategy, controlling what we can in order to reduce our cost position, while continuing to optimize and grow our more stable Retail operations,\" added Mr. Magro. MARKET OUTLOOK The macroeconomic environment has continued to be challenging for commodities, resulting in many commodities trading at multi-year lows in early 2016. While agricultural commodities are driven by unique supply and demand fundamentals, prices have not escaped the general negative sentiment toward commodities. In addition to this, the prices of most crops have been pressured by another year of high global crop yields in 2015, allowing the global inventories of many major grains and oilseeds to increase. Furthermore, the strength in the U.S. dollar relative to most other global currencies has increased the competitiveness of non-U.S. growers, which has led to lower than expected U.S. grain and oilseed exports and added pressure on prices. Despite the weak macroeconomic environment, we expect growers within North America and other major agricultural markets will plant historically high crop acreage again in 2016, supporting robust crop input demand. In the U.S., growers are expected to increase overall crop acreage, including a one to three million acre increase in corn area, as significant crop acreage was lost in 2015 due to excess moisture in parts of the U.S. Corn Belt. Outside of the U.S., the weakness in domestic currencies has led to relatively attractive domestic crop prices, which is expected to support planted acreage. Analysts project that North American corn, soybean, cotton and canola acreage could increase in 2016 if weather cooperates, which is supportive of overall seed demand, but like 2015, growers may be more discerning in trait selection to optimize for yield depending on field locations. Crop protection prices are expected to be relatively stable and we expect that lower year-over-year cash rents and significantly lower fuel and crop nutrient prices will provide support for North American crop input expenditures in 2016. Crop nutrient prices have declined over the past few months, driven by a combination of supply and demand factors. The fall application season in the U.S. was expected to be supported by the relatively early end of the harvest season; however the same warm weather that supported a rapid harvest delayed fall ammonia applications because soil temperatures were too high. Following the warm start, the ability of growers to apply nutrients was constrained by persistent wet weather. November 2015 was the wettest November in the U.S. since 1985 and December 2015 was the wettest December on record in addition to being the warmest. The combination of wet and warm weather meant that application equipment could not get into the field to apply crop nutrients, resulting in below-expected fall applications. The lower than expected fall applications left crop nutrient inventories at higher than expected levels throughout the supply chain and pressured prices of all crop nutrients. The combination of expected increase in U.S. corn acreage and the poor fall application season is anticipated to result in strong U.S. crop nutrient demand in the first half of 2016. Based on expected crop acreage, North American crop nutrient demand is expected to increase by 1 to 3 percent in 2015/2016, but phosphate and potash demand may fall below that range as volumes lost due to the poor fall season may not be fully made up in the first half of 2016. Global urea prices have declined significantly below the cost of production of the high-cost Chinese producers. Even so, Chinese urea production has remained surprisingly strong. While Chinese urea production has not declined as much as expected, Chinese urea exports declined by 26 percent year-over-year in the second half of 2015. Chinese urea costs have declined due to lower coal prices and the weakened yuan, but costs have not declined as much as urea prices. As a result of the continued price weakness and increased non-Chinese urea supplies, Chinese urea exports are projected to decline from 2015 levels to between 12.5 and 13.5 million tonnes in 2016. We expect that the combination of poor Chinese urea profitability and strong North American demand will support urea prices entering the spring season. Chinese phosphate supplies have also pressured that market. Chinese diammonium phosphate and monoammonium phosphate exports reached a record 10.6 million tonnes in 2015 and are expected to remain relatively flat in 2016. On the demand side, the Brazilian market for crop nutrients continued to fall short of expectations in late 2015 as credit constraints and the weak value of the Brazilian real pressured demand for all nutrients. Given that these challenges remain, we expect 2016 Brazilian import demand for all products to remain relatively flat to 2015. The below-average Indian monsoon and weak rupee value pressured demand for phosphate and potash in late 2015, while 2015 urea imports set a record, all of which has led to building inventories and the belief that Indian import demand will be relatively low to start 2016. Global potash markets have been under pressure recently due to a combination of factors, including the sizeable shift in global currencies, a build-up of global inventories due to strong shipments earlier in the year, Indian demand impacted by the below average monsoon and buyers delaying purchases due to the current price uncertainty. We anticipate solid potash demand in global markets in 2016, with global shipments expected to come in between 58 to 60 million tonnes in 2016, relative to the 58.5 million tonnes shipped in 2015. We expect macroeconomic challenges in combination with current crop prices to be a risk in 2016. However, the arrival of the Northern Hemisphere's spring application season over the next couple of months is expected to result in improved demand, particularly in light of the poor fall season in the U.S. and the fact declining crop nutrient prices have caused buyers around the world to sit back and wait for stability. We also expect there will be a supply response across all three major nutrients in reaction to current price levels - some of which we have seen already in the form of production cuts and closures. 2016 ANNUAL GUIDANCE Based on our Market Outlook, Agrium expects to achieve annual diluted earnings per share of $5.50 to $7.00 in 2016. We have maintained a range encompassing approximately $300-million of EBITDA variability to reflect the risk and opportunity associated with crop nutrient prices and demand for crop inputs. We are assuming normal spring and fall application seasons, recognizing there is always a risk that inclement weather could affect the timing and duration of each season. Our earnings per share guidance assumes some recovery from current nitrogen prices during the key application seasons. Based on these and other assumptions regarding crop nutrient prices and demand for crop nutrients set out under the heading \"Market Outlook\", we expect Retail EBITDA to be $1.075-billion to $1.175-billion, and Retail nutrient sales volumes to be 9.8 to 10.2 million tonnes in 2016. Based on our expected increase in utilization rate for our nitrogen assets, we anticipate nitrogen production to total 3.5 to 3.7 million tonnes. Agrium has continued its active hedging program for our gas requirements in 2016 as we expect natural gas prices to remain at levels consistent with 2015. Our earnings per share guidance assume NYMEX gas prices will be between $2.05 and $2.85 per MMBtu in 2016. Agrium's expectation for potash production in 2016 includes incremental production from the completed expansion at our Vanscoy mine. We expect to produce between 2.4 and 2.6 million tonnes of potash in 2016. Total capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $800-million to $900-million, of which approximately $500-million to $550-million is expected to be sustaining capital expenditures. Our investing capital program planned for 2016 includes the completion of our Borger brownfield urea expansion. Agrium's annual effective tax rate for 2016 is expected to be 27 to 28 percent, consistent with 2015. This guidance and updated additional measures and related assumptions are summarized in the following table. Guidance excludes the impact of share-based payments expense (recovery), gains (losses) on foreign exchange and related non-qualifying derivative hedges and significant non-operating, non-recurring items.

Realized selling prices, on the other hand, decreased as a result of weaker market conditions. Reduced sales of product purchased for resale contributed to the decrease in sales as Agrium exited non-core, low return portions of this business. Wholesale's gross profit significantly increased due to manufacturing cost efficiencies associated with higher production volumes, reduced overall fixed costs and lower natural gas input costs for the fourth quarter compared to the same periods last year. Retail's sales and gross profit decreased for the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year primarily due to unfavorable weather conditions and the closure of one of our livestock export businesses in Australia. A decrease in gross profit was partially offset by higher rebates received in the fourth quarter of 2015. Expenses General and administrative expenses decreased by $4-million (5 percent) for the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year as a result of reduced payroll and office expenses related to our ongoing Operational Excellence program. Our share-based payments expense was lower by $10-million due primarily to a slight decrease in our share price in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to a share price increase in the fourth quarter of 2014. Other expenses breakdown In the fourth quarter of 2015, other expenses increased by $18-million due to the following: Costs of $18-million were incurred in the implementation of our Operational Excellence initiatives in the current quarter relating primarily to severance and closure costs. We recorded a goodwill impairment of $19-million for our Wholesale Europe operations. We recognized a $17-million gain from the sale of our West Sacramento nitrogen upgrade facility. We had losses of $15-million on natural gas derivatives in the fourth quarter of 2014, which we recorded directly to other expenses. 2015 did not have comparable results, as effective January 1, 2015, we began to designate all of our natural gas derivatives as qualifying hedges for accounting purposes. Related gains or losses are now recorded as part of cost of product sold when we sell the related product, while unrealized gains or losses are recorded in equity. Bad debt recovery of $11-million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014. Effective Tax Rate The effective tax rate on continuing operations of 20 percent for the fourth quarter was higher than the tax rate of (4) percent for the comparative quarter in 2014 due to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax assets in the fourth quarter of 2014. Excluding the recognition of the one-time previously unrecognized tax assets, the effective tax rate would have been 19 percent. BUSINESS SEGMENT PERFORMANCE Retail  Retail sales and gross profit during the quarter were lower than the same period last year due to lower crop input prices and wet weather across the U.S. impacting the fall application season. Total Retail selling expenses decreased by 10 percent compared to the prior year due to lower depreciation and amortization, the impact of currency valuations in our international businesses and cost reduction measures taken across the business in 2015. Total EBITDA increased 10 percent over the fourth quarter of 2014 primarily due to lower selling expenses, strong margins for crop protection products and improved seed results. Regionally, all key geographies performed well. Canada and the U.S. both showed higher fourth quarter EBITDA figures. Australian EBITDA was down slightly compared to the prior year; however, EBIT in Australia increased compared to the prior quarter due to a reduction in depreciation and amortization. Our U.S. Retail business also reported an annual 2 percent increase in normalized comparable store sales versus a decrease of 2 percent in 2014. Crop nutrients Total crop nutrient sales were 13 percent lower compared to the same period last year due to weaker global pricing and lower application volumes due to weather challenges. However, crop nutrient margins per tonne improved, which offset the lower volumes and resulted in only a 1 percent decline in gross profit. Total crop nutrient volumes were 6 percent lower this quarter across our Retail operations compared to the same period last year. Volumes were lower in the U.S. due to excess rain in the fall application window, while in Canada and Australia, growers were conservative given the uncertainty over nutrient and agricultural markets. Total crop nutrient margins increased slightly on a per tonne basis and gross profit as a percentage of sales rose from 16 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014 to 18 percent this quarter reflecting a focus on inventory management. Crop protection products Total crop protection sales were down 2 percent this quarter, as slightly higher sales in North America were offset by lower sales in our International operations. U.S. sales were driven by a strong herbicide application season, while Canadian growers purchased higher volumes ahead of the weakening Canadian dollar. In Australia, sales were lower due to the weakening of the Australian dollar against the U.S. dollar; in local currency, Australian sales were higher in the current quarter. Crop protection margins as a percentage of sales increased 3 percent, primarily due to year-end rebate reconciliation and a higher margin product mix in the current quarter. Proprietary product sales as a percentage of total sales increased 2 percent compared to the same period in the prior year. Seed Seed sales were down 18 percent this quarter compared to the same period last year, primarily due to the significant reduction in planted wheat acres in the U.S. due to wet weather and lower wheat prices. Despite lower sales, seed margins increased 8 percent compared to the prior year due to strong supplier rebates and seed sales mix. Merchandise Merchandise sales decreased compared to the same period last year as a result of lower fuel pricing and demand in Canada and lower animal health and fencing product sales in Australia due to dry conditions. Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased 3 percent this quarter, primarily due to a reduction in the lower-margin Canadian fuel business compared to the prior year. Services and other Sales for services and other was down 35 percent this quarter, due mainly to the closure of one of our livestock export businesses in Australia. Application and other services were down in North America, due to the wet conditions in the U.S. during the fall application season. Wholesale  Wholesale successfully completed its Canpotex proving run for the Vanscoy potash expansion at the end of the fourth quarter, resulting in our annual Canpotex allocation increasing to 10.3 percent in 2016 from 7.3 percent in 2015. Higher operating production rates at our nitrogen facilities also supported increased sales volumes this quarter. Total sales were slightly lower this quarter due to lower global nutrient prices and our decision to sell non-core, lower-return purchase for resale facilities in 2015 related to our asset portfolio review. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $222-million this quarter, and more than doubled compared to the same quarter last year. The increase was primarily due to lower production costs per tonne and higher utilization rates from our potash and nitrogen operations. Nitrogen Nitrogen gross profit increased by 65 percent over the same period last year as a result of higher sales volumes and significantly lower cost of production. Sales volumes increased by 4 percent over the same period last year, driven by stronger urea and ammonia sales volumes. The increase was due to strong demand in our core markets and higher on-stream time at our production facilities, creating additional product availability compared to the same period last year. Sales volumes were partly impacted by a narrow window for ammonia application in the U.S. and lower nitrogen solution sales volumes due to the closure and subsequent sale of our West Sacramento upgrading facility in 2015. Cost of product sold per tonne was 40 percent lower than the same period last year. Operational improvements and higher on-stream time compared to the same period last year decreased fixed costs per tonne, while lower natural gas costs reduced variable costs. The weaker Canadian dollar also reduced operating costs at our Canadian plants. Nitrogen margins were $204 per tonne, a $76 per tonne increase over the same period last year, despite a 12 percent reduction in average selling prices. As of January 1, 2015, we have designated all of our natural gas derivatives as accounting hedges1, with realized gains and losses now recorded to cost of product sold (which also includes transportation and administration costs). In the prior year, unrealized and realized gains and losses on derivatives not designated as hedges were included in other expenses. Potash Potash gross profit this quarter was $113-million higher than the same period last year. The significant increase was due to higher production volumes and lower costs this quarter after the completion of the Vanscoy expansion project as compared to the significant outage in the fourth quarter of 2014 in order to tie-in the expansion, which resulted in a negative gross profit of $50-million. Sales volumes were 637,000 tonnes higher compared to the same period in the prior year. Production volumes this quarter were 691,000 tonnes and the Canpotex proving run was completed successfully before the end of 2015. We expect Agrium's new Canpotex allotment will be 10.3 percent of Canpotex's total annual international shipments. Realized selling prices were lower than the same period last year due to slow spot market demand in both domestic and international markets. Cost of product sold was reduced as a result of cost efficiencies associated with the ramp-up of the Vanscoy expansion compared to the outage last year for the final tie-in of the expansion project. The significant weakening of the Canadian dollar also reduced production costs reported in U.S. dollars. As a result, cash cost of product manufactured continues to improve and was $64 per tonne this quarter compared to $89 per tonne in the third quarter of 2015. Phosphate Sales volumes were slightly higher than last year, while reduced selling prices were largely offset by lower cost of production. As a result, phosphate margin per tonne was only 6 percent lower than the same quarter last year. Phosphate gross profit was unchanged from the prior year. Wholesale Other Gross profit for Wholesale's other product category increased this quarter primarily due to higher ammonium sulfate sales volumes and higher ESN margins resulting from lower cost of product sold. This was partly offset by lower ESN realized selling prices. Expenses Expenses in the current quarter were $13-million lower than the same period last year as a result of lower selling and general administrative expenses and a $17-million gain on sale of the West Sacramento upgrading facility. Partially offsetting this is a $19-million goodwill impairment in our European purchase for resale business resulting from ongoing portfolio review in 2015. Other EBITDA for our Other non-operating business unit for the fourth quarter of 2015 had a net expense of $92-million, compared to a net expense of $78-million for the fourth quarter of 2014. The variance was due to the following: $7-million higher gross profit elimination expense as a result of higher inter-segment inventory held at the end of the fourth quarter of 2015 Increase of $12-million in other expenses of our Other business unit primarily due to costs incurred in implementing our Operational Excellence initiatives including severance and closure costs $10-million lower share-based payments expenses due primarily to a slight decrease in our share price in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to a share price increase in the same period last year NORMAL COURSE ISSUER BID In January 2015, the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) accepted Agrium's notice of intention to make a normal course issuer bid (NCIB) whereby Agrium may purchase up to 7,185,866 common shares on the TSX and New York Stock Exchange from January 26, 2015 to January 25, 2016. In 2015, we purchased for cancellation 5,574,331 shares at an average share price of $100.25 for total consideration of $559-million. No shares were repurchased in 2016 to the date of expiry.

OTHER Barrick Gold Corporation (TSX: ABX) Our vision is the generation of wealth through responsible mining wealth for our owners, our people, and the countries and communities with which we partner. We aim to be the leading mining company focused on gold, growing our cash flow per share by developing and operating high quality assets through disciplined allocation of human and financial capital and operational excellence. Those who founded and first led the company were committed to a culture of partnership and the values underpinning such a culture: trust, transparency, shared responsibility and accountability, and a sense of emotional and financial ownership. The company is returning to its roots as a lean and nimble organization, with minimal bureaucracy. A small head office manages the company with a balance of entrepreneurialism and prudence, focusing on only a few core activities: defining and implementing strategy, allocating human and financial capital, and fulfilling the obligations required of a public company. Leaders at the operational level have greater autonomy, responsibility, and accountability, functioning as business owners. Free from bureaucracy and middle management, they are focused on maximizing free cash flow, and the head office is focused on allocating that cash flow to maximize shareholder returns. Barrick has mining operations in Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile, Dominican Republic, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Saudi Arabia, United States and Zambia. More than 75 percent of the company's gold production comes from the Americas region. Barrick Reports Third Quarter 2015 Results | Growing Free Cash Flow TORONTO, October 28, 2015 The company reported adjusted net earnings of $131 million ($0.11 per share)1and a net loss of $264 million ($0.23 per share) in the third quarter. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $942 million1; EBITDA was $490 million1. Free cash flow was $866 million1, or $256 million excluding proceeds from the Pueblo Viejo streaming transaction. Gold production in the third quarter was 1.66 million ounces at all-in sustaining costs (AISC) of $771 per ounce1 Full-year gold production is expected to be 6.1-6.3 million ounces. Full-year all-in sustaining cost guidance reduced to $830-$870 per ounce from previous range of $840-$880 per ounce. On track to achieve $2 billion in cash flow improvements by end of 2016. Total debt reduced by 15 percent year-to-date, on track to achieve $3 billion debt reduction target. Progressing drilling and feasibility study work to convert resources to reserves over the next five years at Cortez, Goldstrike, Lagunas Norte, Pueblo Viejo, Turquoise Ridge and other sites. Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:ABX)(TSX:ABX) (Barrick or the \"company\") today reported adjusted net earnings of $131 million ($0.11 per share) for the third quarter and a net loss of $264 million ($0.23 per share). Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was$942 million and EBITDA was $490 million. Free cash flow was $866 million, or $256 million excluding the impact of $610 millionin proceeds from the Pueblo Viejo streaming transaction2. Production in the third quarter was in line with expectations at 1.66 million ounces of gold. All-in sustaining costs were $771 per ounce and cash costs were $570 per ounce1. Full-year 2015 gold production is expected to be 6.1-6.3 million ounces at lower all-in sustaining costs of $830-$870 per ounce. Our objective is to grow free cash flow per share from a portfolio of high-quality gold assets through disciplined capital allocation and operational excellence. In support of this objective, we have returned to a leaner, decentralized operating model designed to maximize free cash flow and improve execution. Clear capital allocation criteria, including a 15 percent hurdle rate for all investments, are driving greater financial rigor and stronger returns. The divestment of non-core assets has refocused our portfolio and we have formed vital new strategic partnerships that will drive new opportunities in the future. All of this is driving stronger performance across the business, reflected by two consecutive quarters of positive free cash flow and improved costs. At the same time, we are strengthening our balance sheet and remain on track to reduce debt by $3 billion. This momentum will support our overriding objective of growing free cash flow per share, underpinned by a strong pipeline of organic projects and mine site expansion opportunities in our core regions. STRENGTHENING THE BALANCE SHEET Earlier this year, we set a $3 billion debt reduction target for 2015. We said we would achieve this through the disciplined sale of non-core assets, the formation of new joint ventures and partnerships, and by maximizing free cash flow from our operations. Thus far, we have completed or announced asset sales, joint ventures and partnerships valued at $2.46 billion. We have also generated$282 million in positive free cash flow in the last two quarters despite a lower gold price, reflecting the impact of our efforts to maximize free cash flow across the company. Both asset sales and cash flow improvements have been credit positive, and have resulted in improvements to our debt-to-EBITDA ratio. Achieving our $3 billion debt reduction target will also reduce annual pre-tax interest payments by approximately $140 million. So far this year, total debt has been reduced by 15 percent, from $13.1 billion to $11.2 billion3, significantly reducing our near-term debt repayment obligations. We currently have less than $250 million in debt due before 2018 and approximately $5 billion of our $11.2 billion in outstanding debt matures after 2032. Building on $1.9 billion in repayments already completed this year, we intend to use approximately $1 billion in proceeds from the sale of 50 percent of Zaldivar to reduce debt. The sale is expected to close in the fourth quarter. This would bring total debt repayments to approximately $2.9 billion. We intend to use free cash flow to reach our target of $3 billion. Assuming the completion of $3 billion in repayments, total debt will have been reduced by 23 percent, from $13.1 billion to $10.1 billion. We also expect to announce the outcome of a process for the sale of certain non-core U.S. assets in the fourth quarter. As we move into 2016 and beyond, we will continue to take prudent steps to strengthen our balance sheet, balancing debt repayments with investments in profitable production that will drive growth in free cash flow and EBITDA. Our liquidity position continues to improve, with strong cash flow generation, very modest near-term debt repayment obligations, a$4 billion undrawn credit facility and $3.34 billion in cash on hand at the end of the third quarter. FINANCIAL DISCUSSION Free cash flow increased to $866 million, or $256 million excluding the impact of $610 million in proceeds from the Pueblo Viejo streaming transaction. This compares to $26 million in free cash flow in the second quarter of 2015. Two consecutive quarters of positive free cash flow after a prolonged period of negative free cash flow reflects our driving focus on maximizing free cash flow through greater capital discipline, operational efficiencies and strong cost management. Third quarter 2015 adjusted net earnings were $131 million ($0.11 per share) compared to $222 million ($0.19 per share) in the prior year period. The net loss for the quarter was $264 million ($0.23 per share) compared to net earnings of $125 million ($0.11per share) in the prior year quarter. Lower adjusted net earnings reflect lower realized gold and copper prices and higher depreciation compared to the prior year period, partially offset by increased gold and copper sales. Significant adjusting items for the quarter (net of tax and non-controlling interest effects) include: $455 million in impairment charges primarily related to the reclassification of our Zaldivar mine as held-for-sale; and $29 million in costs arising from the write-down of obsolete supplies inventory; partially offset by $52 million of gains related to the sale of our Cowal mine and 50 percent of our interest in the Porgera mine; and $45 million in unrealized foreign currency translation gains. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $942 million compared to $1.1 billion in the prior year period. On an unadjusted basis, EBITDA was $490 million for the third quarter compared to $1.0 billion in the prior year period. Operating cash flow was $1.26 billion compared to $852 million in the prior year period. Higher operating cash flow in the quarter reflects the impact of $610 million in proceeds from the Pueblo Viejo streaming transaction. OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS AND GUIDANCE Barrick's operations continued to perform in line with expectations for the year, meeting cost and production targets for the third quarter while generating stronger free cash flow. We have tightened our gold production guidance range for 2015, from 6.1-6.4 million ounces to 6.1-6.3 million ounces, reflecting lower anticipated gold production from Acacia Mining plc. All-in sustaining cost guidance for the year has been reduced to $830-$870 per ounce from the previous range of $840-$880 per ounce. Average all-in sustaining costs for our five core mines are now expected to be $700-$725 per ounce in 2015, down from$725-$775 per ounce at the start of this year. These mines are expected to account for about 75 percent of free cash flow from operations and 60-65 percent of production in 2015. Fourth quarter all-in sustaining costs are now expected to be similar to the third quarter while production is expected to be slightly higher, primarily driven by the impact of higher sustaining capital expenditures offset by higher production at Cortez, Pueblo Viejo, Lagunas Norte and Veladero. We expect significantly higher depreciation in the fourth quarter, primarily related to a drawdown in inventory stockpiles at Cortez, Lagunas Norte and Goldstrike and higher sales volumes at Pueblo Viejo. Total copper guidance for 2015 remains unchanged at 480-520 million pounds. Full-year C1 cash costs are now expected to be$1.60-$1.85 per pound5, down from $1.75-$2.00 per pound, driven by currency impacts and improved costs at Lumwana. Cortez The Cortez mine produced 321,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $501 per ounce in the third quarter. Production benefited from higher open pit tonnage and improved underground productivity through the implementation of short interval controls, an initiative identified as part of our Value Realization review for Cortez. Higher production, lower operating costs and lower sustaining capital drove improved all-in sustaining costs. Production in 2015 is now forecast to be 900,000-950,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $675-$725 per ounce. Fourth quarter production at Cortez is expected to be slightly higher than the third quarter, at higher costs. A prefeasibility study for expanded underground mining in an area known as Deep South below currently permitted levels will be completed in late 2015 and results are expected to be disclosed with the company's fourth quarter results. Our Value Realization review at Cortez also identified long-hole stoping as the preferred mining method for the deposit, as compared to the cut-and-fill method previously contemplated for the underground expansion, which could improve the economics of the project. Mineralization in this zone is primarily oxide and higher grade compared to the current underground mine, which is sulfide in nature. The limits of the Lower Zone have not yet been defined, and drilling has indicated the potential for new targets at depth. With a 382-square-mile land package, Cortez remains a highly prospective district for Barrick. Goldstrike The Goldstrike mine contributed 328,000 ounces in the third quarter in line with plan, while all-in sustaining costs of $558 per ounce were better than expected due to lower operating costs and lower sustaining capital. Our innovative thiosulfate (TCM) circuit achieved commercial production in the third quarter, coming in at a capital cost of $610 million. We expect to complete the ramp up of the TCM circuit in the first half of 2016. Goldstrike's production for 2015 is forecast to be 1.00-1.10 million ounces at improved all-in sustaining costs of $650-$700 per ounce. Fourth quarter production is expected to be similar to the third quarter, at slightly higher costs. Exploration at Goldstrike is focused on the underground mine where good potential exists at depth, and we plan to accelerate near-mine development in 2016. During the quarter, we began development of new areas below existing workings at Meikle and Rodeo in order to access deeper reserves which are expected to come into production at the end of 2016. This work will also open up new drilling platforms to better define future potential in these areas. Pueblo Viejo (60 percent) Barrick's 60 percent share of production from Pueblo Viejo for the third quarter was 172,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of$554 per ounce. Production was slightly below plan due to lower gold grades and recoveries from a higher proportion of carbonaceous ore. All-in sustaining costs were impacted by lower silver recoveries associated with a combination of scheduled autoclave maintenance in September, lime boil limitations and unscheduled maintenance on the limestone grinding circuit. Modifications to the lime boil are underway, including the addition of two lime boil tanks which will be operational in November. These additional tanks are expected to improve silver recoveries to the targeted 80 percent level from around 60 percent currently. We continue to forecast attributable production of 625,000-675,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $540-$590 per ounce in 2015. Production is expected to be higher and costs lower in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter on higher grades, improved recoveries and better autoclave availability. At the end of 2014, Pueblo Viejo had approximately six million ounces of gold and 37 million ounces of silver in the measured and indicated resource category (Barrick's 60 percent share)9. A significant portion of these resources are not currently included in reserves due to tailings storage constraints. We have completed a preliminary economic assessment on a plan to remove these constraints to tailings capacity, which if implemented could significantly extend the life of the mine. We expect to complete further engineering work and commission a prefeasibility study in the second half of 2016 to refine the technical and financial analysis for the increase in tailings storage capacity and to confirm whether the measured and indicated resources described above can be brought into reserves. Lagunas Norte The Lagunas Norte mine contributed 108,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $581 per ounce in the third quarter, in line with expectations. Production in 2015 is now anticipated to be 550,000-590,000 ounces at improved all-in sustaining costs of $550-$600 per ounce, with stronger production expected in the fourth quarter driven by improved performance at the Phase Five leach pad. Fourth quarter all-in sustaining costs are expected to be higher than the third quarter, reflecting the sale of higher cost inventory as well as increased sustaining capital for Phase Six leach pad construction. A pre-feasibility study on a plan to extend the mine life by up to 12 years by mining nearly two million ounces of sulfide ore below the existing open pit is on schedule for completion in 2015. Veladero The Veladero mine produced 143,000 ounces of gold in the third quarter at all-in sustaining costs of $914 per ounce. Production was below plan primarily due to lower grades in the Federico Phase Three pit and adverse weather events in August which impacted leach operations. All-in sustaining costs were higher than plan on lower gold ounces sold, timing of sustaining capital and lower silver credits. The addition of reagents to the leach circuit was temporarily halted in September following a valve failure on a pipe carrying processing solution, which led to a discharge to the environment through a diversion channel gate that was open at the time of the incident. Since the incident occurred, our first priority has been the safety of people and the environment. Water samples analyzed by independent third-parties, including the United Nations, have confirmed that there are no risks to the health of downstream communities as a result of this incident. Restrictions on leaching activities were lifted following implementation of additional monitoring and corrective actions. Production guidance for 2015 is unchanged at 575,000-625,000 ounces while all-in sustaining cost guidance has been narrowed to $950-$1,000 per ounce. Fourth quarter production is expected to be higher, at lower all-in sustaining costs driven by better grades, lower capital expenditures and higher silver and inventory credits. Turquoise Ridge (75 percent) The Turquoise Ridge mine contributed 55,000 ounces in the third quarter at all-in sustaining costs of $738 per ounce, in line with expectations. The mine is forecast to produce 175,000-200,000 ounces in 2015 at improved all-in sustaining costs of $750-$800per ounce. Detailed engineering and feasibility work on developing an additional shaft GoC which could bring forward more than one million ounces of production and roughly double output to an average of 500,000 ounces per year (100 percent basis) at all-in sustaining costs of about $625-$675 per ounce GoC is on track to be completed by the end of the year. Work to install additional ventilation capacity has also been initiated. Porgera (47.5 percent) The Porgera mine produced 134,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $986 per ounce, in line with plan. Attributable production in 2015 is now expected to be 400,000-450,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $1,025-$1,125 per ounce, reflecting Barrick's reduced interest following the sale of 50 percent of Barrick (Niugini) Ltd. to Zijin Mining. Recent drought conditions are not expected to have a material impact on production in 2015. We expect to increase our exploration budget at Porgera in 2016 to focus on underground targets which have been identified through a new geological model. Other Mines Barrick's other mines - consisting of Bald Mountain, 50 percent of Round Mountain, Golden Sunlight, Ruby Hill, Hemlo, Cowal, KCGM and Pierina - contributed 298,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $959 per ounce in the third quarter. A sale process is underway for Bald Mountain, Round Mountain, Ruby Hill, Golden Sunlight and the Spring Valley and Hilltop properties, with strong interest received to date. Acacia Mining (63.9 percent) Barrick's share of third quarter production was lower than expected at 104,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $1,195 per ounce due to temporary factors impacting output from Bulyanhulu and Buzwagi. We now expect attributable 2015 production from Acacia to be about 460,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of approximately $1,155 per ounce. Copper Copper production in the third quarter was 140 million pounds at C1 cash costs of $1.53 per pound. For 2015, copper production is anticipated to be 480-520 million pounds at lower C1 cash costs of $1.60-$1.85 per pound, reflecting currency impacts and improved costs at Lumwana. Lumwana contributed 77 million pounds at C1 cash costs of $1.59 per pound in the third quarter, in line with expectations. Power restrictions and potential reductions to smelter capacity in Zambia are not expected to have any material impact on Lumwana's 2015 production guidance. Production is now anticipated to be 260-280 million pounds at lower C1 cash costs of $1.80-$2.00per pound in 2015, reflecting higher grades. Production of 63 million pounds at Zaldivar at C1 cash costs of $1.47 per pound in the third quarter was in line with plan. At Jabal Sayid, first shipments of copper-in-concentrate continue to be anticipated in early 2016. Once the mine reaches full production, average production in the first full five years is expected to be 100 million pounds per year. TARGETING $2 BILLION IN CASH FLOW IMPROVEMENTS This year, we have taken significant actions to improve our business plans, resulting in positive free cash flow for two consecutive quarters. We remain focused on improving productivity and driving down costs to maximize free cash flow from our assets in any gold price environment. In support of this, we are targeting $2 billion in cash flow improvements across the company before the end of 2016, relative to our original internal plans for 2015 and 2016. These improvements are coming from productivity gains and cost reductions across operating expenses, capital spending and corporate overhead. While a majority of these actions will be incorporated into our 2016 plans, the initial outcomes are reflected in improvements to our 2015 guidance. Total capital expenditures for the year are expected to be 20 percent lower than 2014. Combined with reductions in corporate overhead and other operating cost savings, this has allowed us to reduce our 2015 all-in sustaining cost guidance by about $30 per ounce since the start of year, from our original range of $860-$895 per ounce to $830-$870 per ounce in the third quarter. We are now focused on optimizing our 2016 plans, with an emphasis on operating cost and productivity improvements. Our temporary suspension plan for Pascua-Lama has now been approved by the mining authority in Chile. This will enable us to complete the transition to care and maintenance, and should allow us to significantly reduce holding costs at the project in 2016. Implementation of the temporary suspension plan could require adjustments resulting from regulatory and legal actions and weather conditions, which could increase costs associated with the plan. CONVERTING RESOURCES TO RESERVES At the end of 2014, Barrick had 93 million ounces of proven and probable gold reserves and 94 million ounces of measured and indicated gold resources10. At 1.37 grams per tonne, our reserve grade is more than 50 percent higher than the senior peer average11. For more than 20 years, Barrick has maintained an average reserve mine life of between 10 to 20 years with a track record of replacing reserves and resources at our operations. Mine life and production rates at the majority of our mines have far surpassed initial estimates and we continue to identify excellent potential for resource conversion at many of our operations. Of our exploration budget, 65 percent is focused on opportunities at or near our existing operations. Drilling and feasibility study work to convert resources to reserves over the next five years at Cortez, Goldstrike, Lagunas Norte, Pueblo Viejo and Turquoise Ridge are progressing well. In addition, recent drilling at Hemlo and Porgera indicates strong potential for resource additions. We are also working to advance our Goldrush project in Nevada and drilling to define the limits of mineralization at the Alturas project inChile is expected to resume in the fourth quarter, following the South American winter. An illustration of the optionality that exists within our portfolio is the recent drill program at Hemlo. In the first quarter, Barrick completed the acquisition of surface and mineral rights adjacent to the Hemlo property in Ontario from subsidiaries of Newmont Mining. These claims included an area of geological potential adjacent to Barrick's existing underground workings. Barrick is currently undertaking an underground diamond drilling program in this area to evaluate its potential. To date, drilling has encountered a number of high grade intercepts with significant potential. These results highlight the ongoing potential of mineral deposits such as the Hemlo camp, even as they become mature operations. A detailed update on reserves and resources will be provided with the company's fourth quarter results in February 2016.

Cameco Corporation (TSE: CCJ) Cameco is one of the world's largest uranium producers accounting for about 16% of the global production from its mines in Canada, the US and Kazakhstan. Our leading position is backed by about 429 million pounds of proven and probable reserves and extensive resources. Cameco reports fourth quarter and 2015 financial results delivered on annual guidance amid weak market conditions solid uranium segment results, record annual revenue and average realized price owing to a weaker Canadian dollar record annual uranium production on the back of strong results at Cigar Lake write-down of $210 million in the fourth quarter related to our Rabbit Lake operation Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada, February 5, 2016 Cameco (TSX: CCO; NYSE: CCJ) today reported its consolidated financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2015 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). \"In 2015, the company continued to perform well, in the context of the global challenges our industry faces,\" said president and CEO, Tim Gitzel. \"But despite the challenges, we continued to concentrate on the aspects of our business that are within our control, which has led us to once again deliver on, and in some cases exceed, our annual guidance. \"We are still waiting on a market recovery that was expected to come sooner, but we've learned to put those expectations aside and prepare for whatever comes our way. Looking ahead, our strategy is to continue focusing our capital on tier-one assets, because it's those world-class, low-cost mines that will position us to quickly respond when the market calls for more production. And we believe that the question is not 'if' the market will make that call, but 'when', as we continue to see a bright long-term outlook for the nuclear industry.\" FULL YEAR Our net earnings attributable to equity holders (net earnings) in 2015 were $65 million ($0.16 per share diluted) compared to $185 million ($0.47 per share diluted) in 2014, mainly due to: greater losses on foreign exchange derivatives due to the weakening of the Canadian dollar lower tax recoveries, primarily due to the write-off of our deferred tax asset in the US Partially offset by: lower impairment charges ($215 million in 2015; $327 million in 2014) higher earnings in our uranium and fuel services segments due to higher average realized prices higher earnings in our NUKEM segment as a result of higher volumes and average realized price reduction of the provision related to our Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) litigation In addition, in 2014 there were a number of one-time items that contributed to the higher net earnings in 2014 compared to 2015, including: the sale of our interest in Bruce Power Limited Partnership (BPLP) resulting in a $127 million gain in 2014 a favourable settlement of $66 million in 2014 with respect to a dispute regarding a long-term supply contract with a utility customer Partially offset by: payment of an early agreement termination fee of $18 million as a result of the cancellation of our toll conversion agreement with Springfields Fuels Limited (SFL), and $12 million for settlement costs with respect to early redemption of our Series C debentures in 2014 the write-off of $41 million of assets under construction in 2014 as a result of changes made to the scope of a number of projects On an adjusted basis, our earnings were $344 million ($0.87 per share diluted) (non-IFRS measure, see page 8) in 2015 compared to $412 million ($1.04 per share diluted) in 2014. The 17% decrease from 2014 to 2015 resulted from: greater losses on foreign exchange derivatives due to the weakening of the Canadian dollar lower tax recoveries, primarily due to the write-off of our deferred tax asset in the US partially offset by: higher earnings in our uranium and fuel services segments mainly due to a higher average realized price higher earnings from our NUKEM segment mainly due to higher sales volumes and a higher average realized price a reduction of the provision related to our CRA litigation In addition, in 2014 there was a favourable settlement of $66 million with respect to a dispute regarding a long-term supply contract with a utility customer that contributed to the higher adjusted net earnings in 2014 compared to 2015. The impact of the settlement was partially offset by an early termination fee of $18 million incurred as a result of the cancellation of our toll conversion agreement with SFL and settlement costs of $12 million with respect to the early redemption of our Series C debentures in 2014. FOURTH QUARTER In the fourth quarter of 2015, our net loss was $10 million ($(0.03) per share diluted), a decrease of $83 million compared to net earnings of $73 million ($0.18 per share diluted) in 2014, mainly due to: greater losses on foreign exchange derivatives resulting from the weakening of the Canadian dollar lower income tax recovery due to the reduction of our deferred tax asset in the US higher impairment charges in 2015 ($210 million in 2015, $131 million in 2014) Partially offset by: higher uranium gross profits resulting mainly from a higher average realized price and higher sales volumes higher gross profits from our fuel services segment due to a higher average realized price lower exploration expenditures the reduction of our provision related to the CRA litigation In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2014 there was a favourable settlement of $37 million with respect to a dispute regarding a long-term supply contract with a utility customer that contributed to the higher net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to the same period in 2015. The impact of the settlement was partially offset by the write-off of $41 million of assets under construction as a result of changes made to the scope of a number of projects in the fourth quarter of 2014. On an adjusted basis, our earnings this quarter were $151 million ($0.38 per share diluted) compared to $205 million ($0.52 per share diluted) (non-IFRS measure, see page 8) in 2014, mainly due to: a lower income tax recovery primarily due to the reduction of our deferred tax asset in the US partially offset by: higher uranium gross profits resulting mainly from a higher average realized price and higher sales volumes higher gross profits from our fuel services segment mainly due to a higher average realized price lower exploration expenditures the reduction of our provision related to the CRA litigation In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2014 there was a favourable settlement of $37 million with respect to a dispute regarding a long-term supply contract with a utility customer that contributed to the higher adjusted net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to the same period in 2015. Impairment charge on producing assets During the fourth quarter of 2015, we recognized a $210 million impairment charge related to our Rabbit Lake operation. The impairment was due to increased uncertainty around future production sources for the Rabbit Lake mill as a result of the ongoing economic conditions. The amount of the charge was determined as the excess of carrying value over the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of the mill was determined to be $69 million. See note 9 to the financial statements. 2015 market developments As has been the case in recent years, a lot happened over the course of 2015, although the general state of the market did not see much change. Making positive news for nuclear, as usual, was China. Not only did the country continue with its rapid reactor new build program and bring eight reactors online, but Chinese companies also signed agreements with Argentina, Romania and the UK for new reactors, illustrating the country's commitment to nuclear and its intent to become a major international player in the nuclear industry. Undoubtedly, the biggest headline of 2015 was the long-awaited first reactor restarts in Japan. Sendai units 1 and 2 were the first reactors in Japan to restart since 2013, and it is hoped they are the first of many to come. New builds in the UK and US continued to be bright spots for the industry, in addition to a number of reactor life extensions approved in Japan, and the US, with utilities now considering additional extensions that could see reactor lives reaching 80 years. However, these positive developments could not outweigh the more powerful influence of a continued sluggish global economy, geopolitical issues, concerns around growth in China, and flat electricity demand. These more general drivers had help from industry specific factors as well, such as slower new reactor construction, eight reactor shutdowns, the continued high level of inventories held by market participants, and France's policy to reduce nuclear in their energy mix to 50% by 2025 becoming law. In addition, supply performed relatively well, with only minor disruptions and one curtailment, unlike 2014, which saw six projects tempered or curtailed. The end result was a market seemingly indifferent to the commotion of events that occurred throughout the year. CONTRACTING Market contracting activity was modest. Spot volumes were normal, but long-term contracting was well below historical averages and current consumption levels--about half of current annual reactor consumption estimates, similar to 2014. Long- term contracting is a key factor in the timing of market recovery, and its pace will depend on the respective coverage levels, market views and risk appetite of both buyers and sellers. JAPAN The big news in Japan was the restart of Sendai units 1 and 2, which occurred in August and October. In addition, the court injunction against the two Takahama units was overturned in December, 2015, clearing the way for Takahama unit 3 to restart on January 29, 2016, with unit 4 expected to restart later in the first quarter. Ikata unit 3 has also cleared a safety inspection by the Nuclear Regulatory Authority, and four more units are in the final stages of approval. In all, three reactors are now in operation, while 23 remain under evaluation for restart. Over the long term, Japan's energy policy states that nuclear will make up 20 to 22% of the energy mix in the country. The billions of dollars in investment being made by Japan's utilities suggest a high degree of confidence in reactors coming back online and meeting this target; however, public sentiment towards nuclear in Japan remains somewhat uncertain. OTHER REGIONS China's remarkable nuclear growth program remains on track and the UK's plans for new reactor construction continue to move forward. India and South Korea are also among several key regions growing their nuclear generation fleet. In 2015, growth was tangible as 10 reactors came online--double that of 2014. These included the eight noted in China, one in Russia and one in South Korea. And seven more reactors began construction--six in China and one in the UAE, a formerly non-nuclear country with four reactors now under construction. But, to round out the picture, eight units shut down. Five of these were in Japan, plus one in Sweden, one in Germany as part of its phase-out plans, and one in the UK--the last Magnox reactor operating in the world. In addition, there were announcements for future shutdowns in the US, where nuclear struggles to remain competitive in deregulated electricity markets and in the context of low natural gas prices. One event that could have an effect on the future of nuclear in the US and other western countries is the UN Climate Conference COP-21 agreement, finalized in 2015. As a non-GHG emitter, nuclear could play a significant role in achieving climate change prevention goals. Outlook for 2016 Our strategy is to focus on our tier-one assets and profitably produce at a pace aligned with market signals, while maintaining the ability to respond to conditions as they evolve. Our outlook for 2016 reflects the expenditures necessary to help us achieve our strategy. We do not provide an outlook for the items in the table that are marked with a dash. See 2015 Financial results by segment on page 12 for details. 2016 FINANCIAL OUTLOOK We expect consolidated revenue to decrease up to 5% in 2016, based on currently committed sales volumes, due to a planned decrease in uranium and fuel services sales volumes. If we make additional sales with deliveries in 2016, we would expect our revenue outlook to increase. We expect administration costs (not including stock-based compensation) to be 5% to 10% higher compared to 2015 due to increased costs related to the northern collaboration agreements and increased project work. In 2016, we are continuing to negotiate new collaboration agreements with northern communities, which could result in additional one-time payments. Due to the uncertainty of the timing for the potential signing of agreements, the cost is not included in our outlook. If agreements are signed and there is an impact on our administrative costs, we will update our outlook. We expect exploration expenses to be about 15% to 20% higher than they were in 2015 due to increased exploration activity at Cigar Lake. On an adjusted net earnings basis, we expect a tax recovery of 25% to 30% in 2016 from our uranium, fuel services and NUKEM segments. Our consolidated tax rate is a blend of the statutory rates applicable to taxable income earned or tax losses incurred in Canada and in our foreign subsidiaries. We have a global customer base and we have established a marketing and trading structure involving foreign subsidiaries, which entered into various intercompany purchase and sale arrangements, as well as uranium purchase and sale agreements with third parties. Cameco and its subsidiaries made reasonable efforts to put arm's-length transfer pricing arrangements in place, and these arrangements expose the parties to the risks and rewards accruing to them under these contracts. The intercompany contract prices are generally comparable to those established in comparable contracts between arm's-length parties entered into at that time. This year, many of the existing intercompany purchase and sale arrangements in our portfolio expire. We have started to replace these contracts and will continue to put new intercompany arrangements in place, which, as the existing arrangements did, will reflect the market at the time they are signed. As a result, in 2017, we expect our consolidated tax rate will transition to a modest expense, and trend toward a tax expense of approximately 20% over the next five years. The actual effective tax rate will vary from year-to-year, primarily due to the actual distribution of earnings among jurisdictions and the market conditions at the time transactions occur under both our intercompany and third-party purchase and sale arrangements. ROYALTIES We pay royalties on the sale of all uranium extracted at our mines in the province of Saskatchewan. Two types of royalties are paid: Basic royalty: calculated as 5% of gross sales of uranium, less the Saskatchewan resource credit of 0.75%. Profit royalty: a 10% royalty is charged on profit up to and including $22.70/kg U3O8 ($10.30/lb) and a 15% royalty is charged on profit in excess of $22.70/kg U3O8. Profit is determined as revenue less certain operating, exploration, reclamation and capital costs. Both exploration and capital costs are deductible at the discretion of the producer. As a resource corporation in Saskatchewan, we also pay a corporate resource surcharge of 3% of the value of resource sales. During the period from 2013 to 2015, transitional rules for the new profit royalty regime were applied whereby only 50% of capital costs were deductible. The remaining 50% was accumulated and will now be deductible beginning in 2016. In addition, the capital allowance related to Cigar Lake under the previous system was grandfathered and is also now deductible beginning in 2016. Based on the expected application of transitional and grandfathered capital allowance deductions, we anticipate that only the first tier of the profit royalty (10%) will apply in 2016 and 2017. As capital pools are depleted, we expect to also be subject to the top tier of the profit royalty (15%) in 2018. CAPITAL SPENDING We classify capital spending as sustaining, capacity replacement or growth. As a mining company, sustaining capital is the money we spend to keep our facilities running in their present state, which would follow a gradually decreasing production curve, while capacity replacement capital is spent to maintain current production levels at those operations. Growth capital is money we invest to generate incremental production, and for business development. Outlook for investing activities We expect total capital expenditures for uranium and fuel services to decrease by about 11% in 2016. Major sustaining, capacity replacement and growth expenditures in 2016 include: McArthur River/Key Lake - At McArthur River, the largest projects are the expansion of freeze capacity and mine development. Other projects include site facility and equipment purchases. At Key Lake, work will be done to expand capacity in the solvent extraction and crystallization circuits of the mill. US in situ recovery (ISR) - wellfield construction represents the largest portion of our expenditures in the US. Rabbit Lake - At Eagle Point, the largest component is mine development, along with mine equipment upgrades and purchases. At the mill, we plan to optimize tailings capacity and work on various mill facility and equipment replacements. Cigar Lake - Work to expand freezing capacity makes up the largest portion of capital at the Cigar Lake site. We are also paying our share of the costs to modify and expand the McClean Lake mill. We previously expected to spend between $350 million and $400 million in 2017. We now expect to spend between $300 million and $350 million in 2017. Due to the continued market uncertainty, we have reduced growth capital to focus on our tierone properties. This information regarding currently expected capital expenditures for future periods is forward-looking information, and is based upon the assumptions and subject to the material risks discussed on pages 21 and 22. Our actual capital expenditures for future periods may be significantly different. REVENUE, CASH FLOW AND EARNINGS SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS For 2016: An increase of $5 (US) per pound in each of the Ux spot price ($34.65 (US) per pound on February 1, 2016) and the Ux long-term price indicator ($44.00 (US) per pound on January 25, 2016) would change revenue by $72 million and net earnings by $56 million. Conversely, a decrease of $5 (US) per pound would decrease revenue by $69 million and net earnings by $54 million. A one cent change in the value of the Canadian dollar versus the US dollar would change adjusted net earnings by $8 million and cash flow by $1 million, with a decrease in the value of the Canadian dollar versus the US dollar having a positive impact. URANIUM SEGMENT OUTLOOK We expect to produce 30.0 million pounds in 2016 and have commitments under long-term contracts to purchase approximately 9 million pounds. Based on the contracts we have in place, and not including sales between our segments, we expect to deliver between 30 million and 32 million pounds of U3O8 in 2016. We expect the unit cost of sales to be up to 5% higher than in 2015, primarily due to the planned purchases during the year. If we make additional discretionary purchases in 2016 at a cost different than our other sources of supply, then we expect the overall unit cost of sales to be affected. We expect revenue to be up to 5% lower than in 2015 as a result of an expected decrease in deliveries, not including sales between our segments, partially offset by a higher average realized price. In our uranium and fuel services segments, our customers choose when in the year to receive deliveries. As a result, our quarterly delivery patterns and, therefore, our sales volumes and revenue can vary significantly as shown below. We expect the quarterly distribution of uranium deliveries in 2016 to be weighted to the second half of the year. However, not all delivery notices have been received to date and the expected delivery pattern could change. Typically, we receive notices six months in advance of the requested delivery date. PRICE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: URANIUM SEGMENT The following table is not a forecast of prices we expect to receive. The prices we actually realize will be different from the prices shown in the table. It is designed to indicate how the portfolio of long-term contracts we had in place on December 31, 2015 would respond to different spot prices. In other words, we would realize these prices only if the contract portfolio remained the same as it was on December 31, 2015, and none of the assumptions we list below change. We intend to update this table each quarter in our MD&A to reflect deliveries made and changes to our contract portfolio. As a result, we expect the table to change from quarter to quarter. FUEL SERVICES OUTLOOK In 2016, we plan to produce 8 million to 9 million kgU, and we expect sales volumes, not including intersegment sales, to be up to 5% lower than in 2015. Overall revenue is expected to increase by up to 5% as lower sales volumes will be more than offset by an increase in the average realized price. We expect the average unit cost of sales (including D&A) to increase by 10% to 15%; therefore, overall gross profit will decrease as a result. NUKEM OUTLOOK For 2016, NUKEM expects to deliver between 9 million and 10 million pounds of uranium. Total revenue and unit cost of sales, not including intersegment sales, is expected to increase by 5% to 10% compared to 2015; however, the overall gross profit percentage is expected to be slightly lower than 2015 at 4% to 5%. Non-IFRS measures ADJUSTED NET EARNINGS Adjusted net earnings are a measure that does not have a standardized meaning or a consistent basis of calculation under IFRS (non-IFRS measure). We use this measure as a more meaningful way to compare our financial performance from period to period. We believe that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, certain investors use this information to evaluate our performance. Adjusted net earnings are our net earnings attributable to equity holders, adjusted to better reflect the underlying financial performance for the reporting period. The adjusted earnings measure reflects the matching of the net benefits of our hedging program with the inflows of foreign currencies in the applicable reporting period, and adjusted for impairment charges, the write-off of assets, NUKEM inventory write-down, gain on interest in BPLP (after tax), and income taxes on adjustments. Adjusted net earnings are non-standard supplemental information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information prepared according to accounting standards. Other companies may calculate this measure differently, so you may not be able to make a direct comparison to similar measures presented by other companies. To facilitate a better understanding of these measures, the table below reconciles adjusted net earnings with our net earnings for the years ended 2015 and 2014, and three months ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. TRANSFER PRICING DISPUTES We have been reporting on our transfer pricing disputes with CRA since 2008, when it originated, and with the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) since the first quarter of 2015. Below, we discuss the general nature of transfer pricing disputes and, more specifically, the ongoing disputes we have. Transfer pricing is a complex area of tax law, and it is difficult to predict the outcome of cases like ours. However, tax authorities generally test two things: the governance (structure) of the corporate entities involved in the transactions the price at which goods and services are sold by one member of a corporate group to another We have a global customer base and we established a marketing and trading structure involving foreign subsidiaries, including Cameco Europe Limited (CEL), which entered into various intercompany arrangements, including purchase and sale agreements, as well as uranium purchase and sale agreements with third parties. Cameco and its subsidiaries made reasonable efforts to put arm's-length transfer pricing arrangements in place, and these arrangements expose the parties to the risks and rewards accruing to them under these contracts. The intercompany contract prices are generally comparable to those established in comparable contracts between arm's-length parties entered into at that time. For the years 2003 to 2010, CRA has shifted CEL's income (as recalculated by CRA) back to Canada and applied statutory tax rates, interest and instalment penalties, and, from 2007 to 2009, transfer pricing penalties. There has not yet been a decision regarding a transfer pricing penalty for 2010. The IRS also allocated a portion of CEL's income for the years 2009 through 2012 to the US, resulting in such income being taxed in multiple jurisdictions. Taxes of approximately $320 million for the 2003 - 2015 years have already been paid in a jurisdiction outside Canada and the US. Bilateral international tax treaties contain provisions that generally seek to prevent taxation of the same income in both countries. As such, in connection with these disputes, we are considering our options, including remedies under international tax treaties that would limit double taxation; however, there is a risk that we will not be successful in eliminating all potential double taxation. The expected income adjustments under our tax disputes are represented by the amounts claimed by CRA and IRS and are described below. CRA dispute Since 2008, CRA has disputed our corporate structure and the related transfer pricing methodology we used for certain intercompany uranium sale and purchase agreements. To the end of 2014, we received notices of reassessment for our 2003 through 2009 tax returns, and, in the fourth quarter of 2015, we received a notice of reassessment for our 2010 tax year. We have recorded a cumulative tax provision of $50 million (September 30, 2015 - $92 million), where an argument could be made that our transfer price may have fallen outside of an appropriate range of pricing in uranium contracts for the period from 2003 through 2015. We have reduced the provision to reflect management's revised estimate, which takes into account additional contract information. We are confident that we will be successful in our case and continue to believe the ultimate resolution of this matter will not be material to our financial position, results of operations and cash flows in the year(s) of resolution. For the years 2003 through 2010, CRA issued notices of reassessment for approximately $3.4 billion of additional income for Canadian tax purposes, which would result in a related tax expense of about $1.1 billion. CRA has also issued notices of reassessment for transfer pricing penalties for the years 2007 through 2009 in the amount of $229 million. The Canadian income tax rules include provisions that require larger companies like us to remit or otherwise secure 50% of the cash tax plus related interest and penalties at the time of reassessment. To date, under these provisions, after applying elective deductions, we have paid a net amount of $232 million cash. In addition, we have provided $332 million in letters of credit (LC) to secure 50% of the cash taxes and related interest amounts reassessed in 2015. Using the methodology we believe CRA will continue to apply, and including the $3.4 billion already reassessed, we expect to receive notices of reassessment for a total of approximately $7.0 billion of additional income taxable in Canada for the years 2003 through 2015, which would result in a related tax expense of approximately $2.1 billion. As well, CRA may continue to apply transfer pricing penalties to taxation years subsequent to 2009. As a result, we estimate that cash taxes and transfer pricing penalties for these years would be between $1.65 billion and $1.70 billion. In addition, we estimate there would be interest and instalment penalties applied that would be material to us. While in dispute, we would be responsible for remitting or otherwise providing security for 50% of the cash taxes and transfer pricing penalties (between $825 million and $850 million), plus related interest and instalment penalties assessed, which would be material to us. Under the Canadian federal and provincial tax rules, the amount required to be paid or secured each year will depend on the amount of income reassessed in that year and the availability of elective deductions and tax loss carryovers. Recently, the CRA decided to disallow the use of any loss carry-backs for any transfer pricing adjustment, starting with the 2008 tax year. This does not impact the anticipated income tax expense for a particular year, but does impact the timing of any required security or payment. As noted above, for the 2010 tax year, as an alternative to paying cash, we used letters of credit to satisfy our obligations related to the reassessed income tax and related interest amounts. We expect to be able to continue to provide security in the form of letters of credit to satisfy these requirements. The estimated amounts summarized in the table below reflect actual amounts paid or secured and estimated future amounts owing based on the actual and expected reassessments for the years 2003 through 2015, and include the expected timing adjustment for the inability to use any loss carry-backs starting in 2008. We will update this table annually to include the estimated impact of reassessments expected for completed years subsequent to 2015. In light of our view of the likely outcome of the case as described above, we expect to recover the amounts remitted, including the $564 million already paid or otherwise secured to date. We are expecting the trial for the 2003, 2005 and 2006 reassessments to commence during the week of September 26, 2016, with final arguments in April 2017. If this timing is adhered to, we expect to receive a Tax Court decision within six to 18 months after the trial is complete. IRS dispute In the fourth quarter of 2015, we received a Revenue Agents Report (RAR) from the IRS for the tax years 2010 to 2012. Similar to the 2009 RAR received in the first quarter of 2015, the IRS is challenging the transfer pricing used under certain intercompany transactions pertaining to the 2010 to 2012 tax years for certain of our US subsidiaries. The 2009 and 2010 to 2012 RARs list the adjustments proposed by the IRS and calculate the tax and any penalties owing based on the proposed adjustments. The current position of the IRS is that a portion of the non-US income reported under our corporate structure and taxed in nonUS jurisdictions should be recognized and taxed in the US on the basis that: the prices received by our US mining subsidiaries for the sale of uranium to CEL are too low the compensation earned by Cameco Inc., one of our US subsidiaries, is inadequate The proposed adjustments result in an increase in taxable income in the US of approximately $419 million (US) and a corresponding increased income tax expense of approximately $122 million (US) for the 2009 through 2012 taxation years, with interest being charged thereon. In addition, the IRS proposed cumulative penalties of approximately $8 million (US) in respect of the adjustment. We believe that the conclusions of the IRS in the RARs are incorrect and we are contesting them in an administrative appeal, during which we are not required to make any cash payments. Until this matter progresses further, we cannot provide an estimation of the likely timeline for a resolution of the dispute. We believe that the ultimate resolution of this matter will not be material to our financial position, results of operations and cash flows in the year(s) of resolution. Caution about forward-looking information relating to our CRA and IRS tax dispute This discussion of our expectations relating to our tax disputes with CRA and IRS and future tax reassessments by CRA and IRS is forwardlooking information that is based upon the assumptions and subject to the material risks discussed under the heading Caution about forwardlooking information beginning on page 21 and also on the more specific assumptions and risks listed below. Actual outcomes may vary significantly. Assumptions CRA will reassess us for the years 2011 through 2015 using a similar methodology as for the years 2003 through 2010, and the reassessments will be issued on the basis we expect we will be able to apply elective deductions and utilize letters of credit to the extent anticipated CRA will seek to impose transfer pricing penalties (in a manner consistent with penalties charged in the years 2007 through 2009) in addition to interest charges and instalment penalties we will be substantially successful in our dispute with CRA and the cumulative tax provision of $50 million to date will be adequate to satisfy any tax liability resulting from the outcome of the dispute to date IRS may propose adjustments for later years subsequent to 2012 we will be substantially successful in our dispute with IRS Material risks that could cause actual results to differ materially CRA reassesses us for years 2011 through 2015 using a different methodology than for years 2003 through 2010, or we are unable to utilize elective deductions or letters of credit to the extent anticipated, resulting in the required cash payments or security provided to CRA pending the outcome of the dispute being higher than expected the time lag for the reassessments for each year is different than we currently expect we are unsuccessful and the outcomes of our dispute with CRA and/or IRS result in significantly higher cash taxes, interest charges and penalties than the amount of our cumulative tax provision, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial position, results of operations and cash flows cash tax payable increases due to unanticipated adjustments by CRA or IRS not related to transfer pricing IRS proposes adjustments for years 2013 through 2015 using a different methodology than for 2009 through 2012 we are unable to effectively eliminate all double taxation FOURTH QUARTER Production volumes this quarter were 17% higher compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, mainly as a result of higher production from the rampup of Cigar Lake production, offset by lower production at McArthur River/Key Lake, Rabbit Lake and our US ISR operations. See Our operations starting on page 15 for more information. Uranium revenues were up 13% due to a 5% increase in sales volumes, which represents normal quarterly variance in our delivery schedule, and an 8% increase in the average realized price. Average spot and long-term prices decreased, as did our US dollar average realized price due to lower prices under fixedprice contracts, and the mix of market and fixed contracts. However, the effect of foreign exchange resulted in an 8% higher Canadian dollar average realized price than the prior year. In the fourth quarter of 2015, our realized foreign exchange rate was $1.32 compared to $1.12 in the prior year. Total cost of sales (including D&A) increased by 17% ($429 million compared to $366 million in 2014). This was the result of a 12% increase in the average unit cost of sales and a 5% increase in sales volumes. The unit cost of sales increased due to an increase in the volume of material purchased throughout the year at prices higher than our average cost of inventory and an increase in the unit production costs related to the addition of higher cost production from Cigar Lake during rampup. The net effect was a $17 million increase in gross profit for the quarter. FULL YEAR Production volumes in 2015 increased by 22% compared to 2014. Lower production at our US ISR operations was more than offset by the rampup of Cigar Lake production. See Our operations starting on page 15 for more information. Uranium revenues this year were up 5% compared to 2014 due to an increase of 10% in the Canadian dollar average realized price, partially offset by a decrease in sales volumes of 4%. The spot price for uranium averaged $36.55 (US) per pound in 2015, an increase of 10% compared to the 2014 average price of $33.21 (US) per pound; however, our US dollar average realized price was lower mainly due to lower prices under fixed price contracts. The effect of foreign exchange resulted in a higher Canadian dollar average realized price than in the prior year. The realized foreign exchange rate was $1.27 compared to $1.10 in 2014. Total cost of sales (including D&A) increased by 7% ($1.26 billion compared to $1.18 billion in 2014) due to higher unit cost of sales offset by lower sales volumes. The higher unit cost of sales was mainly the result of an increase in the volume of material purchased at prices higher than our average cost of inventory, and an increase in unit production costs related to the addition of higher costs from Cigar Lake during rampup. The net effect was a $6 million increase in gross profit for the year. The following table shows the costs of produced and purchased uranium incurred in the reporting periods (non-IFRS measures see below). These costs do not include selling costs such as royalties, transportation and commissions, nor do they reflect the impact of opening inventories on our reported cost of sales. Cash cost per pound, non-cash cost per pound and total cost per pound for produced and purchased uranium presented in the above table are non-IFRS measures. These measures do not have a standardized meaning or a consistent basis of calculation under IFRS. We use these measures in our assessment of the performance of our uranium business. We believe that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, certain investors use this information to evaluate our performance and ability to generate cash flow. These measures are non-standard supplemental information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared according to accounting standards. These measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under IFRS. Other companies may calculate these measures differently, so you may not be able to make a direct comparison to similar measures presented by other companies. To facilitate a better understanding of these measures, the following table presents a reconciliation of these measures to our unit cost of sales for the years ended 2015 and 2014 and three months ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 as reported in our financial statements. FOURTH QUARTER Total revenue decreased by 21% due to a 39% decrease in sales volumes, partially offset by a 29% increase in average realized price. The total cost of sales (including D&A) decreased by 28% ($78 million compared to $109 million in the fourth quarter of 2014) mainly due to a 39% decrease in sales volumes, partially offset by an increase of 16% in the average unit cost of sales, primarily as a result of the mix of products sold. The net effect was a $5 million increase in gross profit. FULL YEAR Total revenue increased by 4% due to a 19% increase in the realized price, partially offset by a 12% decrease in sales volumes. The total cost of products and services sold (including D&A) decreased by 4% compared to 2014 ($258 million compared to $268 million in 2014), as a 12% decrease in sales volumes was partially offset by a 9% increase in the average unit cost of sales (including D&A). When compared to 2014, the average unit cost of sales was 9% higher due to the mix of fuel services products sold. The net effect was a $23 million increase in gross profit. FOURTH QUARTER NUKEM delivered 3.7 million pounds of uranium, an increase of 0.3 million pounds compared to 2014. NUKEM revenues amounted to $192 million compared to $159 million in 2014 due to an increase in volumes delivered. Gross profit percentage was 3% in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to 2% in the fourth quarter of 2014. The net effect was a $3 million increase in gross profit. FULL YEAR During 2015, NUKEM delivered 10.7 million pounds of uranium, an increase of 2.6 million pounds compared to the previous year due to an increase in market activity. Revenues from NUKEM amounted to $554 million, 59% higher than in 2014 as a result of higher sales volumes and an increase in the average realized price, mainly due to weakening of the Canadian dollar. Gross profit percentage was 8% for 2015, compared to 6% for 2014. The net effect was a $20 million increase in gross profit. Production Outlook We remain focused on taking advantage of the long-term growth we see coming in our industry, while maintaining the ability to respond to market conditions as they evolve. Our strategy is to focus on our tier-one assets and profitably produce at a pace aligned with market signals in order to increase long-term shareholder value. We plan to: ensure continued safe, reliable, low-cost production from our tier-one assets - McArthur River/Key Lake, Cigar Lake and Inkai complete rampup of production at Cigar Lake seek to expand production at McArthur River/Key Lake in conjunction with market signals manage the rest of our sources of supply in a manner that retains the flexibility to respond to market signals and take advantage of value adding opportunities within our own portfolio and the uranium market maintain our low-cost advantage by focusing on execution and operational excellence MCARTHUR RIVER/KEY LAKE Production Production from McArthur River/Key Lake was 19.1 million pounds; our share was 13.3 million pounds. This was 3% lower than our forecast for the year due to unplanned maintenance outages to repair the calciner at Key Lake. Annual production was unchanged from 2014. Licensing and production capacity In 2015, the CNSC approved our application to increase McArthur River's licensed annual production to 25 million pounds (100% basis) to allow flexibility to match the approved Key Lake mill capacity. The licence conditions handbooks for these operations now allow both operations to produce up to 25 million pounds (100% basis) per year. Key Lake extension and McArthur River production expansion In support of our strategy to maintain the flexibility to respond to market conditions as they evolve, we continue to advance projects that are necessary to sustain and increase production when the market signals that additional production is needed. The Key Lake mill began operating in 1983 and we continue to upgrade circuits with new technology to simplify operations and improve environmental performance. The extension project involved increasing our tailings capacity and the mill's nominal annual production rate to closely follow production from the McArthur River mine. As part of the mill upgrades, we continue to construct and commission a new calciner circuit, and expect to begin operating with the new calciner in 2016. The existing calciner circuit will remain in place until operational reliability of the new calciner is achieved. The calciner replacement project was planned in a way that temporarily allows us to use either calciner, which will help to mitigate risks to our production rate during the commissioning phase. In order to increase production at Key Lake, we also need to optimize and expand the solvent extraction and crystallization circuits in the mill (projects planned for 2017). At McArthur River, we must continue to successfully transition into new mine areas through mine development and investment in support infrastructure. We plan to: improve our dewatering system and expand our water treatment capacity as required to mitigate capacity losses, should mine development increase background water volumes expand the concrete distribution systems and batch plant capacity New mining areas New mining zones and increased mine production requires increased freeze capacity and ventilation. In 2015, we continued to upgrade our electrical infrastructure on surface as part of our plan to address these future needs. We advanced groundworks to prepare for the next freeze plant, which is scheduled to begin freezing the south end of the orebody (zone 4) in 2017. We also made changes in shaft 2 to increase air flow, resulting in a 15% to 20% improvement in ventilation capacity. The improved ventilation eliminates the need for a new ventilation shaft to support a higher production rate. Tailings capacity We expect to have sufficient tailings capacity to mill all the known McArthur River mineral reserves and resources, should they be converted to reserves, with additional capacity to toll mill ore from other regional deposits. PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE AT MCARTHUR RIVER/KEY LAKE Production We plan to produce 20.0 million pounds in 2016; our share is 14.0 million pounds. Expansion progress As previously disclosed in our 2012 Technical Report, we plan to reach an annual capacity of 22 million pounds by 2018. The capital required to do so is shown in our 2016 capital spending plan, and in our outlook for investing activities in 2017 and 2018, beginning on page 6. As we increase to 22 million pounds per year, we will optimize the capacity of both the Key Lake mill and McArthur River mine with a view to further increasing production to 25 million pounds per year (100% basis), as market conditions improve. Using this approach, we do not expect significant additional growth capital will be required to increase from annual production of 22 million pounds to an annual rate of 25 million pounds. We expect that this paced approach will allow us to extract maximum value from the operation as the market transitions. Exploration In 2015, underground drilling further delineated the zone A mineral resources. Underground definition drilling of zone B will be conducted in 2016 and 2017 to provide the information required for engineering work to develop more detailed mining plans. CIGAR LAKE Production Total packaged production from Cigar Lake was 11.3 million pounds U3O8; our share was 5.7 million pounds. The operation exceeded our forecast of 10 million pounds (100% basis) as a result of higher productivity and our intention to adjust annual production as necessary, based on our operating experience during rampup. During the year, we: completed commissioning of the equipment required to operate three JBS units at a production scale brought on additional slurry haul trucks to ensure a sufficient quantity of ore slurry can be transported to the McClean Lake mill completed final commissioning of underground processing circuits and updated our production rampup plan based on commissioning experience modified mine and project plans to reflect our decision to exclusively freeze from surface declared commercial production Commercial production Commercial production signals a transition in the accounting treatment for costs incurred at the mine. Cigar Lake met all of the criteria for commercial production, including cycle time and process specifications, in the second quarter of 2015. Therefore, effective May 1, 2015, we began charging all production costs, including depreciation, to inventory and subsequently recognizing them in cost of sales as the product is sold. Underground development As a result of our decision to exclusively use surface freezing going forward, and the resulting change in the mine plan, the bulk of the development and freeze drilling required for mining in 2016 is already complete. We are continuing to plan for future expansion of surface freezing infrastructure in late 2016. McClean Lake mill update Additional estimated expenditures of $50 million (100% basis, our share $25 million) are expected to be required at the McClean Lake mill in 2016, primarily to complete upgrades in the tailings neutralization area in support of the continued rampup to full production of 18 million pounds per year. PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE AT CIGAR LAKE Production In 2016, we expect to produce 16.0 million packaged pounds at Cigar Lake; our share is 8.0 million pounds. In 2016, we also expect to: extend the current surface freeze pad and advance planning for freeze plant infrastructure expansion to support future production advance underground development according to the new mine plan and backfill drifts no longer required for underground freezing operations continue ramping up towards the planned full annual production rate of 18 million pounds (100% basis) in 2017 Exploration We are planning to conduct delineation drilling from surface to confirm and upgrade resources contained in the western portion of the deposit. Approximately 65,000 metres of diamond drilling is planned over a three-year period, starting in 2016, in order to complete a detailed geological and geotechnical interpretation, a resource estimate, and a technical study for the western portion of the deposit. Rampup schedule In 2017, we expect to reach full annual production of 18 million pounds (100% basis, 9 million pounds our share). The McClean Lake mill's operating licence currently has an annual production limit of 13 million pounds. AREVA has submitted an application to the CNSC to increase the mill's licensed annual production limit; our 2016 and 2017 production outlook for Cigar Lake is therefore subject to AREVA securing the regulatory approvals necessary to increase mill production. Labour relations The current collective agreement between AREVA and unionized employees at the McClean Lake operation expires in May 2016. There is risk to our 2016 and 2017 production outlook for Cigar Lake if AREVA is unable to reach an agreement and there is a labour dispute. INKAI Production Total production from Inkai was 5.8 million pounds; our share was 3.4 million pounds. Production was 17% higher than our production in 2014. During 2015, the subsoil use law in Kazakhstan was amended to allow producers to produce within 20% (above or below) their licensed capacity in a year. As a result, Inkai produced 5.8 million pounds in 2015, 11% higher than its licensed capacity. The increase in production was the result of a higher head grade and an increase in wellfield development efficiency compared to 2014. Project funding As of December 31, 2015, Inkai had fully repaid the outstanding loan under our agreement to fund its project development costs related to blocks 1 and 2. In 2015, Inkai paid the remaining $0.8 million (US) in interest on the loan and repaid $55 million (US) of principal. We are currently advancing funds for Inkai's work on block 3 and, as of December 31, 2015, the principal amounted to $148 million (US). Under the loan agreement, Inkai is to repay Cameco from the net sales proceeds from the sale of production from block 3. Production expansion In 2012, we entered into a binding memorandum of agreement (2012 MOA) with our joint venture partner, Kazatomprom, setting out a framework to: increase Inkai's annual production from blocks 1 and 2 to 10.4 million pounds (our share 5.2 million pounds) and sustain it at that level extend the term of Inkai's resource use contract through 2045 Kazatomprom is pursuing a strategic objective to develop uranium processing capacity in Kazakhstan to complement its leading uranium mining operations. Their primary focus is now on uranium refining, which is an intermediate step in the uranium conversion process. A Nuclear Co-operation Agreement between Canada and Kazakhstan is in place, providing the international framework necessary for applying to the two governments for the required licences and permits. We expect to pursue further expansion of production at Inkai at a pace measured to market opportunities. Discussions continue with Kazatomprom. Block 3 exploration In 2015, Inkai completed construction of the test leach facility and began pilot production from test wellfields, as well as advancing work on a preliminary appraisal of the mineral potential of block 3 according to Kazakhstan standards. Block 3 licence extension The block 3 test leach facility is now operational and state commissioning of the test wellfields was accomplished during 2015. Our application for an extension of the block 3 evaluation period is still pending final approval from the Ministry of Energy of the Republic of Kazakhstan. Inkai continues working on the final appraisal of the mineral potential of block 3 according to Kazakhstan standards. Although a number of extensions of the licence term have been granted by Kazakh regulatory authorities in the past, there is no assurance that a further extension will be granted. Without such extension, there is a risk we could lose our rights to block 3, and a risk we will not be compensated for the funds we advanced to Inkai to fund block 3 activities. PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE AT INKAI Production We expect total production from blocks 1 and 2 to be 5.2 million pounds in 2016; our share is 3.0 million pounds. We expect to maintain production at this level until the potential growth plans are finalized with Kazatomprom. Block 3 exploration In 2016, Inkai expects to continue with pilot production from the test leach facility and to continue working on a final appraisal of the mineral potential according to Kazakhstan standards. RABBIT LAKE Production Production this year was unchanged from our 2014 production as a result of planned timing of production stopes, coupled with slightly improved ore grades. Development and production continued at the Eagle Point mine. At the mill, we continued to improve the efficiency of the mill operation schedule. Temporary mining restrictions On December 17, 2015, we announced that underground mining activities at Eagle Point were being restricted due to a rock fall in an inactive area of the mine. As a precautionary measure, non-essential personnel were removed from the mine while the condition of the affected area was evaluated. Mine production was suspended, although milling of previously mined and transported ore continued through to year end. The assessment determined that repairs were necessary to support the ground in the affected area of the mine. The repairs were completed, along with some further assessment of stability in other areas of the mine. The mine was reopened and normal operations resumed on February 3, 2016. PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE AT RABBIT LAKE Production We expect to produce 3.6 million pounds in 2016. The decrease compared to 2015 is the result of the restriction of mining activities at the end of 2015, which extended into 2016. Tailings capacity Under our current licence, we expect to have sufficient tailings capacity to support milling of Eagle Point ore until about late 2017, based upon expected ore tonnage, milling rates and tailings properties. Our plan for fully utilizing the available tailings capacity of the Rabbit Lake In-Pit Tailings Management facility requires regulatory approval in 2016 for which we have submitted the required applications. With these regulatory approvals and after we complete the necessary work on the existing pit, we expect to then have sufficient tailings capacity to support milling of Eagle Point ore until at least 2021 based upon expected ore tonnage, milling rates, and tailings properties. Exploration We plan to continue our underground drilling reserve replacement program in areas of interest north and northeast of the current mine workings in 2016. The drilling will be carried out from underground locations. Reclamation As part of our multi-year site-wide reclamation plan, we spent over $0.7 million in 2015 to reclaim facilities that are no longer in use and plan to spend over $0.5 million in 2016. FUEL SERVICES 2015 UPDATE Production Fuel services produced 9.7 million kgU, 16% lower than 2014. This was a result of our decision to decrease production in response to weak market conditions and the termination of our toll milling agreement with SFL in 2014. Port Hope conversion facility cleanup and modernization (Vision in Motion) The Vision in Motion project is currently in the feasibility stage and will continue with the CNSC licensing process in 2016, which is required to advance the project. Labour relations Approximately 100 unionized employees at Cameco Fuel Manufacturing Inc.'s operations in Port Hope and Cobourg, Ontario accepted a new collective bargaining agreement in the second quarter of 2015. The employees, represented by the United Steelworkers local 14193 agreed to a three-year contract that includes a 7% wage increase over the term of the agreement. The previous contract expired on June 1, 2015. PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE AT FUEL SERVICES Production We have decreased our production target for 2016 to between 8 million and 9 million kgU in response to the continued weak market conditions. Labour relations The current collective bargaining agreement for our unionized employees at the Port Hope conversion facility expires on June 30, 2016. We will commence the bargaining process in early 2016. Regulatory The current operating licence for the Port Hope conversion facility expires in February 2017. The CNSC relicensing process will take place in 2016. Caution about forward-looking information This document includes statements and information about our expectations for the future.

royalty and stream company by both gold revenues and number of gold assets. The Company is gold-focused but also has the largest and most diversified portfolio of royalties and streams by commodity, geography, revenue type and stage of project. The portfolio is actively managed with the aim to maintain over 80% of revenue from precious metals (gold, silver & PGM). The Company does not operate mines, develop projects or conduct exploration. Franco-Nevada's business model is focused on managing and growing its portfolio of royalties and streams. The advantages of this business model are: Market Exposure to the gold price and exploration optionality; Limited exposure to many of the risks associated with operating companies; A free cash-flow business with limited cash calls; A high-margin business that can generate cash through the entire commodity cycle; A scalable and diversified business in which a large number of assets can be managed with a small stable overhead; A forward-looking business in which management focuses on growth opportunities rather than operational or development issues; and A perpetual discovery option over large areas of geologically prospective lands with no cost other than the initial investment. Franco-Nevada's financial results in the short-term are primarily tied to the price of commodities and the amount of production from its portfolio of producing assets. From time to time, financial results are also supplemented by acquisitions of new producing assets. Over the longer-term, results are impacted by the availability of exploration and development capital applied by other companies to advance Franco-Nevada's advanced and exploration assets into production. Franco-Nevada has a long-term focus in making its investments and recognizes it is in a cyclical industry. Franco-Nevada has historically operated by maintaining a strong balance sheet so that it can make investments during commodity cycle downturns. At year-end 2014, Franco-Nevada had $677.8 million in working capital and an undrawn $500.0 million unsecured credit facility. Franco-Nevada's shares are listed on the Toronto and New York stock exchanges under the symbol FNV. An investment in Franco-Nevada's shares is expected to provide investors with yield and more upside than gold ETF without exposure to operating cost inflation. Since its IPO over seven years ago, Franco-Nevada's share price has outperformed the gold price and all relevant gold equity benchmarks. Franco-Nevada Reports Q3 2015 Results and Declares Quarterly Dividend TORONTO, November 11, 2015 - Franco-Nevada Corporation (TSX: FNV; NYSE: FNV) today reported third quarter 2015 financial results realizing 85,637 Gold Equivalent Ounces (\"GEOs\")1 from its mineral assets and $7.8 million in revenue from its oil & gas assets. Net Income and Adjusted Net Income2 were $15.2 million, or $0.10 per share, and $19.4 million, or $0.12 per share, respectively, with Adjusted EBITDA3 being $78.0 million, or $0.50 per share. Prepared in accordance with IFRS and presented in U.S. dollars (unless otherwise noted). \"Franco-Nevada's diversified portfolio continues to perform well,\" said David Harquail, CEO. \"It is significant that these results are before any contributions from our $610 million Antamina silver stream investment which closed in October. We expect to begin recording revenues from the sale of ounces from Antamina in Q4 2015. Also, in November we began funding our gold and silver stream investment in the Cobre Panama project which we expect will be ramping up production in 2018. Franco-Nevada now has net debt of approximately $330 million, an undrawn credit facility of $270 million and remains well-positioned to continue to add to its portfolio.\" Revenues and GEOs by Asset Categories For the third quarter of 2015, revenue was earned 90% from precious metals (83% gold and 7% PGM) and 79% from the Americas (19% U.S., 23% Canada and 37% Latin America). Costs and expenses were impacted by higher depletion expense and costs of sales due to the Candelaria acquisition. Oil & gas production levels were stable with the associated oil & gas revenue decreasing significantly year over year due to lower average oil & gas prices in 2015. Cash provided by operating activities before changes to working capital was $72.4 million. Corporate Updates Antamina: On October 9, 2015, Franco-Nevada closed the previously announced Antamina silver stream with Teck Resources Limited by providing a $610.0 million upfront payment. The payment was funded through a combination of cash on hand and a partial draw of the Company's credit facility. Antamina is expected to contribute between 900,000 to 1,100,000 silver ounces (12,300 to 15,000 GEOs) in Q4 2015. Cobre Panama: Franco-Nevada and First Quantum finalized terms of a replacement precious metals stream agreement on the Cobre Panama project. On November 3, 2015, Franco-Nevada made a $337.9 million initial upfront payment under its $1.0 billion commitment which was funded through cash on hand and proceeds from a partial draw of its credit facility. Credit Facility: Franco-Nevada has entered into an agreement to increase its credit facility to $1.0 billion while maintaining a $250.0 million accordion and extending the maturity to November 2020. Closing is expected to occur prior to the end of November. Portfolio Updates Gold - U.S.: GEOs from U.S. gold assets increased to 14,618 GEOs mainly due to higher production at Goldstrike, Bald Mountain and Gold Quarry, partially offset by lower production at Marigold and fewer ounces under the Fire Creek/Midas fixed deliveries due to a reduction of the monthly ounce obligation in 2015 compared to 2014. Klondex Mines released an updated Mineral Resource estimate for its Midas Mine and Fire Creek project and announced positive drill results from recent underground and surface drilling at its Midas Mine. Gold - Canada: GEOs from Canadian assets decreased in the quarter due to lower production at Hemlo and Sudbury. In Ontario, Lake Shore Gold and Kirkland Lake Gold both announced positive drill results at their respective projects where Franco-Nevada holds various interests. Pretium Resources announced a $540 million construction financing package for its Brucejack project where Franco-Nevada has a 1.2% NSR. At the Phoenix gold project, where Franco-Nevada holds a 2% NSR, Rubicon Minerals announced the temporary suspension of underground activities while it reviews its geological model and develops an implementation plan Gold - Latin America: Candelaria had a strong quarter delivering 19,081 GEOs to Franco-Nevada. During the quarter, Lundin Mining released an updated mine plan for Candelaria which reflected a 26% increase in precious metal production over the next four years. Under the Guadalupe stream agreement, Franco-Nevada funded $4.0 million during the quarter and the final instalment of $8.0 million subsequent to the quarter. Gold - Rest of World: Contributions from Sabodala and Mine Waste Solutions represented approximately 60% of the total GEOs received from Rest of World gold assets for Q3 2015. True Gold announced the commencement of mining at its Karma project and remains on track for gold production at the end of Q1 2016. Franco-Nevada funded $10.4 million in the quarter and $9.7 million subsequent to the quarter under the Karma stream agreement bringing the total funded to $63.4 million. Perseus Mining announced it had signed a Mining Convention with the Ivorian government on its Sissingue project and expects to make a production decision in the fourth quarter of 2015. PGM: PGM GEOs were impacted by declining palladium and platinum prices relative to gold in the quarter. Oil & gas: Revenue from oil & gas assets was $7.8 million in Q3 2015 with similar production levels as Q3 2014. The decrease in revenue is the result of lower average oil & gas prices. On November 6, 2015, Franco-Nevada acquired an additional 0.29% working interest in the Weyburn Unit for C$6.2 million. Dividend Declaration Franco-Nevada is pleased to announce that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.21 per share. The dividend will be paid on December 17, 2015 to shareholders of record on December 3, 2015.

Goldcorp Delivers Strong Free Cash Flow as Third Quarter Gold Production Increases 42% October 29, 2015 (All amounts in $US unless stated otherwise) VANCOUVER, Oct. 29, 2015 /CNW/ - GOLDCORP INC. (TSX: G, NYSE: GG) today reported record third quarter gold production1 of 922,200 ounces, an increase of 42% compared to gold production of 651,700 ounces in the third quarter of 2014. Adjusted quarterly revenues1 were $1.3 billion. Adjusted operating cash flow1,2 was $374 million, compared to $399 million for the third quarter of 2014. Free cash flow3 was $243 million, compared to negative free cash flow of $355 million for the third quarter of 2014. The reported net loss attributable to shareholders of Goldcorp for the quarter was $192 million, or $0.23 per share, compared to a net loss of $44 million, or $0.05 per share, for the third quarter of 2014. The adjusted net loss1,4 was $37 million, or $0.04 per share, compared to adjusted net earnings of $70 million, or $0.09 per share, for the third quarter of 2014. Included in the adjusted net loss is a reduction in the carrying values of inventory stockpiles of $40 million, or $0.05 per share. Third Quarter 2015 Highlights Gold sales1 of 942,600 ounces; gold production of 922,200 ounces. Free cash flow of $243 million before dividends; $168 million after dividends. Revolving credit facility fully repaid. Adjusted revenues of $1.3 billion. All-in sustaining costs1,5 of $848 per ounce. Adjusted operating cash flow of $374 million. Adjusted net loss of $37 million, or $0.04 per share. 2015 production and cost guidance re-confirmed. Announced joint venture (50/50) with Teck Resources Limited (\"Teck\") to combine El Morro and Relincho projects into a single project. \"Our third quarter results highlight the essence of Goldcorp's investment proposition: growing gold production, declining all-in sustaining costs and decreasing capital spending resulting in strong, sustained free cash flow, despite lower metals prices,\" said Chuck Jeannes, Goldcorp President and Chief Executive Officer. \"Record quarterly gold production, successful cost containment efforts and the wind-down of a capital investment program that has brought two high-quality gold mines into commercial production this year contributed to quarterly free cash flow of $243 million. The benefit of managing a strong portfolio of mines was illustrated in the quarter as good results at Penasquito, Cerro Negro and Musselwhite more than offset lower-than-expected production from Eleonore as the mine continues to ramp up. As a result, we remain on track to meet the upper end of our production guidance of between 3.3 and 3.6 million ounces at all-in sustaining costs of between $850 and $900 per ounce. Our focus over the balance of 2015 and into 2016 is on vigilant management of our costs in the current gold price environment, successful replacement of mined gold reserves and the prudent allocation of free cash flow to fortify our already-strong balance sheet and fund the next wave of Goldcorp's promising organic growth opportunities.\" Financial Review Third quarter gold sales were 942,600 ounces at an average realized gold price of $1,114per ounce on production of 922,200 ounces, compared to sales of 641,400 ounces at an average realized gold price of $1,266 per ounce on production of 651,700 ounces for the third quarter of 2014. Silver production totaled 11.3 million ounces compared to 7.8 million ounces in the prior year's third quarter. All-in sustaining costs were $848 per ounce of gold for the third quarter of 2015 compared to $1,066 per ounce in the third quarter of 2014. Excluding non-cash inventory impairments at Los Filos and Penasquito, all-in sustaining costs for the third quarter of 2015 would have been $802 per ounce. Adjusted revenues for the third quarter totaled $1.3 billion. The reported net loss attributable to shareholders of Goldcorp for the third quarter was $192 million, or $0.23 per share, compared to a net loss of $44 million, or $0.05 per share, for the third quarter of 2014. Adjusted net loss for the third quarter totaled $37 million, or $0.04 per share, compared to adjusted net earnings of $70 million, or $0.09 per share, for the third quarter of 2014. The adjusted net loss for the third quarter of 2015 primarily excludes the unrealized losses from the foreign exchange translation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities ($158 million, or $0.19 per share). The adjusted net loss includes the impact of non-cash stock-based compensation expenses which amounted to approximately $14 million, or $0.02 per share, for the quarter. Adjusted operating cash flow for the third quarter was $374 million, compared to $399 million for the third quarter of 2014. Canada At Eleonore in Quebec, third quarter safe gold production totaled 86,700 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $974 per ounce. Production increased over the prior quarter as a result of the expansion of underground mining from two to four horizons, in addition to successful mine optimization initiatives. Stoping productivity and mining flexibility continued to improve, contributing to higher underground mine tonnage quarter over quarter. Throughput during the quarter averaged 6,500 tonnes per day. While recoveries in the third quarter were impacted by the presence of iron sulphides in certain production stopes, metallurgical studies are underway that are expected to minimize the effect on future recoveries. As previously reported on September 8, 2015, initial production stopes at Eleonore are encountering folding and faulting resulting in higher dilution and therefore lower than planned mined grades and gold production. The folding is of varying intensities and is estimated to affect approximately 10% of the overall Eleonore deposit. The Eleonore team continues to work on adjusting stope designs to minimize these impacts. Work on the Eleonore crown pillar pre-feasibility study continued to advance during the third quarter. Major activities included the successful completion of summer field work, underground and surface infrastructure and stope sequencing determination of the dike location, and permitting and stakeholder engagement efforts. The pre-feasibility study is on track to be completed by the end of 2015. Safe gold production at Red Lake in Ontario in the third quarter totaled 77,600 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $1,028 per ounce. Production decreased over the prior quarter as a result of lower grades from remnant pillar mining at the Campbell Complex, the acceleration of development in the Sulphide Zones and lower-than-expected grades in the Footwall Zone. An exploration drift to access the HG Young discovery at depth continued to advance north on the 14 Level at the Campbell Complex. The drift provides a new platform for follow-up drilling down plunge of positive intercepts from the ongoing surface exploration program at HG Young. At Cochenour, exploration drilling continued to assess the core area of the deposit as well as at the tram level, where there have been changes in the orientation of the veins from prior interpretations. Detailed interpretation and analysis is ongoing to support final mine planning and infrastructure. Processing of mill feed from the initial sill-development work was consistent with expectations. Work is ongoing to define the timing of initial stope production and ramp up of Cochenour feed for processing at Red Lake. At Porcupine in Ontario, safe gold production for the third quarter was 71,000 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $882 per ounce. Production decreased over the prior quarter due to lower gold grades, driven primarily by the mining of lower-grade stopes at the Hoyle Pond underground, partially offset by higher tonnage milled as a result of improved mill operations during the quarter. The Hoyle Deep project, which will enable efficient access to lower portions of the Hoyle Pond deposit, continued to progress and remains on track to be fully operational in the first quarter of 2016. At the Hollinger open pit, the environmental control berm was completed in mid-October, enabling mining to take place 24 hours a day. At the Borden project 160 kilometres west of Porcupine, studies are underway to determine the optimization of a combined Borden-Porcupine operation. Options to access the deposit from underground are currently being evaluated in preparation for permit applications. Surface diamond drilling continued during the third quarter with seven drills on site. The current exploration activity in this new gold district remains focused on in-fill drilling with a target to convert a portion of the resources into reserves at the end of 2015. Safe gold production at Musselwhite in Ontario increased over the prior quarter to 71,000 ounces as a result of higher mill throughput and increased grades. Musselwhite's all-in sustaining cost continued to be among the lowest in the portfolio at $697 per ounce. The focus of the exploration program during the third quarter was on reserve replacement. Drilling concluded late in the third quarter on the West Limb zone and the Upper Lynx zone with positive results showing continuity of mineralization in both areas. All critical exploration development for the year is complete. Latin America At Penasquito in Mexico, safe gold production totaled 236,800 ounces for the quarter at an all-in sustaining cost of $467 per ounce. Production was driven primarily by higher gold grades in sulphide as a result of positive model reconciliation. In light of continued strong performance, production at Penasquito will exceed 2015 guidance of between 700,000 and 750,000 ounces. Construction of the Northern Well Field (\"NWF\") remained suspended throughout the third quarter of 2015 due to an illegal blockade by a local community. Penasquito continues to seek a fair resolution of this matter with the community, while taking steps to enforce its contractual rights. Penasquito is also advancing alternatives for completion of the project without crossing through the affected community lands. Contingency planning is ongoing for fresh water supply to the Penasquito mine until the NWF project is operational. The Company believes that there will be timely resolution of this matter to meet the future water needs of Penasquito. The Metallurgical Enhancement Project (\"MEP\") feasibility study continued, which included completion of pilot testing, confirming capital estimates and concentrate marketing studies. The feasibility study remains on schedule to be completed in early 2016. At the Camino Rojo project, ongoing pre-feasibility study work is focused on the evaluation of Camino Rojo as a supplemental source of sulphide feed to the existing Penasquito facility, in addition to a smaller, stand-alone oxide heap leach facility. An update of the geologic model continued during the third quarter and metallurgical testing of sulphide, transition and oxide zones is ongoing. The pre-feasibility study is on track to be completed in 2016. Safe gold production at Los Filos in Mexico for the third quarter of 2015 totaled 70,300 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $1,442 per ounce. Increased production over the prior quarter was a result of higher ore processed. The 2015 exploration program to enhance deeper phases of the El Bermejal pit and extend high grade zones for underground mining was completed. A new life-of-mine plan is progressing with a focus to maximize return on investment in the current lower price metals environment and is expected to be completed by the end of 2015. At Cerro Negro in Argentina, third quarter safe gold production totaled 135,700 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $731 per ounce, driven by the continued strong ramp-up at both the Mariana Central and Eureka mines. Total tonnes milled increased resulting in an average throughput rate of 3,697 tonnes per day for the quarter. Average milling rates for September surpassed the nameplate capacity of 4,000 tonnes per operating day. Exploration in the third quarter continued to focus on surface resource confirmation drilling. The current drilling program is progressing as planned, expanding resources at the Marianas Complex, particularly at the newly-discovered Emilia vein. The Bajo Negro expansion was completed in the third quarter and the results will be included within the year-end resource update. On September 30, 2015, a work stoppage took place at Cerro Negro by miners represented by the Asociacion Obrera Minera Argentina, Province of Santa Cruz. All work activity resumed on October 5, 2015 following the declaration of a mandatory minimum 15-day conciliation period by the Santa Cruz Provincial Secretariat of Labour. Subsequent to the expiration of the conciliation period productive negotiations continue. The Company remains committed to working cooperatively with union representatives and government authorities on a fair and equitable resolution. At the Pueblo Viejo joint venture in the Dominican Republic, Goldcorp's share of third quarter safe gold and silver production totaled 115,000 ounces and 502,700 ounces, respectively, at an all-in sustaining cost of $585 per ounce. Gold production increased over the prior quarter as a result of higher tonnes processed, grades and recoveries. Silver production increased primarily due to higher recoveries. Tonnage processed was higher in the third quarter due to the prior quarter being impacted by autoclave and counter current decantation thickener maintenance. Silver recoveries were higher due to the shut-down of the lime boil tanks during autoclave maintenance in the prior quarter. At El Morro in Chile, an agreement was reached with Teck on August 27, 2015 to combine the El Morro and Relincho projects into a 50/50 joint venture. In addition, an agreement was reached with New Gold to acquire New Gold's 30% interest in the El Morro project for$90 million in cash upon closing, and a 4% gold stream on future gold production from the El Morro property. Closing of both transactions is expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2015. The project will undertake extensive engagement with communities and other stakeholders to help guide the project's development. In combination with community consultation, a pre-feasibility study is expected to commence in mid-2016. 2015 Guidance Outlook The Company today reconfirmed 2015 production guidance, expected to be at the upper-end of between 3.3 and 3.6 million gold ounces. All-in sustaining costs are expected to be between $850 and $900 per gold ounce; $500 and $550 per ounce on a by-product basis; and $625 to $675 per ounce on a co-product basis. Depreciation, depletion and amortization (\"DD&A\") will increase to $450 per gold ounce from the previous guidance of$425 per gold ounce due primarily to production coming from our newer and higher DD&A per ounce sites and additional assets placed in service earlier than anticipated. Capital spending guidance remains unchanged at between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion for 2015. Corporate administration expense guidance, excluding share-based compensation, is expected to be approximately $170 million in 2015. Excluding the impacts of foreign exchange on current and deferred tax assets and liabilities and excluding the dilution and disposition gains on the sale of mining interests and the related taxes, the Company continues to expect an annual effective tax rate on adjusted earnings subject to income tax of 45% in 2015.

Competitive Strengths Growth in copper, gold and zinc production with exploration upside Consistent performance from reliable operations Disciplined and clear growth strategy already being executed Strong financial position Experienced management and operating team Hudbay Releases Third Quarter 2015 Results TORONTO, ONTARIO -- (Marketwired) -- 11/05/15 -- HudBay Minerals Inc. (\"Hudbay\" or the \"company\") (TSX: HBM)(NYSE:HBM) today released its third quarter 2015 financial results. In the third quarter of 2015, operating cash flow before stream deposit and change in non-cash working capital increased to $79.9 million from $12.1 million in the third quarter of 2014. The net loss and loss per share in the third quarter of 2015 were $11.8 million and $0.05, respectively, compared to net earnings and earnings per share of$46.2 million and $0.21, respectively, in the third quarter of 2014. Net loss and loss per share in the third quarter of 2015 were affected by, among other things, the following items: Pre-tax loss ($ millions) After-tax loss ($ millions) Per share loss  Hudbay expects to achieve full year 2015 production and cost guidance for all of its operations. Financial and Operating Results Starting with its results for the period ended September 30, 2015, Hudbay has changed its reporting currency to US dollars; accordingly, amounts are in US dollars unless otherwise noted. All comparable figures have been restated in US dollars, as per Note 4 of the unaudited condensed interim financial statements. Operating cash flows before stream deposit and changes in non-cash working capital increased 559% to $79.9 million for the three months ending September 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was the result of significant growth in production and sales of most metals as the Constancia mine achieved commercial production at the end of April 2015. Metals production increases included 389% for copper, 329% for silver, 45% for gold and 7% for zinc, and cash cost per pound of copper produced, net of by-product credits, was $0.90. While operating cash flows benefitted from the significant increase in sales volumes and a low cash cost, these factors were partly offset by lower realized prices for all metals when compared to the prior year's quarter. However, net earnings decreased by $58.0 million. This change occurred primarily as a result of a $34.5 million impairment charge associated with equipment inherited from the acquisition of Augusta. In addition, in the third quarter of 2014, Hudbay recorded net gains of $56.2 million related to the Augusta acquisition. Financial Performance ($000s except per share and cash cost amounts) Three months ended September 30 Nine months ended September 30  Attributable to owners of the Company. Operating cash flow per share and cash cost per pound of copper produced, net of by-product credits are non-IFRS financial performance measures with no standardized definition under IFRS. For further information and a detailed reconciliation, please see page 4 of this news release. Metal reported in concentrate is prior to refining losses or deductions associated with smelter contract terms. During the third quarter of 2015, shipments of copper concentrate from the Constancia mine to the port in Matarani were principally constrained by truck driver availability, and truck turnaround time due to road refurbishment. Due to these issues and the rapid ramp up in production, concentrate on site increased to approximately 65,000 tonnes at quarter end. With a significant increase in trucking capacity in Peru since the middle of September, considerable progress has been made in moving the excess copper concentrate from the Constancia site to port. The majority of the excess inventory is expected to be sold during the fourth quarter. Since September 30, 2015, inventory levels at the Constancia mine site have declined by approximately 30%. As at September 30, 2015, Hudbay had total liquidity of approximately $300 million, including $114 million in cash and cash equivalents as well as commitments under its revolving credit facility. This does not include approximately $60 million in expected net cash flow from the sale of excess unsold copper concentrate inventory. Recent Developments As indicated, there was an impairment loss recognized of $34.5 million to reflect the orderly liquidation value of the previously purchased equipment and certain long lead equipment deposits in the Arizona business unit. This followed from the completion of a value engineering process in the second and third quarters of 2015, which deemed that certain equipment previously purchased or ordered by prior Augusta management is unsuitable to achieve the design objectives for Rosemont, and that different equipment will better meet Rosemont's objectives while observing permitting commitments. Although Hudbay's valuation assumptions in determining the Augusta purchase price allocation allowed for additional capital spending beyond Augusta's previous guidance, the purchase price allocation valued this equipment at cost based on the information available at the time. The collective agreements with each of the seven labour unions representing employees at Hudbay's Manitoba business unit expired on December 31, 2014. All seven unions have now ratified new three-year agreements that provide enhancements to wage rates, pensions and benefits. The labour disruption experienced in the second and third quarters ended in late August. On November 2, 2015, Hudbay completed the sale of Balmat Holding Corporation to Northern Zinc, LLC and Northern Zinc, LLC was concurrently acquired byStar Mountain Resources, Inc. (\"Star Mountain\"). On closing, Hudbay received 550,000 shares of Star Mountain common stock and $1 million in cash; Hudbay previously received $0.5 million in upfront deposit payments and is entitled to receive up to an additional $15.5 million in future cash payments or, at Star Mountain's election, $7 million in cash within three months of the closing date. Peru Operations Review During the third quarter of 2015, mining operations continued as planned and cost optimization is underway. Equipment availabilities are within design parameters and both loading and hauling efficiencies remain consistent with expectations. Optimization of plant performance remains the primary focus, as more is understood about varying ore types. During September, copper recoveries plateaued at 80% due to a greater presence of oxide minerals than previously anticipated in the upper sequence of the mine. However, metals production targets continue to be achieved as the reduced ore recovery has been offset by higher-than-expected copper grades and ore throughput. Monthly ore throughput increased from 2 million tonnes in July to 2.6 million tonnes in September. Commissioning of the molybdenum concentrate circuit has been delayed into the fourth quarter due to the availability of key reagents and due to ore characteristics. Metal production and combined operating costs per tonne at Constancia are expected to be within guidance ranges for 2015. Manitoba Operations Review For the third quarter of 2015, ore processed was relatively consistent compared to the same period of 2014. Compared to the same quarter of the prior year, gold, zinc and copper grades were 17%, 6% and 5% higher, respectively, and silver grades were 15% lower as a result of normal mine sequencing. Combined operating costs per tonne of ore processed in the third quarter of 2015 were 34% higher, compared to the same period in 2014, primarily due to increased commercial production at the Snow Lake operations, which have higher unit costs, as well as increased unit costs at the Flin Flon operations resulting from decreased production at the 777 mine. In the fourth quarter of 2015, Hudbay expects to realize sequential improvements in metals production and unit costs per tonne of ore processed as the 777 mine is beginning to benefit from the effects of its planned mine fleet renewal. Metal production and combined operating costs per tonne in Manitoba are expected to be within guidance ranges for 2015. Non-IFRS Financial Performance Measures Operating cash flow per share and cash cost per pound of copper produced are included in this news release because the company believes that, in the case of operating cash flow per share, it helps investors and management to evaluate changes in cash flow while taking into account changes in shares outstanding, and in the case of cash cost per pound of copper produced, it helps investors assess the performance the company's operations. These measures do not have a meaning prescribed by IFRS and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with IFRS and are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under IFRS. Other companies may calculate these measures differently. Operating Cash Flow per Share The following table presents Hudbay's calculation of operating cash flow per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014: ($000s except shares and per share amounts) Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30  Operating cash flow per share is before stream deposit and change in non-cash working capital. It is a non-IFRS financial performance measure with no standardized meaning under IFRS. Reconciliation of Cash Cost, After By-product Credits (non-IFRS) to Cost of Sales (IFRS) Cash cost per pound of copper produced (\"cash cost\") is a non-IFRS measure that management uses as a key performance indicator to assess the performance of the company's operations. Hudbay's calculation designates copper as its primary metal of production as it has been, and is expected to be, the largest component of revenues. Two changes have been made to the cash cost calculation beginning with reporting for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015. First, the basis of measurement has been changed from pounds of copper sold to pounds of copper produced. This change has been made to better align the costs of production with copper produced in the same period and reduce the variation in cash cost due to inventory sales timing. Second, royalties have been removed from the cash cost. This change increases consistency between Hudbay's cash cost calculation and industry peers. The calculation is presented in two manners: Cash cost, before by-product credits - This measure is gross of by-product revenues and is a function of the efforts and costs incurred to mine and process all ore mined. However, the measure divides this aggregate cost over only pounds of copper produced, Hudbay's primary metal of production. This measure is generally less volatile from period to period, as it is not affected by changes in the price received for by-product metals. It is, however, significantly affected by the relative mix of copper concentrate and finished zinc production, and an increase in production of zinc metal will tend to result in an increase in cash costs under this measure. Cash cost, net of by-product credits - In order to calculate the cost to produce and sell copper, the net of by-product credits measure subtracts the revenues realized from the sale of the metals other than copper. The by-product revenues from zinc, gold, silver, and molybdenum are significant and are integral to the economics of Hudbay's operations. The economics that support Hudbay's decision to produce and sell copper would be different if the company did not receive revenues from the other significant metals being extracted and processed. This measure provides management and investors with an indication of the minimum copper price consistent with positive operating cash flows and operating margins, assuming that realized by-product metal prices are consistent with those prevailing during the reporting period. It also serves as an important operating statistic that management and investors utilize to measure Hudbay's operating performance versus that of its competitors. However, it is important to understand that if by-product metal prices decline alongside copper prices, the cash cost net of by-product credits would increase, requiring a higher copper price than that reported to maintain positive cash flows and operating margins.

FEB 18, 2016 Lundin Mining Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results TORONTO, ONTARIO--(Marketwired - Feb. 18, 2016) - Lundin Mining Corporation (\"Lundin Mining\" or the \"Company\") (TSX:LUN)(OMX:LUMI) today reported positive cash flows of $107.1 million generated from operations in the quarter and $713.9 million for the year, not including the Company's attributable cash flows related to Tenke Fungurume, which aggregated to an additional $32.9 million in 2015. As a result of a significant decline of metal prices, a number of asset impairments were taken which result in a net loss attributable to Lundin shareholders of $377.7 million ($0.52 per share) for the quarter and $294.1 million ($0.41 per share) for the year ended December 31, 2015. Net loss for the quarter and the year included a non-cash, after-tax impairment charge of $278.0 million ($0.39 per share) as short-term metal prices negatively impacted estimated net recoverable values of our operating assets and exploration properties. Mr. Paul Conibear, President and CEO commented, \"For 2015 we are very pleased to have generated the highest cash flow in our Company's history. With all of our operations achieving or exceeding their annual production guidance and continuing to generate robust margins, the Company has been able to further improve its strong financial position despite the current commodity price environment. As we progress through 2016 and beyond, we intend to maintain our focus on consistent high performance of our operations, which are capable of providing positive margins at current metal prices, and disciplined capital investment, contributing to preservation of a healthy balance sheet.\"  Operating earnings is a non-GAAP measure defined as sales, less operating costs (excluding depreciation) and general and administrative costs. Net debt is a non-GAAP measure defined as cash and cash equivalents, less long-term debt and finance leases, before deferred financing fees. Highlights Operational Performance For 2015, all of the Company's operations met or performed better than guidance on production, but financial results were negatively impacted by a lower metal price environment. Aggregate capital spending was well below guidance as a result of proactive spending restraint measures adopted in stages to react to declining metal markets. Candelaria (80%): The Candelaria operations produced, on a 100% basis, 181,040 tonnes of copper, approximately 1,874,000 ounces of silver, and 102,500 ounces of gold in concentrate, with copper and gold production exceeding expectations as a result of higher throughput. Copper cash costs1 of $1.25/lb for the year were lower than full year guidance of $1.35/lb. Eagle (100%): Eagle's operational results were excellent, with both nickel (27,167 tonnes) and copper (24,331 tonnes) production exceeding guidance. Nickel cash costs of $2.02/lb for the year were in-line with guidance of $2.00/lb. Neves-Corvo (100%): Neves-Corvo produced 55,831 tonnes of copper and 61,921 tonnes of zinc for the year ended December 31, 2015. Copper production exceeded the prior year by 9% due to higher average copper head grades and recoveries. Zinc production fell short of the prior year comparable period resulting from lower mill throughput and lower zinc recoveries. Significant improvements were achieved in stabilizing the existing zinc plant resulting in improved recoveries in the fourth quarter. Copper cash costs of $1.63/lb for the year were in-line with our latest full-year guidance ($1.60/lb) and were lower than the prior year of $1.85/lb. Zinkgruvan (100%): Zinc production of 83,451 tonnes at Zinkgruvan was a new record, exceeding prior year production due primarily to record tonnages of ore mined and milled. Lead production of 34,120 tonnes exceeded both expectations and 2014 production. Cash costs for zinc of $0.37/lb were lower than guidance ($0.40/lb) and in-line with the prior year ($0.37/lb). Aguablanca (100%): Aguablanca met production expectations for the year, though current year production of 7,213 tonnes of nickel and 6,221 tonnes of copper were lower than the prior year due to cessation of open pit mining in the first quarter and the suspension of underground mining operations in the third quarter of 2015. Cash costs of $2.72/lb of nickel for 2015 were slightly higher than full year guidance ($2.60/lb) due to the lower by-product credits. Tenke (24%): Tenke operations continue to perform well. Lundin's attributable share of annual production included 48,951 tonnes of copper cathode and 3,843 tonnes of cobalt in hydroxide. The Company's attributable share of sales included 50,826 tonnes of copper at an average realized price of $2.42/lb and 3,809 tonnes of cobalt at an average realized price of $8.21/lb. Tenke operating cash costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $1.21/lb of copper sold, higher than the latest guidance due to lower cobalt by-product credits. Cash distributions received by Lundin Mining in the year from Tenke were $24.6 million, slightly higher than expectations. An additional $8.3 million was received from the Freeport Cobalt operations, for total Tenke related distributions to the Company of $32.9 million for the year. Cash cost/lb of copper, zinc and nickel are non-GAAP measures defined as all cash costs directly attributable to mining operations, less royalties and by-product credits. Financial Performance Operating earnings for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $712.1 million, an increase of $407.8 million in comparison to the $304.3 million reported in 2014. The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of operating results from Candelaria ($383.4 million) and Eagle ($100.1 million) and favourable foreign exchange rates in the EUR and SEK ($74.8 million), partially offset by lower realized metal prices and price adjustments ($173.9 million) from our European operations. Sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $1,701.9 million, an increase of $750.6 million in comparison to the $951.3 million reported in 2014. The increase was mainly due to the inclusion of a full year of operating results from Candelaria ($692.9 million) and Eagle ($236.7 million), partially offset by lower realized metal prices and price adjustments from our European operations. Average London Metal Exchange (\"LME\") metal prices for copper, nickel and zinc were lower (20%, 30%, and 11%, respectively) in comparison to 2014. Operating costs (excluding depreciation) for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $962.7 million, an increase of $343.0 million in comparison to the $619.7 million reported in 2014. The increase was largely due to the inclusion of a full year of operating results from Candelaria and Eagle of $309.5 million and $136.6 million, respectively, partially offset by favourable foreign exchange rates. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $555.0 million, an increase of $346.3 million in comparison to the $208.7 million reported in 2014. The increase was attributable to the inclusion of a full year of operating results from Candelaria and Eagle of $238.2 million and $122.3 million, respectively. Cash flow from operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $713.9 million, an increase of $526.5 million in comparison to the $187.4 million reported in 2014. The increase was attributable to: a full year of operating earnings from Candelaria, net of deferred revenue recognized ($336.5 million), and Eagle ($100.1 million); and changes in non-cash working capital and long-term inventory ($226.6 million); partly offset by lower operating earnings at our European operations ($74.8 million); and higher net income taxes paid ($49.3 million). Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $281.8 million, a decrease of $405.2 million in comparison to net earnings of $123.4 million reported in 2014. Net losses were primarily a result of asset impairments connected to lower metal prices, as cost and production performance at mine operations met or exceeded expectations. Before the impact of impairments (net of tax), net loss for the current year was $3.8 million, compared with net earnings of $155.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Net loss, before asset impairments, was impacted by: net loss at Neves-Corvo and lower net income at Zinkgruvan largely due to lower metal prices ($55.4 million); and net loss at Eagle generated from a full year of operation in a poor economic environment ($32.1 million) and write-down of deferred tax assets ($22.9 million); and lower operating earnings from Aguablanca ($22.0 million), partially due to the suspension of underground mining operations in the third quarter; and full year of interest expense associated with the senior secured notes ($62.8 million); and lower income from investment in Tenke ($63.4 million); partly offset by a full year of operations at Candelaria ($106.9 million). Corporate Highlights On June 2, 2015, the Company announced that exploration drilling near the Eagle Mine had intersected a new zone of high-grade massive and semi-massive nickel-copper sulphide mineralization. On July 23, 2015, the Company announced approval of its Environmental Impact Assessment (\"EIA\") for Candelaria 2030, an initiative which includes a number of enhancements to support current and future operations, primarily the construction of the Los Diques tailings storage facility which represents an important step in extending the life of mine of the Candelaria operation. On July 29, 2015, the Company announced the completion of an updated mine plan and annual sustaining capital cost estimate for Candelaria. The new plan is expected to result in an improved production and operating cost profile over the next four year period. On January 28, 2016, the Company advised local authorities and employees of its intention to permanently close the Aguablanca mine. The closure was originally scheduled for early 2018. The decision to close the Aguablanca mine was due to the significant and sustained decrease in nickel and copper prices. Financial Position and Financing Net debt position at December 31, 2015 was $441.3 million compared to $829.2 million at December 31, 2014. The $387.9 million decrease in net debt during the year was attributable to operating cash flows of $713.9 million and distributions from Tenke and Freeport Cobalt of $32.9 million, partially offset by investments in mineral properties, plant and equipment of $277.7 million and interest paid on the senior secured notes of $77.5 million. The Company has a revolving credit facility available for borrowing up to $350 million. As at December 31, 2015, the Company had no amount drawn on the credit facility. A letter of credit in the amount of $19.4 million (SEK 162 million) is outstanding. Net debt as of February 18, 2016 was approximately $458 million. Outlook Market Conditions The Company is advancing production optimizations, cost savings and cost deferrals that are expected to protect cash flows and profits in 2016 and which are reflected in the guidance outlined below. To the extent that base metals markets improve, spending restraint plans will be re-assessed as certain expenditures and deferrals would be reconsidered in a moderately stronger metal price environment. 2016 Production and Cost Guidance With the exception of Tenke, production and costs guidance remains unchanged from that provided on January 21, 2016 (see news release entitled \"Lundin Mining Announces 2015 Production Results and Provides Operating and Capital Guidance\"). Guidance on Tenke's copper production and cash costs have been updated to reflect the most recent guidance from Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (\"Freeport\").  Cash costs remain dependent upon exchange rates (forecast at EUR/USD:1.10, USD/SEK:8.50, USD/CLP:700) and metal prices (forecast at Cu: $2.05/lb, Ni: $4.15/lb, Zn: $0.70/lb, Pb: $0.70/lb, Au: $1,100/oz, Ag: $15.00/oz). Freeport has provided 2016 sales and cash costs guidance. Tenke's 2016 production is assumed to approximate sales guidance. Tenke's 2016 cash costs assume a cobalt price of $10.00/lb. Commentary on 2016 Production Guidance by Mine Candelaria: Attributable share of Candelaria production is expected to decline modestly from 2015 production levels, which benefited from better rock fragmentation and softer ore. Gold and silver production are expected to remain as significant by-product credits. Eagle: Consistent with original plans, year over year production levels of nickel and copper are expected to gradually decline as the highest grade ore is mined early in the mine plan. Neves-Corvo: Copper production is expected to be maintained above 50,000 tonnes per annum with a significant zinc by-product credit. The zinc expansion project has not been reflected in this outlook. Lead by-products are expected to increase as Lombador zinc ore is mined. Zinkgruvan: Planned expansion activities were initiated in 2015, but are not expected to impact production until the end of 2017. Tenke: Freeport expects 2016 copper cathode sales of 224,500 tonnes, an increase of about 10% over 2015 production. Cobalt sales are expected to remain relatively unchanged at 15,900 tonnes. 2016 Capital Expenditure Guidance Capital expenditures, excluding capitalized interest, are expected to be $220 million (excluding Tenke), lower than the $275 million of capital expenditures in 2015, as part of on-going efforts to defer or reduce non-essential spending as long as base metal prices remain low. Sustaining Capital: Americas: $130 million ($179 million in 2015), consisting of approximately $120 million for Candelaria, of which approximately $35 million is for capitalized stripping activities in the open pit, $70 million for construction of the expanded tailings storage facility project, and $15 million for replacement and rebuild of equipment and infrastructure, and $10 million for Eagle which is predominantly for underground development. Europe: $82 million ($86 million in 2015). Neves-Corvo's $55 million capital spending program includes approximately $20 million for underground development, $12 million for commencement of a water treatment plant, $10 million for replacement and rebuild of equipment and the balance for miscellaneous other sustaining capital investment and small projects. Zinkgruvan is expected to spend approximately $15 million for underground development and $12 million on expanded tailings storage and miscellaneous other sustaining capital investment and small projects. New Investment: $8 million ($10 million in 2015) for a processing plant expansion at Zinkgruvan. Exploration Investment The Company's exploration expenditures (not including Tenke) are expected to be in the range of $40 million in 2016 (2015 - $52 million). The majority of the planned activity is expected to be directed towards near mine targets at Candelaria and Eagle. Tenke The Company estimates its share of sustaining capital funding for 2016 at $25 million ($67 million in 2015). All of Tenke's capital expenditures and exploration programs are expected to be self-funded by cash flow from operations. At current metal prices, the Company believes it is reasonable to expect Lundin Mining's attributable cash distributions to range between $30 to $40 million in 2016, taking into account self-funding of capital and other expenditures such as exploration. Final decisions on capital investments and the amounts and timing of any cash distributions for 2016 are ultimately made by Freeport, the mine's operator.

Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc. (TSE: POT) Who we are PotashCorp is the world's largest fertilizer company by capacity, producing the three primary crop nutrients: potash (K), nitrogen (N) and phosphate (P). We are the world's leading potash producer by capacity and our Canadian operations represent nearly one-fifth of global capacity1. To enhance our global footprint, we also have investments in four potash-related businesses in South America, the Middle East and Asia. With operations and business interests in seven countries, PotashCorp is an international enterprise and plays an important role in helping the world grow the food it needs. What we produce Our potash, phosphate and nitrogen products help provide the primary nutrients that crops need. They are also used to make livestock feeds and industrial goods. Produced from mineral deposits (potash and phosphate) and from the air we breathe (nitrogen), our main products are: potash, in standard and granular grades DAP (diammonium phosphate), MAP (monoammonium phosphate) and phosphoric acid Ammonia and urea Why fertilizer? With world population rising, arable land per person diminishing and demand increasing for higher quality diets that include more fruits and vegetables and protein from crop-fed livestock, the need to maximize the efficiency of farmland has never been greater. Every crop harvested removes nutrients from the soil, which must be replaced to keep soil healthy and productive. Responsible for more than 40 percent of the world's total crop yield, fertilizers feed plants, which help to feed animals and people. Where we serve Our products serve customers throughout the global marketplace from China, the world's most populous nation and largest fertilizer consumer, to India, with its 1.2 billion people. From Latin America an agricultural superpower to the rice and oil palm producing fields of Other Asian countries and the breadbasket markets of North America. Together these five regions account for nearly three-quarters of the world's population and roughly 80 percent of the total fertilizer consumption. Delivering when we're needed As the world's food challenges become more pressing, we're taking an active role in meeting them, investing heavily in our assets to deliver quality product when and where our customers need it. We are adding to our current potash capacity without building a new mine - an advantage as demand is expected to rise. And through our partnerships and investments, we strive to better serve customers in emerging markets. How we do business We hold ourselves to the highest business standards and consider factors beyond financial performance when evaluating our success. Guided by our Core Values, we cultivate mutually beneficial relationships with our communities, customers, employees, investors and other people critical to our success. Acting with a long-term view, we make decisions that consider people and the planet, always looking for opportunities to improve. 28 January 2016 Q4 & Year-End: PotashCorp Reports Full-Year 2015 Earnings of $1.52 per Share Key Highlights Fourth-quarter earnings of $0.24 per share1; full-year total of $1.52 per share Annual cash provided by operating activities of $2.3 billion Indefinite suspension of Picadilly, New Brunswick potash operation in January 2016 Quarterly dividend reduced by 34 percent to $0.25 per share Full-year 2016 guidance of $0.90-$1.20 per share; $0.10-$0.20 for the first quarter CEO Commentary \"Weaker fertilizer prices late in the year reduced our earnings for the quarter, giving rise to a more cautious outlook for all three nutrients as we begin 2016,\" said PotashCorp President and Chief Executive Officer Jochen Tilk. \"Against this backdrop, our focus has been not only to navigate these challenges but to further strengthen our company for the future by: supporting our longstanding potash business model, including matching supply to demand; enhancing our best-in-class assets; and protecting our long-term financial health and flexibility. \"We made the very difficult decisions to suspend potash production in New Brunswick and realign our dividend. These actions are part of our thoughtful and holistic approach to strategically position the company and balance the interests of our shareholders, debtholders, employees and communities who depend on our enduring success. Longer term, we maintain our conviction that the drivers of fertilizer demand - rising global crop production and supportive farmer economics - will support improved market conditions.\" Saskatoon, Saskatchewan - Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc. (PotashCorp) reported fourth-quarter earnings of $0.24 per share ($201 million), bringing earnings for the full year to $1.52 per share ($1.3 billion). These totals for the quarter and full year trailed the $0.49 per share ($407 million) and $1.82 per share ($1.5 billion) earned in the same periods of 2014. Gross margin for the quarter ($386 million) and the year ($2.3 billion) was below 2014 levels ($746 million and $2.6 billion, respectively), due primarily to weaker nitrogen prices and lower potash volumes. Cash from operating activities of $623 million for the quarter and $2.3 billion for the year was below 2014 results by 13 percent and 11 percent, respectively. Quarterly and annual earnings before finance costs, income taxes and depreciation and amortization (EBITDA)2 of $482 million and $2.6 billion, respectively, were also lower than in the comparable periods of 2014. Investments in Arab Potash Company (APC) in Jordan, Israel Chemicals Ltd. (ICL) in Israel and Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile S.A. (SQM) in Chile contributed $27 million to our quarterly earnings, trailing the $31 million generated in the fourth quarter of 2014. Our earnings for the year from these three investments - plus a dividend from Sinofert Holdings Limited (Sinofert) in China - totaled $162 million, below the $210 million earned in 2014, which included a special dividend from ICL. The market value of our investments in these four publicly traded companies was approximately $3.5 billion, or $4 per PotashCorp share, at market close on January 27, 2016. Market Conditions Challenging conditions, including currency weakness relative to the US dollar in emerging markets, continued to weigh on fertilizer markets through the fourth quarter. Cautious buying patterns resulted in deteriorating prices across all three nutrients as the year ended. Global potash shipments for the fourth quarter remained relatively flat compared to 2014, with increased deliveries to China offsetting slightly weaker demand in most other markets. Nitrogen markets continued to feel the effects of falling energy prices. Lower production costs in key producing regions increased competitive supply, which - combined with a weaker-than-normal fall application season in the US and slower demand in Brazil - caused prices for nearly all nitrogen products to trend lower during the quarter. In phosphate, record Chinese exports, seasonally slow demand in India and the US and continued caution in Brazil weighed on prices for solid fertilizers. Prices for feed, industrial, and liquid fertilizer products were more resilient, supported by strong demand and tighter supply. Potash Reduced sales volumes and a softening price environment - particularly in the second half of 2015 - resulted in gross margin of $183 million for the quarter and $1.3 billion for the year, below 2014's comparative totals of $445 million and $1.4 billion, respectively. Sales volumes for both the quarter (down 31 percent) and the year (down 6 percent) trailed those achieved in the same periods of 2014. The most significant decline for both the quarter and full year was in North America, which reflected a pullback in demand from 2014's especially strong levels, as well as increased competition. Offshore, the majority of Canpotex's3 shipments for the quarter were to China (40 percent) and Other Asian markets outside of China and India (30 percent), while Latin America and India accounted for 18 percent and 4 percent, respectively. Our average realized potash price for the quarter was $238 per tonne, down considerably from $284 per tonne in the same period last year, reflecting the declining price environment in 2015. Inventory-related shutdowns at our Saskatchewan mines and the closure of our Penobsquis, New Brunswick operation reduced production volumes and resulted in per-tonne cost of goods sold for the quarter of $132, which was 26 percent higher than in the comparable period in 2014. For the year, per-tonne cost of goods sold of $111 was relatively flat with the previous year as the favorable impact of a weaker Canadian dollar was offset primarily by increased shutdown weeks. Nitrogen In nitrogen, weaker prices had a negative impact on our results for the fourth quarter and the full year. Gross margin of $142 million for the quarter and $706 million for the year trailed results from the same periods in 2014 by 39 percent and 30 percent, respectively. Our US operations accounted for 61 percent of our nitrogen gross margin for the quarter, with Trinidad providing the remainder. Sales volumes of 1.6 million tonnes for the quarter were similar to those in the same period of 2014. Extended expansion-related downtime, coupled with weaker demand, resulted in sales volumes for 2015 of 5.9 million tonnes, down 7 percent from the previous year. Our average realized price of $288 per tonne during the quarter was down significantly from the $405 per tonne achieved in the same period last year as lower energy costs and increased global supply weighed heavily on prices for all nitrogen products. Cost of goods sold for the fourth quarter was $199 per tonne, down 21 percent from 2014, driven largely by lower natural gas costs in the US and Trinidad. Phosphate Gross margin for the quarter totaled $61 million, down slightly from the $67 million earned during the same period last year, due to lower sales volumes and price realizations. For the year, we generated $241 million, up from the $202 million earned in 2014, primarily due to increased prices for liquid fertilizers. For the quarter, sales volumes of 0.8 million tonnes were relatively flat compared to the same period in 2014, while volumes for the year of 2.9 million tonnes trailed 2014, due primarily to the absence of production from the Suwannee River chemical plant. Our average realized phosphate price for the fourth quarter of $522 per tonne was similar to 2014's as improved prices for liquid fertilizers offset declining prices for DAP and MAP. Per-tonne cost of goods sold was $443 for the quarter, similar to last year. Financial Provincial mining and other taxes of $46 million for the quarter were lower than the $82 million in the same period last year, due to weaker potash earnings. For the year, provincial mining and other taxes totaled $310 million, 21 percent more than in 2014 because of a weaker Canadian dollar and changes in the timing of allowable deductions within Saskatchewan's potash taxation regulations. Income tax expense for the fourth quarter ($69 million) and full year ($451 million) was down from the same periods last year due primarily to lower earnings. Potash Market Outlook We expect global potash shipments in the range of 59-62 million tonnes, in line with 2015's total of approximately 60 million tonnes. In North America, lower dealer inventories and significant nutrient requirements following consecutive years of large crops are expected to support growth of potash shipments in 2016 to a range of 9.2-9.7 million tonnes In Latin America, we expect agronomic need and favorable crop economics to keep demand at elevated levels, although credit availability and currency weakness are anticipated to keep growth in this market relatively modest. For the full year, we forecast shipments of 10.8-11.3 million tonnes, slightly above 2015 levels. In China, elevated inventories are likely to keep demand below 2015's record of more than 15.0 million tonnes. We anticipate shipments in the range of 13.5-14.5 million tonnes, with strong consumption trends for bulk blends and compound fertilizers continuing. Demand in India is expected to strengthen in 2016. We forecast deliveries of 4.2-4.7 million tonnes to this market, a slight increase from 2015 when a weak monsoon and currency issues reduced demand late in the year. In Other Asian markets, supportive crop economics and substantial agronomic need are expected to keep demand fairly robust in 2016. We anticipate deliveries in the range of 8.5-8.8 million tonnes, slightly above 2015 levels. Financial Outlook Based on these market factors, we anticipate our 2016 potash sales volumes will be in the range of 8.3-9.1 million tonnes. For the year, we forecast potash gross margin of $0.8-$1.1 billion, down significantly from 2015 as the sharp decline in potash prices through the second half of that year is expected to weigh on margins in 2016. Our guidance reflects the suspension of our Picadilly potash operations announced in mid-January, including favorable impacts on our cost of goods sold of $40-$50 million and reduced capital expenditures of $50 million. The company has concluded that the announced change will not result in any impairment charges although our guidance does reflect approximately $35 million in severance and transition costs expected to be recorded in the first quarter of 2016. In nitrogen, we expect improved operating rates at our US facilities and our recently completed Lima nitrogen expansion to increase our sales volumes in 2016. Despite higher sales volumes and reduced costs from lower natural gas prices, a weaker pricing environment - driven by an increase in competitive supply - is expected to result in considerably lower gross margin. In phosphate, we anticipate weaker market fundamentals will keep prices for most products below 2015 levels, although our historically more stable feed and industrial products are forecast to be less impacted. We expect lower input costs and our focus on improved reliability will reduce costs and increase the amount of product available for sale, which we anticipate will help keep gross margin at a level similar to 2015. Given these considerations, we forecast combined nitrogen and phosphate gross margin will be in the range of $0.7-$0.9 billion in 2016. We estimate provincial mining and other taxes in the range of 22-24 percent of potash gross margin, similar to the 2015 percentage. Based on these factors, we forecast full-year 2016 earnings of $0.90-$1.20 per share, including first-quarter earnings of $0.10-$0.20 per share. Our quarterly guidance reflects the severance and transition charges related to the suspension of production at Picadilly and an expectation of some potash demand being deferred to the second quarter. Other annual guidance numbers - including those noted above - are outlined in the table below. 2016 Guidance  Dividend Our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend of US $0.25 per share payable May 3, 2016 to shareholders of record April 12, 2016. \"We are committed to preserving a strong balance sheet and investment-grade credit rating, but also believe in retaining a competitive dividend. In consideration of these objectives, we have decided to reduce our quarterly dividend by 34 percent,\" said Tilk. \"We believe this level - representing a payout ratio of close to 100 percent of 2016 earnings - remains highly competitive and balances the interests of our many stakeholders, including equity and debtholders.\" Notes All references to per-share amounts pertain to diluted net income per share.

ANOTHER RECORD QUARTER OF SILVER EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION AND SALES VOLUME FOR SILVER WHEATON IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2015 11/03/2015 VANCOUVER, Nov. 3, 2015 /CNW/ - Silver Wheaton Corp. (\"Silver Wheaton\" or the \"Company\") (TSX: SLW) (NYSE:SLW) is pleased to announce its unaudited results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2015. All figures are presented in United States dollars unless otherwise noted. Silver Wheaton achieved record production for a third quarter in a row and record sales volume for a second quarter in a row, driven by record production at Salobo and Penasquito and record sales volume at San Dimas. In addition, the ramp-up of production at Salobo and Constancia continue to progress as expected. THIRD QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS Record attributable silver equivalent production in Q3 2015 of 11.0 million ounces (6.9 million ounces of silver and 54,500 ounces of gold), compared with 8.9 million ounces in Q3 2014, representing an increase of 24%. Record silver equivalent sales volume in Q3 2015 of 10.2 million ounces (6.6 million ounces of silver and 48,100 ounces of gold), compared with 8.7 million ounces in Q3 2014, representing an increase of 17%. During the three month period ending September 30, 2015, payable silver equivalent ounces attributable to the Company produced but not yet delivered decreased by 0.1 million ounces to approximately 6.3 million ounces. Revenues of $153.3 million in Q3 2015 compared with $165.9 million in Q3 2014, representing a decrease of 8%. Average realized sale price per silver equivalent ounce sold in Q3 2015 of $15.03 ($15.05 per ounce of silver and $1,130 per ounce of gold), compared with $18.98 in Q3 2014, representing a decrease of 21%. Adjusted net earnings1 of $49.8 million ($0.12 per share) in Q3 2015 compared with $72.6 million ($0.20 per share) in Q3 2014, representing a decrease of 31%. During the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $154.0 million related to its 777 silver and gold interest. After including the after tax impact of the impairment charge, net loss of $95.9 million ($0.24 per share) in Q3 2015 compared with net earnings of $4.5 million ($0.01 per share) in Q3 2014.1 Operating cash flows of $99.5 million ($0.25 per share1) in Q3 2015 compared with $120.4 million ($0.34 per share1) in Q3 2014, representing a decrease of 17%. Cash operating margin1 in Q3 2015 of $10.45 per silver equivalent ounce compared with $14.39 in Q3 2014, representing a decrease of 27%. Average cash costs1 in Q3 2015 were $4.26 and $389 per ounce of silver and gold, respectively. On a silver equivalent basis, average cash costs1 decreased to $4.58 compared with $4.59 in Q3 2014. Declared quarterly dividend of $0.05 per common share. On September 18, 2015, the Company announced that it had received TSX approval for a normal course issuer bid (\"NCIB\") of up to 5% of the Company's outstanding Common Shares. To date, the Company has purchased 764,789 shares under the NCIB. On September 24, 2015, the Company announced that it had received Notices of Reassessment from the Canada Revenue Agency (the \"CRA\") for the 2005 to 2010 taxation years (the \"Relevant Taxation Years\"). Subsequent to the quarter, Silver Wheaton filed notices of objection for each of the Relevant Taxation Years. Asset Highlights Salobo had record attributable production of almost 33,000 ounces of gold net to Silver Wheaton in Q3, and the ongoing ramp-up continues to be on track to achieve 100% utilization in Q4 2015. Record attributable production from Penasquito. Record sale volume from San Dimas. Events Subsequent to the Quarter Silver Wheaton agreed to acquire from a subsidiary of Glencore Plc (\"Glencore\") an amount of silver equal to 33.75% of the silver production until delivery of 140 million ounces of silver and 22.5% of the silver production thereafter for the life of mine from the Antamina mine for an upfront cash consideration of US$900 million and ongoing payments of 20% of spot price per silver ounce delivered. \"Silver Wheaton hit record production for a third consecutive quarter, as the company produced 11 million silver equivalent ounces in the third quarter alone. Our cornerstone assets delivered solid results with Penasquito and Salobo setting new production records. With over 32 million ounces produced year to date, we remain well on track to deliver on our original production growth guidance of over 20% in 2015,\" said Randy Smallwood, President and Chief Executive Officer of Silver Wheaton. \"Clearly, not everything has been smooth sailing, as we have also faced persistently low commodity prices, along with the receipt of the Notices of Reassessment from the CRA. I once again want to reiterate our confidence in our structure and that we will vigorously defend our tax filing position; as such, we have filed notices of objections with the CRA in regards to the Reassessments.\" \"While our cornerstone operations have performed exceptionally well, we did take an impairment charge on 777 in the third quarter due to lack of exploration success combined with lower commodity prices. While the low commodity price environment has had its challenges, it has also created some great opportunities. This is clearly evidenced by the announcement of our acquisition of a silver stream on Antamina, one of the lowest cost, largest copper mines in the world. Antamina is an ideal asset for Silver Wheaton, one that readily fits in to our portfolio of top tier assets.\" Financial Review Revenues Revenue was $153.3 million in the third quarter of 2015, on silver equivalent sales of 10.2 million ounces (6.6 million ounces of silver and 48,100 ounces of gold). This represents an 8% decrease from the $165.9 million of revenue generated in the third quarter of 2014 due primarily to a 21% decrease in the average realized silver equivalent price ($15.03 in Q3 2015 compared with $18.98 in Q3 2014), partially offset by a 17% increase in the number of silver equivalent ounces sold. Costs and Expenses Average cash costs1 in the third quarter of 2015 were $4.58 per silver equivalent ounce as compared with $4.59 during the comparable period of 2014. This resulted in a cash operating margin1 of $10.45 per silver equivalent ounce, a reduction of 27% as compared with Q3 2014. The decrease in the cash operating margin was primarily due to a 21% decrease in the average realized silver equivalent price in Q3 2015 compared with Q3 2014. Earnings and Operating Cash Flows Adjusted net earnings1 and cash flow from operations in the third quarter of 2015 were $49.8 million ($0.12 per share) and $99.5 million ($0.25 per share1), compared with $72.6 million ($0.20 per share) and $120.4 million ($0.34 per share1) for the same period in 2014, a decrease of 31% and 17%, respectively. Earnings and cash flow continued to be impacted by lower gold and silver prices. Balance Sheet At September 30, 2015, the Company had approximately $81 million of cash on hand and $647 million outstanding under the Company's $2 billionrevolving term loan. On September 18, 2015 the Company announced it had received TSX approval to purchase up to 20,229,671 common shares (representing 5% of the Company's 404,593,425 total issued and outstanding common shares as of September 11, 2015) over a period of twelve months commencing onSeptember 23, 2015. The NCIB will expire no later than September 22, 2016. During the three months ended September 30, 2015 the Company purchased 119,400 shares under the NCIB at an average price of $12.26 per share. Subsequent to September 30, 2015, the Company purchased an additional 645,389 shares under the NCIB at an average price of $11.86 per share. Asset Impairment On August 8, 2012, the Company entered into an agreement with Hudbay Minerals Inc. (\"Hudbay\") to acquire an amount equal to 100% of the silver and gold production from its currently producing 777 mine, located in Canada, until the end of 2016, and 100% of the silver and 50% of the gold production for the remainder of the mine life. During the third quarter of 2015, the Company's management was informed that as a result of an unsuccessful drilling program at 777, Hudbay's management believes that the mine life for 777 is unlikely to be extended beyond 2020. As a result, during the third quarter of 2015, the estimate of future production from 777 was reduced, with this reduction representing an indicator of impairment related to the 777 silver and gold interests. At September 30, 2015, Silver Wheaton's management estimated that the recoverable amount under the 777 silver and gold interests was$147.5 million, representing its fair value less cost to sell and resulting in an impairment charge of $154.0 million. CRA Audit Update On July 6, 2015, the Company announced that it had received a proposal letter (the \"Proposal\") from the CRA in which the CRA was proposing to reassess Silver Wheaton under the transfer pricing provisions contained in the Income Tax Act (Canada) (the \"Act\"). Subsequent to the issuance of the Proposal, on September 24, 2015, the Company announced that it had received Notices of Reassessment (the \"Reassessments\") from the CRA for the 2005 to 2010 taxation years (the \"Relevant Taxation Years\"). The Reassessments are consistent with the Proposal and seek to increase the Company's income subject to tax in Canada for the Relevant Taxation Years by approximately Cdn$715.3 million which would result in federal and provincial tax of approximately Cdn$201.3 million. In addition, the CRA is seeking to impose transfer pricing penalties of approximately Cdn$71.5 million and interest and other penalties of Cdn$80.6 million for the Relevant Taxation Years. Total tax, interest and penalties sought by the CRA for the Relevant Taxation Years isCdn$353.4 million. The CRA's position in the Reassessments is that the transfer pricing provisions of the Act relating to income earned by the Company's foreign subsidiaries outside of Canada should apply such that the income of Silver Wheaton subject to tax in Canada should be increased by substantially all of the income of the Company's foreign subsidiaries. Management believes that the Company has filed its tax returns and paid applicable taxes in compliance with Canadian tax law, and as a result no amounts have been recorded for any potential liability arising from this matter. Silver Wheaton intends to vigorously defend its tax filing positions. As such, subsequent to September 30, 2015, Silver Wheaton has filed notices of objection for each of the Relevant Taxation Years. The Company will be required to make a deposit of Cdn$176.7 million representing 50% of the reassessed amounts of tax, interest and penalties. Silver Wheaton will seek to post security in the form of a letter of credit for this amount as opposed to a cash deposit. Cash that has been deposited in respect of a reassessment will be refunded, plus interest, if the Company is ultimately successful in challenging that reassessment. Events Subsequent to the Quarter Antamina Subsequent to the quarter, Silver Wheaton, through its wholly owned subsidiary Silver Wheaton (Caymans) Ltd. (\"SWC\"), has agreed to acquire fromAnani Investments Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Glencore plc (\"Glencore\") an amount of silver equal to 33.75% of the silver production until delivery of 140 million ounces of silver and 22.5% of silver production thereafter for the life of mine silver production from the Antamina mine, located in Peru. SWC will pay Glencore cash consideration of US$900 million for the silver stream. In addition, SWC will make ongoing payments of 20% of spot price per silver ounce delivered. The silver stream is effective September 30, 2015, and as a result, production and sales attributable to Silver Wheaton are forecast for the fourth quarter of 2015. Silver production is expected to average 4.7 million ounces per year over the first 20 years. Closing of the transaction is expected to occur prior to the end of November 2015 and is subject to the completion of certain corporate matters and customary conditions. (See Silver Wheaton's November 3, 2015 news release for full details.) Third Quarter Asset Highlights During the third quarter of 2015, attributable silver equivalent production was 11.0 million ounces (6.9 million ounces of silver and 54,500 ounces of gold), representing an increase of 24% compared with the third quarter of 2014. Operational highlights for the quarter ended September 30, 2015, are as follows: Salobo In the third quarter of 2015, Salobo produced a record 32,954 ounces of gold attributable to Silver Wheaton, an increase of approximately 216% relative to the third quarter of 2014. This increase was primarily due to the doubling of the percentage of gold that Silver Wheaton is entitled to and the increased throughput as a result of the expansion to 24 million tonnes per annum, which commenced production in mid-2014. According to Vale's third quarter of 2015 production report, the ramp-up of Salobo was weaker than expected in July and August but recovered in September with capacity utilization exceeding 90%. Salobo is expected to achieve 100% capacity utilization in the fourth quarter. Constancia In the third quarter of 2015, Constancia produced approximately 4,341 ounces of gold and 0.7 million ounces of silver attributable to Silver Wheaton as the mine declared commercial production on April 30, 2015, and it continues to ramp-up as expected. Penasquito In the third quarter of 2015, Penasquito produced a record 2.1 million ounces of silver attributable to Silver Wheaton, an increase of approximately 28% relative to the third quarter of 2014 due to higher grades being mined as substantial mining took place in the heart of the deposit. As disclosed inGoldcorp Inc.'s (\"Goldcorp\") third quarter of 2015 MD&A, construction of the Northern Well Field project remained suspended throughout the third quarter of 2015 due to an illegal blockade by a local community. Penasquito continues to seek a fair resolution of this matter with the community, while taking steps to enforce its contractual rights. Penasquito is also advancing alternatives for completion of the project without crossing through the affected community lands. Goldcorp believes that there will be timely resolution of this matter to meet the future water needs of Penasquito. The Metallurgical Enhancement Project feasibility study remains on schedule to be completed in early 2016. San Dimas In the third quarter of 2015, attributable production from San Dimas was 1.4 million ounces of silver, an increase of approximately 22% relative to the third quarter of 2014.2 This growth was primarily due to increased production as a result of the expansion to 2,500 tonnes per day (tpd), which was completed early in 2014, as well as to the sharing threshold increasing to 6 million ounces3, partially offset by the cessation of Goldcorp's four-year obligation to deliver 1.5 million ounces of silver to the Company on August 6, 2014. Silver sales in the third quarter of 2015 from San Dimas were a record 2.0 million ounces, an increase of 72% relative to the third quarter of 20142, as silver inventories built up in the second quarter of 2014 were subsequently sold. As at September 30, 2015, approximately 0.2 million ounces of cumulative payable silver ounces have been produced at San Dimas but not yet delivered to the Company, representing a decrease of 0.6 million payable silver ounces during the third quarter of 2015. As reported by Primero on July 6, 2015, silver deliveries in the second quarter had been delayed due to the suspension of Primero's import and export licenses in May 2015 by the Mexican customs authorities due to a discrepancy over Primero's address related to its corporate office relocation from Mexico City to Durango, Mexico. As per Primero's August 6, 2015, news release, the import and export license was reinstated and normal course imports and exports resumed, including the sales of all inventoried silver. Finally, as per Primero's third quarter of 2015 MD&A, during the third quarter, Primero achieved key milestones at both the San Dimas mine and the mill, tracking towards the completion of its expansion from 2,500 tpd to 3,000 tpd by the accelerated April 2016 completion date. Primero successfully connected the tunnel between the Sinaloa-Graben and Central mining blocks, providing a critical de-bottlenecking in the flow of machinery through theSan Dimas mine. At the San Dimas mill, Primero has completed the construction of foundations for the new secondary crusher and demolition of the old foundry is well advanced. The installation of the additional tailings pump is now complete and control has been handed over to the operations team. The new tailings filter and thickener are also in the process of fabrication and remain on-schedule for delivery to site in Q1 2016. Sudbury In the third quarter of 2015, attributable gold production from Vale's Sudbury mine was 5,967 ounces, a decrease of approximately 51% relative to the third quarter of 2014. According to Vale's third quarter of 2015 production report, the decrease was primarily due to planned maintenance shutdowns in the Sudbury surface plants in August 2015. As per Vale, key work completed as part of the shutdown encompassed the rebuild of the SAG mill, the overhaul of the acid plant in preparation for the implementation of the AER project (atmospheric emissions reduction project), and the upgrade of the environmental equipment at the Copper Cliff Nickel Refinery. It should also be noted that production in Q3 2014 was at an elevated level, as Vale processed large inventories of feed stock that had built up in Q2 2014 due to planned maintenance of surface facilities. Yauliyacu In the third quarter of 2015, attributable silver production from Yauliyacu was 0.7 million ounces, a decrease of approximately 20% relative to the third quarter of 2014, primarily due to lower grade being mined in the quarter. Barrick In the third quarter of 2015, attributable silver production from Barrick was 0.5 million ounces, an increase of approximately 27% relative to the third quarter of 2014, primarily due to higher grades at the Veladero mine and higher recoveries at the Lagunas Norte mine. 777 In the third quarter of 2015, 777 produced approximately 6,330 ounces of gold and 0.1 million ounces of silver attributable to Silver Wheaton, a decrease of approximately 48% and 37%, respectively, relative to the third quarter of 2014 primarily due to lower throughput and grades. Other Minto: In the third quarter of 2015, attributable gold production from Minto was 4,920 ounces, a decrease of approximately 29% relative to the third quarter of 2014, primarily due to lower grade being mined in the quarter. According to Capstone Mining Corp.'s (\"Capstone\") third quarter production results, the Minto mill processed solely underground and stockpiled ore while transitioning to the next open pit mining area. In addition, Capstone reported that the Yukon Water Board issued the final Water Use Licence on August 5, 2015, and that stripping of the Minto North open pit commenced immediately. Stripping of Minto North is reportedly on schedule for first ore to the mill starting in December 2015, with high grade ore commencing in the second quarter of 2016. Stratoni: In the third quarter of 2015, attributable silver production from Stratoni was 0.1 million ounces, a decrease of approximately 52% relative to the third quarter of 2014, primarily due to lower throughput as a result of fewer production stopes available in the mine as well as a five week suspension of operations in the quarter. As per Eldorado Gold Corporation's (\"Eldorado\") news release dated August 20, 2015, operations at the Stratoni mine were temporarily suspended as a direct result of the revocation by Greece's Ministry of Energy of the technical studies of Eldorado's projects in Halkidiki,Greece. As per Eldorado's news release dated October 5, 2015, mining operations have resumed at Halkidiki. Subsequent to the quarter, the Stratoni silver purchase agreement dated April 23, 2007, was amended in order to incentivize additional exploration and potentially extend the limited remaining mine life of Stratoni. The primary modification is to increase the production price per ounce of silver delivered to SWC over the current fixed price by one of the following amounts: i) US$2.50 if 10,000 meters of drilling is completed outside of the existing ore body and within SWC's defined area of interest (\"Expansion Drilling\"), ii) US$5.00 if 20,000 meters of Expansion Drilling is completed, and iii) US$7.00 if 30,000 meters of Expansion Drilling is completed. Drilling in all three cases must be completed by December 31, 2020, in order for the agreed upon increase in production price to be initiated.4 Produced But Not Yet Delivered 5 As at September 30, 2015, payable silver equivalent ounces produced but not yet delivered to Silver Wheaton by its partners decreased by 0.1 million ounces to approximately 6.3 million silver equivalent payable ounces, as increases at Salobo and Constancia were more than offset by decreases at San Dimas, 777 and Penasquito. Payable ounces produced but not yet delivered to Silver Wheaton are expected to average approximately two to three months of annualized production but may vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of mining operation factors including mine ramp-up, delays in shipments, and so forth. Detailed mine by mine production and sales figures can be found in the Appendix to this press release and in Silver Wheaton's MD&A in the 'Results of Operations and Operational Review' section. Sherritt International Corporation (S: TSX) Sherritt is a world leader in the mining and refining of nickel from lateritic ores with projects and operations in Canada, Cuba and Madagascar. The Corporation is the largest independent energy producer in Cuba, with extensive oil and power operations on the island. Sherritt licenses its proprietary technologies and provides metallurgical services to commercial metals operations worldwide. The Corporation's common shares are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol \"S\". Sherritt is committed to the highest standards of environment, health and safety practices at all of its operations, while making valuable contributions to local communities. Sherritt Announces Q4 and Year End 2015 Results February 10, 2016 TORONTO, ON --(Marketwired - February 10, 2016) - NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION TO UNITED STATES NEWSWIRE SERVICES OR FOR DISSEMINATION IN THE UNITED STATES Sherritt International Corporation (\"Sherritt\" or the \"Corporation\") (TSX: S), a world leader in the mining and refining of nickel from lateritic ores, today reported its financial results for the year ended December 31, 2015. \"This has been a year of profound base metal and oil price weakness, with nickel down 40% and fuel oil down 50% in 2015. Operationally, we were able to mitigate these price declines with increased nickel production, significant year over year cost reductions, and prudent, proactive management of our capital spending,\" said David Pathe, President and CEO, Sherritt International. \"Looking to 2016, a healthy balance sheet and maintaining liquidity remain our top priorities, and we will continue to enforce strict cost discipline and allocate capital judiciously.\" Q4 AND YEAR END HIGHLIGHTS (1)(2)(3) The nickel price erosion continued in the fourth quarter, with LME traded nickel hitting a new low of US$3.70/lb before recovering to US$3.93/lb at year end. At these prices and based on Wood Mackenzie published cash cost estimates (C1) for the year ended December 31, 2015, up to 70% of global nickel production is considered to be underwater on a cash cost basis before sustaining capital and debt service costs. Crude oil prices also hit multi-year lows, with WTI prices ending the year at US$36.60 per barrel, and Gulf Coast Fuel Oil 6 ending the year at US$21.80 per barrel. Preserving cash has been the Corporation's highest priority in the last half of the year, and cost discipline across all operations mitigated cash funding requirements despite the commodity price slide. At year end 2015, the Corporation had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $435.4 million, compared to $373.8 million at the end of Q3 2015. In the fourth quarter, Sherritt drew down an additional $65 million on its credit facilities, which accounted for most of the increased cash position. Adjusting for this drawdown, the cash decrease in the quarter was only approximately $5 million. During the fourth quarter 2015, the challenge period for financial completion expired, confirming that the Ambatovy project financing is now non-recourse to Sherritt and the other partners. Continuing cost discipline paid off in the fourth quarter, with the Moa JV reporting Q4 Net Direct Cash Cost (NDCC) of US$2.90 per pound, the lowest since 2009, and Ambatovy's Q4 NDCC being US$4.07/lb. For the full year, the Moa JV reported NDCC of US$3.88/lb while the Ambatovy JV reported NDCC of US$4.83 per pound. Sherritt's oil production maintained positive margins, with average realized prices of $29.53 per barrel of oil equivalent in Q4 and unit operating costs of $11.64 per barrel on a Gross Working Interest (GWI) basis. For the full year, average realized prices were $38.73 per barrel and unit operating costs were $10.69 per barrel. The Q4 2015 average realized prices were down 40% compared to year ago levels, while on a full year basis, the average realized prices were down 41%. Unit operating costs were stable on a quarterly comparison basis, being down 5% in Q4 2015 compared to the year ago quarter and up 13% for the year compared to 2014. Nickel production was up 8% in Q4 2015 over the prior year quarter, and for the full year was up 14% as the Ambatovy JV ramped up to approximately 80% of design capacity. On a 100% basis, the Metals division produced 80,976 tonnes of finished nickel in 2015. Cobalt production was up 27% in Q4 2015 over Q4 2014, and up 17% on a full year basis to 7,199 tonnes (100% basis). Oil production declined following natural reservoir declines and poor results in the wells drilled on the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) Extension lands. Fourth quarter 2015 Cuban oil production of 17,045 bopd (GWI basis) was down 9% from levels reported a year ago, and on a full year basis, production of 18,257 bopd was down 6% from the 19,456 bopd in 2014. Power production of 226GWh (33 1/3 % basis) in the fourth quarter was up 6% from the comparable quarter of 2014, and on a full year basis, production of 902GWh was also up 6% from the 847 Gwh produced during 2014. Production in 2015 benefited from a full year of power generation from the 150MW Boca de Jaruco Combined Cycle Project which was brought online in February of 2014. All amounts are Canadian dollars unless otherwise indicated. For additional information see the Non-GAAP measures section of this press release. Compared to the same period in the prior year. Shown on Sherritt's attributable share ownership basis. SIGNIFICANT ITEMS In the fourth quarter of 2015, Sherritt reported an impairment expense of $1.6 billion after tax on Ambatovy, consisting of $1.3 billion representing Sherritt's 40% share of Ambatovy's impairment and $0.3 billion from the incremental carrying value of Sherritt's Ambatovy assets, primarily related to mineral rights acquired from Dynatec in 2007. On a 100% base, the recorded impairment expense was US$2.4 billion, and was due to lower forecast nickel prices. This impairment resulted in a breach of the Financial Debt to Equity covenant in our credit facilities, for which waivers were obtained. Ambatovy Financial Completion was announced by press release September 21, 2015. AMBATOVY FUNDING In 2015, Sherritt provided funding to Ambatovy of US$105.6 million. Funding requirements were significantly impacted in the year by principal and interest payments on the Ambatovy Joint Venture Financing. As no funding was provided in Q4, this amount is unchanged from the funding that Sherritt reported at the end of Q3 2015. As a result of achieving financial completion, the US$1.6 billion Ambatovy Joint Venture Financing (balance as at December 31, 2015, 100% basis) became non-recourse to the Ambatovy partners. Pursuant to cash calls due in January, 2016, an additional US$30.0 million was provided to Ambatovy by Sumitomo Corp. and Korea Resources Corp. (KORES). Total cash calls of US$50.0 million were made, with Sherritt not funding its 40% pro-rata share (US$20.0 million). By agreement amongst the partners Sherritt's unfunded amounts remain payable to Ambatovy, with accrued interest. These amounts will be subtracted from future Ambatovy Joint Venture distributions, or may be set off by the Ambatovy Joint Venture against certain other amounts owed to Sherritt. Sherritt also has the option to pay the amounts in cash at any time, at Sherritt's election. Until the funding deficit is cured, and subject to continued discussions with the Ambatovy partners, Sherritt will not be exercising its Ambatovy voting rights. Sherritt determined not to fund further cash calls at this time to preserve liquidity and due to the current structure of the Ambatovy partner loans, which, at current nickel prices, effectively reduce Sherritt's 40% interest in Ambatovy to a 12% economic interest.(1) At this time, Sherritt continues to serve as operator, and constructive discussions are ongoing between partners and senior lenders regarding future funding of Ambatovy and modifications to the existing senior principal amortization. METAL MARKETS Nickel spot prices hit a multi-year low of US$3.70 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2015, and have since traded lower in February. These are price levels not seen since 2003. More significant supply disruptions have started to appear in January, with announced cuts from Votorantim and Mirabela in Brazil, and Panoramic and Mincor in Australia. Coupled with Chinese supply cuts announced in 2015, these cuts could impact 200,000 tonnes of nickel supply in 2016. So far, the LME nickel price has not shown any positive response to the supply cut news, as nickel was one of the worst performers in 2015 and published inventories remain at high levels buffering the impact of any supply disruptions. On the demand side, global stainless demand is estimated to have decreased marginally (by approximately 1.2%) in 2015; however, despite this slowdown, world nickel demand is projected to increase marginally in 2016. High levels of nickel stocks and the strengthening US dollar are factors that may cap price rallies in 2016. Sherritt's Moa JV and Ambatovy JV operations experienced steady demand for their nickel briquettes throughout 2015, despite the negative market sentiment and price decline. Higher nickel grades of stainless steel remain more profitable for steel mills, which is positive for both the Moa and Ambatovy JVs. Moa Joint Venture (50% interest) and Fort Site Adjusted EBITDA of $7.6 million in the fourth quarter was up $5.4 million from the level reported in Q3 2015, despite lower production of finished nickel and lower nickel average realized sales prices. Cost reductions and strong fertilizer sales following their normal seasonal patterns were the main drivers in maintaining Adjusted EBITDA levels that outperformed the weak nickel price environment. Finished nickel production of 4,098 tonnes (50% basis) for the fourth quarter of 2015 was down approximately 5% from production of 4,332 tonnes (50% basis) in the fourth quarter 2014, and down approximately 9% from third quarter production of 4,521 tonnes (50% basis). Moa's operations were negatively impacted late in the third quarter and part of the fourth quarter from unplanned maintenance in High Pressure Acid Leach (HPAL) operations resulting in lower process plant availability. The unplanned maintenance and lower availability was partially attributed to power failures stemming from a newly commissioned national power plant in Moa, which also contributed to premature component failures in the HPAL. Moa has addressed the component failures and taken measures to mitigate the impact of future power disruptions with operations returning to normal by the end of 2015. For the full year, finished nickel production of 16,853 tonnes (50% basis) was up 2% from last year's level. Finished cobalt production of 1,867 tonnes (50% basis) for the full year was up 16% over the prior year, reflecting higher utilization of cobalt-rich feeds. Nickel recovery at Moa has been steady at 89% all year, an improvement over the 87% level recorded for full year 2014. The NDCC of US$2.90 per pound of nickel in the fourth quarter of 2015 was an improvement of 35% (US$1.54 per pound) from the fourth quarter of 2014, and the lowest reported since the third quarter of 2009. The Moa JV continues to demonstrate that it is a world class laterite asset and is well positioned to meet our long term objective of being in the lowest quartile of nickel producers on a C1 basis as the fourth quarter 2015 was well within that target based on latest published data from Wood Mackenzie. For the full year, the Moa JV reported an average NDCC of US$3.88 per pound of nickel, down 22% (US$1.11/lb) from the previous year. In addition to cost reductions realized as a result of lower fuel oil and energy prices, a weaker Canadian dollar relative to the US dollar, and lower third party feed costs, efforts to focus on controllable costs have paid off. Capital spending of $20.5 million in the quarter and $64.1 million year to date is lower than its comparable quarter of 2014, but higher for the year than 2014, due to the once in 10 year planned maintenance shutdown at Fort Saskatchewan in the second quarter of 2015, and a weaker Canadian dollar, along with the expansion capital spent on the construction of the 2,000 tonne per day acid plant which is on track for full operation in the second half of 2016. Full year capital spending of $64.1 million was $10.9 million less than the guidance provided at the end of the third quarter of 2015, with the difference being carried over to the 2016 capital spending estimate coupled with deferrals in response to continual weakness in commodity markets. This year, Sherritt expects capital spending of US$38 million, covering Sherritt's 50% share of the Moa JV and capex required in the Fort Site fertilizer and utilities operations. The capital spending includes completion of the Moa JV acid plant, which has been financed by a Cuban financial institution. Ambatovy Joint Venture (40% interest) Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter was negative $(9.5) million during the quarter compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $ (7.5) million in the same quarter last year. Nickel reference prices averaged US$4.27/lb in the quarter, compared to US$7.17/lb in the same quarter a year ago, and down 11% from the US$4.78/lb average reference price in Q3 this year. Despite the profound slide in nickel prices, higher production and a significantly improved NDCC have mitigated the losses in the quarter. For the full year, Adjusted EBITDA of $ (9.4) million compares with $ (5.5) million last year. During the quarter, finished nickel production was 4885 tonnes (40% basis), down 6% from the Q3 2015 record production, but an improvement of 23% over last year. Finished cobalt production of 386 tonnes (40% basis) was up 39% from its level in the same quarter of 2014, and very close to the 392 tonnes cobalt produced in the third quarter. For the year, Ambatovy performed at close to 80% of design capacity, and twice achieved the \"90 for 90\" production test performance that was necessary to satisfy the financial completion criteria. The test required operating at 90% of design capacity for 90 days within a 100 day continuous period. While production and efficiency milestones were set and achieved in 2015, during the fourth quarter, Sherritt also received confirmation that finished nickel briquettes from Ambatovy qualified for delivery to London Metal Exchange (LME) warehouses. This recognition demonstrates the technical and metallurgical capabilities that Sherritt has contributed as operator during Ambatovy's ramp-up. LME delivery status allows Ambatovy or its customers the flexibility and commercial advantage of delivering nickel product to LME warehouses where logistics benefits exist or to mitigate short term variance in customer demand. LME certification should also have a positive impact on pricing. Ambatovy nickel was sold at an average realized price of $5.52/lb in the quarter (approximately US$4.14/lb at the quarterly average exchange rate), demonstrating that pricing is not suffering from discounting, and is approaching Moa JV average realized prices. The NDCC of nickel was US$4.07 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2015, continuing the strong decreasing trend achieved for each quarter this year, starting from US$5.74 per pound in Q1. Ambatovy is also demonstrating its potential to move into the lowest quartile of industry cash costs. Costs have responded positively to increased production as the operation has ramped up, improvements in maintenance costs and headcount, and falling input commodity prices. For example, autoclave turnaround times had been reduced from 42 days to 21 by the end of the year. In 2016, a two week total plant shutdown is scheduled for Q3, to complete inspections of pressure vessels in accordance with statutory engineering codes, and to carry out major opportune maintenance in various areas of the plant. Capital spending in 2015 was $23.8 million, which was approximately $11.2 million less than the guidance provided in Q3 2015. In 2016, capital spending is estimated to be US$25 million, which includes the continued build-up of mining fleet to support the mine plan, further mine development works including sediment control dam construction, and ongoing tailings dam expansion works. AMBATOVY FUNDING In 2015, Sherritt provided funding to Ambatovy of US$105.6 million. Funding requirements were significantly impacted in the year by principal and interest payments on the Ambatovy Joint Venture Financing. This amount is unchanged from the funding that Sherritt reported at the end of Q3 2015. As a result of achieving financial completion, the US$ 1.6 billion Ambatovy Joint Venture Financing (balance as at December 31, 2015, 100% basis) became non-recourse to the Ambatovy partners. Pursuant to cash calls due in January, 2016, an additional US$30.0 million was provided to Ambatovy by Sumitomo Corp. and Korea Resources Corp. (KORES). Total cash calls of US$50.0 million were made, with Sherritt not funding its 40% pro-rata share (US$20.0 million). By agreement amongst the partners Sherritt's unfunded amounts remain payable to Ambatovy, with accrued interest. These amounts will be subtracted from future Ambatovy Joint Venture distributions, or may be set off by the Ambatovy Joint Venture against certain other amounts owed to Sherritt. Sherritt also has the option to pay the amounts in cash at any time, at Sherritt's election. Until the funding deficit is cured, and subject to continued discussions with the Ambatovy partners, Sherritt will not be exercising its Ambatovy voting rights. Sherritt determined not to fund further cash calls at this time to preserve liquidity and due to the current structure of the Ambatovy partner loans, which, at current nickel prices, effectively reduce Sherritt's 40% interest in Ambatovy to a 12% economic interest.(1) At this time, Sherritt continues to serve as operator, and constructive discussions are ongoing between partners and senior lenders regarding future funding of Ambatovy and modifications to the existing senior principal amortization. Adjusted EBITDA of $9.7 million was 63% ($16.6 million) lower in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year period, with the average reference price for Gulf Fuel Oil 6 falling 52% from its year ago levels. The WTI and Fuel Oil 6 prices have continued to deteriorate since year end, with Gulf Coast Fuel Oil 6 now trading in a range of US$18 - US$21 per barrel in January of 2016. Fourth quarter GWI oil production in Cuba of 17,045 bopd was down 9% from the same quarter a year ago following natural reservoir declines and lower than expected production from the PSC Extension wells drilled earlier in 2015. Fourth quarter NWI oil production in Cuba of 10,145 bopd increased by 3% over the same quarter in 2014 despite the decrease in Cuban GWI oil production. This trend was also evident in the year over year comparison, with GWI oil production in Cuba down 6% for the full year, while net working interest production was up 1%. Cost recovery oil production in Cuba for both the quarter and the full year increased compared to 2014 because of lower oil prices. The allocation of cost recovery barrels in any particular period is limited to a fixed percentage of GWI volumes within each cost pool. Unit operating costs in Cuba increased by 9% ($0.88 per barrel) to $10.82 (GWI basis) for the fourth quarter (up 11% on a full year basis to $9.53 per barrel). This increase in unit operating costs is mainly attributable to lower than expected production combined with a weaker Canadian dollar, offset to some degree by lower workover costs. Quarterly free cash flow of $23.3 million was considerably higher than quarterly Adjusted EBITDA, benefiting from the collection of overdue receivables and limited capital spending. Although overdue receivables are still above normal levels at year end, approximately $48.8 million was collected during the quarter, and a schedule of payments has been agreed with the Cuban agency that shows receivables returning to current by year end 2016. In the third quarter of 2015, an impairment expense of $80.6 million ($0.27 per share) was recorded on Cuban and Spain oil assets in the quarter. The lower oil price forecast, combined with drilling results on the PSC extension that were below expectations, are the reasons for the impairment. Depletion, depreciation and amortization charges in the last quarter of 2015 were reduced accordingly, with Q4 depletion, depreciation and amortization charges of $10.9 million being $6.7 million lower than the Q4 2014 depletion, depreciation and amortization charges of $17.6 million. On a year to date basis, capital spending of $54.5 million is down 17% year over year, as further drilling was stopped in Q3 on the Extension areas after poor drilling results. Although the decision was made to stop further development within the PSC Extension areas, new capital spending is necessary to offset declines in existing production. The outlook for 2016 Cuban oil production of 14,500 bopd (GWI basis) is 21% lower than 2015 production, anticipating continuing natural reservoir declines, and no further drilling planned on the existing PSCs. The original PSCs expire in 2017 and 2018, with future production dependent on the ability to develop new prospective areas within the Cuban oil partnership. Drilling activity for 2016 is focused on the preparation and drilling of Block 10, where Sherritt has budgeted to drill two wells. Block 10 is one of two new PSC's which Sherritt signed in 2014 with the Cuban agency, covering 261 square kilometres for a 25-year term. Sherritt originally held Block 10 in the Bay of Cardenas, and drilled one well in June 1994. The well was drilled using an offshore drilling rig, and produced a discovery which tested at 3,750 barrels of oil per day. Since then, significant advances in horizontal drilling technology have made new drilling from onshore a viable prospect. Power Quarterly Adjusted EBITDA increased by 2% from Q4 2014 levels, while on a full year basis, Adjusted EBITDA was up 21%. Higher gas availability led to higher production, with Sherritt's share being 902 GWh for the full year. Production included the first full year of production from the 150MW Boca de Jaruco Combined Cycle Project, which was brought online effective February 2, 2014. The average-realized price of electricity was also higher for the quarter and for the full year period compared to 2014, mainly because of a weaker Canadian dollar. Operating costs increased by 48% ($11.06 per MWh) in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year period, with most of the increase being in non-base costs. These are mainly maintenance expenditures on the Boca de Jaruco and Puerto Escondido facilities. Operating costs fluctuate from a quarter to quarter basis with the timing of maintenance performed on gas and steam turbines. The weaker Canadian dollar also contributed to higher unit operating costs on both a three month and full year basis, as the Canadian dollar weakened from levels of approximately $1.14 in Q4 last year to $1.34 in Q4 of 2015, a change of 18%. Higher depletion, depreciation, and amortization expenses in both the quarter and the year compared to 2014 reflect the impact of a change in residual value estimate of the Varadero facility in Q1 2015, as well as the Canadian dollar decline. Free cash flow generation of $4.4 million in the quarter included a $2.8 million payment of interest on the Energas conditional sales agreement ($37.9 million year to date). Principal repayments of $7.9 million in the quarter were also received ($33.7 million year to date). OUTLOOK 2016 PRODUCTION AND CAPITAL SPENDING GUIDANCE In 2016, Sherritt has made certain modifications to how guidance is presented. For example, nickel and cobalt production expectations will continue to be published and reconciled to production guidance, but mixed sulphide production will not be part of the production guidance. This change was implemented recognizing that external stakeholders are focused on finished metal production with mixed sulphide production guidance having less utility. Secondly, capital spending estimates are being presented in US dollar denominated ranges, with the Canadian dollar estimate being presented for ease of comparison. The Canadian dollar estimate has been converted using the 2016 forecast conversion rate $1.36. This change in presentation is intended to align with Sherritt's capital budgeting practices, and to mitigate the change to capital that arises from translation to the Canadian dollar reporting currency. In 2015, capital spending revisions were generally explained in terms of their US dollar movement, as the fall in the Canadian dollar offset larger downward revisions to capital spending as the year progressed. This year, the presentation in US dollars and reporting against spending projections in US dollars is intended to mitigate the impacts of currency exchange volatility. Capital projects in the Metals business are generally US dollar expenditures, while in Oil & Gas, the expenditures are roughly 50% Canadian dollar denominated and 50% US dollar denominated. Production volumes and spending on capital 2015 guidance Actual 2015 December 31 2016 guidance  Spending is 50% of US$expenditures for Moa JV and 100% expenditures for Fort Site fertilizer and utilities Production Volumes Sherritt expects 2016 production to increase at Ambatovy, despite the planned once in three year maintenance shutdown of operations scheduled for Q3 2016. Production at Moa and in the power operations is expected to remain steady, with a decline in Oil & Gas, reflecting natural reservoir declines and no further drilling activity on existing PSC's. The original PSC wells are scheduled to revert to Cuban ownership in 2017 and 2018. Longer term, new production in Oil & Gas is expected to come from the drilling of Block 10, where the drill program will progress at a pace driven by prudent capital spending, and the objective of running the business units to be cash flow neutral. Capital Spending Capital spending (excluding Corporate) in 2015 was approximately $147 million, up 39% from 2014 capex of approximately $106 million, but down 21% from guidance provided at the end of Q3 2015. Approximately US$12 million ($16.3 million) has been carried over to 2016 estimated capital spending of US$107 million. In the Moa JV, 2016 estimated capital spending is consistent with 2015 levels adjusting for carry-forwards. The acid plant construction at the Moa JV is nearing 75% completion at January 31, 2016, and is on track to be operating in the second half of 2016. Counting US$40.4 million spent (100% basis) from the construction re-start in 2013 to the end of 2015 and an additional estimated US$24.6 million (included in the 2016 capital spending estimate), the construction completion cost (since resuming construction in 2013) is forecast at approximately US$65 million which is in line with the 2013 approved budget and is being 100% financed by a Cuban leading institution. Ambatovy capital spending is similar to what was originally estimated for 2015. Oil and gas estimated capital spending is focused on the preparation and drilling of Block 10. Block 10 is covered by one of the two new PSC's which Sherritt signed in 2014 with the Cuban agency, encompassing 261 square kilometres in the Bay of Cardenas for a 25-year term. Sherritt originally held Block 10 and completed a drill hole on the block in June 1994. Sherritt drilled one well, using an offshore drilling rig, which produced a discovery which tested at 3,750 barrels of oil per day. Since then, significant advances in horizontal drilling technology have made new drilling from onshore a viable prospect. Power capital spending is forecast to be US$1 million (Sherritt's 33 1/3% share) in 2016. In addition, the cost to construct a new pipeline to increase gas availability is estimated at US$4 million (Sherritt's share) with construction starting and finishing in 2016. NON-GAAP MEASURES The Corporation uses combined results, Adjusted EBITDA, average-realized price, unit operating cost, and adjusted operating cash flow to monitor the performance of the Corporation and its operating divisions and believes these measures enable investors and analysts to compare the Corporation's financial performance with its competitors and evaluate the results of its underlying business. These measures do not have a standard definition under IFRS and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. As these measures do not have a standardized meaning, they may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other companies.

Teck Reports Unaudited Fourth Quarter Results For 2015 Vancouver, BC - Teck Resources Limited (TSX: TCK.A and TCK.B, NYSE: TCK) (\"Teck\") reported unaudited annual adjusted profit attributable to shareholders of $188 million, or $0.33 per share, compared with $452 million, or $0.78 per share in 2014. Fourth quarter adjusted profit attributable to shareholders was $16 million, or $0.03 per share, compared with $116 million, or $0.20 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2014. Total non-cash after-tax impairment charges for 2015 amounted to $2.7 billion, of which $536 million was taken in the fourth quarter. \"We were pleased with our operating performance in 2015, meeting our guidance, reducing our costs and raising nearly $1 billion through two streaming transactions to strengthen our balance sheet,\" said Don Lindsay, President and CEO. \"However, the commodity cycle continues to provide us with a very challenging environment such that our near-term priorities are to keep all of our operations cash flow positive, meet our commitment to Fort Hills with internal sources of funds, evaluate options to further strengthen our liquidity and maintain a strong financial position by ending the year without drawing on our lines of credit.\" Highlights and Significant Items Annual adjusted profit attributable to shareholders was $188 million, or $0.33 per share. Fourth quarter adjusted profit attributable to shareholders was $16 million, or $0.03 per share. Gross profit before depreciation and amortization in 2015 was $2.6 billion compared with $2.9 billion in 2014. Gross profit before depreciation and amortization was $614 million in the fourth quarter compared with $757 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Cash flow from operations, before working capital changes, was $1.7 billion in 2015 compared with $2.0 billion last year. Cash flow from operations, before working capital changes, was $428 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with $491 million a year ago. The loss attributable to shareholders was $459 million in the fourth quarter compared with a profit of $129 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Our quarterly loss included impairment charges of $736 million on a pre-tax basis, including $45 million on our steelmaking coal assets, $93 million on copper and $598 million on the Fort Hills oil sand project resulting in a $536 million after-tax charge. For 2015, total pre-tax asset impairment charges were $3.6 billion and $2.7 billion on an after-tax basis. Adjusted EBITDA for 2015 (not including the non-cash impairment charges) was $2.0 billion compared with $2.4 billion in 2014. Our liquidity remains strong with a cash balance of $1.8 billion at February 10, and US$3.0 billion available under our revolving credit facility which matures in 2020. Construction of the Fort Hills oil sands project is more than 50% complete and progressing substantially on schedule and on budget. As at February 10, our remaining cash funding to complete the project is $1.2 billion. We received a payment of $789 million (US$610 million) for the sale of a silver stream linked to our share of the Antamina mine. Cash unit production costs were reduced at all of our operations in 2015 compared with a year ago as a result of the highly focused efforts on our cost reduction program and lower diesel prices. We have reached agreements with the majority of our steelmaking coal customers for the first quarter of 2016, based on a quarterly benchmark of US$81 per tonne for the highest quality product, and we expect total sales in the first quarter, including spot sales, to be at least 5.5 million tonnes of steelmaking coal. We were recognized as one of the Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations for the fourth consecutive year by media and investment research company Corporate Knights. Operating highlights in 2015 included: all our operating mines, with the exception of Quebrada Blanca and Pend Oreille, remained cash positive in the fourth quarter and for 2015, we achieved record annual production at Trail for refined zinc and silver, and we achieved record annual mill throughput at Antamina. If we meet our full year guidance for production, costs and capital expenditures, assuming current commodity prices and exchange rates and no unusual transactions or events, we should complete 2016 with at least $500 million in cash without any material change in our overall U.S. dollar debt level.

Turqoise Hill Resources Ltd. (TSE: TRQ) Turquoise Hill Resources (TRQ: TSX, NYSE & NASDAQ) is an international mining company with copper-gold and coal mines in the Asia Pacific region. Principal assets: A 66% interest in Oyu Tolgoi, one of the world's largest copper-gold-silver mines now producing and shipping concentrate to customers in China. A 22.63% interest in established Mongolian coal miner SouthGobi Resources (SGQ: TSX, 1878: HK). Turquoise Hill announces financial results and review of operations for the third quarter of 2015 VANCOUVER, CANADA - Turquoise Hill Resources today announced its financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. All figures are in US dollars unless otherwise stated. . HIGHLIGHTS Oyu Tolgoi achieved a strong safety performance with an All Injury Frequency Rate of 0.31 per 200,000 hours worked for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Oyu Tolgoi recorded revenue of $431.7 million in Q3'15 on sales of 226,000 tonnes of concentrate, a 2.5% increase over Q2'15, reflecting higher sales volumes partially offset by lower copper prices. Turquoise Hill reported income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders of $44.0 million. In Q3'15, a non-cash charge of $76.4 million was recorded within operating expenses for provision against non-current ore stockpile inventory. Turquoise Hill generated operating cash flow before interest and taxes of $171.7 million during Q3'15. Oyu Tolgoi's Q3'15 mine production was at record levels while concentrate produced and contained copper were on par with Q2'15 even considering the planned concentrator shutdown in July 2015. During Q3'15, mined production increased 8.5% over Q2'15 due to shorter hauling routes and ongoing productivity initiatives. Copper in concentrates for Q3'15 increased 1.3% due to higher head grades while gold in concentrates decreased 48.3% over Q2'15 due to slower than anticipated access to gold-rich ore. Increased copper and gold production is expected in Q4'15 compared to Q3'15 as higher-grade ore is accessed in the open pit. Turquoise Hill continues to expect Oyu Tolgoi to produce 175,000 to 195,000 tonnes of copper and 600,000 to 700,000 ounces of gold in concentrates in 2015. In August 2015, Oyu Tolgoi filed revised schedules for the 2015 Oyu Tolgoi Feasibility Study with the Mongolian Minerals Council. Underground pre-start activities are underway in parallel with an update to the feasibility study capital estimate, which is expected to be completed in Q1'16. Turquoise Hill continues to expect signing of project financing by the end of 2015 and the decision for underground construction in early Q2'16. Capital expenditure for 2015 is now expected to be approximately $120 million, of which approximately $115 million relates to sustaining capital, due to operational efficiencies, changes to the mine plan during the year and capital optimization. Operating cash costs for 2015 are now expected to be approximately $900 million reflecting operational improvements throughout the year and excluding one-time costs related to the May 2015 underground agreement as well as pre-start costs for underground development. Sales contracts have been signed for more than 80% of Oyu Tolgoi's expected 2016 concentrate production. In September 2015, Oyu Tolgoi surpassed 1.5 million tonnes of concentrate shipped. Turquoise Hill's cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2015 were $1.3 billion. FINANCIAL RESULTS In Q3'15, the Company recorded net income attributable to owners of Turquoise Hill of $21.2 million or $0.01 per share compared with net loss of $94.0 million or ($0.05) per share in Q3'14, an increase of $115.2 million. The increase is mainly attributable to a $227.3 million non-cash impairment charge recorded in Q3'14 on reclassification of SouthGobi to assets held for sale. Operating cash flows before interest and taxes in Q3'15 were $171.7 million compared with $256.3 million in Q3'14, reflecting continued production and delivery cost improvements and effective working capital management, offset by the impact of lower commodity prices on sales revenue. Additions to property, plant and equipment, excluding adjustments relating to asset retirement obligations ($9.7 million), were $31.1 million in Q3'15 all of which related to sustaining capital activities including the tailing storage facility. Turquoise Hill's cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2015 were $1.3 billion. OYU TOLGOI The Oyu Tolgoi mine is approximately 550 kilometres south of Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia's capital city, and 80 kilometres north of the Mongolia-China border. Mineralization on the property consists of porphyry-style copper, gold, silver and molybdenum contained in a linear structural trend (the Oyu Tolgoi Trend) that has a strike length extending over 26 kilometres. Mineral resources have been identified in a series of deposits throughout this trend. They include, from south to north, the Heruga Deposit, the Southern Oyu deposits (Southwest Oyu, South Oyu, Wedge and Central Oyu) and the Hugo Dummett deposits (Hugo South, Hugo North and Hugo North Extension). Mining of ore commenced in May 2012 and first concentrate was produced in January 2013. The Oyu Tolgoi mine has initially been developed as an open-pit operation. A copper concentrator plant, with related facilities and necessary infrastructure to support a nominal throughput of 100,000 tonnes of ore per day, has been constructed to process ore mined from the Southern Oyu open pit. Long term development plans for Oyu Tolgoi are based on a 95,000-tonne-per-day underground block-cave mine. In August 2013, development of the underground mine was delayed pending resolution of matters with the Government of Mongolia. On May 18, 2015, Turquoise Hill, the Government of Mongolia and Rio Tinto announced the signing of the Oyu Tolgoi Underground Mine Development and Financing Plan, which addressed key outstanding shareholder matters and set out an agreed basis for the funding of the project. Preparation for underground development Following the filing of revised schedules for the 2015 Oyu Tolgoi Feasibility Study with the Mongolian Minerals Council in August 2015, pre-start activities are underway in parallel with an update to the capital estimate, which is expected to be completed in Q1'16. Pre-start activities include ramp-up of the owners and EPCM team, reestimate activities, detailed engineering and early procurement for equipment and materials required for necessary critical works that are key enablers for recommencement of underground lateral development mining activity. Care and maintenance activities have continued for Shaft #1, facilities and mobile equipment. Turquoise Hill expects the decision for underground construction in early Q2'16. The Company continues to expect signing of project financing by the end of 2015. In September 2015, the Government of Mongolia signed the request of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) for host country approval (HCA) with respect to guarantees to be issued by MIGA in connection with the Oyu Tolgoi project financing. The signing of the HCA was a significant milestone in the project financing timeline. In October 2015, the project financing information circular was provided to the banking syndicate allowing for each institution's respective internal consideration and approval. Prior to the suspension in August 2013, underground lateral development at Hugo North had advanced approximately 16 kilometres off Shaft #1. Sinking of Shaft #2, the primary operations access and initial production hoisting shaft, had reached a depth of 1,168 metres below surface, 91% of its final depth of 1,284 metres. The 96 metre-high Shaft #2 concrete headframe has been constructed. Sinking of Shaft #5, a dedicated exhaust ventilation shaft, had reached a depth of 208 metres, 17% of its final depth of 1,174 metres. Surface facilities, including offices, mine dry, and workshop, are in place to support initial pre-production development and construction. Q3'15 performance Safety continues to be a major focus throughout Oyu Tolgoi's operations and the mine's management is committed to reducing risk and injury. Oyu Tolgoi achieved a solid safety performance with an All Injury Frequency Rate of 0.31 per 200,000 hours worked for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Revenue in Q3'15 increased 2.5% over Q2'15. Higher revenues reflect higher volumes of copper-gold concentrate sales, partially offset by a fall in copper prices. The Q3'15 mix of revenue by metals is the result of inventory with higher contained copper and gold drawn down during the quarter from concentrate produced in Q2'15. Gross margin at 41.6% for the quarter reduced from 46.4% in Q2'15 due to the effect of lower copper prices. Production and delivery costs include primarily the cash costs in inventory sold as well as allocated mine administration costs. Depreciation and depletion includes the depreciation and depletion in inventory sold as well as any depreciation of assets used in the selling and delivery process, including the depreciation of capitalized production phase stripping costs. A non-cash charge of $76.4 million was recorded in Q3'15, within operating expenses, for additional provision against non-current ore stockpiles, following re-estimation of realizable value to reflect lower copper and gold prices and updated assumptions for timing of processing. Total additions capitalized to property, plant and equipment, on an accruals basis, for Q3'15 were $31.1 million (Q3'14: $38.3 million) all attributed to sustaining activities, including the tailings storage facility and deferred stripping. Total additions for Q3'15 include an adjustment of $4.0 million, which reduced the carrying amount of underground evaluation costs capitalized in previous quarters to be in accordance with the Company's accounting policy on the recognition of exploration and evaluation costs. Total cash operating costs at Oyu Tolgoi in Q3'15 were $222.5 million. Following transition to IFRS, the 5% royalty payable to the Government of Mongolia, previously deducted from revenue, is reflected as a cash operating expense, and production phase stripping costs, previously included within cash operating expense, are capitalized and depreciated. During Q3'15, Oyu Tolgoi continued to improve and optimize operations in order to reduce costs across the mine's operation. Oyu Tolgoi's C1 costs in Q3'15 were $0.40 per pound, compared with $0.73 per pound in Q2'15. The decrease was mainly due to a $22.1 million charge in Q2'15 for settlement of amounts not previously paid or provided for in relation to Mongolian Tax assessments, following signature of the underground agreement on May 18, 2015, and a net reduction in inventory (excluding non-cash write-down) as sales volumes exceeded production. Oyu Tolgoi's open-pit mine has a high-grade zone containing a large proportion of gold in addition to copper; Turquoise Hill anticipates quarterly fluctuation of C1 costs as the quantity of gold in concentrates sold varies after ore from this zone is fed through the mill. All-in sustaining costs in Q3'15 were $1.52 per pound, compared with $1.26 per pound in Q2'15. The increase was mainly due to a non-cash charge for additional provision against non-current ore stockpile partially offset by royalty expenses returning to regular operational levels following the Q2'15 adjustment upon signing of the underground agreement. Oyu Tolgoi's Q3'15 mine production was at record levels while concentrate produced and contained copper was on par with Q2'15 even considering the planned concentrator shutdown in July. During Q3'15, mined production increased 8.5% over Q2'15 due to shorter hauling routes and ongoing productivity initiatives. Copper in concentrates for Q3'15 increased 1.3% due to higher head grades. Gold in concentrates for the quarter decreased 48.3% over Q2'15 due to slower than anticipated access to gold-rich ore. Funding of Oyu Tolgoi by Turquoise Hill In accordance with the ARSHA dated June 8, 2011, Turquoise Hill has funded Oyu Tolgoi's cash requirements beyond internally generated cash flows by a combination of equity investment and shareholder debt. For amounts funded by debt, Oyu Tolgoi must repay such amounts, including accrued interest, before it can pay common share dividends. At September 30, 2015, the aggregate outstanding balance of shareholder loans extended by subsidiaries of the Company to Oyu Tolgoi was $6.8 billion, including accrued interest of $1.4 billion. These loans bear interest at an effective annual rate of LIBOR plus 6.5%. In Q3'15, Oyu Tolgoi repaid a total amount of $180.0 million with respect to these loans, including accrued interest of $57.9 million. In accordance with the ARSHA, a subsidiary of the Company has funded the common share investments in Oyu Tolgoi on behalf of Erdenes. These funded amounts earn interest at an effective annual rate of LIBOR plus 6.5% and are repayable, by Erdenes to a subsidiary of the Company, via a pledge over Erdenes' share of Oyu Tolgoi common share dividends. Erdenes also has the right to reduce the outstanding balance by making cash payments at any time. As at September 30, 2015, the cumulative amount of such funding was $751.1 million, representing approximately 34% of invested common share equity; unrecognized interest on the funding amounted to $214.9 million. Operational outlook Increased copper and gold production is expected in Q4'15 when compared to Q3'15 as higher-grade ore is anticipated to be accessed in the open pit. Turquoise Hill continues to expect Oyu Tolgoi to produce 175,000 to 195,000 tonnes of copper and 600,000 to 700,000 ounces of gold in concentrates in 2015. The Company expects copper production to be at the top of the range while gold production is expected to be in the middle of the range. Capital expenditure for 2015 is now expected to be approximately $120 million, of which approximately $115 million relates to sustaining capital. The Company previously expected capital expenditure of approximately $230 million, of which approximately $185 million related to sustaining capital. The reduction is the result of operational efficiencies, changes to the mine plan during the year and capital optimization. Operating cash costs for 2015 are now expected to be approximately $900 million. The Company previously expected operating cash costs of approximately $1 billion. The reduction reflects changes from operational improvements throughout the year and excludes one-time costs related to the May 2015 underground agreement as well as pre-start costs for underground development. Sales contracts have been signed for more than 80% of Oyu Tolgoi's expected 2016 concentrate production. Q3'15 exploration Oyu Tolgoi's exploration strategy is focused on developing a project pipeline prioritized in areas that can impact the current development of the Oyu Tolgoi orebodies, seeking low-cost development options; in particular looking for shallower targets. Historical datasets are added to and reinterpreted to enable future discovery. SOUTHGOBI On April 23, 2015, the Company completed sale of 48.7 million shares in SouthGobi to Novel Sunrise Investments Limited (NSI) at a price of C$0.35 per common share payable in cash, and on June 3, 2015 a further 1.7 million shares were sold to NSI at a price of C$0.35 per share. Half of the aggregate cash proceeds, representing C$8.5 million in total, were received at closing; the balance of approximately C$8.5 million was received on August 4, 2015. At September 30, 2015, Turquoise Hill owned 52.4 million SouthGobi common shares, representing approximately 21.3% of the issued and outstanding SouthGobi shares at that date. The carrying value of this interest at September 30, 2015 was $14.6 million based on the quoted share price. At September 30, 2015, SouthGobi is classified as an investment in associate within assets held for sale in the Company's financial statements. OTHER EXPLORATION Desk top studies, data compilation and detailed satellite imagery interpretation are in progress for an orbit Area approximately surrounding Oyu Tolgoi. An induced polarization and magnetotellurics survey on Turquoise Hill's Teregt licence (bordering the south of the Oyu Tolgoi licences) was conducted. The results have been analyzed and the interpretation downgraded the previous induced polarization targets. Additional soil and rock geochemical sampling has been done to test for shallow exploration targets. A service agreement is in place with Rio Tinto Holdings (Exploration), under which they provide exploration services to the Company. This agreement benefits Turquoise Hill by allowing access to Rio Tinto's global expertise, knowledge base and skills. CORPORATE ACTIVITIES Management change In September 2015, Turquoise Hill announced the resignation of Stewart Beckman, Senior Vice President, Operations and Technical Development, effective October 1, 2015 due to Mr. Beckman having accepted a new position within Rio Tinto. The Company is conducting a search for Mr. Beckman's replacement, which will be announced in due course. Mr. Beckman will provide support in the interim to ensure a smooth transition. NON-GAAP MEASURES The Company's financial results are prepared in accordance with IFRS. In addition, the Company presents and refers to the following measures (non-GAAP measures) which are not defined in IFRS. A description and calculation of these measures is given below, and may differ in some aspects from equivalent measures provided by other issuers. Cash operating costs This measure comprises Oyu Tolgoi cash operating costs, and is presented in order to provide investors and other stakeholders in the Company with a greater understanding of performance and operations at Oyu Tolgoi. The measure of cash operating costs excludes: depreciation and depletion; exploration and evaluation; charges for asset write-down (including write-down of materials and supplies inventory), and includes management services payments to Rio Tinto, and management services payments to Turquoise Hill which are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements of the Company. C1 cash costs C1 cash costs is a metric representing the cash cost per unit of extracting and processing the Company's principal metal product to a condition in which it may be delivered to customers, net of by-product credits. It is provided in order to support peer group comparability and to provide investors and other stakeholders' useful information about the underlying cash costs of Oyu Tolgoi and the impact of by-product credits on the operations' cost structure. C1 cash costs are relevant to understanding the Company's operating profitability and ability to generate cash flow. When calculating costs associated with producing a pound of copper, the Company includes gold and silver revenue credits as the production cost is reduced as a result of selling these by-products.Turquoise Hill's principal metal product is copper, and C1 cash costs are reported for Oyu Tolgoi only. All-in sustaining costs All-in sustaining costs (AISC) is an extended cash based cost metric, providing further information on the aggregate cash, capital and overhead outlay per unit, and is intended to reflect the costs of producing the Company's principal metal product over the life-cycle of its operations. The measure seeks to reflect the full cost of copper production from current operations and as a result development project capital is not included. AISC allows Turquoise Hill to assess the ability of Oyu Tolgoi to support sustaining capital expenditures for future production from the generation of operating cash flows.

The world's population is growing, getting richer and increasingly opting for meat-rich diets - factors which are pushing up demand for fertilisers. While this worn cliche, trotted out by many in the agriminerals industry, has its basis in truth, in reality, these variables are not new and have long been factored into the business plans of the industry's majors. Enthusiastic gesturing towards demographics and shifting preferences therefore mean relatively little for the sector's bottom line. Steve Hansen at investment firm Raymond James recently told the UK's Financial Times that \"global fertiliser fundamentals remain broadly anaemic, with few encouraging pricing signals\". Speaking about the crop nutrients, potash, phosphate and nitrogen, Canada-based Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. (PotashCorp) said in its full year 2015 results, released in late January, that it retains a \"cautious outlook\" for all three commodities. The company's net profit fell by just over 51% year-on-year (y-o-y) in 2015, primarily owing to low market prices for the minerals it produces. Other producers look set to report annual earnings outlining similar trends. Market analysis firm Integer Research was slightly less pessimistic than some in its most recent fertiliser market summaries, noting that in potash, demand actually remained firm y-o-y at 59m tonnes muriate of potash (MOP) last year, according to its estimates. Prices, however, continued at their lowest levels for around a decade. Describing phosphate buying from key markets as \"disappointing\", particularly for India, Integer said that stocks were full in 2015 from earlier buying, totalling around 1m tonnes by October, pulling down demand.  Supply reform Despite subdued demand, supply control measures that are expected to have a positive effect on the market balance are finally being put in place by the industry. The Investec \"mining clock\", which describes the various events that occur during a boom and bust cycle, notes that dividend cuts are key to realignment and deleveraging in the mining industry. PotashCorp's latest earnings release informed investors that it would slash its dividend payments by 34% to Canadian dollar (C$) $0.25/share ($0.18/share*), an announcement made all the more significant because this is the first time PotashCorp has cut its dividend in 27 years as a publicly listed entity. More recently, the company mothballed its Picadilly potash mine in New Brunswick after only around a year of active production, resulting in the loss of 420 jobs and suspending 1.8m tonnes of production capacity, saving PotashCorp around C$50m in 2016 capex costs and C$135m across 2017 and 2018.  \"This announcement highlights the pain being felt in the potash sector globally,\" Investec said at the time, adding that it seems very unlikely that Anglo-Australian mining giant BHP Billiton will bring its large-scale Jansen project in Saskatchewan online any time in the foreseeable future. Production cuts are also being pursued elsewhere. One year on from the flooding and consequent suspension of leading supplier Uralkali OAO's Solikamsk II mine in Russia, a closure which knocked out a fifth of the company's potash capacity but had no effect on global prices, Uralkali has made no attempt to salvage the operation. In the last quarter of 2015, US-based Mosaic Co. axed 46 staff its Colonsay, Saskatchewan mine and extended planned maintenance work downtime, keeping supply offline. Its phosphate segment is also running at well below capacity. Tel-Aviv-headquartered Israel Chemicals Ltd (ICL) said in its full year 2015 earnings statement in February that it anticipated a more balanced potash market in the second half of this year, based on production cuts from major companies. The Israeli company did not make any firm commitments to reduce its own output, but did say that it plans to transition from the production of potash to polysulphate at its Cleveland operation in the UK - a shift that will see the loss of 330 jobs.  Bitter lemons While the bulk commodities market is suffering, there is no shortage of strategies for ensuring continued strong business performance among the world's fertiliser mineral producers - most of which have been through punishing industry cycles in the past. One approach is identifying smaller, higher growth markets and targeting them with new products. HJ Baker & Bro. Inc.'s subsidiary, Tiger-Sul, recently released its Tiger Greening Guard-branded fertiliser - a blend aimed solely at the citrus fruit industry. According to the US Department of Agriculture, US orange production, traditionally associated with the state of Florida, is forecast to be 4.8m tonnes for the 2015/2016 season, down nearly half on the 8.1m tonnes produced in the 2010/2011 season, thanks to a combination of adverse growing conditions. HJ Baker's Greening Guard fertiliser, introduced in November 2015, is specifically targeted at farmers affected by citrus greening disease, a bacterial infection spread by several species of the psyllid insect and one of the chief causes of the drop in crop tonnages. As well as giving fruit a green hue, as the name suggests, citrus greening, which is also known as Yellow Dragon Disease, can result in defoliation, stunted growth, plant death and bitter flavoured, irregularly shaped fruits that drop off the tree early, according to the US' Food and Fertilizer Technology Center. Pesticides can be used to control psyllid populations, but according to Usman Khalid, marketing manager at HJ Baker, Greening Guard is one of the best performing and cost-effective options for counteracting the disease. The sulphur-heavy (64% sulphur, 3% iron, 7% manganese and 7% zinc) blend \"limits tree vulnerability by boosting and strengthening the tree's immune system\", Khalid told IM. \"It also increases feeder root density for optimal nutrient uptake, which allows for healthier fruit and reduced fruit drop,\" he said. HJ Baker noted last year that citrus greening can reduce root functionality by as much as 50-80%. Khalid added that the product reduces stress on the plant by lowering the surrounding soil pH and that Greening Guard's controlled release property optimises uptake by delivering nutrients over time, rather than in a burst upon application. The company sees its key markets for Greening Guard as Florida (which is currently the biggest consumer) and California, which together account for the vast majority of the citrus crop acreage of the US, in addition to smaller opportunities in Texas and Arizona. \"We are also targeting several global markets where citrus greening is a major problem,\" Khalid added. As part of its effort to sharpen its strategy, Khalid said that Tiger-Sul is continuously investing in R&D and improving product formulation with modified ingredients to target the various issues facing the agriculture industry. Products for effectively delivering micronutrients to crops are seen as a significant opportunity for companies in the fertiliser industry. ArrMaz Custom Chemicals Inc., a supplier of processing solutions to a variety of mining and industrial minerals companies, told IM that the addition of micronutrients to bulk phosphate fertiliser as a value enhancer is a recent trend. The company notes that this can make granulation more difficult, however, requiring process additives such blending agents, granulation aids, dust controllers and anti-caking coatings. Particle segregation is also less easy following micronutrient loading, because the different particle sizes, densities and shapes affect the even application of a fertiliser mixture, owing to the tendency of non-uniform particles to differentiate during transit and storage. According to ArrMaz, its Microstickers-branded product can stabilise stored fertilisers for up to 90 days. Optimisation Another business strategy in the tough bulk fertiliser market is optimisation. This can stretch through from mining to beneficiation processes, to yield higher value products and reduce costs. ArrMaz told IM that, in the case of phosphate, higher grades and recovery rates result in cost advantages across the processing chain, in addition to a number of tangible environmental benefits. Obtaining higher grades and recovery result in smaller areas of mining, lowering permitting and land retention costs. Mine reserves last longer, taxes can become less punitive and shipping costs can be reduced, ArrMaz said. For phosphate, as with many other minerals, higher grade feedstock can open up more processing routes towards more valuable end products, such as phosphoric acid. Zug, Switzerland-headquartered EuroChem AG told IM: \"All coefficients and ratios - such as output, acid concentration (which is key to ensure final product quality), raw material consumption rates, energy consumption and other vital parts of the production process - to a large extent depend on phosphate rock quality.\" This can be defined by the phosphate (P2O5)/calcium oxide (CaO) ratio and the impurity content of the rock, where impurities include: aluminium (Al2O3), iron (Fe2O3), magnesium (MgO), fluorine (F), silicon (Si), sodium (Na), potassium (K) and assorted organic compounds. Excess silicon, for example, will result in abrasion and erosion in the processing plant, reducing its lifespan and filtering efficiency while increasing waste volumes. Carbonate, meanwhile, can result in higher required sulphuric acid and defoaming reagent volumes, according to ArrMaz. EuroChem said that the normal approach is to qualify phosphate rock raw material according to its minor element ratio (MER) coefficient, where MER = ((Al2O3 + Fe2O3 + MgO)/P2O5). As a general rule, production processes can be worthwhile and economically viable if the MER indicator ratio remains lower than 0.12. Kovdorskiy, EuroChem's iron ore-apatite phosphate mine in the Kola peninsula, northwest Russia, produces phosphate feedstock with a MER of 0.05-0.08; while at the recently opened Kok-Jon phosphate mine in the Jambyl region of Kazakhstan, the MER ratio ranges from 0.09-0.1, EuroChem told IM. Todd Parker, industrial marketing manager at ArrMaz, listed the 10 most important rules that must be followed in a beneficiation plant to result in higher quality end products at minimal expense, as: 1 Avoid ore dilution - keep the feed clean of overburden and other contamination 2 Liberate the feed as needed, creating as few fines as possible 3 Wash the ore and remove clays 4 Size the feed well for floatation sections or equipment 5 Float similarly sized feeds together 6 Use the cleanest water for conditioning and floatation 7 Condition feed at the right solids and at the right pH 8 Use the right amount of reagents, water and air 9 Employ smooth, non-turbulent floatation 10 Feed the plant at stable rates \"These rules may seem rudimentary in nature but often getting back to the basics of mineral processing will help improve grade and recovery, which is generally a balancing act - improving one is usually achieved at the detriment of the other,\" Parker told IM.  Balancing act At its Kovdorskiy mine, EuroChem explained that while reducing the Mg content of the feedstock is a requirement, as its presence lowers slurry velocities and thus reduces filtering ability, Mg also adds value to the end product as a key micronutrient. He also noted the difficulty of shifting a plant's feedstock from one source of phosphate rock to another - or, as is the case at EuroChem's Belorechenskie Minudobrenia (BMU) plant in southern Russia, having two separate phosphate feedstocks. \"To feed our fertiliser operations there, we use both apatite concentrate from Kovdorskiy and a fine rock phosphate flour imported from Kazakhstan. While changing phosphate rock sources can be challenging, due to equipment configuration and calibration, the results of exhaustive testing and the use of the first rock shipments as feedstock have generated positive results with a quality fertiliser product,\" EuroChem said. Different sources of rock, divergent flowsheets and various reagents must also be balanced against each other to yield the best end products. \"While there is no universal reagent scheme and flowsheet design, each directly influences the other. Therefore operations designed with a marriage of flowsheet, equipment selection and reagent formulation creates the best value for the miner,\" ArrMaz's Parker said. ArrMaz told IM that it develops reagent schemes and flowsheet designs for customer-specific phosphate ores to recover greater volumes of higher grade phosphate, while consuming less energy and fewer resources. \"We provide a complete technical service package that includes laboratory evaluations of flowsheets and reagents as well as process consultations on existing operations and custom formulated reagents to improve recovery and grade for phosphate processing operations,\" the company said. One key factor in processing is the recovery of fine fractions. According to ArrMaz, this can both significantly improve operational economies and reduce the need for clay and tailings facilities. \"However, handling and recovering finer phosphate fractions can create a balancing act between overall recovery and conditioning/flotation efficiency,\" ArrMaz said. \"Often, clays interfere with the flotation process, driving costs up and challenging the recovery of other size fractions. In this case, reagent selection is key.\" The company markets its CustoFloat and CustAmine reagents for this purpose, both of which were formulated to handle clays and multiple-sized feed fractions. \"These reagents have recently found success for carbonate and silica rejection in clay-laden feeds, while maximising grade and recovery,\" ArrMaz said.  Granular approach Phosphoric acid is itself still a feedstock, largely for diammonium phosphate (DAP) and monoammonium phosphate (MAP) production. EuroChem told IM that product consistency is especially important for phosphate products over other fertilisers because their markets demand specific characteristics, including granule size and colour. \"All of our plants, whether at BMU, Kingisepp, or Lifosa, have undergone and benefit from investments targeting the stabilisation of product granulometry and the physical and mechanical properties of the product,\" EuroChem said. \"Ongoing investments are being made to enhance granulation with various surface treatments such as conditioning additives, anti-caking material and so on.\" At EuroChem's Nevinnomysskiy Azot facility, the company has recently introduced several new nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium (NPK) formulae (19:4:19, 15:24:16 and 10:26:26). These were rolled out together with additional granulometry stabilisation measures to improve overall product quality, EuroChem said. \"More importantly, the equipment upgrades now ensure a maximum conversion rate for potassium chloride and ammonium nitrate, which makes for non-caking mechanically stable products, meaning a more consistent and reliable product for the farmers,\" the company added. Granulation is improved by having a purer phosphoric acid feedstock, according to ArrMaz, yielding not just higher grades, but also a greater hardness and more consistent size and solubility properties. \"The goal is to make the strongest and most uniform size granule, while meeting all analytical requirements without over formulation,\" ArrMaz said. \"The lower the phosphoric acid impurities the easier it is to make consistent phosphoric acid and as the granulation plant is fed consistent, high grade acid, the better the granulator runs. The better the granulator runs, the higher the production without the need to recycle off-spec granules.\" Higher quality granules are easier to store, handle and ship, the company added.  The sci-fi future of agriculture Looking even further ahead, precision application of specific fertiliser blends directed by drone surveying could be one of the most important future developments in agriculture. Drone technology has largely received attention for its potential as a tool for policing and spying, but opinion is growing in agricultural circles that unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) could play a role in the future of precision farming technology. Khalid told IM that HJ Baker considers that UAVs could be used for scouting, video capturing and field surveys in agriculture, predicting that their use is set to \"grow tremendously\" in the coming years. EuroChem said that sensor drones \"appear poised to play an increasingly crucial role in modern agriculture\". According to EuroChem, aerial support drones can help track and assess crop growth, reduce nutrient waste and increase yields - \"representing another step towards sustainable farming\". Khalid agrees: \"As production agriculture enters an era of uncertain commodity prices and profitability, precision agriculture will help the farmer apply products more efficiently.\" While remote sensing by satellite has been used in agriculture for many years, both the spectral and spatial resolution of surveying can be increased by using near-surface drones, in addition to eliminating downtime caused by clouds. \"Remote sensing is already an established method of monitoring crop status. While satellite programmes, such as the European Earth observation programme, Copernicus (previously known as GMES), are in place, the drones provide for a far more flexible proposition,\" EuroChem said. By using sensor data to identify where fertiliser has - and has not - been applied, in addition to assessing foliage density, farmers can adjust application rates to target areas showing deficiency in nutrient content and crop growth. \"Big data and aerial collection of data will be very critical,\" Khalid said. \"Integration of UAVs and satellite imagery linked with yield monitors and field maps is where the industry will move.\" Sensing the future The proliferation of drones in agriculture has grown as the technology has become more compact and manoeuvrable and less expensive. The International Water Management Institute (IWMI) carried out UAV trials in Sri Lanka in September 2015. Using an eBee drone fixed with a near-infrared sensor, the IWMI recorded positive results that could ultimately see farmers fix nutrient supply problems before they affect crop growth. \"Using near-infrared, you can identify stress in a plant 10 days before it becomes visible to the eye,\" Salman Siddiqui, head of IWMI's GIS remote sensing and data unit, told the UK's Guardian newspaper. \"When a plant goes into stress, it's either due to a water or fertiliser shortage, or because it's being attacked by a pest. Photosynthetic activity decreases and that affects the chlorophyll. That's what the near-infrared sensor can detect, but our human eye can't see it until it's more advanced,\" he explained. Siddiqui said that if a crop is being attacked by pests, UAVs can be used to spot this and prevent the pest spreading to affect a larger area - from farm to regional scale. Meanwhile, in Uganda and Tanzania, the International Potato Center (CIP) has found that sweet potato crop acreages were being underestimated by around 50% in official statistics. On a small scale, this can impact local policy-making by reducing the availability of training, seeds and small-scale insurance agreements. Charities, development agencies and the public sector - even local farming syndicates - could use drones in this context to advance agricultural development. \"In developing countries, it's still the case that farmers get together and share tractors, so this could be another area where they pool resources,\" Siddiqui said. EuroChem suggested that, coupled with farmer feedback, drone-collected data could be harnessed to engineer new types of fertiliser products. \"While a few hurdles remain, including around privacy and data mining use - for example, who owns the data and what will it be used for - drones are increasingly likely to become part of the next global breakthrough in the quest to increase yields on ever decreasing arable land.\" *Conversion made February 2016"}, {"title": "Deveron Updates Change of Business: Providing Drone Technology Solutions to Enhance Profitability in Agriculture; Enters into Share Exchange Agreement", "article": "Sydney - Wednesday - February 24: (RWE) - Deveron Resources Ltd [TSX VENTURE:DVR], announces that further to its press release dated November 13, 2015, it has entered into a definitive arm's length share exchange agreement dated February 19, 2016 to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of 2487473 Ontario Inc, a private company existing under the laws of the Province of Ontario.

After all, BDC Capital 's predecessor IT fund - which also had $150 million to work with - invested a total of zero dollars in Manitoba companies. But that's not to say the new one won't. Robert Simon , the managing partner of the BDC IT Venture Fund II, said, \"We're looking,\" as if he was anticipating the question as to why there are no Manitoba investments and whether or not there ever will be. The fund is designed to basically move up the food chain. BDC's first IT fund - which invested in about 23 companies - was targeted at early-stage or startup companies averaging about $500,000 to $1 million per investment. This one is looking to invest in more mature, mid-stage companies, and will average $2 million to $5 million for a Series A round and $4 million to $7 million for a Series B round. The idea is for the new fund to address the gap between the startup phase and revenue growth phase. Everyone in the ecosystem complains about the challenges of finding the capital to scale up. Simon said the quality of the startups in Canada has improved dramatically in the past few years, and the availability of capital is at an all-time high. But that sound you hear is the grinding of teeth in Manitoba, where next to none of that bounteous pile of venture capital ever seems to land. The age-old problem is venture capital funds like to be close to the companies they invest in. To BDC's credit, it probably has better geographic coverage than most, with offices in Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal and Vancouver. One of the successful exits from its first fund was with a company out of Fredericton. And Simon said BDC's industrial, clean and energy technology venture fund is currently talking with a Manitoba company. Jan Lederman, president of Innovate Manitoba, said she has no doubt Manitoba companies can hold their own when they get the chance to be in front of the likes of BDC investors. But they have to go out of their way to get there. For example, she said the BDC partners attend events such as the Banff Venture Forum, the Canadian Financing Forum and the National Angel Capital Organization's annual summit, and she has assisted several Winnipeg companies by attending, and sometimes successfully pitching at, those events. \"Part of the purpose of going to those kinds of events is to connect with BDC venture people,\" she said. There is plenty of frustration in this community about the lack of a home-grown fund, or at least a domiciled representative of a fund in Winnipeg. Marshal Ring, CEO of Manitoba Technology Accelerator, said he understands relationships matter with venture capital funds, just like they do when conducting any kind of business. \"They (the BDC people) don't see the excitement at our community engagement events,\" he said. Ring said that's why he prefers developing local investors, who will also not be inclined to relocate the company. \"We want to keep the companies local,\" he said. \"Sending companies abroad to do cold pitches at VC competitions, I don't think is a sustainable economic development model.\" Of course, there are exceptions. Farmer's Edge, the brilliant, Winnipeg-based precision-farming data-management solutions company, just raised a $58-million round of financing led by Japanese global conglomerate, Mitsui & Co. Ltd ., Silicon Valley veterans Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and David Thomson 's (yes, that David Thomson ) Osminigton Inc. Two years ago, the Harper government launched the venture capital action plan with much fanfare, kicking in $400 million to leverage an additional $800 million from the private sector. The Canadian taxpayers' money has been placed in four different funds, all based in Ontario and Quebec. To date, none of that money has been placed in Manitoba. martin.cash@freepress.mb.ca"}, {"title": "Precision agriculture forecast to be $4B industry worldwide", "article": "It was no less than a candy store for farm geeks. There were tractors that chat with satellites. Top-flight drones that map bugs in cornfields. Laser probes that analyze soil, using the same technology used to suss out rocks from Mars. Precision agriculture - the hightech science of getting the most from farmland, and everything that goes into it - is forecast to become a $4-billion global industry within a few years. But it's more than mere gadgetry for the most serious practitioners, hundreds of whom gathered in London earlier this month - in the centre of one of Canada's richest farm belts - to share their cool tools and ideas. Southwestern Ontario has become \"such a big part of Canadian agriculture,\" it's only natural that it be a groundbreaker in precision agriculture too, said Joe Dales of farms.com, an agriculture and technology firm that organized the two-day conference. Precision agriculture aims to integrate every aspect of a farm so it uses the seed, land, fertilizers, weed-control and equipment most productively. \"We're all trying to help farmers do their jobs better,\" said Dales. Making an official debut at the conference was LaserAg, a company that boasts the same technology that the Mars rover Curiosity uses to analyze the mineral composition of rock samples from the red planet. On Earth, LaserAg is a new type of soil analysis that sends thousands of pulses of light through soil to determine its exact composition of nutrients and minerals. Each soil sample is unique, \"like a fingerprint,\" and its accompanying algorithm can then help a farmer decide what to plant, and what to add - or not - to the soil, and when and where, said agronomist Jacques Nault of Logiag, its developer. It's faster and cleaner than the traditional method of soil sampling in labs, Nault said. LaserAg had its commercial beginnings in Quebec only a few months ago. In the 1980s, when farmers first started looking for computer-aided ways to improve productivity, they used four-wheelers and cumbersome radar technology to map their fields, said Paul Schrimpf, who heads Precision Ag Magazine. But for years it was golly geewizardry, rather than commercially viable. As technologies evolved, the specialized landscape became \"kind of a mess\" with a patchwork quilt of processes that couldn't talk with each other, with overly specialized uses and technology for its own sake, and with what Schrimpf called \"solutions in search of a problem.\" But it's more standardized now, and more easily used in the field on smartphones with high-speed Internet connections and data that can be integrated into everyday farming use. He estimates the worldwide potential of precision ag is so promising, it'll be in the billions by 2018."}, {"title": "Press Release: Agrium Announces Upcoming Renewal of Normal Course Issuer Bid", "article": "Agrium Announces Upcoming Renewal of Normal Course Issuer Bid CALGARY, AB--(Marketwired - February 17, 2016) - Agrium Inc.

The global biostimulants market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 13.12% over the period 2015-2019. The most widely used method for testing the effectiveness of biostimulants, the bioassay, faces a few challenges. For instance, it does not consider many of the factors that affect biostimulant efficiency such as climatic conditions, processing, and timing of extraction. In order to deal with this problem, the global biostimulants market is moving toward the adoption of high throughput image analysis. This technology helps to examine the effect of biostimulants on the roots and areal component of plants. Hence, traditional bioassays can be associated with high throughput analysis, this collaborative approach will help in mapping the gap faced with bioassays. According to the report, precision farming is a site-specific crop management concept that helps farmers to optimize results from inputs. The aim of precision farming is to manage, measure, and respond to field variability in crops by using data analysis. It helps in the judicious use of biostimulants while minimizing the use of chemical fertilizers. It ensures sustainable production of crops with minimum wastage and harm to the environment. Precision farming is heavily practiced in North America and Latin America, especially in the US, Canada, and Brazil. Hence, precision farming is driving the growth of the global biostimulants market. Further, the report states that managing the variability of the efficiency of biostimulants under different conditions is a challenge hindering the growth of the global biostimulants market.

Report Highlights Precision agriculture tackles the variability inherent in farming systems to improve productivity and profitability and to reduce risks and environmental impact. It involves the application of information and communications technology software and hardware to farming. Integrated systems cycle through data collection, its use in decision-support models and enterprise management, operations, and analysis and evaluation. To date, commercial applications of precision agriculture have been strongly biased towards crop nutrition, based on mapping of soil types, crop yield and variable rate fertilizer application. However, precision farming technologies for crop protection are being taken-up on farms and are the focus of this report. The development and implementation of precision farming has been made possible by GPS (and other satellite systems) and geographic information systems (GIS). These technologies enable data collected in real-time to be linked with accurate position information. Remote sensing is the detection and/or identification of an object(s) or landscape without direct contact. Operations may be conducted at various altitudes, e.g. by satellites, aircraft or drones. Common forms include colour and infrared aerial photography, satellite imaging and radar sensing. UAVs or drones offer the potential for rapid assessment and high-resolution imagery. Remote sensing can be used to create images and maps.

(TSX:AGU) (NYSE:AGU) announced today 2015 fourth quarter net earnings from continuing operations of $200-million ($1.45 diluted earnings per share), compared to $70-million ($0.46 diluted earnings per share) in the fourth quarter of 2014. The increased net earnings were driven by strong performance from our Wholesale business unit, which achieved reduced cost of production and higher overall sales volumes for all three nutrients. Retail's fourth quarter earnings were also higher than last year, despite the wet weather in the U.S. during the fall application season. On an annual basis, 2015 net earnings from continuing operations were $988-millon ($6.98 diluted earnings per share) compared to $798-millon ($5.51 diluted earnings per share) in 2014. Highlights: Fourth quarter adjusted net earnings of $209-million or $1.52 per share (see page 2 for adjusted net earnings reconciliation)1, the second highest fourth quarter results on record. Our results include an $18-million restructuring expense ($0.10 per share) associated with the portfolio review and cost reduction measures undertaken, which was not included in the adjusted net earnings reconciliation on page 2. Wholesale's fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA2 of $372-million demonstrates improved nitrogen and potash production performance, delivering higher sales volumes and significantly lower production costs. The Canpotex proving run for the Vanscoy expansion was highly successful. We demonstrated our nameplate capacity within a year of mechanical completion, which increased our allocation to 10.3 percent of total Canpotex shipments starting in 2016. Retail EBITDA2 was higher than the same quarter last year as a result of strong year-end rebates for crop protection products and seed as well as lower operating expenses as a result of cost reduction initiatives implemented in 2015. On an annual basis, Retail U.S. normalized comparable store sales was up 2 percent versus a 2 percent decline in 2014. On an annual basis, 2015 free cash flow3 increased to $1.2-billion, or $8.59 per share, compared to $841-million, or $5.85 per share in 2014. Agrium has announced a 2016 annual guidance range of $5.50 to $7.00 diluted earnings per share (see page 3 for further details). \"Agrium achieved a strong finish to 2015, despite lower nutrient prices and challenging commodity markets. A key differentiator for the company was our integrated strategy, which helped provide stability in our earnings. We also benefited from the proactive steps we took to further strengthen the company over the past year, including a renewed focus on execution and controlling our controllables. These benefits flowed through to our bottom line, helped us to generate $8.59 of free cash flow per share and drive increased returns to shareholders, while still investing in future earnings growth,\" commented Chuck Magro, Agrium's President and CEO. 1Quarter effective tax rate of 20 percent used for adjusted net earnings and per share calculations. These are non-IFRS measures which represent net earnings adjusted for certain income (expenses) that are considered to be non-operational in nature. We believe these measures provide meaningful comparison to the earnings of other companies by eliminating share-based payments expense (recovery), gains (losses) on foreign exchange and related gains (losses) on non-qualifying derivative hedges and significant non-operating, non-recurring items. These should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS and may not be directly comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. 2EBITDA is earnings (loss) from continuing operations before finance costs, income taxes, depreciation and amortization while Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA before finance costs, income taxes, depreciation and amortization of joint ventures.

We remain focused on Operational Excellence and our growth strategy, controlling what we can in order to reduce our cost position, while continuing to optimize and grow our more stable Retail operations,\" added Mr. Magro. MARKET OUTLOOK The macroeconomic environment has continued to be challenging for commodities, resulting in many commodities trading at multi-year lows in early 2016. While agricultural commodities are driven by unique supply and demand fundamentals, prices have not escaped the general negative sentiment toward commodities. In addition to this, the prices of most crops have been pressured by another year of high global crop yields in 2015, allowing the global inventories of many major grains and oilseeds to increase. Furthermore, the strength in the U.S. dollar relative to most other global currencies has increased the competitiveness of non-U.S. growers, which has led to lower than expected U.S. grain and oilseed exports and added pressure on prices. Despite the weak macroeconomic environment, we expect growers within North America and other major agricultural markets will plant historically high crop acreage again in 2016, supporting robust crop input demand. In the U.S., growers are expected to increase overall crop acreage, including a one to three million acre increase in corn area, as significant crop acreage was lost in 2015 due to excess moisture in parts of the U.S. Corn Belt. Outside of the U.S., the weakness in domestic currencies has led to relatively attractive domestic crop prices, which is expected to support planted acreage. Analysts project that North American corn, soybean, cotton and canola acreage could increase in 2016 if weather cooperates, which is supportive of overall seed demand, but like 2015, growers may be more discerning in trait selection to optimize for yield depending on field locations. Crop protection prices are expected to be relatively stable and we expect that lower year-over-year cash rents and significantly lower fuel and crop nutrient prices will provide support for North American crop input expenditures in 2016. Crop nutrient prices have declined over the past few months, driven by a combination of supply and demand factors. The fall application season in the U.S. was expected to be supported by the relatively early end of the harvest season; however the same warm weather that supported a rapid harvest delayed fall ammonia applications because soil temperatures were too high. Following the warm start, the ability of growers to apply nutrients was constrained by persistent wet weather. November 2015 was the wettest November in the U.S. since 1985 and December 2015 was the wettest December on record in addition to being the warmest. The combination of wet and warm weather meant that application equipment could not get into the field to apply crop nutrients, resulting in below-expected fall applications. The lower than expected fall applications left crop nutrient inventories at higher than expected levels throughout the supply chain and pressured prices of all crop nutrients. The combination of expected increase in U.S. corn acreage and the poor fall application season is anticipated to result in strong U.S. crop nutrient demand in the first half of 2016. Based on expected crop acreage, North American crop nutrient demand is expected to increase by 1 to 3 percent in 2015/2016, but phosphate and potash demand may fall below that range as volumes lost due to the poor fall season may not be fully made up in the first half of 2016. Global urea prices have declined significantly below the cost of production of the high-cost Chinese producers. Even so, Chinese urea production has remained surprisingly strong. While Chinese urea production has not declined as much as expected, Chinese urea exports declined by 26 percent year-over-year in the second half of 2015. Chinese urea costs have declined due to lower coal prices and the weakened yuan, but costs have not declined as much as urea prices. As a result of the continued price weakness and increased non-Chinese urea supplies, Chinese urea exports are projected to decline from 2015 levels to between 12.5 and 13.5 million tonnes in 2016. We expect that the combination of poor Chinese urea profitability and strong North American demand will support urea prices entering the spring season. Chinese phosphate supplies have also pressured that market. Chinese diammonium phosphate and monoammonium phosphate exports reached a record 10.6 million tonnes in 2015 and are expected to remain relatively flat in 2016. On the demand side, the Brazilian market for crop nutrients continued to fall short of expectations in late 2015 as credit constraints and the weak value of the Brazilian real pressured demand for all nutrients. Given that these challenges remain, we expect 2016 Brazilian import demand for all products to remain relatively flat to 2015. The below-average Indian monsoon and weak rupee value pressured demand for phosphate and potash in late 2015, while 2015 urea imports set a record, all of which has led to building inventories and the belief that Indian import demand will be relatively low to start 2016. Global potash markets have been under pressure recently due to a combination of factors, including the sizeable shift in global currencies, a build-up of global inventories due to strong shipments earlier in the year, Indian demand impacted by the below average monsoon and buyers delaying purchases due to the current price uncertainty. We anticipate solid potash demand in global markets in 2016, with global shipments expected to come in between 58 to 60 million tonnes in 2016, relative to the 58.5 million tonnes shipped in 2015. We expect macroeconomic challenges in combination with current crop prices to be a risk in 2016. However, the arrival of the Northern Hemisphere's spring application season over the next couple of months is expected to result in improved demand, particularly in light of the poor fall season in the U.S. and the fact declining crop nutrient prices have caused buyers around the world to sit back and wait for stability. We also expect there will be a supply response across all three major nutrients in reaction to current price levels - some of which we have seen already in the form of production cuts and closures. 2016 ANNUAL GUIDANCE Based on our Market Outlook, Agrium expects to achieve annual diluted earnings per share of $5.50 to $7.00 in 2016. We have maintained a range encompassing approximately $300-million of EBITDA variability to reflect the risk and opportunity associated with crop nutrient prices and demand for crop inputs. We are assuming normal spring and fall application seasons, recognizing there is always a risk that inclement weather could affect the timing and duration of each season. Our earnings per share guidance assumes some recovery from current nitrogen prices during the key application seasons. Based on these and other assumptions regarding crop nutrient prices and demand for crop nutrients set out under the heading \"Market Outlook\", we expect Retail EBITDA to be $1.075-billion to $1.175-billion, and Retail nutrient sales volumes to be 9.8 to 10.2 million tonnes in 2016. Based on our expected increase in utilization rate for our nitrogen assets, we anticipate nitrogen production to total 3.5 to 3.7 million tonnes. Agrium has continued its active hedging program for our gas requirements in 2016 as we expect natural gas prices to remain at levels consistent with 2015. Our earnings per share guidance assumes NYMEX gas prices will be between $2.05 and $2.85 per MMBtu in 2016. Agrium's expectation for potash production in 2016 includes incremental production from the completed expansion at our Vanscoy mine. We expect to produce between 2.4 and 2.6 million tonnes of potash in 2016. Total capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $800-million to $900-million, of which approximately $500-million to $550-million is expected to be sustaining capital expenditures. Our investing capital program planned for 2016 includes the completion of our Borger brownfield urea expansion. Agrium's annual effective tax rate for 2016 is expected to be 27 to 28 percent, consistent with 2015. This guidance and updated additional measures and related assumptions are summarized in the following table. Guidance excludes the impact of share-based payments expense (recovery), gains (losses) on foreign exchange and related non-qualifying derivative hedges and significant non-operating, non-recurring items. 2015 Fourth Quarter Operating Results Improved utilization rates in our nitrogen and potash segments led to an increase in product available for sale and higher overall Wholesale sales volumes. Realized selling prices, on the other hand, decreased as a result of weaker market conditions. Reduced sales of product purchased for resale contributed to the decrease in sales as Agrium exited non-core, low return portions of this business. Wholesale's gross profit significantly increased due to manufacturing cost efficiencies associated with higher production volumes, reduced overall fixed costs and lower natural gas input costs for the fourth quarter compared to the same periods last year. Retail's sales and gross profit decreased for the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year primarily due to unfavorable weather conditions and the closure of one of our livestock export businesses in Australia. A decrease in gross profit was partially offset by higher rebates received in the fourth quarter of 2015. Expenses General and administrative expenses decreased by $4-million (5 percent) for the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year as a result of reduced payroll and office expenses related to our ongoing Operational Excellence program. Our share-based payments expense was lower by $10-million due primarily to a slight decrease in our share price in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to a share price increase in the fourth quarter of 2014. In the fourth quarter of 2015, other expenses increased by $18-million due to the following: Costs of $18-million were incurred in the implementation of our Operational Excellence initiatives in the current quarter relating primarily to severance and closure costs. We recorded a goodwill impairment of $19-million for our Wholesale Europe operations. We recognized a $17-million gain from the sale of our West Sacramento nitrogen upgrade facility. We had losses of $15-million on natural gas derivatives in the fourth quarter of 2014, which we recorded directly to other expenses. 2015 did not have comparable results, as effective January 1, 2015, we began to designate all of our natural gas derivatives as qualifying hedges for accounting purposes. Related gains or losses are now recorded as part of cost of product sold when we sell the related product, while unrealized gains or losses are recorded in equity. Bad debt recovery of $11-million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014. Effective Tax Rate The effective tax rate on continuing operations of 20 percent for the fourth quarter was higher than the tax rate of (4) percent for the comparative quarter in 2014 due to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax assets in the fourth quarter of 2014. Excluding the recognition of the one-time previously unrecognized tax assets, the effective tax rate would have been 19 percen BUSINESS SEGMENT PERFORMANCE Retail sales and gross profit during the quarter were lower than the same period last year due to lower crop input prices and wet weather across the U.S. impacting the fall application season. Total Retail selling expenses decreased by 10 percent compared to the prior year due to lower depreciation and amortization, the impact of currency valuations in our international businesses and cost reduction measures taken across the business in 2015. Total EBITDA increased 10 percent over the fourth quarter of 2014 primarily due to lower selling expenses, strong margins for crop protection products and improved seed results. Regionally, all key geographies performed well. Canada and the U.S. both showed higher fourth quarter EBITDA figures. Australian EBITDA was down slightly compared to the prior year; however, EBIT in Australia increased compared to the prior quarter due to a reduction in depreciation and amortization. Our U.S. Retail business also reported an annual 2 percent increase in normalized comparable store sales versus a decrease of 2 percent in 2014. Crop nutrients Total crop nutrient sales were 13 percent lower compared to the same period last year due to weaker global pricing and lower application volumes due to weather challenges. However, crop nutrient margins per tonne improved, which offset the lower volumes and resulted in only a 1 percent decline in gross profit. Total crop nutrient volumes were 6 percent lower this quarter across our Retail operations compared to the same period last year. Volumes were lower in the U.S. due to excess rain in the fall application window, while in Canada and Australia; growers were conservative given the uncertainty over nutrient and agricultural markets. Total crop nutrient margins increased slightly on a per tonne basis and gross profit as a percentage of sales rose from 16 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014 to 18 percent this quarter reflecting a focus on inventory management. Crop protection products Total crop protection sales were down 2 percent this quarter, as slightly higher sales in North America were offset by lower sales in our International operations. U.S. sales were driven by a strong herbicide application season, while Canadian growers purchased higher volumes ahead of the weakening Canadian dollar. In Australia, sales were lower due to the weakening of the Australian dollar against the U.S. dollar; in local currency, Australian sales were higher in the current quarter. Crop protection margins as a percentage of sales increased 3 percent, primarily due to year-end rebate reconciliation and a higher margin product mix in the current quarter. Proprietary product sales as a percentage of total sales increased 2 percent compared to the same period in the prior year. Seed Seed sales were down 18 percent this quarter compared to the same period last year, primarily due to the significant reduction in planted wheat acres in the U.S. due to wet weather and lower wheat prices. Despite lower sales, seed margins increased 8 percent compared to the prior year due to strong supplier rebates and seed sales mix. Merchandise Merchandise sales decreased compared to the same period last year as a result of lower fuel pricing and demand in Canada and lower animal health and fencing product sales in Australia due to dry conditions. Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased 3 percent this quarter, primarily due to a reduction in the lower-margin Canadian fuel business compared to the prior year. Services and other Sales for services and other was down 35 percent this quarter, due mainly to the closure of one of our livestock export businesses in Australia. Application and other services were down in North America, due to the wet conditions in the U.S. during the fall application season. Wholesale Wholesale successfully completed its Canpotex proving run for the Vanscoy potash expansion at the end of the fourth quarter, resulting in our annual Canpotex allocation increasing to 10.3 percent in 2016 from 7.3 percent in 2015. Higher operating production rates at our nitrogen facilities also supported increased sales volumes this quarter. Total sales were slightly lower this quarter due to lower global nutrient prices and our decision to sell non-core, lower-return purchase for resale facilities in 2015 related to our asset portfolio review. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $222-million this quarter, and more than doubled compared to the same quarter last year. The increase was primarily due to lower production costs per tonne and higher utilization rates from our potash and nitrogen operations. Nitrogen Nitrogen gross profit increased by 65 percent over the same period last year as a result of higher sales volumes and significantly lower cost of production. Sales volumes increased by 4 percent over the same period last year, driven by stronger urea and ammonia sales volumes. The increase was due to strong demand in our core markets and higher on-stream time at our production facilities, creating additional product availability compared to the same period last year. Sales volumes were partly impacted by a narrow window for ammonia application in the U.S. and lower nitrogen solution sales volumes due to the closure and subsequent sale of our West Sacramento upgrading facility in 2015. Cost of product sold per tonne was 40 percent lower than the same period last year. Operational improvements and higher on-stream time compared to the same period last year decreased fixed costs per tonne, while lower natural gas costs reduced variable costs. The weaker Canadian dollar also reduced operating costs at our Canadian plants. Nitrogen margins were $204 per tonne, a $76 per tonne increase over the same period last year, despite a 12 percent reduction in average selling prices. Potash Potash gross profit this quarter was $113-million higher than the same period last year. The significant increase was due to higher production volumes and lower costs this quarter after the completion of the Vanscoy expansion project as compared to the significant outage in the fourth quarter of 2014 in order to tie-in the expansion, which resulted in a negative gross profit of $50-million. Sales volumes were 637,000 tonnes higher compared to the same period in the prior year. Production volumes this quarter were 691,000 tonnes and the Canpotex proving run was completed successfully before the end of 2015. We expect Agrium's new Canpotex allotment will be 10.3 percent of Canpotex's total annual international shipments. Realized selling prices were lower than the same period last year due to slow spot market demand in both domestic and international markets. Cost of product sold was reduced as a result of cost efficiencies associated with the ramp-up of the Vanscoy expansion compared to the outage last year for the final tie-in of the expansion project. The significant weakening of the Canadian dollar also reduced production costs reported in U.S. dollars. As a result, cash cost of product manufactured continues to improve and was $64 per tonne this quarter compared to $89 per tonne in the third quarter of 2015. Phosphate Sales volumes were slightly higher than last year, while reduced selling prices were largely offset by lower cost of production. As a result, phosphate margin per tonne was only 6 percent lower than the same quarter last year. Phosphate gross profit was unchanged from the prior year. Wholesale Other Gross profit for Wholesale's Other product category increased this quarter primarily due to higher ammonium sulfate sales volumes and higher ESN margins resulting from lower cost of product sold. This was partly offset by lower ESN realized selling prices. Expenses Expenses in the current quarter were $13-million lower than the same period last year as a result of lower selling and general administrative expenses and a $17-million gain on sale of the West Sacramento upgrading facility. Partially offsetting this is a $19-million goodwill impairment in our European purchase for resale business resulting from ongoing portfolio review in 2015. Other EBITDA for our Other non-operating business unit for the fourth quarter of 2015 had a net expense of $92-million, compared to a net expense of $78-million for the fourth quarter of 2014. The variance was due to the following: $7-million higher gross profit elimination expense as a result of higher inter-segment inventory held at the end of the fourth quarter of 2015 Increase of $12-million in other expenses of our Other business unit primarily due to costs incurred in implementing our Operational Excellence initiatives including severance and closure costs $10-million lower share-based payments expenses due primarily to a slight decrease in our share price in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to a share price increase in the same period last year NORMAL COURSE ISSUER BID In January 2015, the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) accepted Agrium's notice of intention to make a normal course issuer bid (NCIB) whereby Agrium may purchase up to 7,185,866 common shares on the TSX and New York Stock Exchange from January 26, 2015 to January 25, 2016.

THE INDUSTRY Mining Facts Minerals and metals are the building blocks of the computers and smartphones we rely on, of the vehicles and public transit that get us places, of the buildings where we live and work, and of green technologies that help make the world a more sustainable place. Just as we as individuals depend on mining to support our daily lives, Canada relies on the industry to keep the economy humming. Mining is one of Canada's most important economic sectors and a major job creator. A major employer: Approximately 380,000 people across Canada work in the mining and mineral processing industries. Mining is the largest private sector employer of Aboriginal peoples in Canada on a proportional basis, and employment is poised to increase. Canada has one of the largest mining supply sectors globally with more than 3,400 companies supplying engineering, geotechnical, environmental, financial and other services to mining operations. Those who work in mining enjoy the highest wages and salaries of all industrial sectors in Canada with an average annual pay exceeding $110,000, which surpassed the average earnings of workers in forestry, manufacturing, finance and construction by a range of $31,000 to $46,000 for those sectors. An economic engine: Mining contributed $54 billion to Canada's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2013. The industry accounted for 19.6% of the value of Canadian goods exports in 2013. Canada's value of mineral production was nearly $43.6 billion in 2013. The mining industry's payments to Canadian federal and provincial governments total $71 billion in taxes and royalties over the last decade (2003-2012). A global leader: Thanks to its rich geology, Canada is one of the largest mining nations in the world producing more than 60 minerals and metals. Canada ranks in the top five countries in the global production of 11 major minerals and metals: First in potash Second in uranium and cobalt Third in aluminum and tungsten Fourth in platinum group metals, sulphur and titanium Fifth in nickel and diamonds 57% of the world's public mining companies are listed on the TSX and TSX-Venture Exchanges. Together, the two exchanges handled 48% of global mining equity transactions in 2013, and accounted for 46% of global mining equity capital for that year. Globally, Canada is recognized for its leadership in safety and sustainability. Mining companies in Canada were the first in the world to develop an externally-verified performance system for sustainable mining practices with the creation of MAC's Towards Sustainable Mining initiative in 2004."}, {"title": "Press Release: AgJunction Q4 2015 Conference Call Notice", "article": "AgJunction Q4 2015 Conference Call Notice Canada NewsWire HIAWATHA, KS, Feb. 12, 2016 HIAWATHA, KS, Feb. 12, 2016 /CNW/ - (TSX: AJX) - AgJunction Inc. will release financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2015 following the close of trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Monday March 28, 2016.

(TSX:AGU) (NYSE:AGU) announced today 2015 fourth quarter net earnings from continuing operations of $200-million, compared to $70-million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The increased net earnings were driven by strong performance from our Wholesale business unit, which achieved reduced cost of production and higher overall sales volumes for all three nutrients. Retail's fourth quarter earnings were also higher than last year, despite the wet weather in the U.S. during the fall application season. On an annual basis, 2015 net earnings from continuing operations were $988-millon ($6.98 diluted earnings per share) compared to $798-millon ($5.51 diluted earnings per share) in 2014. Our results include an $18-million restructuring expense ($0.10 per share) associated with the portfolio review and cost reduction measures undertaken, which was not included in the adjusted net earnings reconciliation on page 2. Wholesale's fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA2 of $372-million demonstrates improved nitrogen and potash production performance, delivering higher sales volumes and significantly lower production costs. The Canpotex proving run for the Vanscoy expansion was highly successful. We demonstrated our nameplate capacity within a year of mechanical completion, which increased our allocation to 10.3 percent of total Canpotex shipments starting in 2016. Retail EBITDA2 was higher than the same quarter last year as a result of strong year-end rebates for crop protection products and seed as well as lower operating expenses as a result of cost reduction initiatives implemented in 2015. On an annual basis, Retail U.S. normalized comparable store sales was up 2 percent versus a 2 percent decline in 2014. On an annual basis, 2015 free cash flow3 increased to $1.2-billion, or $8.59 per share, compared to $841-million, or $5.85 per share in 2014. Agrium has announced a 2016 annual guidance range of $5.50 to $7.00 diluted earnings per share. 'Agrium achieved a strong finish to 2015, despite lower nutrient prices and challenging commodity markets. A key differentiator for the company was our integrated strategy, which helped provide stability in our earnings. We also benefited from the proactive steps we took to further strengthen the company over the past year, including a renewed focus on execution and controlling our controllables. These benefits flowed through to our bottom line, helped us to generate $8.59 of free cash flow per share and drive increased returns to shareholders, while still investing in future earnings growth,' commented Chuck Magro, Agrium's President and CEO. 1Quarter effective tax rate of 20 percent used for adjusted net earnings and per share calculations.

MARKET OUTLOOK The macroeconomic environment has continued to be challenging for commodities, resulting in many commodities trading at multi-year lows in early 2016. While agricultural commodities are driven by unique supply and demand fundamentals, prices have not escaped the general negative sentiment toward commodities. In addition to this, the prices of most crops have been pressured by another year of high global crop yields in 2015, allowing the global inventories of many major grains and oilseeds to increase. Furthermore, the strength in the U.S. dollar relative to most other global currencies has increased the competitiveness of non-U.S. growers, which has led to lower than expected U.S. grain and oilseed exports and added pressure on prices. Despite the weak macroeconomic environment, we expect growers within North America and other major agricultural markets will plant historically high crop acreage again in 2016, supporting robust crop input demand. In the U.S., growers are expected to increase overall crop acreage, including a one to three million acre increase in corn area, as significant crop acreage was lost in 2015 due to excess moisture in parts of the U.S. Corn Belt. Outside of the U.S., the weakness in domestic currencies has led to relatively attractive domestic crop prices, which is expected to support planted acreage. Analysts project that North American corn, soybean, cotton and canola acreage could increase in 2016 if weather cooperates, which is supportive of overall seed demand, but like 2015, growers may be more discerning in trait selection to optimize for yield depending on field locations. Crop protection prices are expected to be relatively stable and we expect that lower year-over-year cash rents and significantly lower fuel and crop nutrient prices will provide support for North American crop input expenditures in 2016. Crop nutrient prices have declined over the past few months, driven by a combination of supply and demand factors. The fall application season in the U.S. was expected to be supported by the relatively early end of the harvest season; however the same warm weather that supported a rapid harvest delayed fall ammonia applications because soil temperatures were too high. Following the warm start, the ability of growers to apply nutrients was constrained by persistent wet weather. November 2015 was the wettest November in the U.S. since 1985 and December 2015 was the wettest December on record in addition to being the warmest. The combination of wet and warm weather meant that application equipment could not get into the field to apply crop nutrients, resulting in below-expected fall applications. The lower than expected fall applications left crop nutrient inventories at higher than expected levels throughout the supply chain and pressured prices of all crop nutrients. The combination of expected increase in U.S. corn acreage and the poor fall application season is anticipated to result in strong U.S. crop nutrient demand in the first half of 2016. Based on expected crop acreage, North American crop nutrient demand is expected to increase by 1 to 3 percent in 2015/2016, but phosphate and potash demand may fall below that range as volumes lost due to the poor fall season may not be fully made up in the first half of 2016. Global urea prices have declined significantly below the cost of production of the high-cost Chinese producers. Even so, Chinese urea production has remained surprisingly strong. While Chinese urea production has not declined as much as expected, Chinese urea exports declined by 26 percent year-over-year in the second half of 2015. Chinese urea costs have declined due to lower coal prices and the weakened yuan, but costs have not declined as much as urea prices. As a result of the continued price weakness and increased non-Chinese urea supplies, Chinese urea exports are projected to decline from 2015 levels to between 12.5 and 13.5 million tonnes in 2016. We expect that the combination of poor Chinese urea profitability and strong North American demand will support urea prices entering the spring season. Chinese phosphate supplies have also pressured that market. Chinese diammonium phosphate and monoammonium phosphate exports reached a record 10.6 million tonnes in 2015 and are expected to remain relatively flat in 2016. On the demand side, the Brazilian market for crop nutrients continued to fall short of expectations in late 2015 as credit constraints and the weak value of the Brazilian real pressured demand for all nutrients. Given that these challenges remain, we expect 2016 Brazilian import demand for all products to remain relatively flat to 2015. The below-average Indian monsoon and weak rupee value pressured demand for phosphate and potash in late 2015, while 2015 urea imports set a record, all of which has led to building inventories and the belief that Indian import demand will be relatively low to start 2016. Global potash markets have been under pressure recently due to a combination of factors, including the sizeable shift in global currencies, a build-up of global inventories due to strong shipments earlier in the year, Indian demand impacted by the below average monsoon and buyers delaying purchases due to the current price uncertainty. We anticipate solid potash demand in global markets in 2016, with global shipments expected to come in between 58 to 60 million tonnes in 2016, relative to the 58.5 million tonnes shipped in 2015. We expect macroeconomic challenges in combination with current crop prices to be a risk in 2016. However, the arrival of the Northern Hemisphere's spring application season over the next couple of months is expected to result in improved demand, particularly in light of the poor fall season in the U.S. and the fact declining crop nutrient prices have caused buyers around the world to sit back and wait for stability. We also expect there will be a supply response across all three major nutrients in reaction to current price levels - some of which we have seen already in the form of production cuts and closures. 2016 ANNUAL GUIDANCE Based on our Market Outlook, Agrium expects to achieve annual diluted earnings per share of $5.50 to $7.00 in 2016. We have maintained a range encompassing approximately $300-million of EBITDA variability to reflect the risk and opportunity associated with crop nutrient prices and demand for crop inputs. We are assuming normal spring and fall application seasons, recognizing there is always a risk that inclement weather could affect the timing and duration of each season. Our earnings per share guidance assumes some recovery from current nitrogen prices during the key application seasons. Based on these and other assumptions regarding crop nutrient prices and demand for crop nutrients set out under the heading 'Market Outlook', we expect Retail EBITDA to be $1.075-billion to $1.175-billion, and Retail nutrient sales volumes to be 9.8 to 10.2 million tonnes in 2016. Based on our expected increase in utilization rate for our nitrogen assets, we anticipate nitrogen production to total 3.5 to 3.7 million tonnes. Agrium has continued its active hedging program for our gas requirements in 2016 as we expect natural gas prices to remain at levels consistent with 2015. Our earnings per share guidance assumes NYMEX gas prices will be between $2.05 and $2.85 per MMBtu in 2016. Agrium's expectation for potash production in 2016 includes incremental production from the completed expansion at our Vanscoy mine. We expect to produce between 2.4 and 2.6 million tonnes of potash in 2016. Total capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $800-million to $900-million, of which approximately $500-million to $550-million is expected to be sustaining capital expenditures. Our investing capital program planned for 2016 includes the completion of our Borger brownfield urea expansion. Agrium's annual effective tax rate for 2016 is expected to be 27 to 28 percent, consistent with 2015.

The increased net earnings were driven by strong performance from our Wholesale business unit, which achieved reduced cost of production and higher overall sales volumes for all three nutrients. Retail's fourth quarter earnings were also higher than last year, despite the wet weather in the U.S. during the fall application season. On an annual basis, 2015 net earnings from continuing operations were $988-millon ($6.98 diluted earnings per share) compared to $798-millon ($5.51 diluted earnings per share) in 2014. Highlights:  \"Agrium achieved a strong finish to 2015, despite lower nutrient prices and challenging commodity markets. A key differentiator for the company was our integrated strategy, which helped provide stability in our earnings. We also benefited from the proactive steps we took to further strengthen the company over the past year, including a renewed focus on execution and controlling our controllables. These benefits flowed through to our bottom line, helped us to generate $8.59 of free cash flow per share and drive increased returns to shareholders, while still investing in future earnings growth,\" commented Chuck Magro, Agrium's President and CEO.

The variance was due to the following:  NORMAL COURSE ISSUER BID In January 2015, the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) accepted Agrium's notice of intention to make a normal course issuer bid (NCIB) whereby Agrium may purchase up to 7,185,866 common shares on the TSX and New York Stock Exchange from January 26, 2015 to January 25, 2016. In 2015, we purchased for cancellation 5,574,331 shares at an average share price of $100.25 for total consideration of $559-million. No shares were repurchased in 2016 to the date of expiry. OUTSTANDING SHARE DATA Agrium had 138,169,000 outstanding shares at January 31, 2016.  The agricultural products business is seasonal. Consequently, year-over-year comparisons are more appropriate than quarter-over-quarter comparisons. Crop input sales are primarily concentrated in the spring and fall crop input application seasons. Crop nutrient inventories are normally accumulated leading up to each application season. Our cash collections from accounts receivables generally occur after the application season is complete, and our customer prepayments are concentrated in December and January.

Latest Research Improving power quality in mining industries with a three-level active front end Luiz, Alex-Sander Amavel, de Jesus Cardoso Filho, Braz Abstract This paper deals with the power quality improvements that can be achieved in mining industries by the employment of a high power active front end. A three-level neutral-point-clamped rectifier with low harmonic distortion and high power factor is chosen alternatively to diode rectifiers. A constraint on this class of converters is its lower switching frequency that results in low order harmonics. This is often solved employing passive filters. In this paper an appropriate choice of modulator and filter topology leads to significant simplifications on the filter design and reduces both weight and cost of its elements. The Selective Harmonic Elimination is presented and though it is generally considered as a steady-state technique it was designed to work in transient conditions within a closed loop current control. The system is submitted to tests in order to assess its operational performance through simulation results. Experimental data from a prototype is also presented. The Industry Mining Facts Minerals and metals are the building blocks of the computers and smartphones we rely on, of the vehicles and public transit that get us places, of the buildings where we live and work, and of green technologies that help make the world a more sustainable place. Just as we as individuals depend on mining to support our daily lives, Canada relies on the industry to keep the economy humming. Mining is one of Canada's most important economic sectors and a major job creator. A major employer: Approximately 380,000 people across Canada work in the mining and mineral processing industries. Mining is the largest private sector employer of Aboriginal peoples in Canada on a proportional basis, and employment is poised to increase. Canada has one of the largest mining supply sectors globally with more than 3,400 companies supplying engineering, geotechnical, environmental, financial and other services to mining operations. Those who work in mining enjoy the highest wages and salaries of all industrial sectors in Canada with an average annual pay exceeding $110,000, which surpassed the average earnings of workers in forestry, manufacturing, finance and construction by a range of $31,000 to $46,000 for those sectors. An economic engine: Mining contributed $54 billion to Canada's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2013. The industry accounted for 19.6% of the value of Canadian goods exports in 2013. Canada's value of mineral production was nearly $43.6 billion in 2013. The mining industry's payments to Canadian federal and provincial governments total $71 billion in taxes and royalties over the last decade (2003-2012). A global leader: Thanks to its rich geology, Canada is one of the largest mining nations in the world producing more than 60 minerals and metals. Canada ranks in the top five countries in the global production of 11 major minerals and metals: First in potash Second in uranium and cobalt Third in aluminum and tungsten Fourth in platinum group metals, sulphur and titanium Fifth in nickel and diamonds 57% of the world's public mining companies are listed on the TSX and TSX-Venture Exchanges. Together, the two exchanges handled 48% of global mining equity transactions in 2013, and accounted for 46% of global mining equity capital for that year. Globally, Canada is recognized for its leadership in safety and sustainability. Mining companies in Canada were the first in the world to develop an externally-verified performance system for sustainable mining practices with the creation of MAC's Towards Sustainable Mining initiative in 2004. Leading Companies Agnico Eagle Mines Limited Agnico Eagle's mission is to run a high quality, easy to understand business, that generates superior long-term per share returns for our shareholders, creates a great place to work for our employees, and that is a leading contributor to the well-being of the communities in which we operate. Agnico Eagle Reports Record Third Quarter 2015 Gold Production; Strong Operating Performance Leads to Increased Production Guidance and Reduced Costs for 2015 October 28, 2015 Stock Symbol: AEM (NYSE and TSX) (All amounts expressed in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted) TORONTO, Oct. 28, 2015 /PRNewswire/ - Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (NYSE:AEM, TSX:AEM) (\"Agnico Eagle\" or the \"Company\") today reported quarterly net income of $1.3 million, or net income of $0.01 per share for the third quarter of 2015. This result includes losses on financial instruments of $16.6 million ($0.08 per share), a non-cash foreign currency translation loss on deferred tax liabilities of $8.1 million ($0.04 per share), various mark-to-market and other adjustment losses of $9.5 million ($0.04 per share), non-cash stock option expense of $4.1 million ($0.02 per share), non-cash foreign currency translation losses of $0.9 million (nil per share), and non-recurring gains of $1.3 million ($0.01 per share). Excluding these items would result in adjusted net income of $39.2 million or adjusted net income of $0.18 per share for the third quarter of 2015. In the third quarter of 2014, the Company reported a net loss of $15.1 million or a net loss of $0.07 per share. Based on the exploration success in the first half of the year at several of the Company's projects, it was previously announced that exploration expense would increase in the second half of the year. Total exploration expense for the third quarter was $37.1 million. As a result of this increased exploration expense the Amaruq project in Nunavut yielded a significant increase in inferred resources (see August 19, 2015 news release) and an initial resource is expected to be reported by mid-February 2016 at the El Barqueno project in Mexico. For the first nine months of 2015, the Company reported net income of $40.1 million, or $0.19 per share. This compares with the first nine months of 2014 when net income was $104.3 million, or $0.55 per share. Financial results in the 2015 period were negatively impacted by much higher investment in exploration (approximately 102% higher); lower gold prices (approximately 9% lower) and lower by-product metals revenues. Third quarter 2015 cash provided by operating activities was $143.7 million ($217.8 million before changes in non-cash components of working capital). This compares to cash provided by operating activities of $71.2 million in the third quarter of 2014 ($129.2 million before changes in non-cash components of working capital). The increase in cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital during the current period was mainly due to an increase of 26% in gold production. For the first nine months of 2015, cash provided by operating activities was $475.5 million ($547.4 million before changes in non-cash components of working capital), as compared with the first nine months of 2014 when cash provided by operating activities was $504.4 million ($472.8 million before changes in non-cash components of working capital). The increase in cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital during the period was mainly due to a 20% increase in gold production. \"In the third quarter of 2015, we set a new record for quarterly gold production and lowered unit costs which resulted in strong operating cash flow. This has allowed us to continue to invest in our exploration and development pipeline, which represents the long-term future of our business,\" said Sean Boyd, Agnico Eagle's Chief Executive Officer. \"Our increased level of exploration activity continues to pay dividends as witnessed by the new discoveries at Kittila, Amaruq and El Barqueno. These projects are expected to be significant contributors to our production profile in the coming years,\" added Mr. Boyd. Third Quarter 2015 Highlights Include: Strong performance of Abitibi operations drives record quarterly gold production and low costs - Payable gold production1 in the third quarter of 2015 was 441,124 ounces of gold at total cash costs2 per ounce on a by-product basis of $536 and all-in sustaining costs3 on a by-product basis (\"AISC\") of $759 per ounce Two new production records set at Canadian Malartic - New quarterly records were set for average tonnes processed per calendar day (53,703 tonnes on a 100% basis), and ounces of gold produced in a quarter (153,206 ounces on a 100% basis) 2015 production guidance increased and cost forecasts reduced - Expected gold production for 2015 is now forecast to be approximately 1.65 million ounces (previously 1.6 million ounces) with total cash costs on a by-product basis of approximately $590 to $610 per ounce (previously $600 to $620) and AISC of approximately $840 to $860 per ounce (previously $870 to $890) expected Amaruq drilling expands scope of known mineralization - Drilling indicates that the Whale Tail and Mammoth zones form a single mineralized system at least 2.3 kilometres long. In addition, the V zone (part of the IVR area) has been identified as a substantial mineralized structure, locally with abundant visible gold Drilling extends new parallel zone at Kittila - Two recent drill holes have confirmed continuity within the new parallel lens (now called the \"Sisar lens\"). Highlights include: 8.1 grams per tonne (\"g/t\") gold (uncapped) over 8.0 metres at 1,235 metres depth; and 5.5 g/t gold (uncapped) over 3.3 metres at 950 metres depth and 560 metres farther north along strike Improved financial flexibility - In the third quarter, the Company's credit facility was amended and $25 million was repaid. In addition, a 10-year, $50-million term note was issued to Ressources Quebec, a subsidiary of Investissement Quebec. Capital expenditures in 2015 are also forecast to be approximately $50 million lower than previously reported due to positive foreign currency adjustments and deferrals into future periods A quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share was declared Third Quarter Financial and Production Highlights In the third quarter of 2015, strong operational performance continued at the Company's mines. Payable gold production in the third quarter of 2015 was a record 441,124 ounces compared to 349,273 ounces in the third quarter of 2014. The higher level of production in the 2015 period was primarily due to increased throughput levels at LaRonde, Goldex and Canadian Malartic, increased mill capacity at Kittila and higher grades at LaRonde, Meadowbank, Goldex, Kittila, Pinos Altos and La India. A detailed description of the production and cost performance at each mine is set out below. Total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis for the third quarter of 2015 were lower at $536 compared to $716 per ounce for the third quarter of 2014. The reduction in total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis in the third quarter of 2015 was a result of higher silver production, higher gold production at the majority of the Company's mines and weaker local currencies compared to the third quarter of 2014. In the third quarter of 2015 the average value of the Canadian dollar, Euro and Mexican Peso were 8%, 4%, and 23% lower, respectively than the Company's 2015 currency price assumptions (see February 11, 2015 news release). Payable gold production for the first nine months of 2015 was 1,249,012 ounces, compared to payable gold production of 1,041,753 ounces in the comparable 2014 period (which only included 76,639 ounces from Canadian Malartic for production from June 16 to September 30, 2014). For the first nine months of 2015, total cash costs on a by-product basis were $574 per ounce. This compares with $627 per ounce on a by-product basis in the first nine months of 2014. The lower costs in the 2015 period are due to the higher levels of production and favourable currency movements compared to the 2014 period. AISC for the third quarter of 2015 was lower at $759 versus $1,059 per ounce for the third quarter of 2014. The lower AISC is primarily due to higher production, lower total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis, lower general and administrative expenditures and lower capital expenditures. For the first nine months of 2015, AISC was $808 versus $947 per ounce for the 2014 period. The lower AISC in the 2015 period is due to the same reasons set out above. Cash Position Remains Strong; Continued focus on Debt Reduction; Credit lines extended for an additional year through 2020 Cash and cash equivalents and short term investments increased to $208.1 million at September 30, 2015, from the June 30, 2015 balance of $164.0 million. The outstanding balance on the Company's $1.2 billion credit facility was reduced from $375 million at June 30, 2015 to $350 million at September 30, 2015. This results in available credit lines of approximately $850 million, not including the $300 million accordion facility. On September 30, 2015, the Company amended its $1.2 billion Credit Facility to extend the maturity date from June 22, 2019 to June 22, 2020 and improve the pricing terms. On September 30 2015, a private placement of a $50 million, 10-year senior unsecured note (the \"Note\") with a maturity of September 30, 2025 was completed with Ressources Quebec, a subsidiary of Investissement Quebec. The Company has agreed to use the net proceeds from the issuance of the Note at its mining projects in the Province of Quebec. Total capital expenditures made by the Company in the third quarter of 2015 were $122.4 million, including $24.8 million at Meliadine, $19.7 million at Meadowbank, $15.1 million at LaRonde, $14.1 million at Kittila, $13.3 million at Goldex, $12.5 million at Pinos Altos, $9.3 million at Canadian Malartic (50% basis), $7.0 million at La India, $1.2 million at Creston Mascota and $1.1 million at Lapa. Total capital expenditures for the first nine months of 2015 were $316.8 million including $50.6 million at LaRonde, $47.4 million at Meadowbank, $44.6 million at Meliadine, $41.8 million at Pinos Altos, $38.4 million at Kittila, $35.3 million at Goldex, $29.8 million at Canadian Malartic (50% basis), $15.5 million at La India, $5.5 million at Lapa and $1.6 million at Creston Mascota. Total sustaining capital expenditures made by the Company in the third quarter were $72.0 million, including $19.5 million at Meadowbank, $15.1 million at LaRonde, $10.6 million at Kittila, $8.2 million at Canadian Malartic (50% basis), $7.0 million at La India, $6.7 million at Pinos Altos, $2.6 million at Goldex, $1.2 million at Creston Mascota and $1.1 million at Lapa. Total sustaining capital expenditures for the first nine months of 2015 were $214.7 million including $50.6 million at LaRonde, $47.2 million at Meadowbank, $30.7 million at Kittila, $28.0 million at Canadian Malartic (50% basis), $24.0 million at Pinos Altos, $15.5 million at La India, $11.6 million at Goldex, $5.5 million at Lapa, and $1.6 million at Creston Mascota. For 2015, capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $489.0 million, representing approximately a $50 million decrease from the previously announced figure. The decrease is primarily due to favourable currency movements and capital expenditure deferrals into future periods. The Company recorded an income and mining taxes recovery of $15.3 million on the consolidated statements of income for the third quarter of 2015. This was primarily a result of applying effective tax rates on a regional tax basis which were well in excess of the statutory tax rate based on IFRS tax calculation methodology. The Company continues to guide an effective tax rate range between 40% and 45% for 2015. Revised 2015 Guidance - Production Increased and Costs Lowered As a result of strong operational performance in the third quarter of 2015, production guidance for 2015 has been increased to approximately 1.65 million ounces of gold (previously 1.6 million ounces) with total cash costs on a by-product basis of approximately $590 to $610 per ounce (previously $600 to $620) and AISC of approximately $840 to $860 per ounce (previously $870 to $890). NORTHERN BUSINESS OPERATING REVIEW ABITIBI REGION, QUEBEC Agnico Eagle is currently Quebec's largest gold producer with a 100% interest in three mines (LaRonde, Goldex and Lapa) and a 50% interest in the Canadian Malartic mine. These mines are located within 50 kilometres of each other, which provides operating synergies and allows for the sharing of technical expertise. LaRonde Mine - Increased Production Driven by Higher Grades in Lower Mining Area, Phase 1 Commissioning of Coarse Ore Conveyor Underway The 100% owned LaRonde mine in northwestern Quebec achieved commercial production in 1988. The LaRonde mill processed an average of 5,992 tonnes per day (\"tpd\") in the third quarter of 2015, compared with an average of 4,634 tpd in the corresponding period of 2014. Throughput in the 2014 period was lower due to an approximate four week shutdown related to the upgrade and commissioning of the production and service hoist drives at the Penna shaft. Minesite costs per tonne4 were approximately C$101 in the third quarter of 2015, lower than the C$111 per tonne experienced in the third quarter of 2014. The higher costs in the 2014 period were primarily due to the scheduled shutdown noted above. For the first nine months of 2015, the LaRonde mill processed an average of 6,145 tpd, compared to 5,668 tpd in the first nine months of 2014. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$101, compared to C$100 per tonne in the first nine months of 2014. LaRonde's total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis were $558 in the third quarter of 2015 on payable production of 71,860 ounces of gold. This compares with the third quarter of 2014 when total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis were $861 on production of 37,490 ounces of gold. Production in the 2015 period increased as a result of higher throughput and higher gold grades (primarily from the 293 mining pyramid) compared to the 2014 period. Costs in the 2015 period were lower due to higher gold production (partially offset by lower by-product revenues) and favourable foreign exchange rates. In the first nine months of 2015, LaRonde produced 194,760 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $620 on a by-product basis. This is in contrast with the first nine months of 2014 when the mine produced 145,336 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $701 on a by-product basis. Production in the 2015 period was higher and costs were lower due to the factors mentioned above. During the quarter, work was completed on the installation of the coarse ore conveyor system that extends from the 293 level to the crusher on the 280 level. The first phase of commissioning involving the discharge point and rock breaker is underway. The ore pass feeding the rock breaker is expected to be commissioned in the first quarter of 2016. The new conveyor should help to improve mining flexibility and reduce congestion in the deeper portions of the mine. Studies are continuing to assess the potential to extend the mineral reserves and carry out mining activities between the 311 and 371 levels at LaRonde. At present, the mineral reserves extend to the 311 level, which is 3.1 kilometres below the surface. Drilling is ongoing to further expand the known mineral resource between the 311 and 341 levels. Additional holes are also being drilled to evaluate the extent of the mineralization down to the 371 level (a depth of 3.7 kilometres below the surface). Canadian Malartic Mine - New Quarterly Production Records Established In June 2014, Agnico Eagle and Yamana Gold Inc. (\"Yamana\") acquired all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Osisko Mining Corporation (\"Osisko\") and created the Canadian Malartic General Partnership (the \"Partnership\"). The partnership owns and operates the Canadian Malartic mine in northwestern Quebec through a joint management committee. Each of Agnico Eagle and Yamana has an indirect 50% ownership interest in the Partnership. Canadian Malartic had very strong operational performance in the third quarter of 2015. New records were set for quarterly tonnes milled (4.94 million tonnes), tonnes processed per day (53,703 tonnes), and ounces produced (153,206 ounces on a 100% basis). On September 22, 2015, the mine poured its two millionth ounce of gold. During the third quarter of 2015, the Canadian Malartic mill processed an average of 53,703 tpd (on a 100% basis) compared with an average of 52,539 tpd in the corresponding period of 2014. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$22 (C$19.32 excluding royalties) compared to the C$22 (C$19.60 excluding royalties) per tonne experienced in the third quarter of 2014. The costs in the 2015 period were in line with the costs in the 2014 period. Throughput was higher in the 2015 period due to improved crusher operating time. The average stripping ratio in the third quarter of 2015 was 2.04 to 1.0. For the first nine months of 2015, the Canadian Malartic mill processed an average of 52,139 tpd compared with an average of 50,580 tpd in the corresponding period of 2014 (on a 100% basis). Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$23 (C$19.72 excluding royalties) compared to the C$22 (C$19.42 excluding royalties) per tonne experienced in the corresponding period of 2014. The 2014 tonnage and costs are not considered to be representative as they only reflect the period of June 16 through September 30. For the third quarter of 2015, Agnico Eagle's share of production at the Canadian Malartic mine was 76,603 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $544 on a by-product basis. This compares with the third quarter of 2014 when total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis were $735 on production of 64,761 ounces of gold. Production was higher in the 2015 period due to increased mill throughput and higher grades. Costs in the 2015 period were lower due to increased production and favourable foreign exchange rates. In the first nine months of 2015, Agnico Eagle's share of production at the Canadian Malartic mine was 212,937 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $593 on a by-product basis. This is in contrast with production from June 16 to September 30, 2014 which only included 76,639 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $717 on a by-product basis from Canadian Malartic. The Partnership continues to work on initiatives to optimize the operations. Current opportunities include: Improving SAG mill and crusher liners to attempt to reduce the number of planned shutdowns to three per year (currently four per year). New liners were installed in Q3 2015 Improving gyratory crusher availability by redirecting ore containing scrap steel to a separate crusher Maintaining mining throughput levels at two million tonnes per month in the North zone (which contains higher grades) Acquiring an additional remote excavator for use in the North zone Adding two larger production drills which is expected reduce drilling costs Increasing rate of waste rock backfilling of the Gouldie pit which reduces haulage distances and noise Permitting activities for the Barnat Extension and deviation of Highway 117 are continuing. An Environmental Impact Assessment (\"EIA\") for this project was submitted in February 2015. An initial series of questions were received by the Partnership, and final responses were submitted in September 2015. A second round of questions from the government is expected to be received later in the fourth quarter of 2015. Public hearings are then expected to be held in the spring of 2016, with receipt of the necessary permits potentially by year-end 2016. In parallel, the Partnership is currently working on the permitting for improving the efficiency and environmental performance of the existing mobile crusher. At this point, milling levels are expected to be approximately 53,000 tpd through year-end 2016. In March 2015, the Partnership increased its interest in the Malartic CHL property to 100% by acquiring the remaining 30% interest from Abitibi Royalties Inc. The Malartic CHL property adjoins the Canadian Malartic mine to the east and hosts part of the Odyssey North discovery. At the end of the third quarter of 2015, 28 holes (24,537 metres) of drilling had been completed on the Odyssey zones. Drilling and data compilation will continue in the fourth quarter. Update on Pandora and Kirkland Lake Projects Canadian Malartic Corporation, a company in which each of Agnico Eagle and Yamana has an indirect 50% interest, is exploring a portfolio of properties in the Kirkland Lake area of Ontario and the Pandora property in the Abitibi region of Quebec. In the Kirkland Lake area, an internal technical study on the Upper Beaver property is being reviewed. Elsewhere in the region, compilation work is ongoing and a select number of targets are being drilled. At Pandora, underground development on the 101-W exploration drift from the adjacent Lapa mine commenced in February 2015 and approximately 691 metres of development was completed by the end of the third quarter of 2015. For the full year, approximately 940 metres of development is planned. In mid-June 2015, underground drilling resumed from the 101-W exploration drift and approximately half of the proposed 2015 program (approximately 7,000 metres) was completed by the end of the third quarter. The focus of the current exploration program is to test for extensions to the Branch zone and C zone on the Pandora property. Lapa - Zulapa Z7 Zone Continues to Deliver Higher Grades and Recoveries The 100% owned Lapa mine in northwestern Quebec achieved commercial production in May 2009. The Lapa circuit, located at the LaRonde mill, processed an average of 1,583 tpd in the third quarter of 2015. This compares with an average of 1,703 tpd in the third quarter of 2014. Throughput in the 2015 period was lower because of downtime related to repairs carried out on the Lapa ball mill. Repairs were completed in August 2015. During the repair time, excess ore was stockpiled and there is sufficient mill capacity that should allow the Company to meet its annual throughput rate (tonnes and ounces) over the balance of 2015. Minesite costs per tonne were C$114 in the third quarter of 2015, compared to the C$104 in the third quarter of 2014. Costs in the 2015 period were higher due to mining at deeper depths and lower throughput compared to the same period in 2014. For the first nine months of 2015, the Lapa mill processed an average of 1,553 tpd, compared to 1,747 tpd in the first nine months of 2014. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$119, above the C$106 per tonne in the first nine months of 2014 due to the reasons explained above. Payable production in the third quarter of 2015 was 25,668 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $522. This compares with the third quarter of 2014, when production was 24,781 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $606. In the 2015 period, production was higher primarily due to better recoveries (up 8.7%) related to a higher component of free gold in the Zulapa Z7 ore zone. Costs were lower primarily due to increased production and favourable foreign exchange rates. In the first nine months of 2015, Lapa produced 71,038 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $581 on a by-product basis. This compares to the first nine months of 2014 when the mine produced 67,011 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $689 on a by-product basis. The higher production and lower costs in the 2015 period are due to the reasons outlined above. At Lapa, 2015 is the last full year of production based on the current life of mine plan. Commercial production is forecast to end at the mine in the third quarter of 2016, but exploration activities (primarily on the Pandora property) are expected to continue. The permanent employees are expected to be relocated to the Company's other operations where they will replace contract positions. Studies are underway to evaluate other internal opportunities to utilize the Lapa mill, which is located at the LaRonde Metallurgical complex. Goldex - Development Rates Expected to Double by Year End; M Zone Yields Better Than Expected Grades The 100% owned Goldex mine in northwestern Quebec began operation in 2008 but mining operations in the original orebody, the Goldex Extension Zone (\"GEZ\"), were suspended in October 2011. In July 2012, the M and E satellite zones were approved for development. Mining operations resumed on the M and E satellite zones in September 2013. Mining operations at GEZ remain suspended. The Goldex mill processed an average of 6,199 tpd in the third quarter of 2015. This compares with an average of 5,851 tpd in the third quarter of 2014. The higher throughput in the 2015 period was due to more mature mining fronts and productivity improvements compared to the 2014 period. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$34 in the third quarter of 2015, which was slightly higher than the C$32 per tonne experienced in the third quarter of 2014. The increased cost in the 2015 period is primarily due to increased development in the M3 and M4 zones and extensions to the E Zone. For the first nine months of 2015, the Goldex mill processed an average of 6,377 tpd, compared to 5,647 tpd in the first nine months of 2014. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$34 in the first nine months of 2015 which is in line with C$33 in first nine months of 2014. Payable gold production in the third quarter of 2015 was 32,068 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $479. This compares with the third quarter of 2014, when production was 27,611 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $582. The higher production in the 2015 period was largely due to increased tonnage and better grades (especially in the M Zone) and higher recoveries. The decrease in total cash costs in the 2015 period was largely a result of increased production and favourable foreign exchange rates compared to the 2014 period. In the first nine months of 2015, Goldex produced 87,780 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $546 on a by-product basis. This compares to the first nine months of 2014 when the mine produced 70,970 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $661 on a by-product basis. The higher production and lower costs in the 2015 period are due to the same reasons as outlined above. In late July 2015, the Company announced production approval for the Goldex Deep 1 project (see July 29, 2015 news release). Mining will focus on the lower part of the Dx zone and the top of the D zone from a depth of 850 metres to 1,200 metres (level 120). The Company plans to undertake development from the current Goldex infrastructure, with existing equipment and personnel. The planned mining method is long-hole stoping with cemented paste backfill, which is the same method currently used at Goldex M & E zones. Gold production from the Goldex Deep 1 project is currently expected to average in excess of 100,000 ounces per year from 2018 through 2024. In the third quarter of 2015, approximately 1,462 metres of development were carried out in the Deep zone. The ramp has now reached Level 115 on its way to an ultimate depth of level 120. In addition, full restoration of the surface ramp is expected to be completed by the end of this year. This ramp will improve on the ability to move equipment and supplies from the surface into the underground workings. The advancement of the Deep 1 project at Goldex also has the potential to unlock other significant value creating opportunities including: Potential for additional mineral resource conversion in the Deep 1 zone Potential for mining at the Deep 2 (below level 120) Potential to develop the South zone (a narrow high-grade zone accessible via Deep 1 infrastructure) Potential development of the Akasaba West deposit, which is approximately 30 kilometres to the East of Goldex An EIA on the Akasaba West deposit was submitted during the quarter, which allows the environmental review process to commence. The Company anticipates the EIA approval in late 2017 or early 2018. FINLAND AND SWEDEN Agnico Eagle's Kittila mine in Finland is the largest primary gold producer in Europe and hosts the Company's largest mineral reserves. Exploration activities continue to expand the mineral resources and studies are underway to evaluate the potential to cost-effectively increase production. Kittila - Focus Remains On Optimizing Future Production Levels and Exploration Potential of the New Parallel Zone The 100% owned Kittila mine in northern Finland achieved commercial production in 2009. The Kittila mill processed an average of 3,937 tpd in the third quarter of 2015 compared to the 2,559 tpd in the third quarter of 2014. Throughput in the 2014 period was lower due to a planned shutdown to complete the mill expansion. Minesite costs per tonne at Kittila were approximately EUR72 in the third quarter of 2015, compared to EUR86 in the third quarter of 2014. Costs decreased in the third quarter of 2015 due to the increased throughput when compared with the 2014 period. For the first nine months of 2015, the Kittila mill processed an average of 3,981 tpd, compared to 2,895 tpd in the first nine months of 2014. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately EUR75 in the first nine months of 2015, compared to the EUR79 per tonne in the comparable 2014 period. Throughput was higher and costs were lower in the 2015 period due to the reasons outlined above. Since the expansion, the mill has shown potential to operate in excess of 4,000 tpd and efforts are ongoing to optimize throughput and recovery rates. In addition, the Company is also working to optimize underground mining rates and evaluate the potential to develop new mining areas. Unit costs are expected to decrease once steady state operations are achieved. Third quarter 2015 payable gold production at Kittila was 46,455 ounces with total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $639. In the third quarter of 2014, the mine produced 28,230 ounces at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $951. The higher production in the 2015 period is a result of the increased mill capacity compared to the 2014 period and the planned 2014 shutdown. Costs decreased in the third quarter of 2015 primarily due to increased production and a favourable foreign exchange rate. In the first nine months of 2015, Kittila produced 133,095 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $696 on a by-product basis. This is in contrast to the first nine months of 2014, when the mine produced 98,612 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $861 on a by-product basis. The lower cash costs in 2015 are mainly due to reasons described above. Drilling Extends New Parallel Zone at Kittila Previous drilling from the surface at Kittila has outlined a significant zone of deep mineralization at Rimpi with potentially wider widths and better grades than those currently being mined. The main underground ramp at Kittila is being extended to reach the Rimpi zone and a new surface ramp is also being developed to access the shallower portions of the Rimpi deposit. The surface ramp had advanced a total of 825 metres to 134 metres depth by the end of September. In April and July, the Company announced that drilling had encountered a mineralized lens east of the main Kittila ore zone, within the sheared and altered structure that hosts the known Kittila deposits (see April 30, 2015 and July 29, 2015 news releases). The intercepts lay within an area approximately 800 metres long north to south between 975 and 1,300 metres below surface, approximately 100 to 150 metres east of the main ore zone. These intercepts indicate a new parallel lens (now called the \"Sisar lens\" which in English means \"sister lens\"), that could extend upwards to a similar elevation as the main exploration ramp (currently at 800 metres depth) being driven towards Rimpi. This new lens could provide additional tonnage should further drilling outline an economic deposit. Two recent holes drilled from the exploration ramp have confirmed continuity within the Sisar lens. The table below shows the intercepts of the two new holes as well as those reported previously from the Sisar lens. Pierce points for all these holes are shown on the Kittila composite longitudinal section and two cross sections (500 metres apart). All intercepts reported for the Kittila mine show uncapped grades over estimated true widths, based on a current geological interpretation that is being updated as new information becomes available with further drilling.  midpoint below surface (metres) Estimated true width (metres) Gold grade (g/t) (uncapped)  Kittila composite longitudinal section Kittila composite cross sections - 7538000mN and 7538500mN Hole ROD15-703 intersected two lenses in the main zone and one in the Sisar lens. In the main ore zone, this hole intersected 14.3 g/t gold over 6.1 metres at 1,028 metres depth, and 5.8 g/t gold over 3.5 metres at 1,077 metres depth. The upper intercept verifies, widens and increases the grade of the probable reserves between the Suuri and Roura trends, while the lower one extends the mineralization to the north, and will help to convert future resources. The hole then intersected 8.1 g/t gold over 8.0 metres at 1,235 metres depth in the Sisar lens, approximately 150 metres east of the main ore zone, strongly confirming the continuity of the lens. This intercept is between two previously reported intercepts at approximately the same depth: it is approximately 116 metres north of hole ROU10-037 and 250 metres south of hole ROD14-003. At shallower depths and approximately 560 metres farther north, hole ROU15-600 intersected 5.5 g/t gold over 3.3 metres at 950 metres below surface, approximately 100 metres east of the main zone mineralization. This intercept is approximately 130 metres south of the previously reported intercept of hole ROU15-603. Additional holes have been drilled in the vicinity of the new Sisar lens intercepts, and assays are pending. A second underground deep drill rig is expected to start operating in the fourth quarter 2015 and carry on into 2016 to determine continuity and test for extensions of the Sisar lens. At the Kuotko deposit, located approximately 15 kilometres north of Kittila, drilling continues with a focus on infilling and expanding the existing inferred resource of approximately 170,000 ounces (1.8 million tonnes at 2.9 g/t gold). In addition, new mineralized zones have been identified outside of the known resource areas. Metallurgical testing is ongoing and unlike Kittila, the gold mineralization is free milling. Upon completion of the drilling, studies will be carried out to assess the viability of mining the deposit as a satellite open pit. Barsele Project - Drilling Now Underway on the Central Zone On June 11, 2015, Agnico Eagle acquired a 55% interest in the Barsele project in Sweden. The Company can earn an additional 15% interest in the project through the completion of a pre-feasibility study. The Barsele property is known to contain intrusive-hosted gold mineralization and gold-rich volcanogenic massive sulphide mineralization. In 2015, the Company plans to spend approximately $3.25 million on exploration to further evaluate the mineral potential of the property. In September 2015, trenching and mapping programs were carried out that confirmed that the known intrusive-hosted deposits plunge to the southeast. A 16-hole (9,300-metre) drill program commenced in early October to test the depth extension of the Central Zone to 400 to 500 metres below surface. NUNAVUT REGION With the Company's largest producing mine (Meadowbank) and two significant development assets and exploration projects (Meliadine and Amaruq) located in Nunavut, Agnico Eagle has the potential to build an operating platform that could have the ability to generate strong production and cash flows over several decades. Meadowbank - Increased Waste Stripping Capacity Provides Production Flexibility The 100% owned Meadowbank mine in Nunavut, northern Canada, achieved commercial production in March 2010. The Meadowbank mill processed an average of 10,824 tpd in the third quarter of 2015, compared to the 11,492 tpd achieved in the third quarter of 2014. Mill throughput levels were lower in the 2015 period due to a higher percentage of Vault ore processed which has a higher hardness factor, which has an impact on both the primary and secondary grinding circuit efficiency. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$72 in the third quarter of 2015, which compares to C$74 per tonne in the third quarter of 2014. The lower costs in the 2015 period were primarily due to an increase in capitalized versus expensed waste stripping compared to the respective 2014 period. For the first nine months of 2015, the Meadowbank mill processed an average of 11,009 tpd, compared to 11,365 tpd in the first nine months of 2014. Mill throughput levels were lower in the 2015 period primarily due to the reasons outlined above. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$72 in the first nine months of 2015, which was similar to the C$73 per tonne in the comparable 2014 period. Payable production in the third quarter of 2015 was 99,425 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $598. This compares with the third quarter of 2014 when 91,557 ounces were produced at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $777. The higher production in the 2015 period compared to the 2014 period was primarily due to the processing of higher grade ore (an increase of approximately 15%) and slightly better recoveries. Costs in the 2015 period were lower due to increased production and favourable foreign exchange rates. In the first nine months of 2015, Meadowbank produced 279,224 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $646 on a by-product basis. In the first nine months of 2014, the mine produced 366,162 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $561 on a by-product basis. The lower production (down 24%) in the 2015 period compared to the previous period was primarily due to processing fewer tonnes at lower grades and lower mill recoveries (down 2.3%). During the first six months of the 2014 period, the Company encountered ore grades that were higher than expected in both the Portage and Goose pits. In 2013, approximately 246,000 ounces were removed from mineral reserves at the Vault deposit due to a change in the gold price assumption used to calculate mineral reserves at December 31, 2013. Given the current US dollar to Canadian dollar foreign exchange rate (which yields favourable revenues and costs in Canadian dollar terms), lower fuel costs, and the growing significance of the Amaruq Project, the Company made a decision in July 2015 to proceed with the expansion of the Vault pit. With the expansion, the Meadowbank mine is now expected to be in production until the third quarter of 2018 (approximately one year longer than originally forecast). The extension of the Meadowbank mine life is expected to help bridge the production gap between the end of production at Meadowbank and the potential start of production at a satellite operation at Amaruq (not yet approved for construction). Amaruq Project - Drilling Expands Scope of Whale Tail Deposit; Positive Results from the V Zone Area; Phase Two Exploration Program Now Completed Agnico Eagle has a 100% interest in the Amaruq project. The large property consists of 114,761 hectares, approximately 50 kilometres northwest of the Meadowbank mine. In August 2015, the Company announced an updated inferred mineral resource estimate as of June 30, 2015 of 2.0 million ounces gold (9.7 million tonnes grading 6.47 g/t gold). The phase two drilling program for 2015 was completed in mid-October. Total drilling at Amaruq for the year was 108,000 metres (378 holes) completed. This release incorporates some of the drill results received since the last results were released on August 19, 2015. The latest drill results are from the main Whale Tail deposit including the east-plunging high-grade shoot and the former gap area between Whale Tail West and Mammoth Lake. As well, there are recent exploration drill results from the V zone. The 2016 drill program is expected to start in February. Phase Two Drill Results Continue to Expand Mineralized Zones The phase two 2015 drilling program at the Amaruq project began in July with several purposes, including step-out drilling to link Whale Tail and Mammoth Lake mineralization; testing the down-plunge extent of the ore shoot in the east of Whale Tail; and extending the I, V and R zones. Recent intercepts from the project are set out in the table below and the drill hole collars are located on the Amaruq project local geology map. The Whale Tail deposit pierce points are shown on the Whale Tail composite longitudinal section, while the coordinates from the V zone drill-hole collars are given in a second table. All intercepts reported for the Amaruq project show capped grades over estimated true widths, based on a preliminary geological interpretation that is being updated as new information becomes available with further drilling. Amaruq local geology map Whale Tail Deposit Composite Longitudinal Section Recent drilling has confirmed that the Whale Tail and Mammoth zones form a single mineralized system at least 2.3 kilometres long, between surface and locally to a depth of 450 metres. A new intercept lies in between several previously reported intercepts filling the former gap between Whale Tail and the Mammoth Lake mineralization. Hole AMQ15-450 yielded 4.5 g/t gold over 16.9 metres at 166 metres depth including 7.6 g/t gold over 6.7 metres. This area will continue to be investigated in 2016. The mineralized system remains open at depth and along strike. Drilling from the opposite direction (north to south) has enhanced the understanding of the geometry of the deposit. Within the Whale Tail deposit is a thickened higher-grade ore shoot that is at least one kilometre long. This cigar-shaped shoot extends from surface (Whale Tail West) plunging shallowly eastward to a depth of 380 metres (Whale Tail East). The ore shoot remains open. Six recent intercepts within this shoot, from west to east, are hole AMQ15-369 that intersected 8.4 g/t gold over 18.4 metres at 176 metres depth, hole AMQ15-463 that yielded 6.8 g/t gold over 29.7 metres at 293 metres depth, hole AMQ15-422 that intersected 5.7 g/t gold over 29.9 metres at 270 metres depth, hole AMQ15-442 that intersected 8.1 g/t gold over 12.9 metres at 296 metres depth, hole AMQ15-470 that intersected 6.9 g/t gold over 16.1 metres at 357 metres depth and hole AMQ15-444, which yielded two intercepts 6.3 g/t gold over 14.8 metres at 359 metres depth, and 5.8 g/t gold over 10.3 metres at 378 metres depth. (Note that holes AMQ15-369 and AMQ15-444 were drilled from the south.) The results described for the Whale Tail deposit are expected to have a positive impact on the size of the upcoming resources estimate for the Amaruq project. Recent drilling and mapping has shown that the V zone is a significant mineralized structure dipping shallowly to the southeast, with locally abundant visible gold. The structure has been identified from outcrop on surface to a depth of 155 metres in recent drilling; it remains open at depth and laterally. Hole AMQ15-390 intersected the structure yielding 30.1 g/t gold over 5.2 metres at 40 metres depth. Approximately 100 metres to the south of this intercept, hole AMQ15-461 yielded 7.9 g/t gold over 23.4 metres at 115 metres depth. Approximately 150 metres southwest of hole AMQ15-390 was a third high-grade intersection in the V zone: hole AMQ15-491 intersected 21.1 g/t gold over 3.6 metres at 155 metres depth. Other results from the V zone are included in the intercepts table above. These results will lead to a reinterpretation of the I, V, and R zones, which could have a positive impact on the year-end resource estimate. Although additional drilling will be required, the Company believes that the V zone could potentially be a second source of open pit ore at Amaruq. Engineering and environmental baseline studies are underway to support the permitting process for the Amaruq project as a satellite open pit operation to the Meadowbank mine. The most recent drilling at depth in Whale Tail also indicates that this deposit hosts high-grade intercepts below the preliminary ultimate pit shell, suggesting that Whale Tail has underground potential. An application to construct an all-weather access road between Meadowbank and the Amaruq site was filed in the first quarter of 2015 and is currently working its way through the Nunavut permitting process. Meliadine Project - License B Granted; Regional Land Holdings Expanded The Meliadine gold project was acquired in July 2010 and is the Company's largest development project based on mineral reserves and mineral resources. The Company has a 100% interest in the 111,757-hectare property, which is linked to the town of Rankin Inlet in Nunavut by a 25-kilometre all-weather access road. In March 2015, the Company completed and filed with Canadian securities regulators an updated National Instrument 43-101 (\"NI 43-101\") technical report on the Meliadine gold project. The updated technical study was based on extracting only the 3.3 million ounces of gold in proven and probable mineral reserves (13.9 million tonnes of ore at 7.44 g/t gold), which is all contained in the Tiriganiaq and Wesmeg deposits. The Meliadine property also hosts 3.3 million ounces of measured and indicated mineral resources (20.2 million tonnes at 5.06 g/t gold), and 3.5 million ounces of inferred mineral resources (14.1 million tonnes at 7.65 g/t gold). In addition, there are numerous other known gold occurrences in the 80-kilometre-long greenstone belt that require further evaluation. Internal studies are ongoing to evaluate the potential to extract additional ounces from the Tiriganiaq and Wesmeg/Normeg deposits, which could potentially extend the mine life, improve the project economics, and increase the after-tax internal rate of return. These studies are expected to be completed in the first half of 2016. At the end of the third quarter of 2015, approximately 1,960 metres of underground development had been completed, and additional underground equipment has been transported to site to complete the 2015 plan that calls for total underground development of approximately 2,500 metres. This development will allow for more cost-effective exploration and conversion drilling of the deeper parts of the Tiriganiaq and Wesmeg/Normeg deposits and help to optimize potential mining plans. On July 13, 2015, the Kivalliq Inuit Association and Agnico Eagle signed the Inuit Impact Benefit Agreement (\"IIBA\") for the Meliadine gold project. The IIBA addresses protection of Inuit values, culture and language, protection of the land, water and wildlife, provides financial compensation to Inuit over the mine life, and contains provision for training, Inuit employment and contracting. On October 5, 2015, the Nunavut Water Board issued the permit (License B) for Meliadine pre-development work. License A, which is required for production activities, is expected to be granted in the second quarter of 2016. The timing of future capital expenditures on the Meliadine project beyond 2015 and the determination of whether to build a mine at Meliadine are subject to approval by Agnico Eagle's Board of Directors, which will be based on prevailing market conditions and outcomes of the various potential scenarios being evaluated. Acquisition of New Properties in Nunavut Agnico Eagle is currently studying options and alternatives in Nunavut to capitalize on the large and growing mineral resource in the region. As part of this initiative, the Company has recently staked claims totaling 68,012 hectares on properties to the west-northwest of the project, on the continuation of the greenstone belt that hosts the Meliadine deposits. This summer, an airborne VTEM magnetic and electromagnetic survey was flown over the new properties. A field crew initiated prospecting and sampling of areas with geophysical signatures typical of iron formation-hosted Archean/Proto-Proterozoic deposits, similar to those recognized at Meadowbank, Amaruq and Meliadine projects. Close to 800 rock samples have been collected from the properties. Initial results have identified a 2-kilometre-long structure from which 21 rock samples returned values above 1.0 g/t gold including seven values in excess of 10.0 g/t gold, with a maximum value of 42.0 g/t gold. The new properties appear to be geologically similar to the Meadowbank, Meliadine and Amaruq projects where our exploration team has demonstrated the effectiveness of a systematic exploration approach and the strong mineral potential of this part of Nunavut. Assembling and analyzing the data collected this summer will assist in preparing a drill program for 2016 to further investigate the higher potential areas on the new properties. SOUTHERN BUSINESS OPERATING REVIEW Agnico Eagle's southern business operations are focused in Mexico. These operations have been the source of growing precious metals production (gold and silver), stable operating costs and strong free cash flow since 2009. Pinos Altos - Strong Performance Driven by Higher Mill Throughput and Grades The 100% owned Pinos Altos mine in northern Mexico achieved commercial production in November 2009. The Pinos Altos mill processed 5,403 tpd in the third quarter of 2015, compared to 5,040 tpd processed in the third quarter of 2014. During the third quarter of 2015, approximately 49,300 tonnes of ore were stacked on the leach pad at Pinos Altos, compared to 143,500 tonnes in the comparable 2014 period. Minesite costs per tonne at Pinos Altos were $48 in the third quarter of 2015, which is in line with $48 in the third quarter of 2014. Although minesite costs per tonne are unchanged on a year-over-year basis, these costs are subject to variations in the proportion of heap leach ore to milled ore and open pit ore to underground ore, currency exchange rates and routine movements in the waste to ore stripping ratio in the open pit mines. For the first nine months of 2015, the Pinos Altos mill processed an average of 5,638 tpd, compared to 5,311 tpd processed in the first nine months of 2014. Approximately 238,500 tonnes of ore were stacked on the Pinos Altos leach pad during the first nine months of 2015, compared to 436,800 tonnes in the prior year period. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately $46 compared to $48 per tonne in the first nine months of 2014 with variance due to the proportion of heap leach to mill ore and the proportion of underground ore to open pit, variations in the proportion of waste to ore mined and variations in the currency exchange rate. Payable production in the third quarter of 2015 was 47,725 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $392. This compares with production of 41,155 ounces at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $545 in the third quarter of 2014. Higher production in 2015 is largely due to higher mill throughput and higher grades processed over the comparable prior year period. The decrease in the year over year total cash costs per ounce is largely due to increased gold production and higher silver production (offset in part, by a decline in realized silver prices) and favourable foreign exchange rates compared to the prior year period. In the first nine months of 2015, Pinos Altos produced 148,478 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $378 on a by-product basis. This is in contrast to the first nine months of 2014 when the mine produced 130,350 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $513 on a by-product basis. The lower cash costs in the first nine months of 2015 are primarily due to favourable foreign exchange rates and higher gold and silver production compared to the prior year period. The Pinos Altos shaft-sinking project remains on schedule for completion in 2016. The shaft is currently at a depth of approximately 573 metres, and activities during the third quarter of 2015 focused on the development of loading stations on levels 27 and 28. When the shaft is completed (final depth of approximately 603 metres), it will allow better matching of the mill capacity with the future mining capacity at Pinos Altos once the open pit mining operation begins to wind down, as planned over the next several years. The Company continues to evaluate a number of regional satellite opportunities. A 6,000-metre in-fill and conversion drill program on the Sinter deposit is 95% complete with assays still pending from about 50% of the holes. Results received to date indicate that there is good potential to add this deposit to the Pinos Altos mine plan beginning in 2020. Creston Mascota Deposit at Pinos Altos - Initial In-pit Drilling Results Indicate Potential to Extend Mine Life The Creston Mascota deposit at Pinos Altos has been operating as a satellite operation to the Pinos Altos mine since late 2010. Approximately 434,300 tonnes of ore were stacked on the Creston Mascota leach pad during the third quarter of 2015, compared to approximately 469,200 tonnes stacked in the third quarter of 2014. In the 2015 period, fewer tonnes were stacked mainly due to the adverse impact of the rainy season on roads, loading and dumping zones, and the crushing circuit. Minesite costs per tonne at Creston Mascota were $14 in the third quarter of 2015, compared to $17 in the third quarter of 2014. Costs in the 2015 period were lower due to currency fluctuations, lower fuel consumption and reduced power requirements compared to the 2014 period. For the first nine months of 2015, approximately 1,569,800 tonnes of ore were stacked on the Creston Mascota leach pad, compared to 1,242,900 tonnes in the prior year period. In the 2015 period, additional ore was encountered outside the block model, which resulted in more tonnes being stacked in the first half of the year compared to the 2014 period. For the first nine months of 2015, mine site costs per tonne at Creston Mascota were $12, compared to $17 per tonne in the first nine months of 2014. Costs were lower in the 2015 period due to more tonnes stacked and the other reasons outlined above. Payable gold production at Creston Mascota in the third quarter of 2015 was 12,716 ounces at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $436. This compares to 13,377 ounces at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $556 during the third quarter of 2014. Production was lower in the 2015 period due to fewer tonnes stacked, compared to the 2014 period. Cash costs were lower in the 2015 period based on lower minesite costs per tonne (see above), increased silver production (partially offset by a lower realized silver price) and a favourable foreign exchange rate compared to the 2014 period. Payable gold production for the first nine months of 2015 was 40,770 ounces at total cash costs per ounce of $425 on a by-product basis. This compares to 34,853 ounces at total cash costs per ounce of $587 on a by-product basis in the first nine months of 2014. The higher production in the 2015 period was due to more tonnes being stacked (especially in the first half of 2015) compared to the 2014 period. The lower costs in the 2015 period are due to higher gold production, increased silver production (partially offset by a lower realized silver price) and a favourable foreign exchange rate compared to the 2014 period. In the third quarter of 2015, preparation and top soil recovery at the Phase IV heap leach pad were completed. The earthworks have been initiated, with commissioning expected by year-end 2015. Over its mine life, Creston Mascota has added approximately 50% (179,000 ounces of contained gold) to its mineral reserves through infill drilling and improved geological understanding. In April 2015, higher grade mineralization was encountered at the bottom of the pit and outside the Creston Mascota block model. An infill drill program was completed in the third quarter of 2015 with encouraging results, and the interpretation of drill hole assays is ongoing. In September 2015, a 3,500-metre infill and conversion drill program commenced on the Bravo satellite zone. This program is expected to be completed by year-end 2015. The results of recent infill drilling in the pit and the potential of nearby satellite deposits such as Bravo could extend the projected life of the Creston Mascota operations beyond 2018. La India - New Record Set for Quarterly Gold Production The La India mine property in Sonora, Mexico, located approximately 70 kilometres from the Company's Pinos Altos mine, was acquired in November 2011 through the purchase of Grayd Resources, which held a 56,000-hectare land position in the Mulatos Gold belt. Commissioning of the mine commenced ahead of schedule in the third quarter of 2013 and commercial production was declared as of February 1, 2014. Approximately 1,193,900 tonnes of ore were stacked on the La India leach pad during the third quarter of 2015, compared to approximately 1,190,100 tonnes stacked in the third quarter of 2014. Minesite costs per tonne at La India were $11 in the third quarter of 2015, compared to the $10 in the third quarter of 2014. The increase in minesite costs reflect slightly higher maintenance costs and cyanide consumption (due to the rainy season) partially offset by lower costs for fuel and labour, and favourable foreign exchange rates. In the first nine months of 2015, approximately 3,931,900 tonnes of ore were stacked on the La India leach pad, compared to approximately 3,346,500 stacked in the first nine months of 2014. Minesite costs per tonne at La India were $9 in the first nine months of 2015, compared to the $8 in the first nine months of 2014. Tonnage stacked in the 2014 period was lower given that the operation was still ramping up to full capacity. The slightly higher costs in the 2015 period are primarily due to the reasons outlined above. Payable gold production at La India in the third quarter of 2015 was 28,604 ounces at total cash costs per ounce of $436 on a by-product basis were. Production in the third quarter of 2014 was 20,311 ounces at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $547. Production in the 2015 period was positively impacted by rain flushing residual ounces from the heaps and significantly higher ore grades placed on the heaps than planned. Total cash costs in the 2015 period were favourably impacted by higher production volumes and favourable foreign exchange rates. For the first nine months of 2015, La India produced 80,930 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $422 on a by-product basis. This compares to 51,820 ounces at total cash costs per ounce of $483 on a by-product basis in the first nine months of 2014. The higher production and lower costs in the 2015 period are primarily due to the reasons outlined above. During the third quarter of 2015, construction activities on the heap leach expansion were negatively affected by the extraordinary rains during the period. However, any delays related to the rains are not expected to affect future production plans or capital costs. Approximately 77% of the earthworks have been finished with full completion expected later in the fourth quarter of 2015. This leach pad expansion will provide the capacity for the current planned life-of-mine production at La India and approximately 5.0 million tonnes of additional stacking. Construction of the Main Zone haul road was completed during the third quarter of 2015. In the third quarter of 2015, several activities were undertaken to improve the La India block model and potentially expand the mineral reserves and mineral resource. Infill drilling and favourable reconciliation data from the first full year of mining have led to an improved geological model for the Main Zone oxides. In addition, ongoing metallurgical investigations and field-proven production experience with the North Zone sulphides have shown that some of the transition and sulphide material in the Main Zone and La India Zone may also be amenable to heap leaching. Inclusion of sulphide material into the pit designs at the La India mine has the potential to add further oxides as well as sulphides into the year-end 2015 mineral reserve and mineral resource estimate expected to be reported in mid-February 2016. Any additions could potentially extend the mine life beyond 2020. El Barqueno - Drilling Continues with a Focus on Resource Delineation and Defining New Target Areas Agnico Eagle has a 100% interest in the El Barqueno project. The 32,840-hectare property is in the Guachinango gold-silver mining district, Jalisco State, Mexico, approximately 150 kilometres west of the state capital of Guadalajara. It consists of three blocks of land: the original El Barqueno package (El Barqueno I, II and III) acquired from Cayden Resources in November 2014, and two adjacent blocks acquired from Soltoro Limited in June 2015 (El Rayo and El Tecolote). The Company last reported exploration results from this project in a news release dated September 21, 2015. The El Barqueno project contains a number of known mineralized zones and several prospects that require further evaluation. There are currently 10 drill rigs working to define the limits of the Azteca-Zapoteca, Angostura and Pena de Oro prospects, and delineate an initial mineral resource estimate for these deposits. Several other prospects are also under evaluation. An additional drill rig is testing the Zapote-Mixteca prospect, which has been shown to be gold-bearing by recent rock sample and trench results. To the end of the third quarter, 171 holes (42,940 metres) had been drilled. Drilling will continue at El Barqueno until the end of the year. The Company expects that this drilling will lead to the estimation of an initial inferred mineral resource at the Azteca-Zapoteca, Angostura and Pena de Oro areas to open-pit mineable depths. The resources are expected to be reported in mid-February 2016. Conceptual design studies and additional metallurgical testing are underway at El Barqueno. The project may host gold-silver deposits that could potentially be developed into a series of open pits utilizing heap leach processing, similar to Creston Mascota and the La India mine. While it is too early to estimate the extent of the mineral resources and the number of deposits with economic potential at El Barqueno, the Company already has the experience of developing cost-efficient mining operations in Mexico, and increasing their size through successful exploration as well as metallurgical innovation. This body of knowledge will be applied as El Barqueno continues to be explored and studied. Exploration expenditures at El Barqueno in 2015 are currently expected to total approximately $22 million. Quarterly Dividend Declared Agnico Eagle's Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.08 per common share, payable on December 15, 2015 to shareholders of record as of December 1, 2015. Agnico Eagle has declared a cash dividend every year since 1983. Dividend Reinvestment Plan Please follow the link below for information on the Company's dividend reinvestment program. Dividend Reinvestment Plan About Agnico Eagle Agnico Eagle is a senior Canadian gold mining company that has produced precious metals since 1957. Its eight mines are located in Canada, Finland and Mexico, with exploration and development activities in each of these countries as well as in the United States and Sweden. The Company and its shareholders have full exposure to gold prices due to its long-standing policy of no forward gold sales. Agnico Eagle has declared a cash dividend every year since 1983. Note Regarding Certain Measures of Performance This news release discloses certain measures, including ''total cash costs per ounce'' and ''minesite costs per tonne'', \"all-in sustaining costs per ounce\" and \"adjusted net income\" that are not recognized measures under IFRS. These data may not be comparable to data presented by other gold producers. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable financial information presented in the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS and for an explanation of how management uses these measures, other than adjusted net income, see \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Performance Measures\" below. The total cash costs per ounce of gold produced is presented on both a by-product basis (deducting by-product metal revenues from production costs) and co-product basis (before by-product metal revenues). The total cash costs per ounce of gold produced on a by-product basis is calculated by adjusting production costs as recorded in the consolidated statements of income (loss) for by-product revenues, unsold concentrate inventory production costs, smelting, refining and marketing charges and other adjustments, and then dividing by the number of ounces of gold produced. The total cash costs per ounce of gold produced on a co-product basis is calculated in the same manner as the total cash costs per ounce of gold produced on a by-product basis except that no adjustment is made for by-product metal revenues. Accordingly, the calculation of total cash costs per ounce of gold produced on a co-product basis does not reflect a reduction in production costs or smelting, refining and marketing charges associated with the production and sale of by-product metals. The total cash costs per ounce of gold produced is intended to provide information about the cash-generating capabilities of the Company's mining operations. Management also uses these measures to monitor the performance of the Company's mining operations. As market prices for gold are quoted on a per ounce basis, using the total cash costs per ounce of gold produced on a by-product basis measure allows management to assess a mine's cash-generating capabilities at various gold prices. All-in sustaining costs are used to show the full cost of gold production from current operations. The Company calculates all-in sustaining costs per ounce of gold produced as the aggregate of total cash costs on a by-product basis, sustaining capital expenditures (including capitalized exploration), general and administrative expenses (including stock options) and reclamation expenses divided by the amount of gold produced. The all-in sustaining costs per ounce of gold produced on a co-product basis is calculated in the same manner as the total cash costs per ounce of gold produced on a by-product basis except that no adjustment is made for by-product metal revenues. The Company's methodology for calculating all-in sustaining costs may differ from to the methodology used by other producers that disclose all-in sustaining costs. The Company may change the methodology it uses to calculate all-in sustaining costs in the future, including in response to the adoption of formal industry guidance regarding this measure by the World Gold Council. Management is aware that these per ounce measures of performance can be affected by fluctuations in exchange rates, and, in the case of total cash costs per ounce of gold produced on a by-product basis, by-product metal prices. Management compensates for these inherent limitations by using these measures in conjunction with minesite costs per tonne (discussed below) as well as other data prepared in accordance with IFRS. Management also performs sensitivity analyses in order to quantify the effects of fluctuating exchange rates and metal prices. This news release also contains information as to estimated future total cash costs per ounce, all-in sustaining costs and minesite costs per tonne. The estimates are based upon the total cash costs per ounce, all-in sustaining costs and minesite costs per tonne that the Company expects to incur to mine gold at its mines and projects and, consistent with the reconciliation of these actual costs referred to above, do not include production costs attributable to accretion expense and other asset retirement costs, which will vary over time as each project is developed and mined. It is therefore not practicable to reconcile these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable IFRS measure.

The scientific and technical information relating to Agnico Eagle's mineral reserves and mineral resources contained herein has been approved by Daniel Doucet, Senior Corporate Director, Reserve Development, Ing., and a qualified person as defined by NI 43-101. Cautionary Note To U.S. Investors - The SEC permits U.S. mining companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose only those mineral deposits that a company can economically and legally extract or produce. Agnico Eagle reports mineral resource and reserve mineral estimates in accordance with the CIM guidelines for the estimation, classification and reporting of mineral resources and mineral reserves in accordance with the Canadian securities regulatory authorities' NI 43-101. These standards are similar to those used by the SEC's Industry Guide No. 7, as interpreted by Staff at the SEC (\"Guide 7\"). However, the definitions in NI 43-101 differ in certain respects from those under Guide 7. Accordingly, mineral reserve information contained herein may not be comparable to similar information disclosed by U.S. companies. Under the requirements of the SEC, mineralization may not be classified as a \"reserve\" unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically and legally produced or extracted at the time the mineral reserve determination is made. A \"final\" or \"bankable\" feasibility study is required to meet the requirements to designate mineral reserves under Industry Guide 7. Agnico Eagle uses certain terms in this news release, such as \"measured\", \"indicated\", and \"inferred\", and \"resources\" that the SEC guidelines strictly prohibit U.S. registered companies from including in their filings with the SEC. In prior periods, mineral reserves for all properties were typically estimated using historic three-year average metals prices and foreign exchange rates in accordance with the SEC guidelines. These guidelines require the use of prices that reflect current economic conditions at the time of mineral reserve determination, which the Staff of the SEC has interpreted to mean historic three-year average prices. Given the current lower commodity price environment, Agnico Eagle has decided to use price assumptions that are below the three-year averages. The assumptions used for the mineral reserves estimates at all mines and advanced projects as of December 31, 2014 (other than the Canadian Malartic mine), reported by the Company on February 11, 2015, are $1,150 per ounce gold, $18.00 per ounce silver, $1.00 per pound zinc, $3.00 per pound copper, $0.91 per pound lead and C$/US$, US$/Euro and MXP/US$ exchange rates of 1.08, 1.30 and 13.00, respectively. For the mineral reserves estimate at the Canadian Malartic mine, the Company has decided to continue to report the mineral reserves estimated as of June 15, 2014, reported by the Company in a news release dated August 13, 2014, minus the production to the end of 2014. The assumptions used were $1,300 per ounce gold, a cut-off grade between 0.28 g/t and 0.35 g/t gold (depending on the deposit), and a C$/US$ exchange rate of 1.10. NI 43-101 requires mining companies to disclose mineral reserves and mineral resources using the subcategories of \"proven\" mineral reserves, \"probable\" mineral reserves, \"measured\" mineral resources, \"indicated\" mineral resources and \"inferred\" mineral resources. Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. A mineral reserve is the economically mineable part of a measured and/or indicated mineral resource. It includes diluting materials and allowances for losses, which may occur when the material is mined or extracted and is defined by studies at pre-feasibility or feasibility level as appropriate that include application of modifying factors. Such studies demonstrate that, at the time of reporting, extraction could reasonably be justified. Modifying factors are considerations used to convert mineral resources to mineral reserves. These include, but are not restricted to, mining, processing, metallurgical, infrastructure, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental factors. A proven mineral reserve is the economically mineable part of a measured mineral resource. A proven mineral reserve implies a high degree of confidence in the modifying factors. A probable mineral reserve is the economically mineable part of an indicated and, in some circumstances, a measured mineral resource. The confidence in the modifying factors applying to a probable mineral reserve is lower than that applying to a proven mineral reserve. A mineral resource is a concentration or occurrence of solid material of economic interest in or on the Earth's crust in such form, grade or quality and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade or quality, continuity and other geological characteristics of a mineral resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge, including sampling. A measured mineral resource is that part of a mineral resource for which quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics are estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the application of modifying factors to support detailed mine planning and final evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. Geological evidence is derived from detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing and is sufficient to confirm geological and grade or quality continuity between points of observation. An indicated mineral resource is that part of a mineral resource for which quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics are estimated with sufficient confidence to allow the application of modifying factors in sufficient detail to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. Geological evidence is derived from adequately detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing and is sufficient to assume geological and grade or quality continuity between points of observation. An inferred mineral resource is that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of limited geological evidence and sampling. Geological evidence is sufficient to imply but not verify geological and grade or quality continuity. Investors are cautioned not to assume that part or all of an inferred mineral resource exists, or is economically or legally mineable. A feasibility study is a comprehensive technical and economic study of the selected development option for a mineral project that includes appropriately detailed assessments of applicable modifying factors together with any other relevant operational factors and detailed financial analysis that are necessary to demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that extraction is reasonably justified (economically mineable). The results of the study may reasonably serve as the basis for a final decision by a proponent or financial institution to proceed with, or finance, the development of the project. The confidence level of the study will be higher than that of a Pre-Feasibility Study. Agrium Inc. (TSE: AGU) Our vision to help feed the world responsibly means not only helping farmers grow more food, but doing it in ways that protect the environment, support economic vitality and enhance communities. One of the greatest challenges the global community has ever faced is how to sustainably feed a rapidly growing population. This challenge is complex and won't be solved quickly, but we believe we're stronger working together. By collaborating with multiple groups, we build long-term, impactful programs and solutions that we continually learn from and build upon. So that, together, we can feed the world responsibly and improve the lives of future generations. Agrium Reports Solid Third Quarter and Expects Strong Fall Crop Input Demand CALGARY, ALBERTA--(Marketwired - Nov. 5, 2015) - ALL AMOUNTS ARE STATED IN U.S.$ Agrium Inc. (TSX:AGU) (NYSE:AGU) announced today 2015 third quarter net earnings from continuing operations of $99-million ($0.72 diluted earnings per share), compared to $91-million ($0.63 diluted earnings per share) in the third quarter of 2014. The increased net earnings are due to higher sales volumes of Wholesale nutrients combined with lower production costs in the Wholesale business unit, while Retail's earnings were similar to the prior year, despite weaker market conditions. Highlights: Third quarter adjusted net earnings of $97-million or $0.71 per share and $5.73 per share year to date in 2015 on the same basis (see page 2 for adjusted net earnings reconciliation)1. Wholesale's results were boosted by nitrogen and potash performance, which saw higher volumes and lower costs, leading to an improvement in gross profit, despite lower nutrient prices. Agrium achieved 94 percent ammonia capacity utilization in the third quarter, exceeding the 90 percent target rate. The Canpotex proving run is well underway at our Vanscoy potash facility and is progressing as expected. Retail EBITDA2 in the U.S. and Australia were higher than the same quarter last year reflecting Operational Excellence initiatives. Total Retail EBITDA of $129-million for the quarter was in line with the prior year, despite the impact of drought conditions in the Canadian business. Agrium has repurchased 5.6 million shares since the beginning of April under its current Normal Course Issuer Bid. 2015 annual guidance range has been narrowed to $7.10 to $7.40 diluted earnings per share (see page 3 for further details). \"Agrium's performance this quarter is another demonstration of the resilience of our business model. We focused on what we can control, improving our on-stream Wholesale performance and optimizing our distribution network and effectively managing costs in Retail, all of which helped drive a 9 percent increase in earnings over the same period last year despite prevailing market headwinds,\" commented Chuck Magro, Agrium's President and CEO. \"We see strong crop input demand during the fall application season which is now in full swing and we are confident that our strategy and business structure can continue to deliver value to all our shareholders,\" added Mr. Magro. Forecasted annual effective tax rate of 27.5 percent used for adjusted net earnings and per share calculations. These are non-IFRS measures which represent net earnings adjusted for certain income (expenses) that are considered to be non-operational in nature. We believe these measures provide meaningful comparison to the earnings of other companies by eliminating share-based payments expense (recovery), gains (losses) on foreign exchange, gains (losses) on non-qualifying derivative hedges and significant non-operating, non-recurring items. These should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS and may not be directly comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Earnings (loss) from continuing operations before finance costs, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. This is a non-IFRS measure. Refer to section \"Additional IFRS and Non-IFRS Financial Measures\" in the Management's Discussion and Analysis. MARKET OUTLOOK For the third consecutive year, favorable growing conditions have contributed to above-trend global grain yields. Even in geographies which faced challenging conditions early in the growing season, such as parts of the U.S. Corn Belt and Western Canada, yield prospects have come in stronger than anticipated. Despite historically high production, the outlook for grains is more positive than it was a year ago and as of the end of October 2015, cash corn prices were more than 10 percent above 2014 levels, although oilseed prices are lower year-over-year. Excluding China, the global grain stocks to use ratio is projected to decline to the lowest level since 2012/13 and the U.S. corn supply/demand balance is projected to tighten. As a result of projected lower 2015/16 U.S. corn ending stocks, analysts project that U.S. corn area will increase in 2016. We expect normal North American crop nutrient application rates in the 2015/16 fertilizer year and expect that fall demand in 2015 will improve relative to 2014 levels as harvest progress is significantly ahead of last year, supporting a wider application window than the short 2014 season. In addition, we expect the overall planted acreage and crop mix to support increased crop nutrient demand. The devaluation of most non-U.S. currencies over the past year has negatively impacted crop input demand and U.S. dollar prices. While growers in most market driven non-U.S. regions have realized a net benefit from lower local currency values due to improved local currency crop prices, crop nutrient prices in local currencies have increased significantly in some cases, which has been negative for demand. Currency devaluations have directly impacted crop nutrient demand and prices in Brazil and India. In Brazil, higher local prices, combined with lending constraints have negatively impacted import demand, however, downstream inventories have been drawn down to meet farm-level demand. In India, the devaluation of the rupee has pressured phosphate prices in order to be economical under the subsidy regime, while Indian buyers have delayed execution on some contracted potash volumes. Globally, the downstream distribution network has been drawing on nutrient inventories to meet grower demand and purchasing on a just-in-time basis, which has led to relatively slow demand for all products. This has been the case in the U.S. urea market, as offshore imports of urea are estimated to be down 19 percent through the end of October 2015. The urea market has also been under pressure due to the combination of the devaluation of the Chinese yuan and lower anthracite coal prices, which have lowered the marginal cost of production. Chinese production levels in September in 2015 declined by 6 percent from August levels as a result of these market pressures and are expected to drop through the remainder of the year. Similarly for potash, strong shipments of potash in 2014 and the first half of 2015 allowed downstream inventories to increase. Buyers have been drawing upon these inventories in the second half of 2015, and prices have declined as spot sales volumes have declined. We expect pent-up demand to emerge late as fall applications occur and downstream inventories are drawn down. Similar to nitrogen and potash, phosphate demand has been slow in recent months, which has led to a reduction in phosphate production by some major producers. UPDATED ANNUAL 2015 GUIDANCE Based on our Market Outlook, Agrium expects to achieve annual diluted earnings per share of $7.10 to $7.40 in 2015 compared to our previous estimate of $7.00 to $7.50 per share. We have narrowed the guidance range but maintained a range width encompassing approximately $60-million of EBITDA variability to reflect the risk and opportunity associated with weather conditions and fall season length. We are assuming a normal fall season, recognizing there is always a risk that an early onset of inclement weather could bring an early close to the season. We have lowered the high-end and narrowed our anticipated Retail EBITDA range to $1.00-billion to $1.03-billion because of the impact of drought and lower crop prices on our Canadian operations in 2015. Our annual nitrogen production target remains unchanged. We narrowed our potash production range to 1.95 million tonnes to 2.05 million tonnes for 2015. We have updated the range for our annual effective tax rate for 2015 to 27 percent to 28 percent to reflect the anticipated geographic split of our global income. Our estimates of the Canada and U.S. foreign exchange rates and NYMEX for 2015 have been narrowed from our previous estimates based on current market conditions. This guidance and updated additional measures and related assumptions are summarized in the table below. Guidance excludes the impact of share-based payments expense (recovery), gains (losses) on foreign exchange and non-qualifying derivative hedges and significant non-operating, non-recurring items. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS November 4, 2015 Unless otherwise noted, all financial information in this Management's Discussion and Analysis (\"MD&A\") is prepared using accounting policies in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\") and is presented in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 - Interim Financial Reporting. All comparisons of results for the third quarter of 2015 (three months ended September 30, 2015) and for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 are against results for the third quarter of 2014 (three months ended September 30, 2014) and nine months ended September 30, 2014.

In respect of Forward-Looking Statements, please refer to the section titled \"Forward-Looking Statements\" section of this MD&A. 2015 Third Quarter Operating Results CONSOLIDATED NET EARNINGS Agrium's 2015 third quarter net earnings from continuing operations were $99-million or $0.72 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations compared to net earnings from continuing operations of $91-million or $0.63 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the same quarter of 2014. Wholesale's sales volumes increased for all three crop nutrients for the third quarter and for nitrogen and phosphate for the first nine months of 2015 primarily as a result of higher operating rates. Realized selling prices for the third quarter decreased as a result of weaker market conditions but overall our average selling price increased for the first nine months of 2015. Product purchased for resale contributed to the decrease in sales as Agrium exited portions of this business. Wholesale's gross profit significantly increased due to lower natural gas input costs, manufacturing cost efficiencies and as a result of higher nitrogen, potash and phosphate volumes produced for the third quarter and first nine months of 2015 compared to the same periods last year. Retail's sales and gross profit decreased for the third quarter and first nine months of 2015 compared to the same periods last year primarily due to unfavorable weather conditions and competitive pricing pressure as a result of lower crop prices which impacted most of our product lines' sales and margins. Expenses General and administrative expense decreased by $9-million (13 percent) for the third quarter and $27-million (12 percent) for the first nine months of 2015 compared to the same periods last year as a result of reduced payroll and office expense costs as we continue to realize reductions related to our Operational Excellence program. Share-based Payments We had a share-based payment recovery of $15-million this quarter compared to a share-based payment expense of $10-million for the third quarter last year due primarily to the decrease in our share price. As a result of our higher average share price for the first nine months of 2015, our share-based payments expense increased by $11-million compared to the same period last year. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased for the third quarter and first nine months of 2015 due to the change in our method of depreciation from the straight-line basis to the units-of-production basis for our Vanscoy potash facility mining and milling assets at the beginning of 2015 and our reassessment of the useful lives of our property, plant and equipment in our Retail business unit in the fourth quarter of 2014 to reflect our expectations on the estimated future economic benefits of our property, plant and equipment. In the first nine months of 2015, other expenses decreased by $8-million due to the following: Gains of $33-million were recognized on natural gas derivatives in the first nine months of 2014 and were recorded directly to other expenses. 2015 did not have comparable results, as starting January 1, 2015, we began to designate all of our natural gas derivatives as qualifying hedges for accounting purposes and the related gains or losses are recorded as part of cost of product sold when we sell the related product while unrealized gains or losses are recorded in equity. We completed the sale of our Niota and Meredosia storage and distribution facilities in the first quarter of 2015 resulting in a gain on sale of purchase for resale assets of $38-million. Effective Tax Rate The effective tax rate on continuing operations of 27 percent for the third quarter is higher than the tax rate of 18 percent in the comparative quarter in 2014 (excluding the effect of the recognition of a previously unrecognized tax benefit of $29-million) because of higher earnings in higher taxed jurisdictions. The effective tax rate of 29 percent for the first nine months of 2015 is higher than the rate of 27 percent for the same period last year (excluding the effect of the recognition of a previously unrecognized tax benefit) due to the increase in the Alberta provincial statutory tax rate. BUSINESS SEGMENT PERFORMANCE Retail sales and gross profit during the quarter were lower than the same period last year due to generally lower crop input prices, weaker non-U.S. currency exchange rates and dry weather conditions in our international and Canadian operations. Regionally, the U.S. EBITDA contribution was up approximately 4 percent over the same period last year. Australia reported a 40 percent increase in EBITDA, due mostly to a focused effort in reducing overall operating costs. Canada and South America EBITDA declined as poor growing conditions hampered demand for all crop inputs. Retail selling expenses as a percentage of sales were marginally higher this quarter due to lower total sales. However, total selling expenses were down $33-million compared to the same period last year as a result of cost reductions primarily in our Canadian and Australian Retail operations. Total crop nutrient sales were 10 percent lower compared to the same period last year due to a reduction in both average crop nutrient selling prices as well as lower sales volumes. Total crop nutrient volumes were 4 percent lower this quarter across our Retail operations compared to the same period last year. Virtually all of the reduction was due to lower demand in our International Retail, due to dry conditions and lower planted wheat acreage. Despite lower corn and total seeded acreage this year in North America, sales tonnes in the region were relatively flat compared to the third quarter of 2014. Crop nutrient margins on a per tonne basis were lower across all regions. Margins from our international Retail declined by 28 percent over the same period last year. North American operations were 15 percent lower as a result of declining crop nutrient prices. Crop protection products Total crop protection sales were down 8 percent year-over-year with most of the reduction due to a combination of drought conditions impacting sales within our Canadian operations, lower demand for insecticides in the U.S. and lower prices for glyphosate products. International crop protection sales also experienced a decline related to dry conditions in those regions. Crop protection margins as a percentage of sales increased year-over-year, largely due to timing of rebates and new programs from suppliers in the U.S. market. Additionally, proprietary crop protection margins as a percentage of sales increased by 5 percent over the same period last year with the most significant increases in Canada and Australia. Seed Seed sales were up 11 percent this quarter compared to the same period last year. The increase was due primarily to excessive moisture conditions in the Eastern U.S. during June, which pushed corn and soybean seeding into July of this year. The excessive moisture also prevented a significant amount of corn and soybean acreage in the region from being planted and much of this area was seeded with wheat, rye grass and other grass seed instead. Seed sales and margins were negatively impacted by competitive pressures across the seed industry, as well as lower sales volumes in Canada. Seed margins as a percentage of sales were 43 percent this quarter compared to 50 percent in 2014. Increased sales volumes of wheat, rye grass and other grass seed, which are lower margin products, were a key contributor to the lower margins. Merchandise Merchandise sales decreased compared to the same period last year as a result of lower fuel prices and demand in Canada and lower animal health sales in Australia. Gross margin as a percentage of sales was higher this quarter due to a decrease in lower margin Canadian fuel sales and our ability to maintain a better cost position in the Australian business, which consistently has higher margin products. Services and other Sales for services and other was down 21 percent this quarter, due mainly to the closure of our livestock export business in Australia. Application and other services sales, gross profit and gross margins were all higher in North America compared to the same period last year. Wholesale sales this quarter were lower than the same period last year due to our decision to sell several non-core, lower-return purchase for resale facilities in 2015 related to our on-going asset portfolio review. Excluding this factor, Wholesale had higher product sales volumes this quarter largely offset by lower selling prices for all three crop nutrients. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $55-million over the prior year, as a result of higher utilization rates from our nitrogen and potash segments resulting in higher sales volumes and lower production costs per tonne. Nitrogen Nitrogen gross profit increased by 69 percent over the same period last year, with results being driven by higher volumes and a significant reduction in cost of product sold due to improved capacity utilization rates and lower natural gas costs in the current period. Sales volumes increased by 3 percent over the same period last year, driven by stronger urea and ammonia sales. This increase was due to higher on-stream time at our production facilities and product availability compared to the same period last year. Cost of product sold per tonne was 35 percent lower than the same period last year. Operational improvements and higher on-stream time compared to the same period in the prior year decreased fixed costs per tonne, while lower natural gas costs reduced variable costs. The weaker Canadian dollar also reduced operating costs at our Canadian plants. Nitrogen margin per tonne was $171 per tonne, a 63 percent improvement over the same period last year, despite an 11 percent reduction in average selling prices. Potash Potash gross profit this quarter was $40-million higher than the same period last year, due to the turnaround to tie-in the Vanscoy capacity expansion that started in the third quarter of 2014 leading to lower sales and margin in the prior year. Sales volumes were 53 percent higher compared to the same period in the prior year. Production volumes this quarter were 560,000 tonnes. Realized sales prices were lower than the same period last year due to competitive pricing pressure in both domestic and international markets. Cost of product sold was reduced as a result of cost efficiencies associated with the continuing ramp-up of the Vanscoy expansion, as well as weakening of the Canadian dollar. As a result, cash cost of product manufactured continues to improve and is $89 per tonne in the current quarter compared to $110 per tonne in the second quarter of 2015. Phosphate Phosphate gross profit was unchanged from the prior year. Sales volumes were slightly higher than last year, while reduced selling prices were largely offset by lower cost of production. As a result, phosphate margins were only 2 percent lower than the same quarter last year. Wholesale Other Gross profit for Wholesale's Other product category decreased this quarter primarily due to lower sales volumes and gross profit for the product purchased for resale business, as these operations were significantly scaled back earlier in 2015 as part of our portfolio review. ESN(r) gross profit increased this quarter due to slightly higher sales volumes and lower cost of product sold, which was partly offset by lower selling prices. Wholesale Earnings from Equity Investees Agrium's share of earnings from equity investees saw a loss of $10-million during the quarter. MOPCO experienced gas curtailments throughout the quarter which restricted nitrogen production. Profertil's sales volumes and costs were impacted by an extended outage during the current quarter. Other EBITDA for our Other non-operating business unit for the third quarter of 2015 had a net expense of $44-million, compared to a net expense of $40-million for the third quarter of 2014. The variance was due to the following: A $12-million higher gross profit elimination expense as a result of higher inter-segment inventory held at the end of the third quarter of 2015; A $22-million increase in other expenses primarily due to higher provisions for environmental remediation and asset retirement obligations and an interest recovery received in 2014; and A $15-million share-based payment recovery for the third quarter of 2015 compared to a $10-million share-based payment expense for the same period last year due to a decrease in Agrium's share price in 2015. Summary of Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Below is a summary of our cash provided by or used in operating, investing, and financing activities as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows: Our investing capital expenditures decreased in the first nine months of 2015 compared to the first nine months of 2014 due to the completion of the tie-in of our Vanscoy potash facility expansion in the fourth quarter of 2014, partially offset by expenditures relating to the Borger nitrogen expansion project. Our sustaining capital expenditures decreased in the first nine months of 2015 as we had less turnarounds compared to the same period last year. We expect Agrium's capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of 2015 to approximate $200--million to $300-million in 2015. We anticipate that we will be able to finance the announced projects through a combination of cash provided from operating activities and existing credit facilities. Short-term Debt Our short-term debt of $1.8-billion at September 30, 2015 is outlined in note 5 of our Summarized Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our short-term debt increased by $1.1-billion during the three months ended September 30, 2015, which in turn contributed to a decrease in our unutilized short-term financing capacity to $1.1-billion at September 30, 2015. Capital Management Our revolving credit facilities require that we maintain specific interest coverage and debt-to-capital ratios, as well as other non-financial covenants as defined in our credit agreements. We were in compliance with all covenants at September 30, 2015. NORMAL COURSE ISSUER BID In January 2015, the Toronto Stock Exchange (\"TSX\") accepted Agrium's notice of intention to make a normal course issuer bid (\"NCIB\") whereby Agrium may purchase up to 7,185,866 common shares on the TSX and New York Stock Exchange during the period from January 26, 2015 to January 25, 2016. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we purchased 5,574,331 shares at an average share price of $100.25 for total consideration of $559-million. Shareholders can obtain a free copy of the NCIB notice submitted to the TSX from Agrium upon request. OUTSTANDING SHARE DATA Agrium had 138,169,000 outstanding shares at October 31, 2015. At that date, under our stock option plans, shares expected to be issued for options outstanding were negligible.

OTHER Barrick Gold Corporation (TSX: ABX) Our vision is the generation of wealth through responsible mining wealth for our owners, our people, and the countries and communities with which we partner. We aim to be the leading mining company focused on gold, growing our cash flow per share by developing and operating high quality assets through disciplined allocation of human and financial capital and operational excellence. Those who founded and first led the company were committed to a culture of partnership and the values underpinning such a culture: trust, transparency, shared responsibility and accountability, and a sense of emotional and financial ownership. The company is returning to its roots as a lean and nimble organization, with minimal bureaucracy. A small head office manages the company with a balance of entrepreneurialism and prudence, focusing on only a few core activities: defining and implementing strategy, allocating human and financial capital, and fulfilling the obligations required of a public company. Leaders at the operational level have greater autonomy, responsibility, and accountability, functioning as business owners. Free from bureaucracy and middle management, they are focused on maximizing free cash flow, and the head office is focused on allocating that cash flow to maximize shareholder returns. Barrick has mining operations in Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile, Dominican Republic, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Saudi Arabia, United States and Zambia. More than 75 percent of the company's gold production comes from the Americas region. Barrick Reports Third Quarter 2015 Results | Growing Free Cash Flow TORONTO, October 28, 2015 The company reported adjusted net earnings of $131 million ($0.11 per share)1and a net loss of $264 million ($0.23 per share) in the third quarter. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $942 million1; EBITDA was $490 million1. Free cash flow was $866 million1, or $256 million excluding proceeds from the Pueblo Viejo streaming transaction. Gold production in the third quarter was 1.66 million ounces at all-in sustaining costs (AISC) of $771 per ounce1 Full-year gold production is expected to be 6.1-6.3 million ounces. Full-year all-in sustaining cost guidance reduced to $830-$870 per ounce from previous range of $840-$880 per ounce. On track to achieve $2 billion in cash flow improvements by end of 2016. Total debt reduced by 15 percent year-to-date, on track to achieve $3 billion debt reduction target. Progressing drilling and feasibility study work to convert resources to reserves over the next five years at Cortez, Goldstrike, Lagunas Norte, Pueblo Viejo, Turquoise Ridge and other sites. Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:ABX)(TSX:ABX) (Barrick or the \"company\") today reported adjusted net earnings of $131 million ($0.11 per share) for the third quarter and a net loss of $264 million ($0.23 per share). Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was$942 million and EBITDA was $490 million. Free cash flow was $866 million, or $256 million excluding the impact of $610 millionin proceeds from the Pueblo Viejo streaming transaction2. Production in the third quarter was in line with expectations at 1.66 million ounces of gold. All-in sustaining costs were $771 per ounce and cash costs were $570 per ounce1. Full-year 2015 gold production is expected to be 6.1-6.3 million ounces at lower all-in sustaining costs of $830-$870 per ounce. Our objective is to grow free cash flow per share from a portfolio of high-quality gold assets through disciplined capital allocation and operational excellence. In support of this objective, we have returned to a leaner, decentralized operating model designed to maximize free cash flow and improve execution. Clear capital allocation criteria, including a 15 percent hurdle rate for all investments, are driving greater financial rigor and stronger returns. The divestment of non-core assets has refocused our portfolio and we have formed vital new strategic partnerships that will drive new opportunities in the future. All of this is driving stronger performance across the business, reflected by two consecutive quarters of positive free cash flow and improved costs. At the same time, we are strengthening our balance sheet and remain on track to reduce debt by $3 billion. This momentum will support our overriding objective of growing free cash flow per share, underpinned by a strong pipeline of organic projects and mine site expansion opportunities in our core regions. STRENGTHENING THE BALANCE SHEET Earlier this year, we set a $3 billion debt reduction target for 2015. We said we would achieve this through the disciplined sale of non-core assets, the formation of new joint ventures and partnerships, and by maximizing free cash flow from our operations. Thus far, we have completed or announced asset sales, joint ventures and partnerships valued at $2.46 billion. We have also generated$282 million in positive free cash flow in the last two quarters despite a lower gold price, reflecting the impact of our efforts to maximize free cash flow across the company. Both asset sales and cash flow improvements have been credit positive, and have resulted in improvements to our debt-to-EBITDA ratio. Achieving our $3 billion debt reduction target will also reduce annual pre-tax interest payments by approximately $140 million. So far this year, total debt has been reduced by 15 percent, from $13.1 billion to $11.2 billion3, significantly reducing our near-term debt repayment obligations. We currently have less than $250 million in debt due before 2018 and approximately $5 billion of our $11.2 billion in outstanding debt matures after 2032. Building on $1.9 billion in repayments already completed this year, we intend to use approximately $1 billion in proceeds from the sale of 50 percent of Zaldivar to reduce debt. The sale is expected to close in the fourth quarter. This would bring total debt repayments to approximately $2.9 billion. We intend to use free cash flow to reach our target of $3 billion. Assuming the completion of $3 billion in repayments, total debt will have been reduced by 23 percent, from $13.1 billion to $10.1 billion. We also expect to announce the outcome of a process for the sale of certain non-core U.S. assets in the fourth quarter. As we move into 2016 and beyond, we will continue to take prudent steps to strengthen our balance sheet, balancing debt repayments with investments in profitable production that will drive growth in free cash flow and EBITDA. Our liquidity position continues to improve, with strong cash flow generation, very modest near-term debt repayment obligations, a$4 billion undrawn credit facility and $3.34 billion in cash on hand at the end of the third quarter. FINANCIAL DISCUSSION Free cash flow increased to $866 million, or $256 million excluding the impact of $610 million in proceeds from the Pueblo Viejo streaming transaction. This compares to $26 million in free cash flow in the second quarter of 2015. Two consecutive quarters of positive free cash flow after a prolonged period of negative free cash flow reflects our driving focus on maximizing free cash flow through greater capital discipline, operational efficiencies and strong cost management. Third quarter 2015 adjusted net earnings were $131 million ($0.11 per share) compared to $222 million ($0.19 per share) in the prior year period. The net loss for the quarter was $264 million ($0.23 per share) compared to net earnings of $125 million ($0.11per share) in the prior year quarter. Lower adjusted net earnings reflect lower realized gold and copper prices and higher depreciation compared to the prior year period, partially offset by increased gold and copper sales. Significant adjusting items for the quarter (net of tax and non-controlling interest effects) include: $455 million in impairment charges primarily related to the reclassification of our Zaldivar mine as held-for-sale; and $29 million in costs arising from the write-down of obsolete supplies inventory; partially offset by $52 million of gains related to the sale of our Cowal mine and 50 percent of our interest in the Porgera mine; and $45 million in unrealized foreign currency translation gains. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $942 million compared to $1.1 billion in the prior year period. On an unadjusted basis, EBITDA was $490 million for the third quarter compared to $1.0 billion in the prior year period. Operating cash flow was $1.26 billion compared to $852 million in the prior year period. Higher operating cash flow in the quarter reflects the impact of $610 million in proceeds from the Pueblo Viejo streaming transaction. OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS AND GUIDANCE Barrick's operations continued to perform in line with expectations for the year, meeting cost and production targets for the third quarter while generating stronger free cash flow. We have tightened our gold production guidance range for 2015, from 6.1-6.4 million ounces to 6.1-6.3 million ounces, reflecting lower anticipated gold production from Acacia Mining plc. All-in sustaining cost guidance for the year has been reduced to $830-$870 per ounce from the previous range of $840-$880 per ounce. Average all-in sustaining costs for our five core mines are now expected to be $700-$725 per ounce in 2015, down from$725-$775 per ounce at the start of this year. These mines are expected to account for about 75 percent of free cash flow from operations and 60-65 percent of production in 2015. Fourth quarter all-in sustaining costs are now expected to be similar to the third quarter while production is expected to be slightly higher, primarily driven by the impact of higher sustaining capital expenditures offset by higher production at Cortez, Pueblo Viejo, Lagunas Norte and Veladero. We expect significantly higher depreciation in the fourth quarter, primarily related to a drawdown in inventory stockpiles at Cortez, Lagunas Norte and Goldstrike and higher sales volumes at Pueblo Viejo. Total copper guidance for 2015 remains unchanged at 480-520 million pounds. Full-year C1 cash costs are now expected to be$1.60-$1.85 per pound5, down from $1.75-$2.00 per pound, driven by currency impacts and improved costs at Lumwana. Cortez The Cortez mine produced 321,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $501 per ounce in the third quarter. Production benefited from higher open pit tonnage and improved underground productivity through the implementation of short interval controls, an initiative identified as part of our Value Realization review for Cortez. Higher production, lower operating costs and lower sustaining capital drove improved all-in sustaining costs. Production in 2015 is now forecast to be 900,000-950,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $675-$725 per ounce. Fourth quarter production at Cortez is expected to be slightly higher than the third quarter, at higher costs. A prefeasibility study for expanded underground mining in an area known as Deep South below currently permitted levels will be completed in late 2015 and results are expected to be disclosed with the company's fourth quarter results. Our Value Realization review at Cortez also identified long-hole stoping as the preferred mining method for the deposit, as compared to the cut-and-fill method previously contemplated for the underground expansion, which could improve the economics of the project. Mineralization in this zone is primarily oxide and higher grade compared to the current underground mine, which is sulfide in nature. The limits of the Lower Zone have not yet been defined, and drilling has indicated the potential for new targets at depth. With a 382-square-mile land package, Cortez remains a highly prospective district for Barrick. Goldstrike The Goldstrike mine contributed 328,000 ounces in the third quarter in line with plan, while all-in sustaining costs of $558 per ounce were better than expected due to lower operating costs and lower sustaining capital. Our innovative thiosulfate (TCM) circuit achieved commercial production in the third quarter, coming in at a capital cost of $610 million. We expect to complete the ramp up of the TCM circuit in the first half of 2016. Goldstrike's production for 2015 is forecast to be 1.00-1.10 million ounces at improved all-in sustaining costs of $650-$700 per ounce. Fourth quarter production is expected to be similar to the third quarter, at slightly higher costs. Exploration at Goldstrike is focused on the underground mine where good potential exists at depth, and we plan to accelerate near-mine development in 2016. During the quarter, we began development of new areas below existing workings at Meikle and Rodeo in order to access deeper reserves which are expected to come into production at the end of 2016. This work will also open up new drilling platforms to better define future potential in these areas. Pueblo Viejo (60 percent) Barrick's 60 percent share of production from Pueblo Viejo for the third quarter was 172,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of$554 per ounce. Production was slightly below plan due to lower gold grades and recoveries from a higher proportion of carbonaceous ore. All-in sustaining costs were impacted by lower silver recoveries associated with a combination of scheduled autoclave maintenance in September, lime boil limitations and unscheduled maintenance on the limestone grinding circuit. Modifications to the lime boil are underway, including the addition of two lime boil tanks which will be operational in November. These additional tanks are expected to improve silver recoveries to the targeted 80 percent level from around 60 percent currently. We continue to forecast attributable production of 625,000-675,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $540-$590 per ounce in 2015. Production is expected to be higher and costs lower in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter on higher grades, improved recoveries and better autoclave availability. At the end of 2014, Pueblo Viejo had approximately six million ounces of gold and 37 million ounces of silver in the measured and indicated resource category (Barrick's 60 percent share)9. A significant portion of these resources are not currently included in reserves due to tailings storage constraints. We have completed a preliminary economic assessment on a plan to remove these constraints to tailings capacity, which if implemented could significantly extend the life of the mine. We expect to complete further engineering work and commission a prefeasibility study in the second half of 2016 to refine the technical and financial analysis for the increase in tailings storage capacity and to confirm whether the measured and indicated resources described above can be brought into reserves. Lagunas Norte The Lagunas Norte mine contributed 108,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $581 per ounce in the third quarter, in line with expectations. Production in 2015 is now anticipated to be 550,000-590,000 ounces at improved all-in sustaining costs of $550-$600 per ounce, with stronger production expected in the fourth quarter driven by improved performance at the Phase Five leach pad. Fourth quarter all-in sustaining costs are expected to be higher than the third quarter, reflecting the sale of higher cost inventory as well as increased sustaining capital for Phase Six leach pad construction. A pre-feasibility study on a plan to extend the mine life by up to 12 years by mining nearly two million ounces of sulfide ore below the existing open pit is on schedule for completion in 2015. Veladero The Veladero mine produced 143,000 ounces of gold in the third quarter at all-in sustaining costs of $914 per ounce. Production was below plan primarily due to lower grades in the Federico Phase Three pit and adverse weather events in August which impacted leach operations. All-in sustaining costs were higher than plan on lower gold ounces sold, timing of sustaining capital and lower silver credits. The addition of reagents to the leach circuit was temporarily halted in September following a valve failure on a pipe carrying processing solution, which led to a discharge to the environment through a diversion channel gate that was open at the time of the incident. Since the incident occurred, our first priority has been the safety of people and the environment. Water samples analyzed by independent third-parties, including the United Nations, have confirmed that there are no risks to the health of downstream communities as a result of this incident. Restrictions on leaching activities were lifted following implementation of additional monitoring and corrective actions. Production guidance for 2015 is unchanged at 575,000-625,000 ounces while all-in sustaining cost guidance has been narrowed to $950-$1,000 per ounce. Fourth quarter production is expected to be higher, at lower all-in sustaining costs driven by better grades, lower capital expenditures and higher silver and inventory credits. Turquoise Ridge (75 percent) The Turquoise Ridge mine contributed 55,000 ounces in the third quarter at all-in sustaining costs of $738 per ounce, in line with expectations. The mine is forecast to produce 175,000-200,000 ounces in 2015 at improved all-in sustaining costs of $750-$800per ounce. Detailed engineering and feasibility work on developing an additional shaft GoC which could bring forward more than one million ounces of production and roughly double output to an average of 500,000 ounces per year (100 percent basis) at all-in sustaining costs of about $625-$675 per ounce GoC is on track to be completed by the end of the year. Work to install additional ventilation capacity has also been initiated. Porgera (47.5 percent) The Porgera mine produced 134,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $986 per ounce, in line with plan. Attributable production in 2015 is now expected to be 400,000-450,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $1,025-$1,125 per ounce, reflecting Barrick's reduced interest following the sale of 50 percent of Barrick (Niugini) Ltd. to Zijin Mining. Recent drought conditions are not expected to have a material impact on production in 2015. We expect to increase our exploration budget at Porgera in 2016 to focus on underground targets which have been identified through a new geological model. Other Mines Barrick's other mines - consisting of Bald Mountain, 50 percent of Round Mountain, Golden Sunlight, Ruby Hill, Hemlo, Cowal, KCGM and Pierina - contributed 298,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $959 per ounce in the third quarter. A sale process is underway for Bald Mountain, Round Mountain, Ruby Hill, Golden Sunlight and the Spring Valley and Hilltop properties, with strong interest received to date. Acacia Mining (63.9 percent) Barrick's share of third quarter production was lower than expected at 104,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $1,195 per ounce due to temporary factors impacting output from Bulyanhulu and Buzwagi. We now expect attributable 2015 production from Acacia to be about 460,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of approximately $1,155 per ounce. Copper Copper production in the third quarter was 140 million pounds at C1 cash costs of $1.53 per pound. For 2015, copper production is anticipated to be 480-520 million pounds at lower C1 cash costs of $1.60-$1.85 per pound, reflecting currency impacts and improved costs at Lumwana. Lumwana contributed 77 million pounds at C1 cash costs of $1.59 per pound in the third quarter, in line with expectations. Power restrictions and potential reductions to smelter capacity in Zambia are not expected to have any material impact on Lumwana's 2015 production guidance. Production is now anticipated to be 260-280 million pounds at lower C1 cash costs of $1.80-$2.00per pound in 2015, reflecting higher grades. Production of 63 million pounds at Zaldivar at C1 cash costs of $1.47 per pound in the third quarter was in line with plan. At Jabal Sayid, first shipments of copper-in-concentrate continue to be anticipated in early 2016. Once the mine reaches full production, average production in the first full five years is expected to be 100 million pounds per year. TARGETING $2 BILLION IN CASH FLOW IMPROVEMENTS This year, we have taken significant actions to improve our business plans, resulting in positive free cash flow for two consecutive quarters. We remain focused on improving productivity and driving down costs to maximize free cash flow from our assets in any gold price environment. In support of this, we are targeting $2 billion in cash flow improvements across the company before the end of 2016, relative to our original internal plans for 2015 and 2016. These improvements are coming from productivity gains and cost reductions across operating expenses, capital spending and corporate overhead. While a majority of these actions will be incorporated into our 2016 plans, the initial outcomes are reflected in improvements to our 2015 guidance. Total capital expenditures for the year are expected to be 20 percent lower than 2014. Combined with reductions in corporate overhead and other operating cost savings, this has allowed us to reduce our 2015 all-in sustaining cost guidance by about $30 per ounce since the start of year, from our original range of $860-$895 per ounce to $830-$870 per ounce in the third quarter. We are now focused on optimizing our 2016 plans, with an emphasis on operating cost and productivity improvements. Our temporary suspension plan for Pascua-Lama has now been approved by the mining authority in Chile. This will enable us to complete the transition to care and maintenance, and should allow us to significantly reduce holding costs at the project in 2016. Implementation of the temporary suspension plan could require adjustments resulting from regulatory and legal actions and weather conditions, which could increase costs associated with the plan. CONVERTING RESOURCES TO RESERVES At the end of 2014, Barrick had 93 million ounces of proven and probable gold reserves and 94 million ounces of measured and indicated gold resources10. At 1.37 grams per tonne, our reserve grade is more than 50 percent higher than the senior peer average11. For more than 20 years, Barrick has maintained an average reserve mine life of between 10 to 20 years with a track record of replacing reserves and resources at our operations. Mine life and production rates at the majority of our mines have far surpassed initial estimates and we continue to identify excellent potential for resource conversion at many of our operations. Of our exploration budget, 65 percent is focused on opportunities at or near our existing operations. Drilling and feasibility study work to convert resources to reserves over the next five years at Cortez, Goldstrike, Lagunas Norte, Pueblo Viejo and Turquoise Ridge are progressing well. In addition, recent drilling at Hemlo and Porgera indicates strong potential for resource additions. We are also working to advance our Goldrush project in Nevada and drilling to define the limits of mineralization at the Alturas project inChile is expected to resume in the fourth quarter, following the South American winter. An illustration of the optionality that exists within our portfolio is the recent drill program at Hemlo. In the first quarter, Barrick completed the acquisition of surface and mineral rights adjacent to the Hemlo property in Ontario from subsidiaries of Newmont Mining. These claims included an area of geological potential adjacent to Barrick's existing underground workings. Barrick is currently undertaking an underground diamond drilling program in this area to evaluate its potential. To date, drilling has encountered a number of high grade intercepts with significant potential. These results highlight the ongoing potential of mineral deposits such as the Hemlo camp, even as they become mature operations. A detailed update on reserves and resources will be provided with the company's fourth quarter results in February 2016.

Cameco Corporation (TSE: CCJ) Cameco is one of the world's largest uranium producers accounting for about 16% of the global production from its mines in Canada, the US and Kazakhstan. Our leading position is backed by about 429 million pounds of proven and probable reserves and extensive resources. Cameco Reports Third Quarter Financial Results SASKATOON, SASKATCHEWAN--(Oct. 30, 2015) higher consolidated revenue and gross profit for the first nine months lower uranium segment gross profit for the quarter and first nine months annual uranium sales outlook confirmed strong performance at Cigar Lake, increased annual production target range ALL AMOUNTS ARE STATED IN CDN $ (UNLESS NOTED) Cameco (TSX:CCO) (NYSE:CCJ) today reported its consolidated financial and operating results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2015 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). \"Our results for the quarter and the first nine months are as expected\" said Tim Gitzel, president and CEO, \"with a higher proportion of our deliveries scheduled for the fourth quarter. \"We've continued to see the oversupply in the market impacting demand and price, and while we can't control the pace of industry recovery, we can ensure that our company is ready at each step along the way. Our positive long-term view has not changed, so today that means preparing for the demand-driven market we see coming, by keeping our costs down and operating our mines safely and efficiently. Those mines continue to return excellent results, particularly Cigar Lake, which has already exceeded our 2015 production target range. The Cigar Lake operation, along with our other world-class assets, are at the core of our strategy to enhance our operating leverage and maintain the flexibility needed to respond quickly as the market improves.\" THIRD QUARTER Net losses attributable to equity holders this quarter were $4 million ($0.01 per share diluted) compared to net losses of $146 million ($0.37 per share diluted) in the third quarter of 2014. In addition to the items noted below, our net losses were affected by mark-to-market losses on foreign exchange derivatives. Net losses in the third quarter of 2014 included the impairment of our investment in GE-Hitachi Global Laser Enrichment of $184 million and the impairment of our investment in GoviEx Uranium Inc. of $12 million. On an adjusted basis, our earnings this quarter were $78 million ($0.20 per share diluted) compared to earnings of $93 million ($0.23 per share diluted) (non-IFRS measure, see section) in the third quarter of 2014. The change was mainly due to: lower gross profit from our uranium segment lower tax recovery partially offset by: higher gross profit from our fuel services and NUKEM segments FIRST NINE MONTHS Net earnings in the first nine months of the year were $75 million ($0.19 per share diluted) compared to earnings of $113 million ($0.28 per share diluted) in the first nine months of 2014. In addition to the items noted below, our net earnings were affected by mark-to-market losses on foreign exchange derivatives. Our 2014 earnings also included a gain on the sale of our interest in BPLP of $127 million, the impairment of our investment in GE-Hitachi Global Laser Enrichment of $184 million and the impairment of our investment in GoviEx Uranium Inc. of $12 million. On an adjusted basis, our earnings for the first nine months of this year were $193 million ($0.49 per share diluted) compared to earnings of $207 million ($0.52 per share diluted) (non-IFRS measure, see section) for the first nine months of 2014. Key variances include: lower gross profit from our uranium segment higher administration costs a favourable settlement of $28 million with respect to a dispute regarding a long-term supply contract with a utility customer recorded in the second quarter of 2014 lower tax recovery Partially offset by: higher gross profit from our fuel services and NUKEM segments lower losses from equity accounted investments Our 2014 adjusted net earnings were also impacted by: an early termination fee of $18 million incurred in 2014 as a result of the cancellation of our toll conversion agreement with Springfields Fuels Ltd., which was to expire in 2016 settlement costs of $12 million with respect to the early redemption our Series C debentures recorded in 2014 Uranium market update In the third quarter, there was no significant change to the market in terms of contract volumes or price. Quantities transacted in the spot market were at normal levels, and spot prices remained in the mid-$30s (US). This is in keeping with the rest of the year so far, and is, we believe, simply a function of the currently over-supplied market. Reactor restarts in Japan remain an important driver of market sentiment in the short term, and the first of these were finally realized: Kyushu's Sendai unit 1 restarted in August and unit 2 in mid-October. Three additional reactors have been approved by the regulator to restart, and twenty more applications await decisions. We remain confident that a significant number of units will be restarted in Japan over time, though the regulatory approval process and restart schedules are clearly hard to predict. Longer term, strong fundamentals underpin a positive outlook for the industry. The 65 reactors under construction today and additional units planned over the next decade means increasing uranium demand as those reactors come online. As future supply continues to be negatively affected by current depressed market conditions, we expect to see a shift from the currently over-supplied market we are experiencing today to a demand-driven market that requires more primary supply. Demand growth combined with the timing, development and execution of new supply projects and the continued performance of existing supply, will determine the pace of that shift. Caution about forward-looking information relating to our uranium market update This discussion of our expectations for the nuclear industry, including its growth profile, future global uranium supply and demand is forward-looking information that is based upon the assumptions and subject to the material risks discussed under the heading Caution about forward-looking information below. Outlook for 2015 Our strategy is to profitably produce at a pace aligned with market signals, while maintaining the ability to respond to conditions as they evolve. Our outlook for 2015 reflects the expenditures necessary to help us achieve our strategy. Our outlook for uranium production, uranium, fuel services and NUKEM revenue, NUKEM unit cost, consolidated tax rate, and capital expenditures has changed. We do not provide an outlook for the items in the table that are marked with a dash. 2015 FINANCIAL OUTLOOK Our 2015 outlook for sales volume does not include sales between our uranium, fuel services and NUKEM segments. For comparison of our 2015 outlook and 2014 results for revenue, we do not include sales between our uranium, fuel services and NUKEM segments. Based on a uranium spot price of $36.50 (US) per pound (the Ux spot price as of October 26, 2015), a long-term price indicator of $44.00 (US) per pound (the Ux long-term indicator on October 26, 2015) and an exchange rate of $1.00 (US) for $1.25 (Cdn). This increase is based on the unit cost of sale for produced material and committed long-term purchases. If we make discretionary purchases in the remainder of 2015, then we expect the overall unit cost of sales to increase further. Direct administration costs do not include stock-based compensation expenses. Our outlook for the tax rate is based on adjusted net earnings. We have increased our uranium production outlook to 27.3 million pounds U3O8 (previously between 25.3 million and 26.3 million pounds) to reflect the higher expected production from Cigar Lake/McClean Lake. See Uranium 2015 Q3 updates below for more information. Our outlook for uranium revenue and for fuel services revenue have both changed to an increase of 5% to 10% in each segment (previously an increase up to 5% in each) due to the effects of foreign exchange. We have also adjusted our outlook for NUKEM revenue to an increase of 30% to 35% (previously an increase of 20% to 25%) due to the effects of foreign exchange; however, the higher revenue expectation is largely offset by our adjusted outlook for NUKEM unit cost of sales, which is now expected to increase 15% to 20% (previously an increase of 5% to 10%), also due to the effects of foreign exchange. We have adjusted our outlook for the consolidated tax rate to a recovery of 25% to 30% (previously 40% to 45%) due to the expected impact of the changes to our revenue outlook noted above, and a change in the distribution of earnings between jurisdictions. We now expect capital expenditures to be $385 million (previously $405 million). The decrease is primarily due to the timing of expenditures on projects at Key Lake and McArthur River, as well as a reduction in planned spending at Cigar Lake due to changes in the mine plan, slightly offset by increased costs at Inkai and our US operations due to the effect of foreign exchange. REVENUE AND EARNINGS SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS For the rest of 2015: an increase of $5 (US) per pound in both the Ux spot price ($36.50 (US) per pound on October 26, 2015) and the Ux long-term price indicator ($44.00 (US) per pound on October 26, 2015) would increase revenue by $22 million and net earnings by $12 million. Conversely, a decrease of $5 (US) per pound would decrease revenue by $19 million and net earnings by $9 million. a one-cent change in the value of the Canadian dollar versus the US dollar would change adjusted net earnings by $3 million, with a decrease in the value of the Canadian dollar versus the US dollar having a positive impact ADJUSTED NET EARNINGS (NON-IFRS MEASURE) Adjusted net earnings are a measure that does not have a standardized meaning or a consistent basis of calculation under IFRS (non-IFRS measure). We use this measure as a more meaningful way to compare our financial performance from period to period. We believe that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, certain investors use this information to evaluate our performance. Adjusted net earnings are our net earnings attributable to equity holders, adjusted to better reflect the underlying financial performance for the reporting period. The adjusted earnings measure reflects the matching of the net benefits of our hedging program with the inflows of foreign currencies in the applicable reporting period, and has also been adjusted for NUKEM purchase price inventory write-downs and recoveries, income taxes on adjustments, impairment charges on non-producing property, and the after tax gain on the sale of our interest in BPLP. Adjusted net earnings are non-standard supplemental information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information prepared according to accounting standards. Other companies may calculate this measure differently, so you may not be able to make a direct comparison to similar measures presented by other companies. Discontinued operation On March 27, 2014, we completed the sale of our 31.6% limited partnership interest in BPLP, which was accounted for effective January 1, 2014. The aggregate sale price for our interest in BPLP and certain related entities was $450 million. We realized an after tax gain of $127 million on this divestiture. As a result of the transaction, we presented the results of BPLP as a discontinued operation and we revised our statement of earnings, statement of comprehensive income and statement of cash flows to reflect the change in presentation. See note 4 to the interim financial statements for more information. TRANSFER PRICING DISPUTES We have been reporting on our transfer pricing disputes with Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) since 2008, when it originated, and with the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) since the first quarter of 2015. Below, we discuss the general nature of transfer pricing disputes and, more specifically, the ongoing disputes we have. Transfer pricing is a complex area of tax law, and it is difficult to predict the outcome of cases like ours. However, tax authorities generally test two things: the governance (structure) of the corporate entities involved in the transactions the price at which goods and services are sold by one member of a corporate group to another We have a global customer base and we established a marketing and trading structure involving foreign subsidiaries, including Cameco Europe Limited (CEL), which entered into various intercompany arrangements, including purchase and sale agreements, as well as uranium purchase and sale agreements with third parties. Cameco and its subsidiaries made reasonable efforts to put arm's length transfer pricing arrangements in place, and these arrangements expose the parties to the risks and rewards accruing to them under these contracts. The intercompany contract prices are generally comparable to those established in comparable contracts between arm's-length parties entered into at that time. For the years 2003 to 2009, CRA has shifted CEL's income (as re-calculated by CRA) back to Canada and applied statutory tax rates, interest and instalment penalties, and, from 2007 to 2009, transfer pricing penalties. The IRS also allocated a portion of CEL's income for 2009 to the US, resulting in such income being taxed in multiple jurisdictions. Taxes of approximately $290 million for the 2003 - 2014 years have already been paid in a jurisdiction outside Canada and the US. Bilateral international tax treaties contain provisions that generally seek to prevent taxation of the same income in both countries. As such, in connection with these disputes, we are considering our options including remedies under international tax treaties that would limit double taxation; however, there is a risk that we will not be successful in eliminating all potential double taxation. The expected income adjustments under our tax disputes are represented by the amounts claimed by CRA and IRS and are described below. CRA dispute Since 2008, CRA has disputed our corporate structure and the related transfer pricing methodology we used for certain intercompany uranium sale and purchase agreements, and issued notices of reassessment for our 2003 through 2009 tax returns. We have recorded a cumulative tax provision of $92 million, where an argument could be made that our transfer price may have fallen outside of an appropriate range of pricing in uranium contracts for the period from 2003 through September 30, 2015. We are confident that we will be successful in our case and continue to believe the ultimate resolution of this matter will not be material to our financial position, results of operations and cash flows in the year(s) of resolution. For the years 2003 through 2009, CRA issued notices of reassessment for approximately $2.8 billion of additional income for Canadian tax purposes, which would result in a related tax expense of about $820 million. We expect to receive the reassessment for 2010 in the fourth quarter. CRA has also issued notices of reassessment for transfer pricing penalties for the years 2007 through 2009 in the amount of $229 million. The Canadian income tax rules include provisions that require larger companies like us to remit 50% of the cash tax plus related interest and penalties at the time of reassessment. To date, under these provisions, after applying elective deductions and tax loss carryovers, we have paid a net amount of $229 million cash to the Government of Canada, which includes the amounts shown in the table below.  These amounts do not include interest and instalment penalties, which totalled approximately $70 million to September 30, 2015. In light of our view of the likely outcome of the case as described above, we expect to recover the amounts remitted to the Government of Canada, including the $229 million already paid to date. We are expecting the trial for the 2003, 2005 and 2006 reassessments to commence during the week of September 26, 2016 and to conclude within four months thereafter. If this timing is adhered to, we expect to receive a Tax Court decision within six to 18 months after the trial is complete. IRS dispute In the first quarter, we received a Revenue Agent's Report (RAR) from the IRS challenging the transfer pricing used under certain intercompany transactions pertaining to the 2009 tax year for certain of our US subsidiaries. The RAR lists the adjustments proposed by the IRS and calculates the tax and any penalties owing based on the proposed adjustments. The current position of the IRS is that a portion of the non-US income reported under our corporate structure and taxed in non-US jurisdictions should be recognized and taxed in the US on the basis that: the prices received by our US mining subsidiaries for the sale of uranium to CEL are too low the compensation being earned by Cameco Inc., one of our US subsidiaries, is inadequate The proposed adjustments result in an increase in taxable income in the US of approximately $108 million (US) and a corresponding increased income tax expense of approximately $32 million (US) for the 2009 taxation year, with interest being charged thereon. In addition, the IRS proposed penalties of approximately $7 million (US) in respect of the adjustment. At present, the RAR pertains only to the 2009 tax year; however, the IRS is also auditing our tax returns for 2010 through 2012 on a similar basis and we expect adjustments in these years to be similar to those made for 2009. If the IRS audits years subsequent to 2012 on a similar basis, we expect these proposed adjustments would also be similar to those made for 2009. We believe that the conclusions of the IRS in the RAR are incorrect and we are contesting them in an administrative appeal, during which we are not required to make any cash payments. At present, this matter is still at an early stage and, until this matter progresses further, we cannot provide an estimation of the likely timeline for a resolution of the dispute. We believe that the ultimate resolution of this matter will not be material to our financial position, results of operations and cash flows in the year(s) of resolution. Caution about forward-looking information relating to our CRA and IRS tax disputes This discussion of our expectations relating to our tax disputes with CRA and IRS and future tax reassessments by CRA and IRS is forward-looking information that is based upon the assumptions and subject to the material risks discussed under the heading Caution about forward-looking information below and also on the more specific assumptions and risks listed below. Actual outcomes may vary significantly. Assumptions CRA will reassess us for the years 2010 through 2014 using a similar methodology as for the years 2003 through 2009, and the reassessments will be issued on the basis we expect we will be able to apply elective deductions to the extent anticipated we will be able to utilize letters of credit to the extent anticipated CRA will seek to impose transfer pricing penalties (in a manner consistent with penalties charged in the years 2007 through 2009) in addition to interest charges and instalment penalties we will be substantially successful in our dispute with CRA and the cumulative tax provision of $92 million to date will be adequate to satisfy any tax liability resulting from the outcome of the dispute to date IRS will continue to propose adjustments for the years 2010 through 2012 and may propose adjustments for later years we will be substantially successful in our dispute with IRS Material risks that could cause actual results to differ materially CRA reassesses us for years 2010 through 2014 using a different methodology than for years 2003 through 2009, or we are unable to apply elective deductions or utilize letters of credit to the same extent as anticipated, resulting in the required cash payments to CRA pending the outcome of the dispute being higher than expected the time lag for the reassessments for each year is different than we currently expect we are unsuccessful and the outcomes of our dispute with CRA and/or IRS result in significantly higher cash taxes, interest charges and penalties than the amount of our cumulative tax provision, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial position, results of operations and cash flows cash tax payable increases due to unanticipated adjustments by CRA or IRS not related to transfer pricing IRS proposes adjustments for years 2010 through 2014 using a different methodology than for 2009 we are unable to effectively eliminate all double taxation THIRD QUARTER Production volumes this quarter were 52% higher compared to the third quarter of 2014, mainly due to production from Cigar Lake and higher production from McArthur River/Key Lake, Rabbit Lake and Inkai, which was partially offset by lower production at our US operations. SeeUranium 2015 Q3 updates below for more information. The 13% decrease in uranium revenues was a result of a 23% decrease in sales volume, partially offset by a 13% increase in the Canadian dollar average realized price. The US dollar average realized price decreased by 5% compared to 2014 mainly due to lower prices on fixed price contracts, while the higher Canadian dollar realized prices this quarter were a result of the weakening of the Canadian dollar compared to 2014. This quarter the exchange rate on the average realized price was $1.00 (US) for $1.29 (Cdn) compared to $1.00 (US) for $1.09 (Cdn) in the third quarter of 2014. Total cost of sales (including D&A) decreased by 12% ($278 million compared to $315 million in 2014) due to a 23% decrease in sales volume, partially offset by a 14% increase in the unit cost of sales. The increase in the unit cost of sales was mainly the result of an increase in the volume of material purchased in the quarter at prices higher than our average cost of inventory and an increase in unit production costs related to the addition of higher cost production from Cigar Lake during ramp up. The net effect was a $22 million decrease in gross profit for the quarter. FIRST NINE MONTHS Production volumes for the first nine months of the year were 24% higher than in the previous year due to the addition of production from Cigar Lake and higher production at McArthur/Key Lake, and Rabbit Lake, partially offset by lower production at our US operations. SeeUranium 2015 Q3 updates below for more information. Uranium revenues increased 1% compared to the first nine months of 2014 due to an 11% increase in the Canadian dollar average realized price, partially offset by a 9% decrease in sales volumes in the first nine months. In our uranium and fuel services segments, our customers choose when in the year to receive deliveries, so our quarterly delivery patterns, sales volumes and revenue can vary significantly. We are on track to meet our 2015 uranium sales targets, and, therefore, expect to deliver between 10 million and 12 million pounds in the fourth quarter. Our Canadian dollar realized prices for the first nine months of 2015 were higher than 2014, primarily as a result of the weakening of the Canadian dollar compared to 2014. For the first nine months of 2015, the exchange rate on the average realized price was $1.00 (US) for $1.25 (Cdn) compared to $1.00 (US) for $1.09 (Cdn) for the same period in 2014. Total cost of sales (including D&A) increased by 2% ($829 million compared to $810 million in 2014) mainly due to a 12% increase in the unit cost of sales, partially offset by a 9% decrease in sales volume for the first nine months. The increase in the unit cost of sales was mainly the result of an increase in the volume of material purchased in the first nine months at prices higher than our average cost of inventory, and an increase in unit production costs related to the addition of higher cost production from Cigar Lake during rampup. The net effect was a $12 million decrease in gross profit for the first nine months. We are active in the uranium market, buying and selling uranium on the spot market and under long-term contracts when we expect it will be beneficial for us. Purchases are impacted by foreign exchange rates, and may, in some cases, require we pay prices higher or lower than current spot prices. Depending on the volume and unit cost of purchases in a quarter, our average cost of inventory can be impacted, which flows through to our cost of sales. The table below shows the costs of produced and purchased uranium incurred in the reporting periods (which are non-IFRS measures, see the paragraphs below the table). These costs do not include selling costs such as royalties, transportation and commissions, nor do they reflect the impact of opening inventories on our reported cost of sales. This quarter, cash costs of purchased material were $37.78 US per pound compared to $27.98 US per pound in the same period in 2014. In the third quarter the exchange rate on purchases averaged $1.00 (US) for $1.25 (Cdn) compared to $1.00 (US) for $1.10 (Cdn) in the third quarter of 2014. For the first nine months, cash costs of purchased material were $37.51 US per pound compared to $33.89 per lb in the same period in 2014. For the first nine months of 2015, the exchange rate on purchases averaged $1.00 (US) for $1.25 (Cdn) compared to $1.00 (US) for $1.10 (Cdn) for the same period in 2014. Cash cost per pound, non-cash cost per pound and total cost per pound for produced and purchased uranium presented in the above table are non-IFRS measures. These measures do not have a standardized meaning or a consistent basis of calculation under IFRS. We use these measures in our assessment of the performance of our uranium business. We believe that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, certain investors use this information to evaluate our performance and ability to generate cash flow. These measures are non-standard supplemental information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared according to accounting standards. These measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under IFRS. Other companies may calculate these measures differently, so you may not be able to make a direct comparison to similar measures presented by other companies. To facilitate a better understanding of these measures, the following table presents a reconciliation of these measures to our unit cost of sales for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2015 and 2014. Fuel services THIRD QUARTER Total revenue for the third quarter of 2015 increased to $83 million from $71 million for the same period last year. A 23% increase in sales volumes was partially offset by a 4% decrease in average realized price, primarily due to the mix of products sold, partially offset by the weakening of the Canadian dollar compared to 2014. The total cost of products and services sold (including D&A) increased by 6% ($70 million compared to $66 million in the third quarter of 2014) due to the increase in sales volumes, partially offset by a decrease in the average unit cost of sales. When compared to 2014, the average unit cost of sales was 13% lower due to the mix of fuel services products sold, partially offset by higher production costs. The net effect was an $8 million increase in gross profit. FIRST NINE MONTHS In the first nine months of the year, total revenue increased by 21% due to an 11% increase in sales volumes and a 9% increase in realized price that was the result of the weakening of the Canadian dollar and the mix of products sold. The total cost of sales (including D&A) increased 13% ($180 million compared to $159 million in 2014) due to an increase in sales volume and a 1% increase in the average unit cost of sales, which resulted from increased production costs, partially offset by the mix of fuel services products sold. The net effect was a $17 million increase in gross profit. NUKEM Includes sales and revenue between our uranium, fuel services and NUKEM segments (130,000 pounds in sales and revenue of $6.0 million in Q3, 2015, nil in Q3, 2014; 873,000 pounds in sales and revenue of $19.3 million in the first nine months of 2015, nil in the first nine months of 2014). THIRD QUARTER During the third quarter of 2015, NUKEM delivered 2.9 million pounds of uranium, an increase of 16% from the same period last year. Total revenues increased by 89% as a result of higher sales volumes and average realized prices which were 37% higher than those realized in the third quarter of 2014. Gross profit percentage was 8% in the third quarter of 2015, a slight increase from 9% recorded in the third quarter of 2014. The allocation of the historic purchase price to the sale of inventory on hand at the time of acquisition of NUKEM, impacted margins for the quarter. The net effect was a $5 million increase in gross profit. FIRST NINE MONTHS During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, NUKEM delivered 6.9 million pounds of uranium, an increase of 47%, due to timing of customer requirements and generally lower activity in the market during 2014. Total revenues increased 90% due to a 47% increase in sales volumes and an 18% increase in average realized price. Gross profit percentage was 10% for the first nine months of 2015, unchanged from the same period in 2014. Included in the 2014 margin was a $6 million write-down of inventory compared to a $3 million recovery in 2015. The write-down in 2014 was a result of a decline in the spot price during the period. The net effect was a $16 million increase in gross profit. Uranium 2015 Q3 updates MCARTHUR RIVER/KEY LAKE Production for the quarter was 26% higher compared to the same period last year and 6% higher for the first nine months due to the timing of mill maintenance. At Key Lake, commissioning of the new calciner is underway and expected to be complete by year end. The existing calciner circuit will remain in place until operational reliability of the new calciner is achieved. The operation remains on track to achieve our planned 2015 production; however, operational tie-ins of the new calciner will require brief production outages in the fourth quarter, and the output of the mill will be sensitive to the performance of the calciners. CIGAR LAKE During the third quarter, Cigar Lake packaged approximately 3.6 million pounds (100% basis, 1.8 million pounds our share) for total production of 6.7 million pounds (100% basis, 3.3 million pounds our share) to the end of September. As of the end of October, the mill has packaged over 8 million pounds (100% basis) and exceeded the 2015 production target range. If production continues at current rates, the McClean Lake mill could produce more than 10 million packaged pounds of uranium (100% basis, 5 million pounds our share) from Cigar Lake in 2015. As we ramp up production to 18 million pounds (100% basis) by 2018, volumes may not be linear year-to-year, but will vary based on our operational experience. To ensure the most efficient operation of the mine and mill throughout the year, we expect to continually manage ore supply and, therefore, may halt and resume mining several times during a quarter without impacting planned annual production. INKAI Production for the quarter was 25% higher compared to the same period last year due to the timing of new wellfield development. Production remains unchanged for the first nine months of the year compared to the same periods in 2014. The operation remains on track to achieve our planned 2015 production.

FNV) Franco-Nevada is the leading gold-focused royalty and stream company by both gold revenues and number of gold assets. The Company is gold-focused but also has the largest and most diversified portfolio of royalties and streams by commodity, geography, revenue type and stage of project. The portfolio is actively managed with the aim to maintain over 80% of revenue from precious metals (gold, silver & PGM). The Company does not operate mines, develop projects or conduct exploration. Franco-Nevada's business model is focused on managing and growing its portfolio of royalties and streams. The advantages of this business model are: Market Exposure to the gold price and exploration optionality; Limited exposure to many of the risks associated with operating companies; A free cash-flow business with limited cash calls; A high-margin business that can generate cash through the entire commodity cycle; A scalable and diversified business in which a large number of assets can be managed with a small stable overhead; A forward-looking business in which management focuses on growth opportunities rather than operational or development issues; and A perpetual discovery option over large areas of geologically prospective lands with no cost other than the initial investment. Franco-Nevada's financial results in the short-term are primarily tied to the price of commodities and the amount of production from its portfolio of producing assets. From time to time, financial results are also supplemented by acquisitions of new producing assets. Over the longer-term, results are impacted by the availability of exploration and development capital applied by other companies to advance Franco-Nevada's advanced and exploration assets into production. Franco-Nevada has a long-term focus in making its investments and recognizes it is in a cyclical industry. Franco-Nevada has historically operated by maintaining a strong balance sheet so that it can make investments during commodity cycle downturns. At year-end 2014, Franco-Nevada had $677.8 million in working capital and an undrawn $500.0 million unsecured credit facility. Franco-Nevada's shares are listed on the Toronto and New York stock exchanges under the symbol FNV. An investment in Franco-Nevada's shares is expected to provide investors with yield and more upside than gold ETF without exposure to operating cost inflation. Since its IPO over seven years ago, Franco-Nevada's share price has outperformed the gold price and all relevant gold equity benchmarks. Franco-Nevada Reports Q3 2015 Results and Declares Quarterly Dividend TORONTO, November 11, 2015 - Franco-Nevada Corporation (TSX: FNV; NYSE: FNV) today reported third quarter 2015 financial results realizing 85,637 Gold Equivalent Ounces (\"GEOs\")1 from its mineral assets and $7.8 million in revenue from its oil & gas assets. Net Income and Adjusted Net Income2 were $15.2 million, or $0.10 per share, and $19.4 million, or $0.12 per share, respectively, with Adjusted EBITDA3 being $78.0 million, or $0.50 per share. Prepared in accordance with IFRS and presented in U.S. dollars (unless otherwise noted). \"Franco-Nevada's diversified portfolio continues to perform well,\" said David Harquail, CEO. \"It is significant that these results are before any contributions from our $610 million Antamina silver stream investment which closed in October. We expect to begin recording revenues from the sale of ounces from Antamina in Q4 2015. Also, in November we began funding our gold and silver stream investment in the Cobre Panama project which we expect will be ramping up production in 2018. Franco-Nevada now has net debt of approximately $330 million, an undrawn credit facility of $270 million and remains well-positioned to continue to add to its portfolio.\" Revenues and GEOs by Asset Categories For the third quarter of 2015, revenue was earned 90% from precious metals (83% gold and 7% PGM) and 79% from the Americas (19% U.S., 23% Canada and 37% Latin America). Costs and expenses were impacted by higher depletion expense and costs of sales due to the Candelaria acquisition. Oil & gas production levels were stable with the associated oil & gas revenue decreasing significantly year over year due to lower average oil & gas prices in 2015. Cash provided by operating activities before changes to working capital was $72.4 million. Corporate Updates Antamina: On October 9, 2015, Franco-Nevada closed the previously announced Antamina silver stream with Teck Resources Limited by providing a $610.0 million upfront payment. The payment was funded through a combination of cash on hand and a partial draw of the Company's credit facility. Antamina is expected to contribute between 900,000 to 1,100,000 silver ounces (12,300 to 15,000 GEOs) in Q4 2015. Cobre Panama: Franco-Nevada and First Quantum finalized terms of a replacement precious metals stream agreement on the Cobre Panama project. On November 3, 2015, Franco-Nevada made a $337.9 million initial upfront payment under its $1.0 billion commitment which was funded through cash on hand and proceeds from a partial draw of its credit facility. Credit Facility: Franco-Nevada has entered into an agreement to increase its credit facility to $1.0 billion while maintaining a $250.0 million accordion and extending the maturity to November 2020. Closing is expected to occur prior to the end of November. Portfolio Updates Gold - U.S.: GEOs from U.S. gold assets increased to 14,618 GEOs mainly due to higher production at Goldstrike, Bald Mountain and Gold Quarry, partially offset by lower production at Marigold and fewer ounces under the Fire Creek/Midas fixed deliveries due to a reduction of the monthly ounce obligation in 2015 compared to 2014. Klondex Mines released an updated Mineral Resource estimate for its Midas Mine and Fire Creek project and announced positive drill results from recent underground and surface drilling at its Midas Mine. Gold - Canada: GEOs from Canadian assets decreased in the quarter due to lower production at Hemlo and Sudbury. In Ontario, Lake Shore Gold and Kirkland Lake Gold both announced positive drill results at their respective projects where Franco-Nevada holds various interests. Pretium Resources announced a $540 million construction financing package for its Brucejack project where Franco-Nevada has a 1.2% NSR. At the Phoenix gold project, where Franco-Nevada holds a 2% NSR, Rubicon Minerals announced the temporary suspension of underground activities while it reviews its geological model and develops an implementation plan Gold - Latin America: Candelaria had a strong quarter delivering 19,081 GEOs to Franco-Nevada. During the quarter, Lundin Mining released an updated mine plan for Candelaria which reflected a 26% increase in precious metal production over the next four years. Under the Guadalupe stream agreement, Franco-Nevada funded $4.0 million during the quarter and the final instalment of $8.0 million subsequent to the quarter. Gold - Rest of World: Contributions from Sabodala and Mine Waste Solutions represented approximately 60% of the total GEOs received from Rest of World gold assets for Q3 2015. True Gold announced the commencement of mining at its Karma project and remains on track for gold production at the end of Q1 2016. Franco-Nevada funded $10.4 million in the quarter and $9.7 million subsequent to the quarter under the Karma stream agreement bringing the total funded to $63.4 million. Perseus Mining announced it had signed a Mining Convention with the Ivorian government on its Sissingue project and expects to make a production decision in the fourth quarter of 2015. PGM: PGM GEOs were impacted by declining palladium and platinum prices relative to gold in the quarter. Oil & gas: Revenue from oil & gas assets was $7.8 million in Q3 2015 with similar production levels as Q3 2014. The decrease in revenue is the result of lower average oil & gas prices. On November 6, 2015, Franco-Nevada acquired an additional 0.29% working interest in the Weyburn Unit for C$6.2 million. Dividend Declaration Franco-Nevada is pleased to announce that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.21 per share. The dividend will be paid on December 17, 2015 to shareholders of record on December 3, 2015.

Forward Looking Statements Non-IFRS Measures: Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed under IFRS and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. These measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under IFRS. Other companies may calculate these measures differently. For a reconciliation of these measures to various IFRS measures, please see below or the Company's current MD&A disclosure found on the Company's website, on SEDAR and on EDGAR. GEOs include our gold, silver, platinum, palladium and other mineral assets. GEOs are estimated on a gross basis for NSR royalties and, in the case of stream ounces, before the payment of the per ounce contractual price paid by the Company. For NPI royalties, GEOs are calculated taking into account the NPI economics. Platinum, palladium, silver and other minerals were converted to GEOs by dividing associated revenue, which includes settlement adjustments, by the average gold price for the period. For Q3 2015, the average commodity prices were as follows: $1,124/oz gold (2014 - $1,282/oz); $988/oz platinum (2014 - $1,434/oz); $14.91/oz silver (2014 - $19.63/oz) and $615/oz palladium (2014 - $863/oz). Adjusted Net Income is defined by the Company as net income (loss) excluding foreign exchange gains/losses, gains/losses on the sale of investments, impairment charges related to royalties, streams, working interests and investments, unusual non-recurring items, and the impact of taxes on all these items. Adjusted EBITDA is defined by the Company as net income (loss) excluding income tax expense/recovery, finance income and expenses, foreign exchange gains/losses, gains/losses on the sale of investments, depletion and depreciation, non-cash costs of sales and impairment charges related to royalties, streams, working interests and investments.

Goldcorp Delivers Strong Free Cash Flow as Third Quarter Gold Production Increases 42% October 29, 2015 (All amounts in $US unless stated otherwise) VANCOUVER, Oct. 29, 2015 /CNW/ - GOLDCORP INC. (TSX: G, NYSE: GG) today reported record third quarter gold production1 of 922,200 ounces, an increase of 42% compared to gold production of 651,700 ounces in the third quarter of 2014. Adjusted quarterly revenues1 were $1.3 billion. Adjusted operating cash flow1,2 was $374 million, compared to $399 million for the third quarter of 2014. Free cash flow3 was $243 million, compared to negative free cash flow of $355 million for the third quarter of 2014. The reported net loss attributable to shareholders of Goldcorp for the quarter was $192 million, or $0.23 per share, compared to a net loss of $44 million, or $0.05 per share, for the third quarter of 2014. The adjusted net loss1,4 was $37 million, or $0.04 per share, compared to adjusted net earnings of $70 million, or $0.09 per share, for the third quarter of 2014. Included in the adjusted net loss is a reduction in the carrying values of inventory stockpiles of $40 million, or $0.05 per share. Third Quarter 2015 Highlights Gold sales1 of 942,600 ounces; gold production of 922,200 ounces. Free cash flow of $243 million before dividends; $168 million after dividends. Revolving credit facility fully repaid. Adjusted revenues of $1.3 billion. All-in sustaining costs1,5 of $848 per ounce. Adjusted operating cash flow of $374 million. Adjusted net loss of $37 million, or $0.04 per share. 2015 production and cost guidance re-confirmed. Announced joint venture (50/50) with Teck Resources Limited (\"Teck\") to combine El Morro and Relincho projects into a single project. \"Our third quarter results highlight the essence of Goldcorp's investment proposition: growing gold production, declining all-in sustaining costs and decreasing capital spending resulting in strong, sustained free cash flow, despite lower metals prices,\" said Chuck Jeannes, Goldcorp President and Chief Executive Officer. \"Record quarterly gold production, successful cost containment efforts and the wind-down of a capital investment program that has brought two high-quality gold mines into commercial production this year contributed to quarterly free cash flow of $243 million. The benefit of managing a strong portfolio of mines was illustrated in the quarter as good results at Penasquito, Cerro Negro and Musselwhite more than offset lower-than-expected production from Eleonore as the mine continues to ramp up. As a result, we remain on track to meet the upper end of our production guidance of between 3.3 and 3.6 million ounces at all-in sustaining costs of between $850 and $900 per ounce. Our focus over the balance of 2015 and into 2016 is on vigilant management of our costs in the current gold price environment, successful replacement of mined gold reserves and the prudent allocation of free cash flow to fortify our already-strong balance sheet and fund the next wave of Goldcorp's promising organic growth opportunities.\" Financial Review Third quarter gold sales were 942,600 ounces at an average realized gold price of $1,114per ounce on production of 922,200 ounces, compared to sales of 641,400 ounces at an average realized gold price of $1,266 per ounce on production of 651,700 ounces for the third quarter of 2014. Silver production totaled 11.3 million ounces compared to 7.8 million ounces in the prior year's third quarter. All-in sustaining costs were $848 per ounce of gold for the third quarter of 2015 compared to $1,066 per ounce in the third quarter of 2014. Excluding non-cash inventory impairments at Los Filos and Penasquito, all-in sustaining costs for the third quarter of 2015 would have been $802 per ounce. Adjusted revenues for the third quarter totaled $1.3 billion. The reported net loss attributable to shareholders of Goldcorp for the third quarter was $192 million, or $0.23 per share, compared to a net loss of $44 million, or $0.05 per share, for the third quarter of 2014. Adjusted net loss for the third quarter totaled $37 million, or $0.04 per share, compared to adjusted net earnings of $70 million, or $0.09 per share, for the third quarter of 2014. The adjusted net loss for the third quarter of 2015 primarily excludes the unrealized losses from the foreign exchange translation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities ($158 million, or $0.19 per share). The adjusted net loss includes the impact of non-cash stock-based compensation expenses which amounted to approximately $14 million, or $0.02 per share, for the quarter. Adjusted operating cash flow for the third quarter was $374 million, compared to $399 million for the third quarter of 2014. Canada At Eleonore in Quebec, third quarter safe gold production totaled 86,700 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $974 per ounce. Production increased over the prior quarter as a result of the expansion of underground mining from two to four horizons, in addition to successful mine optimization initiatives. Stoping productivity and mining flexibility continued to improve, contributing to higher underground mine tonnage quarter over quarter. Throughput during the quarter averaged 6,500 tonnes per day. While recoveries in the third quarter were impacted by the presence of iron sulphides in certain production stopes, metallurgical studies are underway that are expected to minimize the effect on future recoveries. As previously reported on September 8, 2015, initial production stopes at Eleonore are encountering folding and faulting resulting in higher dilution and therefore lower than planned mined grades and gold production. The folding is of varying intensities and is estimated to affect approximately 10% of the overall Eleonore deposit. The Eleonore team continues to work on adjusting stope designs to minimize these impacts. Work on the Eleonore crown pillar pre-feasibility study continued to advance during the third quarter. Major activities included the successful completion of summer field work, underground and surface infrastructure and stope sequencing determination of the dike location, and permitting and stakeholder engagement efforts. The pre-feasibility study is on track to be completed by the end of 2015. Safe gold production at Red Lake in Ontario in the third quarter totaled 77,600 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $1,028 per ounce. Production decreased over the prior quarter as a result of lower grades from remnant pillar mining at the Campbell Complex, the acceleration of development in the Sulphide Zones and lower-than-expected grades in the Footwall Zone. An exploration drift to access the HG Young discovery at depth continued to advance north on the 14 Level at the Campbell Complex. The drift provides a new platform for follow-up drilling down plunge of positive intercepts from the ongoing surface exploration program at HG Young. At Cochenour, exploration drilling continued to assess the core area of the deposit as well as at the tram level, where there have been changes in the orientation of the veins from prior interpretations. Detailed interpretation and analysis is ongoing to support final mine planning and infrastructure. Processing of mill feed from the initial sill-development work was consistent with expectations. Work is ongoing to define the timing of initial stope production and ramp up of Cochenour feed for processing at Red Lake. At Porcupine in Ontario, safe gold production for the third quarter was 71,000 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $882 per ounce. Production decreased over the prior quarter due to lower gold grades, driven primarily by the mining of lower-grade stopes at the Hoyle Pond underground, partially offset by higher tonnage milled as a result of improved mill operations during the quarter. The Hoyle Deep project, which will enable efficient access to lower portions of the Hoyle Pond deposit, continued to progress and remains on track to be fully operational in the first quarter of 2016. At the Hollinger open pit, the environmental control berm was completed in mid-October, enabling mining to take place 24 hours a day. At the Borden project 160 kilometres west of Porcupine, studies are underway to determine the optimization of a combined Borden-Porcupine operation. Options to access the deposit from underground are currently being evaluated in preparation for permit applications. Surface diamond drilling continued during the third quarter with seven drills on site. The current exploration activity in this new gold district remains focused on in-fill drilling with a target to convert a portion of the resources into reserves at the end of 2015. Safe gold production at Musselwhite in Ontario increased over the prior quarter to 71,000 ounces as a result of higher mill throughput and increased grades. Musselwhite's all-in sustaining cost continued to be among the lowest in the portfolio at $697 per ounce. The focus of the exploration program during the third quarter was on reserve replacement. Drilling concluded late in the third quarter on the West Limb zone and the Upper Lynx zone with positive results showing continuity of mineralization in both areas. All critical exploration development for the year is complete. Latin America At Penasquito in Mexico, safe gold production totaled 236,800 ounces for the quarter at an all-in sustaining cost of $467 per ounce. Production was driven primarily by higher gold grades in sulphide as a result of positive model reconciliation. In light of continued strong performance, production at Penasquito will exceed 2015 guidance of between 700,000 and 750,000 ounces. Construction of the Northern Well Field (\"NWF\") remained suspended throughout the third quarter of 2015 due to an illegal blockade by a local community. Penasquito continues to seek a fair resolution of this matter with the community, while taking steps to enforce its contractual rights. Penasquito is also advancing alternatives for completion of the project without crossing through the affected community lands. Contingency planning is ongoing for fresh water supply to the Penasquito mine until the NWF project is operational. The Company believes that there will be timely resolution of this matter to meet the future water needs of Penasquito. The Metallurgical Enhancement Project (\"MEP\") feasibility study continued, which included completion of pilot testing, confirming capital estimates and concentrate marketing studies. The feasibility study remains on schedule to be completed in early 2016. At the Camino Rojo project, ongoing pre-feasibility study work is focused on the evaluation of Camino Rojo as a supplemental source of sulphide feed to the existing Penasquito facility, in addition to a smaller, stand-alone oxide heap leach facility. An update of the geologic model continued during the third quarter and metallurgical testing of sulphide, transition and oxide zones is ongoing. The pre-feasibility study is on track to be completed in 2016. Safe gold production at Los Filos in Mexico for the third quarter of 2015 totaled 70,300 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $1,442 per ounce. Increased production over the prior quarter was a result of higher ore processed. The 2015 exploration program to enhance deeper phases of the El Bermejal pit and extend high grade zones for underground mining was completed. A new life-of-mine plan is progressing with a focus to maximize return on investment in the current lower price metals environment and is expected to be completed by the end of 2015. At Cerro Negro in Argentina, third quarter safe gold production totaled 135,700 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $731 per ounce, driven by the continued strong ramp-up at both the Mariana Central and Eureka mines. Total tonnes milled increased resulting in an average throughput rate of 3,697 tonnes per day for the quarter. Average milling rates for September surpassed the nameplate capacity of 4,000 tonnes per operating day. Exploration in the third quarter continued to focus on surface resource confirmation drilling. The current drilling program is progressing as planned, expanding resources at the Marianas Complex, particularly at the newly-discovered Emilia vein. The Bajo Negro expansion was completed in the third quarter and the results will be included within the year-end resource update. On September 30, 2015, a work stoppage took place at Cerro Negro by miners represented by the Asociacion Obrera Minera Argentina, Province of Santa Cruz. All work activity resumed on October 5, 2015 following the declaration of a mandatory minimum 15-day conciliation period by the Santa Cruz Provincial Secretariat of Labour. Subsequent to the expiration of the conciliation period productive negotiations continue. The Company remains committed to working cooperatively with union representatives and government authorities on a fair and equitable resolution. At the Pueblo Viejo joint venture in the Dominican Republic, Goldcorp's share of third quarter safe gold and silver production totaled 115,000 ounces and 502,700 ounces, respectively, at an all-in sustaining cost of $585 per ounce. Gold production increased over the prior quarter as a result of higher tonnes processed, grades and recoveries. Silver production increased primarily due to higher recoveries. Tonnage processed was higher in the third quarter due to the prior quarter being impacted by autoclave and counter current decantation thickener maintenance. Silver recoveries were higher due to the shut-down of the lime boil tanks during autoclave maintenance in the prior quarter. At El Morro in Chile, an agreement was reached with Teck on August 27, 2015 to combine the El Morro and Relincho projects into a 50/50 joint venture. In addition, an agreement was reached with New Gold to acquire New Gold's 30% interest in the El Morro project for$90 million in cash upon closing, and a 4% gold stream on future gold production from the El Morro property. Closing of both transactions is expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2015. The project will undertake extensive engagement with communities and other stakeholders to help guide the project's development. In combination with community consultation, a pre-feasibility study is expected to commence in mid-2016. 2015 Guidance Outlook The Company today reconfirmed 2015 production guidance, expected to be at the upper-end of between 3.3 and 3.6 million gold ounces. All-in sustaining costs are expected to be between $850 and $900 per gold ounce; $500 and $550 per ounce on a by-product basis; and $625 to $675 per ounce on a co-product basis. Depreciation, depletion and amortization (\"DD&A\") will increase to $450 per gold ounce from the previous guidance of$425 per gold ounce due primarily to production coming from our newer and higher DD&A per ounce sites and additional assets placed in service earlier than anticipated. Capital spending guidance remains unchanged at between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion for 2015. Corporate administration expense guidance, excluding share-based compensation, is expected to be approximately $170 million in 2015. Excluding the impacts of foreign exchange on current and deferred tax assets and liabilities and excluding the dilution and disposition gains on the sale of mining interests and the related taxes, the Company continues to expect an annual effective tax rate on adjusted earnings subject to income tax of 45% in 2015.

Competitive Strengths Growth in copper, gold and zinc production with exploration upside Consistent performance from reliable operations Disciplined and clear growth strategy already being executed Strong financial position Experienced management and operating team Hudbay Releases Third Quarter 2015 Results TORONTO, ONTARIO -- (Marketwired) -- 11/05/15 -- HudBay Minerals Inc. (\"Hudbay\" or the \"company\") (TSX: HBM)(NYSE:HBM) today released its third quarter 2015 financial results. In the third quarter of 2015, operating cash flow before stream deposit and change in non-cash working capital increased to $79.9 million from $12.1 million in the third quarter of 2014. The net loss and loss per share in the third quarter of 2015 were $11.8 million and $0.05, respectively, compared to net earnings and earnings per share of$46.2 million and $0.21, respectively, in the third quarter of 2014. Net loss and loss per share in the third quarter of 2015 were affected by, among other things, the following items: Pre-tax loss ($ millions) After-tax loss ($ millions) Per share loss  Hudbay expects to achieve full year 2015 production and cost guidance for all of its operations. Financial and Operating Results Starting with its results for the period ended September 30, 2015, Hudbay has changed its reporting currency to US dollars; accordingly, amounts are in US dollars unless otherwise noted. All comparable figures have been restated in US dollars, as per Note 4 of the unaudited condensed interim financial statements. Operating cash flows before stream deposit and changes in non-cash working capital increased 559% to $79.9 million for the three months ending September 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was the result of significant growth in production and sales of most metals as the Constancia mine achieved commercial production at the end of April 2015. Metals production increases included 389% for copper, 329% for silver, 45% for gold and 7% for zinc, and cash cost per pound of copper produced, net of by-product credits, was $0.90. While operating cash flows benefitted from the significant increase in sales volumes and a low cash cost, these factors were partly offset by lower realized prices for all metals when compared to the prior year's quarter. However, net earnings decreased by $58.0 million. This change occurred primarily as a result of a $34.5 million impairment charge associated with equipment inherited from the acquisition of Augusta. In addition, in the third quarter of 2014, Hudbay recorded net gains of $56.2 million related to the Augusta acquisition. Financial Performance ($000s except per share and cash cost amounts) Three months ended September 30 Nine months ended September 30  Attributable to owners of the Company. Operating cash flow per share and cash cost per pound of copper produced, net of by-product credits are non-IFRS financial performance measures with no standardized definition under IFRS. For further information and a detailed reconciliation, please see page 4 of this news release. Metal reported in concentrate is prior to refining losses or deductions associated with smelter contract terms. During the third quarter of 2015, shipments of copper concentrate from the Constancia mine to the port in Matarani were principally constrained by truck driver availability, and truck turnaround time due to road refurbishment. Due to these issues and the rapid ramp up in production, concentrate on site increased to approximately 65,000 tonnes at quarter end. With a significant increase in trucking capacity in Peru since the middle of September, considerable progress has been made in moving the excess copper concentrate from the Constancia site to port. The majority of the excess inventory is expected to be sold during the fourth quarter. Since September 30, 2015, inventory levels at the Constancia mine site have declined by approximately 30%. As at September 30, 2015, Hudbay had total liquidity of approximately $300 million, including $114 million in cash and cash equivalents as well as commitments under its revolving credit facility. This does not include approximately $60 million in expected net cash flow from the sale of excess unsold copper concentrate inventory. Recent Developments As indicated, there was an impairment loss recognized of $34.5 million to reflect the orderly liquidation value of the previously purchased equipment and certain long lead equipment deposits in the Arizona business unit. This followed from the completion of a value engineering process in the second and third quarters of 2015, which deemed that certain equipment previously purchased or ordered by prior Augusta management is unsuitable to achieve the design objectives for Rosemont, and that different equipment will better meet Rosemont's objectives while observing permitting commitments. Although Hudbay's valuation assumptions in determining the Augusta purchase price allocation allowed for additional capital spending beyond Augusta's previous guidance, the purchase price allocation valued this equipment at cost based on the information available at the time. The collective agreements with each of the seven labour unions representing employees at Hudbay's Manitoba business unit expired on December 31, 2014. All seven unions have now ratified new three-year agreements that provide enhancements to wage rates, pensions and benefits. The labour disruption experienced in the second and third quarters ended in late August. On November 2, 2015, Hudbay completed the sale of Balmat Holding Corporation to Northern Zinc, LLC and Northern Zinc, LLC was concurrently acquired byStar Mountain Resources, Inc. (\"Star Mountain\"). On closing, Hudbay received 550,000 shares of Star Mountain common stock and $1 million in cash; Hudbay previously received $0.5 million in upfront deposit payments and is entitled to receive up to an additional $15.5 million in future cash payments or, at Star Mountain's election, $7 million in cash within three months of the closing date. Peru Operations Review During the third quarter of 2015, mining operations continued as planned and cost optimization is underway. Equipment availabilities are within design parameters and both loading and hauling efficiencies remain consistent with expectations. Optimization of plant performance remains the primary focus, as more is understood about varying ore types. During September, copper recoveries plateaued at 80% due to a greater presence of oxide minerals than previously anticipated in the upper sequence of the mine. However, metals production targets continue to be achieved as the reduced ore recovery has been offset by higher-than-expected copper grades and ore throughput. Monthly ore throughput increased from 2 million tonnes in July to 2.6 million tonnes in September. Commissioning of the molybdenum concentrate circuit has been delayed into the fourth quarter due to the availability of key reagents and due to ore characteristics. Metal production and combined operating costs per tonne at Constancia are expected to be within guidance ranges for 2015. Manitoba Operations Review For the third quarter of 2015, ore processed was relatively consistent compared to the same period of 2014. Compared to the same quarter of the prior year, gold, zinc and copper grades were 17%, 6% and 5% higher, respectively, and silver grades were 15% lower as a result of normal mine sequencing. Combined operating costs per tonne of ore processed in the third quarter of 2015 were 34% higher, compared to the same period in 2014, primarily due to increased commercial production at the Snow Lake operations, which have higher unit costs, as well as increased unit costs at the Flin Flon operations resulting from decreased production at the 777 mine. In the fourth quarter of 2015, Hudbay expects to realize sequential improvements in metals production and unit costs per tonne of ore processed as the 777 mine is beginning to benefit from the effects of its planned mine fleet renewal. Metal production and combined operating costs per tonne in Manitoba are expected to be within guidance ranges for 2015. Non-IFRS Financial Performance Measures Operating cash flow per share and cash cost per pound of copper produced are included in this news release because the company believes that, in the case of operating cash flow per share, it helps investors and management to evaluate changes in cash flow while taking into account changes in shares outstanding, and in the case of cash cost per pound of copper produced, it helps investors assess the performance the company's operations. These measures do not have a meaning prescribed by IFRS and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with IFRS and are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under IFRS. Other companies may calculate these measures differently. Operating Cash Flow per Share The following table presents Hudbay's calculation of operating cash flow per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014: ($000s except shares and per share amounts) Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30  Operating cash flow per share is before stream deposit and change in non-cash working capital. It is a non-IFRS financial performance measure with no standardized meaning under IFRS. Reconciliation of Cash Cost, After By-product Credits (non-IFRS) to Cost of Sales (IFRS) Cash cost per pound of copper produced (\"cash cost\") is a non-IFRS measure that management uses as a key performance indicator to assess the performance of the company's operations. Hudbay's calculation designates copper as its primary metal of production as it has been, and is expected to be, the largest component of revenues. Two changes have been made to the cash cost calculation beginning with reporting for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015. First, the basis of measurement has been changed from pounds of copper sold to pounds of copper produced. This change has been made to better align the costs of production with copper produced in the same period and reduce the variation in cash cost due to inventory sales timing. Second, royalties have been removed from the cash cost. This change increases consistency between Hudbay's cash cost calculation and industry peers. The calculation is presented in two manners: Cash cost, before by-product credits - This measure is gross of by-product revenues and is a function of the efforts and costs incurred to mine and process all ore mined. However, the measure divides this aggregate cost over only pounds of copper produced, Hudbay's primary metal of production. This measure is generally less volatile from period to period, as it is not affected by changes in the price received for by-product metals. It is, however, significantly affected by the relative mix of copper concentrate and finished zinc production, and an increase in production of zinc metal will tend to result in an increase in cash costs under this measure. Cash cost, net of by-product credits - In order to calculate the cost to produce and sell copper, the net of by-product credits measure subtracts the revenues realized from the sale of the metals other than copper. The by-product revenues from zinc, gold, silver, and molybdenum are significant and are integral to the economics of Hudbay's operations. The economics that support Hudbay's decision to produce and sell copper would be different if the company did not receive revenues from the other significant metals being extracted and processed. This measure provides management and investors with an indication of the minimum copper price consistent with positive operating cash flows and operating margins, assuming that realized by-product metal prices are consistent with those prevailing during the reporting period. It also serves as an important operating statistic that management and investors utilize to measure Hudbay's operating performance versus that of its competitors. However, it is important to understand that if by-product metal prices decline alongside copper prices, the cash cost net of by-product credits would increase, requiring a higher copper price than that reported to maintain positive cash flows and operating margins.

OCT 28, 2015 - 17:30 ET Lundin Mining Third Quarter Results TORONTO, ONTARIO--(Marketwired - Oct. 28, 2015) - Lundin Mining Corporation (\"Lundin Mining\" or the \"Company\") (TSX: LUN) (OMX: LUMI) today reported a net loss of $35.3 million or a net loss attributable to Lundin shareholders (after deducting non-controlling interests) of $34.6 million ($0.05 per share) for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. Cash flows of $120.2 million were generated from operations in the quarter, not including the Company's attributable cash flows from Tenke Fungurume. The Company continued to strengthen its balance sheet, generating free-cash flow and reducing net debt during the quarter by a further $43.4 million to $453.8 million, despite lower metal prices and negative price adjustments of $56.4 million related to the re-pricing of provisional sales from prior periods. Mr. Paul Conibear, President and CEO commented, \"We are pleased that our operations continue to generate healthy cash flows despite the low commodity price environment. Our continued focus on cost efficiency and productivity enhancements has enabled us to maintain all mines producing at low cash costs with good margins, and we have been able to reduce our annual capital expenditure guidance by a further $40 million, while maintaining our production profile intact. The combination of our strong balance sheet and steady operations helps ensure that Lundin will remain in a favorable position to continue to generate excellent shareholder value moving forward.\"  Operating earnings is a non-GAAP measure defined as sales, less operating costs (excluding depreciation) and general and administrative costs. Net debt is a non-GAAP measure defined as cash and cash equivalents, less long-term debt and finance leases, before deferred financing fees. Highlights Operational Performance For the third quarter of 2015, production results were strong but financial results were impacted by a lower metal price environment. The Company remains on track to meet overall full year guidance. Candelaria (80%): The Candelaria operations produced, on a 100% basis, 45,195 tonnes of copper, and approximately 434,000 ounces of silver and 25,400 ounces of gold in concentrate, with copper and gold production better than expectations as a result of higher throughput. Copper cash costs1 of $1.44/lb for the quarter remain on track to meet full year guidance of $1.35/lb. Eagle (100%): Eagle's operational results were generally in-line with expectations, with both nickel (6,438 tonnes) and copper (6,514 tonnes) production meeting projections for the quarter. Nickel cash costs of $2.38/lb for the quarter were higher than full year guidance of $2.00/lb largely as a result of lower copper by-product credits. Both production and nickel cash costs remain on track to meet full year guidance. Neves-Corvo (100%): Neves-Corvo produced 13,917 tonnes of copper and 14,363 tonnes of zinc in the third quarter. Copper production exceeded the prior year comparable period by 28% due to higher head grades. Zinc production fell short of the prior year comparable period, resulting from lower mill feed grades and, in particular, below target metal recovery in the zinc plant. Copper cash costs of $1.83/lb for the quarter were higher than full year guidance ($1.55/lb) due primarily to lower by-product production and sales. Zinkgruvan (100%): Zinc production in the third quarter of 2015 was 8% lower than the comparable period in 2014, while lead production for the third quarter of 2015 was higher than the 2014 comparable period. Production variances for both metals were due to normal variations of grades in the ore milled. Cash costs for zinc of $0.41/lb for the quarter were in-line with guidance ($0.40/lb). Aguablanca (100%): Despite the suspension of underground mining operations during the quarter, Aguablanca met production expectations, though current quarter production of 1,708 tonnes of nickel and 1,658 tonnes of copper was lower than the prior year comparable period due to lower throughput, head grades, and recoveries from stockpiled ore. Cash costs of $5.23/lb of nickel for the quarter were higher than full year guidance ($3.75/lb). Tenke (24%): Tenke operations continue to perform well. Lundin's attributable share of third quarter production included 11,761 tonnes of copper cathode and 954 tonnes of cobalt in hydroxide. The Company's attributable share of sales included 12,278 tonnes of copper at an average realized price of $2.32/lb and 1,022 tonnes of cobalt at an average realized price of $8.96/lb. Tenke operating cash costs for the third quarter of 2015 were $1.15/lb of copper sold, marginally higher than the latest guidance. Cash distributions received by Lundin Mining in the quarter from Tenke were $2.5 million. An additional $1.2 million was received from the Freeport Cobalt operations. Year-to-date cash distributions to the Company from Tenke and Freeport Cobalt totalled $20.6 million, in-line with expectations. Cash cost/lb of copper, zinc and nickel are non-GAAP measures defined as all cash costs directly attributable to mining operations, less royalties and by-product credits.  Financial Performance Operating earnings for the quarter ended September 30, 2015 were $94.1 million, an increase of $51.2 million in comparison to the third quarter of the prior year ($42.9 million). The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of Candelaria's ($66.7 million) and Eagle's ($18.5 million) operating results. Operating earnings were also positively impacted by favourable foreign exchange rates ($19.1 million), partially offset by lower realized metal prices and price adjustments ($58.4 million) from our European operations. On a year-to-date basis, operating earnings were $611.1 million, an increase of $450.8 million in comparison to the first nine months of 2014 ($160.3 million). The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of Candelaria's ($371.8 million) and Eagle's ($114.9 million) operating results, and favourable foreign exchange rates ($60.5 million), partially offset by lower realized metal prices and price adjustments ($131.1 million) from our European operations. Sales for the quarter ended September 30, 2015 were $353.2 million, an increase of $186.6 million in comparison to the third quarter of the prior year ($166.6 million). The increase was mainly due to incremental sales from Candelaria and Eagle of $192.0 million and $60.0 million, respectively, partially offset by lower realized metal prices and price adjustments. On a year-to-date basis, sales were $1,386.0 million, an increase of $877.7 million in comparison to the first nine months of 2014 ($508.3 million). The increase was mainly due to incremental sales from Candelaria and Eagle of $740.7 million and $233.4 million, respectively, and higher net European sales volumes ($45.6 million), partially offset by lower realized metal prices and price adjustments. Average metal prices for copper, nickel and zinc for the quarter ended September 30, 2015 were lower (25%, 43%, and 20%, respectively) in comparison to the third quarter of the prior year. On a year-to-date basis, average metal prices for copper, nickel and zinc were lower (18%, 27%, and 5%, respectively) in comparison to the first nine months of 2014. Operating costs (excluding depreciation) for the quarter ended September 30, 2015 were $252.3 million, an increase of $134.7 million in comparison to the third quarter of the prior year ($117.6 million). The increase was largely due to incremental costs from Candelaria and Eagle of $125.2 million and $41.5 million, respectively, partially offset by favourable foreign exchange rates in the EUR and SEK ($19.1 million). On a year-to-date basis, operating costs (excluding depreciation) were $754.5 million, an increase of $425.7 million in comparison to the first nine months of 2014 ($328.8 million). The increase was largely due to incremental costs from Candelaria and Eagle of $368.9 million and $118.5 million, respectively, partially offset by favourable foreign exchange rates in the EUR and SEK ($60.5 million). Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 when measured against the comparable period in 2014. The increase was attributable to the acquisition of Candelaria (Q3 2015 - $58.6 million; YTD - $224.4 million) and the start of commercial production at Eagle (Q3 2015 - $32.0 million; YTD - $102.7 million). Cash flow from operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2015 was $120.2 million, an increase of $62.7 million in comparison to the third quarter of the prior year ($57.5 million). The increase was primarily due to operating earnings from Candelaria ($66.7 million) and Eagle ($18.5 million), and changes in non-cash working capital and long-term inventory ($50.8 million), partially offset by lower operating earnings at our European operations ($33.7 million), primarily due to lower metal prices and higher net income taxes paid ($33.6 million). On a year-to-date basis, cash flow from operations was $606.9 million, an increase of $488.1 million in comparison to the first nine months of 2014 ($118.8 million). The increase was attributable to operating earnings from Candelaria ($371.8 million) and Eagle ($114.9 million), and changes in non-cash working capital and long-term inventory ($138.3 million), partially offset by higher net income taxes paid ($71.7 million) and lower operating earnings at our European operations ($33.8 million). Net loss for the quarter ended September 30, 2015 was $35.3 million compared to net earnings of $33.7 million in the third quarter of the prior year. Net loss was impacted by: lower net earnings at our European operations, primarily the result of lower realized metal prices and price adjustments ($27.8 million); and interest expense associated with the senior secured notes ($20.2 million); andlower income from investment in Tenke ($19.3 million). On a year-to-date basis, net earnings were $101.8 million, an increase of $15.0 million in comparison to the first nine months of 2014 ($86.8 million). Net earnings were impacted by: addition of Candelaria ($112.9 million) and Eagle's first three full quarters of operations ($19.9 million); partially offset by interest expense associated with the senior secured notes ($60.0 million); and lower income from investment in Tenke ($43.0 million); and lower net earnings at our European operations, primarily the result of lower realized metal prices and price adjustments ($18.3 million). Corporate Highlights On July 23, 2015, the Company announced approval of the Environmental Impact Assessment (\"EIA\") for Candelaria 2030 - the project to install new tailings storage facilities and approvals for continued mine operation running to at least year 2030. Financial Position and Financing Net debt position at September 30, 2015 was $453.8 million compared to $829.2 million at December 31, 2014 and $497.2 million at June 30, 2015. The $43.4 million decrease in net debt during the quarter was largely attributable to operating cash flows of $120.2 million, partially offset by investments in mineral properties, plant and equipment of $73.0 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, net debt decreased by $375.4 million due primarily to operating cash flows of $606.9 million, partially offset by investments in mineral properties, plant and equipment of $215.7 million. The Company has a revolving credit facility available for borrowing up to $350 million. As at September 30, 2015, the Company had no amount drawn on the credit facility. A letter of credit in the amount of $19.3 million (SEK 162 million) is outstanding. Net debt at October 28, 2015 is approximately $448 million. Outlook 2015 Production and Cost Guidance Production and cash cost guidance for 2015 has been updated from that disclosed in our Management Discussion and Analysis for the six months ended June 30, 2015, as noted below. Production guidance ranges for all sites have been narrowed to account for production results to date. Cash cost guidance at Neves-Corvo has been increased slightly ($0.05/lb) to reflect lower expected sales of by-products and lower metal prices. Cash cost and production guidance for the Aguablanca Mine reflects that all mining and milling activities are suspended at the Aguablanca nickel-copper mine in Spain. Underground production activities at the operation have been in suspension since late July of 2015. Since that time, the processing plant has been running exclusively on stockpiled material, which has now been exhausted. As the Company has not yet received the needed environmental approvals to recommence underground mining, a decision has been made to fully suspend the operations pending further notice. The full year guidance for cash costs and production are based on an estimate of October production and may change slightly upon finalization of assays and financial results. Guidance on Tenke's cash costs have been updated to reflect the most recent guidance provided by Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (\"Freeport\").  Guidance as outlined in our Management's Discussion and Analysis for the quarter ended June 30, 2015. Cash costs remain dependent upon exchange rates (forecast at EUR/USD:1.15, USD/SEK:8.25, USD/CLP:680) and metal prices (forecast at Cu: $2.50/lb, Ni: $5.00/lb, Zn: $0.85/lb, Pb: $0.80/lb, Au: $1,100/oz, Ag: $15.00/oz, Co: $13.00/lb). Prior guidance forecast USD/CLP at 625, Cu at $2.70/lb, Ni at $6.25/lb and Zn at $0.95/lb. Freeport has provided 2015 sales and cash costs guidance. Tenke's 2015 production is assumed to approximate sales guidance. 2015 Capital Expenditure and Exploration Guidance Capital expenditures for 2015 are expected to be $310 million (excluding Tenke), $40 million less than previous guidance. The Company expects to spend $20 million less on sustaining capital expenditures at our Candelaria and Neves-Corvo operations as part of on-going efforts to defer or reduce non-essential spending during the current metal price environment.  Guidance as outlined in our Management's Discussion and Analysis for the quarter ended June 30, 2015. The Company estimates its share of expansion related initiatives and sustaining capital funding for 2015 at Tenke to be $80 million, unchanged from previous guidance. All of the capital expenditures are expected to be self-funded by cash flow from Tenke operations. The Company expects to receive cash distributions from Tenke in 2015 of approximately $20 million, at the lower end of previous guidance of $20 - $30 million. The total exploration expense is expected to be $60 million, unchanged from previous guidance.

(TSE: POT) Who we are PotashCorp is the world's largest fertilizer company by capacity, producing the three primary crop nutrients: potash (K), nitrogen (N) and phosphate (P). We are the world's leading potash producer by capacity and our Canadian operations represent nearly one-fifth of global capacity1. To enhance our global footprint, we also have investments in four potash-related businesses in South America, the Middle East and Asia. With operations and business interests in seven countries, PotashCorp is an international enterprise and plays an important role in helping the world grow the food it needs. What we produce Our potash, phosphate and nitrogen products help provide the primary nutrients that crops need. They are also used to make livestock feeds and industrial goods. Produced from mineral deposits (potash and phosphate) and from the air we breathe (nitrogen), our main products are: potash, in standard and granular grades DAP (diammonium phosphate), MAP (monoammonium phosphate) and phosphoric acid Ammonia and urea Why fertilizer? With world population rising, arable land per person diminishing and demand increasing for higher quality diets that include more fruits and vegetables and protein from crop-fed livestock, the need to maximize the efficiency of farmland has never been greater. Every crop harvested removes nutrients from the soil, which must be replaced to keep soil healthy and productive. Responsible for more than 40 percent of the world's total crop yield, fertilizers feed plants, which help to feed animals and people. Where we serve Our products serve customers throughout the global marketplace from China, the world's most populous nation and largest fertilizer consumer, to India, with its 1.2 billion people. From Latin America an agricultural superpower to the rice and oil palm producing fields of Other Asian countries and the breadbasket markets of North America. Together these five regions account for nearly three-quarters of the world's population and roughly 80 percent of the total fertilizer consumption. Delivering when we're needed As the world's food challenges become more pressing, we're taking an active role in meeting them, investing heavily in our assets to deliver quality product when and where our customers need it. We are adding to our current potash capacity without building a new mine - an advantage as demand is expected to rise. And through our partnerships and investments, we strive to better serve customers in emerging markets. How we do business We hold ourselves to the highest business standards and consider factors beyond financial performance when evaluating our success. Guided by our Core Values, we cultivate mutually beneficial relationships with our communities, customers, employees, investors and other people critical to our success. Acting with a long-term view, we make decisions that consider people and the planet, always looking for opportunities to improve. OCT 29 2015 Q3: PotashCorp Reports 2015 Third-Quarter Earnings of $0.34 per Share Key Highlights Third-quarter earnings of $0.34 per share1, including $0.03 per share related to notable non-cash charges, primarily in phosphate Annual earnings guidance adjusted to $1.55 - $1.65 per share Preparing for closure of Penobsquis mine and inventory shutdowns at Cory, Allan and Lanigan CEO Commentary \"Broader emerging market concerns have weighed on customer sentiment, contributing to a weaker fertilizer environment in the second half of 2015,\" said PotashCorp President and Chief Executive Officer Jochen Tilk. \"In response, we are moving forward the permanent closure date of our Penobsquis, New Brunswick mine and planning inventory shutdowns in December at three of our Saskatchewan mines. While we anticipate production in the fourth quarter to be reduced by nearly 500,000 tonnes, we do not expect employee layoffs.\" \"Despite challenges over recent months, we are seeing signs of a shift in focus by distributors and farmers to 2016,\" Tilk said. \"We believe the need for increased global agricultural production - coupled with supportive crop prices - provides a compelling opportunity for farmers.\" Saskatoon, Saskatchewan - Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc. (PotashCorp) reported third-quarter earnings of $0.34 per share ($282 million), bringing the nine-month total to $1.28 per share ($1.1 billion). Earnings for both the quarter and the first nine months modestly trailed 2014's comparable period amounts of $0.38 per share ($317 million) and $1.33 per share ($1.1 billion), respectively. Gross margin for the quarter totaled $505 million, below the $589 million generated during the third quarter of 2014, primarily due to weaker nitrogen contributions. For the first nine months, improved potash and phosphate contributions largely offset weaker nitrogen performance, as gross margin totaled $1.9 billion, relatively flat compared to the same period in 2014. Cash from operating activities of $358 million in the third quarter and $1.7 billion for the first nine months of 2015 were below last year's comparable totals of $574 million and $1.9 billion, respectively. Earnings before finance costs, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization (EBITDA)2 of $593 million for the quarter and $2.1 billion for the first nine months were also below 2014's comparative figures. Investments in Arab Potash Company (APC) in Jordan, Israel Chemicals Ltd. (ICL) in Israel and Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile S.A. (SQM) in Chile contributed $37 million to our quarterly earnings, exceeding the $24 million earned in third-quarter 2014. Our nine-month total of $134 million, which included a dividend from Sinofert Holdings Limited (Sinofert) in China, was down from last year's total of $179 million when we received a $69 million special dividend from ICL. The market value of our investments in these four publicly traded companies equated to approximately $4 billion, or $5 per PotashCorp share, at market close on October 28, 2015. Market Conditions Global potash demand remained strong during the quarter as higher volumes to Brazil, India and China helped offset slower purchasing in other markets. With many buyers moving cautiously amidst economic headwinds and significant currency volatility, prices declined in most key potash markets. In nitrogen, prices for nearly all products were lower compared to third-quarter 2014 as market fundamentals weakened. Rising global supply due in part to lower energy prices - combined with weaker shipments to Latin America - largely overshadowed strong demand from India compared to 2014. In phosphate, markets for solid fertilizer remained relatively stable. Increased Chinese exports and weaker demand in Latin America more than offset stronger Indian demand and resulted in relatively flat pricing. Other phosphate products were supported by strong demand in North America and India, driving prices for liquid fertilizers, feed and industrial products above those of 2014's third quarter. Potash Potash gross margin of $294 million for 2015's third quarter was relatively flat compared to the same period last year. This result raised our total for the first nine months to $1.1 billion, 15 percent higher than the comparable period of 2014, primarily due to slightly higher realized prices and lower costs. Shipments for the quarter reached 2.2 million tonnes, increasing the total for the first nine months of 2015 to 7.0 million tonnes driven largely by offshore demand. Sales volumes for both the quarter and the full year surpassed the results for the comparable periods in 2014. Offshore shipments reached 1.5 million tonnes in the third quarter, with the majority of Canpotex's3 volumes to Latin America (40 percent) and Other Asian markets (29 percent), while India and China accounted for 15 percent and 11 percent, respectively. North American sales totaled 0.7 million tonnes. Our average realized potash price of $250 per tonne in the third quarter was down from $281 per tonne in the same period last year due to declining prices in North America and a higher percentage of sales volumes to lower-netback offshore markets. Cost of goods sold of $113 per tonne in the third quarter was 14 percent lower than the same period last year due to the favorable impact of a weakened Canadian dollar and the deferral of annual maintenance at certain locations to the fourth quarter of 2015. Nitrogen Weaker nitrogen prices and lower sales volumes resulted in third-quarter gross margin of $161 million, 31 percent below 2014's comparable period. These factors also caused our nine-month total of $564 million to trail last year's record level. Our US operations accounted for 60 percent of our nitrogen gross margin for the quarter, with Trinidad providing the remainder. Weaker demand, mechanical issues and a planned turnaround at our recently expanded Lima facility kept third-quarter and nine-month sales volumes (1.4 million and 4.4 million tonnes, respectively) below the comparable periods in 2014. Our average realized price of $319 per tonne during the quarter declined from $356 per tonne in the same period last year as lower energy prices and increased global supply weighed on benchmark prices and realizations for all our products. Cost of goods sold for the third quarter was $210 per tonne, relatively flat compared to the same period of 2014. The negative impact of reduced sales volumes was partly offset by lower natural gas costs in the US and Trinidad. Phosphate Third-quarter phosphate gross margin totaled $50 million, trailing the $61 million earned during the same period last year as higher sales volumes and prices were more than offset by increased costs. For the first nine months, gross margin totaled $180 million, exceeding the $135 million generated in the same period of 2014, which included accelerated depreciation charges related to the closure of our Suwannee River chemical plant. Sales volumes of 0.8 million tonnes for the quarter were slightly above the same period in 2014, while the 2.1 million tonnes sold in the first nine months of 2015 was 11 percent lower than the previous year's total due primarily to the absence of production from Suwannee River. Our average realized phosphate price for the third quarter was $538 per tonne, up from the $517 per tonne realized in the same period last year, primarily reflecting higher netbacks for liquid fertilizer products. Cost of goods sold of $475 per tonne in the third quarter was 9 percent higher than the same period in 2014. Increased reliability maintenance, a negative adjustment to our asset retirement obligations and other period costs exceeded the notable charges taken in last year's third quarter and more than offset the positive impact of increased sales volumes. Financial Provincial mining and other taxes for the third quarter increased to $79 million from the $52 million recorded in 2014, reflecting the impact of a weaker Canadian dollar and lower deductible costs due to changes in Saskatchewan's potash taxation regulations in early 2015. Lower total earnings and a discrete tax recovery resulted in income tax expense declining to $90 million in the third quarter, down from $156 million during 2014's comparable period which included a discrete tax expense. In August, we closed the acquisition of our 9.5 percent stake in Brazil-based Fertilizantes Heringer S.A. and entered into a long-term potash supply agreement with the company. Market Outlook Despite broad economic uncertainty, we continue to see strong underlying consumption trends across most key potash markets. We maintain our forecast for 2015 global shipments of 58 to 60 million tonnes, although we no longer expect they will reach the high end of this range. In North America, cautious buying patterns in the third quarter are expected to keep total potash shipments for the year below 2014 levels. Although we anticipate healthy fall application demand will support fourth-quarter shipments, we now forecast total 2015 deliveries of 8.5-9.0 million tonnes. In Latin America, while we expect potash shipments will remain at historically strong levels, credit challenges and currency volatility are likely to result in demand below last year's record level. For the full year, we forecast shipments of 10.5-11.0 million tonnes. In China, we anticipate that encouraging consumption trends for compound fertilizers and bulk blends will support healthy demand through the fourth quarter. We have slightly lowered our total potash shipment range for 2015 to 14.0-14.5 million tonnes to reflect modestly lower deliveries due to the recently implemented value-added tax on fertilizer sales. In India, we remain encouraged by rising consumption trends for compound fertilizers, even in the absence of subsidy reform. Despite this trend, we have lowered our full-year potash shipment estimate to 4.2-4.5 million tonnes due to currency volatility and a weaker-than-normal monsoon. In Other Asian markets (outside of China and India), we have slightly lowered our estimate for potash shipments to 8.3-8.7 million tonnes to reflect lower demand caused by weaker local currencies and adverse weather conditions affecting application requirements in certain regions. Financial Outlook In light of these market factors, we have revised full-year expectations for our potash business. We have lowered our sales volume guidance to a range of 9.0-9.2 million tonnes and now expect potash gross margin of $1.4-$1.5 billion, reflecting weaker volumes and pricing. Consistent with our long-held strategy of matching supply to demand, we are accelerating the permanent closure date of our Penobsquis mine in New Brunswick to the end of November (annual operational capability of approximately 800,000 tonnes). While this will reduce available production levels until our new Picadilly mine is fully ramped up, it is expected to improve our cost profile and help manage inventories. We are also preparing to take three-week inventory shutdowns at our Allan, Cory and Lanigan operations in Saskatchewan, beginning in mid-December. The combination of these shutdowns and the closure of Penobsquis is expected to reduce fourth-quarter production by nearly 500,000 tonnes and lead to slightly higher per-tonne cost of goods sold. We expect there will be no impact on our employment levels at these locations. We have lowered the top end of our previous combined nitrogen and phosphate gross margin guidance range and now estimate we will generate between $1.0-$1.1 billion. In nitrogen, we expect total gross margin below last year's record as increased global supply is expected to keep prices for most products below 2014 levels. Additionally, weaker North American demand, reduced production due to mechanical challenges and an expansion-related turnaround at Lima are expected to keep sales volumes below last year's levels. In phosphate, supportive market fundamentals and our higher-netback product mix are expected to support gross margin above 2014 levels. We have increased our estimate for provincial mining and other taxes to a range of 21-23 percent of potash gross margin due to a weaker Canadian dollar and lower deductible costs. We have lowered our range for income from offshore equity investments to $165-$175 million due to a weaker-than-expected potash earnings environment and we have also slightly increased our estimate for selling and administrative expenses to a range of $245-$250 million. Due to the continued strength of the US dollar, we have revised our full-year foreign exchange rate assumption to CDN$1.26 per US dollar. As a result of the noted changes, we have revised our full-year 2015 earnings guidance to $1.55-$1.65 per share. Other annual guidance numbers - including those noted above - are outlined in the table below. 2015 Guidance  Silver Wheaton Corp.

ANOTHER RECORD QUARTER OF SILVER EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION AND SALES VOLUME FOR SILVER WHEATON IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2015 11/03/2015 VANCOUVER, Nov. 3, 2015 /CNW/ - Silver Wheaton Corp. (\"Silver Wheaton\" or the \"Company\") (TSX: SLW) (NYSE:SLW) is pleased to announce its unaudited results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2015. All figures are presented in United States dollars unless otherwise noted. Silver Wheaton achieved record production for a third quarter in a row and record sales volume for a second quarter in a row, driven by record production at Salobo and Penasquito and record sales volume at San Dimas. In addition, the ramp-up of production at Salobo and Constancia continue to progress as expected. THIRD QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS Record attributable silver equivalent production in Q3 2015 of 11.0 million ounces (6.9 million ounces of silver and 54,500 ounces of gold), compared with 8.9 million ounces in Q3 2014, representing an increase of 24%. Record silver equivalent sales volume in Q3 2015 of 10.2 million ounces (6.6 million ounces of silver and 48,100 ounces of gold), compared with 8.7 million ounces in Q3 2014, representing an increase of 17%. During the three month period ending September 30, 2015, payable silver equivalent ounces attributable to the Company produced but not yet delivered decreased by 0.1 million ounces to approximately 6.3 million ounces. Revenues of $153.3 million in Q3 2015 compared with $165.9 million in Q3 2014, representing a decrease of 8%. Average realized sale price per silver equivalent ounce sold in Q3 2015 of $15.03 ($15.05 per ounce of silver and $1,130 per ounce of gold), compared with $18.98 in Q3 2014, representing a decrease of 21%. Adjusted net earnings1 of $49.8 million ($0.12 per share) in Q3 2015 compared with $72.6 million ($0.20 per share) in Q3 2014, representing a decrease of 31%. During the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $154.0 million related to its 777 silver and gold interest. After including the after tax impact of the impairment charge, net loss of $95.9 million ($0.24 per share) in Q3 2015 compared with net earnings of $4.5 million ($0.01 per share) in Q3 2014.1 Operating cash flows of $99.5 million ($0.25 per share1) in Q3 2015 compared with $120.4 million ($0.34 per share1) in Q3 2014, representing a decrease of 17%. Cash operating margin1 in Q3 2015 of $10.45 per silver equivalent ounce compared with $14.39 in Q3 2014, representing a decrease of 27%. Average cash costs1 in Q3 2015 were $4.26 and $389 per ounce of silver and gold, respectively. On a silver equivalent basis, average cash costs1 decreased to $4.58 compared with $4.59 in Q3 2014. Declared quarterly dividend of $0.05 per common share. On September 18, 2015, the Company announced that it had received TSX approval for a normal course issuer bid (\"NCIB\") of up to 5% of the Company's outstanding Common Shares. To date, the Company has purchased 764,789 shares under the NCIB. On September 24, 2015, the Company announced that it had received Notices of Reassessment from the Canada Revenue Agency (the \"CRA\") for the 2005 to 2010 taxation years (the \"Relevant Taxation Years\"). Subsequent to the quarter, Silver Wheaton filed notices of objection for each of the Relevant Taxation Years. Asset Highlights Salobo had record attributable production of almost 33,000 ounces of gold net to Silver Wheaton in Q3, and the ongoing ramp-up continues to be on track to achieve 100% utilization in Q4 2015. Record attributable production from Penasquito. Record sale volume from San Dimas. Events Subsequent to the Quarter Silver Wheaton agreed to acquire from a subsidiary of Glencore Plc (\"Glencore\") an amount of silver equal to 33.75% of the silver production until delivery of 140 million ounces of silver and 22.5% of the silver production thereafter for the life of mine from the Antamina mine for an upfront cash consideration of US$900 million and ongoing payments of 20% of spot price per silver ounce delivered. \"Silver Wheaton hit record production for a third consecutive quarter, as the company produced 11 million silver equivalent ounces in the third quarter alone. Our cornerstone assets delivered solid results with Penasquito and Salobo setting new production records. With over 32 million ounces produced year to date, we remain well on track to deliver on our original production growth guidance of over 20% in 2015,\" said Randy Smallwood, President and Chief Executive Officer of Silver Wheaton. \"Clearly, not everything has been smooth sailing, as we have also faced persistently low commodity prices, along with the receipt of the Notices of Reassessment from the CRA. I once again want to reiterate our confidence in our structure and that we will vigorously defend our tax filing position; as such, we have filed notices of objections with the CRA in regards to the Reassessments.\" \"While our cornerstone operations have performed exceptionally well, we did take an impairment charge on 777 in the third quarter due to lack of exploration success combined with lower commodity prices. While the low commodity price environment has had its challenges, it has also created some great opportunities. This is clearly evidenced by the announcement of our acquisition of a silver stream on Antamina, one of the lowest cost, largest copper mines in the world. Antamina is an ideal asset for Silver Wheaton, one that readily fits in to our portfolio of top tier assets.\" Financial Review Revenues Revenue was $153.3 million in the third quarter of 2015, on silver equivalent sales of 10.2 million ounces (6.6 million ounces of silver and 48,100 ounces of gold). This represents an 8% decrease from the $165.9 million of revenue generated in the third quarter of 2014 due primarily to a 21% decrease in the average realized silver equivalent price ($15.03 in Q3 2015 compared with $18.98 in Q3 2014), partially offset by a 17% increase in the number of silver equivalent ounces sold. Costs and Expenses Average cash costs1 in the third quarter of 2015 were $4.58 per silver equivalent ounce as compared with $4.59 during the comparable period of 2014. This resulted in a cash operating margin1 of $10.45 per silver equivalent ounce, a reduction of 27% as compared with Q3 2014. The decrease in the cash operating margin was primarily due to a 21% decrease in the average realized silver equivalent price in Q3 2015 compared with Q3 2014. Earnings and Operating Cash Flows Adjusted net earnings1 and cash flow from operations in the third quarter of 2015 were $49.8 million ($0.12 per share) and $99.5 million ($0.25 per share1), compared with $72.6 million ($0.20 per share) and $120.4 million ($0.34 per share1) for the same period in 2014, a decrease of 31% and 17%, respectively. Earnings and cash flow continued to be impacted by lower gold and silver prices. Balance Sheet At September 30, 2015, the Company had approximately $81 million of cash on hand and $647 million outstanding under the Company's $2 billionrevolving term loan. On September 18, 2015 the Company announced it had received TSX approval to purchase up to 20,229,671 common shares (representing 5% of the Company's 404,593,425 total issued and outstanding common shares as of September 11, 2015) over a period of twelve months commencing onSeptember 23, 2015. The NCIB will expire no later than September 22, 2016. During the three months ended September 30, 2015 the Company purchased 119,400 shares under the NCIB at an average price of $12.26 per share. Subsequent to September 30, 2015, the Company purchased an additional 645,389 shares under the NCIB at an average price of $11.86 per share. Asset Impairment On August 8, 2012, the Company entered into an agreement with Hudbay Minerals Inc. (\"Hudbay\") to acquire an amount equal to 100% of the silver and gold production from its currently producing 777 mine, located in Canada, until the end of 2016, and 100% of the silver and 50% of the gold production for the remainder of the mine life. During the third quarter of 2015, the Company's management was informed that as a result of an unsuccessful drilling program at 777, Hudbay's management believes that the mine life for 777 is unlikely to be extended beyond 2020. As a result, during the third quarter of 2015, the estimate of future production from 777 was reduced, with this reduction representing an indicator of impairment related to the 777 silver and gold interests. At September 30, 2015, Silver Wheaton's management estimated that the recoverable amount under the 777 silver and gold interests was$147.5 million, representing its fair value less cost to sell and resulting in an impairment charge of $154.0 million. CRA Audit Update On July 6, 2015, the Company announced that it had received a proposal letter (the \"Proposal\") from the CRA in which the CRA was proposing to reassess Silver Wheaton under the transfer pricing provisions contained in the Income Tax Act (Canada) (the \"Act\"). Subsequent to the issuance of the Proposal, on September 24, 2015, the Company announced that it had received Notices of Reassessment (the \"Reassessments\") from the CRA for the 2005 to 2010 taxation years (the \"Relevant Taxation Years\"). The Reassessments are consistent with the Proposal and seek to increase the Company's income subject to tax in Canada for the Relevant Taxation Years by approximately Cdn$715.3 million which would result in federal and provincial tax of approximately Cdn$201.3 million. In addition, the CRA is seeking to impose transfer pricing penalties of approximately Cdn$71.5 million and interest and other penalties of Cdn$80.6 million for the Relevant Taxation Years. Total tax, interest and penalties sought by the CRA for the Relevant Taxation Years isCdn$353.4 million. The CRA's position in the Reassessments is that the transfer pricing provisions of the Act relating to income earned by the Company's foreign subsidiaries outside of Canada should apply such that the income of Silver Wheaton subject to tax in Canada should be increased by substantially all of the income of the Company's foreign subsidiaries. Management believes that the Company has filed its tax returns and paid applicable taxes in compliance with Canadian tax law, and as a result no amounts have been recorded for any potential liability arising from this matter. Silver Wheaton intends to vigorously defend its tax filing positions. As such, subsequent to September 30, 2015, Silver Wheaton has filed notices of objection for each of the Relevant Taxation Years. The Company will be required to make a deposit of Cdn$176.7 million representing 50% of the reassessed amounts of tax, interest and penalties. Silver Wheaton will seek to post security in the form of a letter of credit for this amount as opposed to a cash deposit. Cash that has been deposited in respect of a reassessment will be refunded, plus interest, if the Company is ultimately successful in challenging that reassessment. Events Subsequent to the Quarter Antamina Subsequent to the quarter, Silver Wheaton, through its wholly owned subsidiary Silver Wheaton (Caymans) Ltd. (\"SWC\"), has agreed to acquire fromAnani Investments Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Glencore plc (\"Glencore\") an amount of silver equal to 33.75% of the silver production until delivery of 140 million ounces of silver and 22.5% of silver production thereafter for the life of mine silver production from the Antamina mine, located in Peru. SWC will pay Glencore cash consideration of US$900 million for the silver stream. In addition, SWC will make ongoing payments of 20% of spot price per silver ounce delivered. The silver stream is effective September 30, 2015, and as a result, production and sales attributable to Silver Wheaton are forecast for the fourth quarter of 2015. Silver production is expected to average 4.7 million ounces per year over the first 20 years. Closing of the transaction is expected to occur prior to the end of November 2015 and is subject to the completion of certain corporate matters and customary conditions. (See Silver Wheaton's November 3, 2015 news release for full details.) Third Quarter Asset Highlights During the third quarter of 2015, attributable silver equivalent production was 11.0 million ounces (6.9 million ounces of silver and 54,500 ounces of gold), representing an increase of 24% compared with the third quarter of 2014. Operational highlights for the quarter ended September 30, 2015, are as follows: Salobo In the third quarter of 2015, Salobo produced a record 32,954 ounces of gold attributable to Silver Wheaton, an increase of approximately 216% relative to the third quarter of 2014. This increase was primarily due to the doubling of the percentage of gold that Silver Wheaton is entitled to and the increased throughput as a result of the expansion to 24 million tonnes per annum, which commenced production in mid-2014. According to Vale's third quarter of 2015 production report, the ramp-up of Salobo was weaker than expected in July and August but recovered in September with capacity utilization exceeding 90%. Salobo is expected to achieve 100% capacity utilization in the fourth quarter. Constancia In the third quarter of 2015, Constancia produced approximately 4,341 ounces of gold and 0.7 million ounces of silver attributable to Silver Wheaton as the mine declared commercial production on April 30, 2015, and it continues to ramp-up as expected. Penasquito In the third quarter of 2015, Penasquito produced a record 2.1 million ounces of silver attributable to Silver Wheaton, an increase of approximately 28% relative to the third quarter of 2014 due to higher grades being mined as substantial mining took place in the heart of the deposit. As disclosed inGoldcorp Inc.'s (\"Goldcorp\") third quarter of 2015 MD&A, construction of the Northern Well Field project remained suspended throughout the third quarter of 2015 due to an illegal blockade by a local community. Penasquito continues to seek a fair resolution of this matter with the community, while taking steps to enforce its contractual rights. Penasquito is also advancing alternatives for completion of the project without crossing through the affected community lands. Goldcorp believes that there will be timely resolution of this matter to meet the future water needs of Penasquito. The Metallurgical Enhancement Project feasibility study remains on schedule to be completed in early 2016. San Dimas In the third quarter of 2015, attributable production from San Dimas was 1.4 million ounces of silver, an increase of approximately 22% relative to the third quarter of 2014.2 This growth was primarily due to increased production as a result of the expansion to 2,500 tonnes per day (tpd), which was completed early in 2014, as well as to the sharing threshold increasing to 6 million ounces3, partially offset by the cessation of Goldcorp's four-year obligation to deliver 1.5 million ounces of silver to the Company on August 6, 2014. Silver sales in the third quarter of 2015 from San Dimas were a record 2.0 million ounces, an increase of 72% relative to the third quarter of 20142, as silver inventories built up in the second quarter of 2014 were subsequently sold. As at September 30, 2015, approximately 0.2 million ounces of cumulative payable silver ounces have been produced at San Dimas but not yet delivered to the Company, representing a decrease of 0.6 million payable silver ounces during the third quarter of 2015. As reported by Primero on July 6, 2015, silver deliveries in the second quarter had been delayed due to the suspension of Primero's import and export licenses in May 2015 by the Mexican customs authorities due to a discrepancy over Primero's address related to its corporate office relocation from Mexico City to Durango, Mexico. As per Primero's August 6, 2015, news release, the import and export license was reinstated and normal course imports and exports resumed, including the sales of all inventoried silver. Finally, as per Primero's third quarter of 2015 MD&A, during the third quarter, Primero achieved key milestones at both the San Dimas mine and the mill, tracking towards the completion of its expansion from 2,500 tpd to 3,000 tpd by the accelerated April 2016 completion date. Primero successfully connected the tunnel between the Sinaloa-Graben and Central mining blocks, providing a critical de-bottlenecking in the flow of machinery through theSan Dimas mine. At the San Dimas mill, Primero has completed the construction of foundations for the new secondary crusher and demolition of the old foundry is well advanced. The installation of the additional tailings pump is now complete and control has been handed over to the operations team. The new tailings filter and thickener are also in the process of fabrication and remain on-schedule for delivery to site in Q1 2016. Sudbury In the third quarter of 2015, attributable gold production from Vale's Sudbury mine was 5,967 ounces, a decrease of approximately 51% relative to the third quarter of 2014. According to Vale's third quarter of 2015 production report, the decrease was primarily due to planned maintenance shutdowns in the Sudbury surface plants in August 2015. As per Vale, key work completed as part of the shutdown encompassed the rebuild of the SAG mill, the overhaul of the acid plant in preparation for the implementation of the AER project (atmospheric emissions reduction project), and the upgrade of the environmental equipment at the Copper Cliff Nickel Refinery. It should also be noted that production in Q3 2014 was at an elevated level, as Vale processed large inventories of feed stock that had built up in Q2 2014 due to planned maintenance of surface facilities. Yauliyacu In the third quarter of 2015, attributable silver production from Yauliyacu was 0.7 million ounces, a decrease of approximately 20% relative to the third quarter of 2014, primarily due to lower grade being mined in the quarter. Barrick In the third quarter of 2015, attributable silver production from Barrick was 0.5 million ounces, an increase of approximately 27% relative to the third quarter of 2014, primarily due to higher grades at the Veladero mine and higher recoveries at the Lagunas Norte mine. 777 In the third quarter of 2015, 777 produced approximately 6,330 ounces of gold and 0.1 million ounces of silver attributable to Silver Wheaton, a decrease of approximately 48% and 37%, respectively, relative to the third quarter of 2014 primarily due to lower throughput and grades. Other Minto: In the third quarter of 2015, attributable gold production from Minto was 4,920 ounces, a decrease of approximately 29% relative to the third quarter of 2014, primarily due to lower grade being mined in the quarter. According to Capstone Mining Corp.'s (\"Capstone\") third quarter production results, the Minto mill processed solely underground and stockpiled ore while transitioning to the next open pit mining area. In addition, Capstone reported that the Yukon Water Board issued the final Water Use Licence on August 5, 2015, and that stripping of the Minto North open pit commenced immediately. Stripping of Minto North is reportedly on schedule for first ore to the mill starting in December 2015, with high grade ore commencing in the second quarter of 2016. Stratoni: In the third quarter of 2015, attributable silver production from Stratoni was 0.1 million ounces, a decrease of approximately 52% relative to the third quarter of 2014, primarily due to lower throughput as a result of fewer production stopes available in the mine as well as a five week suspension of operations in the quarter. As per Eldorado Gold Corporation's (\"Eldorado\") news release dated August 20, 2015, operations at the Stratoni mine were temporarily suspended as a direct result of the revocation by Greece's Ministry of Energy of the technical studies of Eldorado's projects in Halkidiki,Greece. As per Eldorado's news release dated October 5, 2015, mining operations have resumed at Halkidiki. Subsequent to the quarter, the Stratoni silver purchase agreement dated April 23, 2007, was amended in order to incentivize additional exploration and potentially extend the limited remaining mine life of Stratoni. The primary modification is to increase the production price per ounce of silver delivered to SWC over the current fixed price by one of the following amounts: i) US$2.50 if 10,000 meters of drilling is completed outside of the existing ore body and within SWC's defined area of interest (\"Expansion Drilling\"), ii) US$5.00 if 20,000 meters of Expansion Drilling is completed, and iii) US$7.00 if 30,000 meters of Expansion Drilling is completed. Drilling in all three cases must be completed by December 31, 2020, in order for the agreed upon increase in production price to be initiated.4 Produced But Not Yet Delivered 5 As at September 30, 2015, payable silver equivalent ounces produced but not yet delivered to Silver Wheaton by its partners decreased by 0.1 million ounces to approximately 6.3 million silver equivalent payable ounces, as increases at Salobo and Constancia were more than offset by decreases at San Dimas, 777 and Penasquito. Payable ounces produced but not yet delivered to Silver Wheaton are expected to average approximately two to three months of annualized production but may vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of mining operation factors including mine ramp-up, delays in shipments, and so forth. Detailed mine by mine production and sales figures can be found in the Appendix to this press release and in Silver Wheaton's MD&A in the 'Results of Operations and Operational Review' section. Sherritt International Corporation (S: TSX) Sherritt is a world leader in the mining and refining of nickel from lateritic ores with projects and operations in Canada, Cuba and Madagascar. The Corporation is the largest independent energy producer in Cuba, with extensive oil and power operations on the island. Sherritt licenses its proprietary technologies and provides metallurgical services to commercial metals operations worldwide. The Corporation's common shares are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol \"S\". Sherritt is committed to the highest standards of environment, health and safety practices at all of its operations, while making valuable contributions to local communities. Sherritt Announces Q3 2015 Results Nickel Net Direct Cash Costs Decline for the Third Consecutive Quarter TORONTO, ON--(Marketwired - October 27, 2015) - NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION TO UNITED STATES NEWSWIRE SERVICES OR FOR DISSEMINATION IN THE UNITED STATES Sherritt International Corporation (\"Sherritt\" or the \"Corporation\") (TSX: S), a world leader in the mining and refining of nickel from lateritic ores, today reported its financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. \"Operational performance, cost discipline and collecting overdue receivables all played a role this quarter in minimizing our use of cash,\" said David Pathe, President and CEO, Sherritt. \"We continue to operate in a severely depressed commodity pricing environment, with nickel and oil prices declining further during the quarter. In response to this reality, we have executed on further cost-cutting measures, including cutting our dividend and reducing expected capital spending for this year and next. In this environment, achieving financial completion at Ambatovy was a pivotal achievement, making the Ambatovy project debt non-recourse to us and our partners.\" \"We are working hard to position ourselves for long-term success when the commodity cycle turns favourable,\" continued Pathe. \"Operationally, we had record nickel production at Ambatovy, where we saw cash costs drop more than 20% from Q2, down to US$4.24 per pound. At Moa, our cash costs are bordering on first quartile, and I am confident we will get there with the addition of the third acid plant. In total, our two integrated operations now produce around 83,000 tonnes a year of Class 1 nickel.\" Q3 HIGHLIGHTS Nickel prices during the quarter hit a low closing price of US$4.22 per pound on August 24, 2015, a level not seen since 2008, and averaged US$4.78 in the quarter. Crude oil prices also declined since Q2 2015, with WTI crude prices closing at a low of US$38.24 per barrel on the same day and averaging US$46.56 in the quarter. Since quarter end, nickel prices have rebounded modestly from their lows to US$4.75 per pound and WTI is trading at US$44.46 per barrel (both prices at Oct. 26, 2015). Preserving cash was the Corporation's highest priority in the quarter, and cost discipline across all operations mitigated cash funding requirements outside Ambatovy. Total available liquidity at September 30, 2015 was $454.5 million, benefiting from a $40 million increase in available credit, after renewing and increasing the size of the syndicated 364-day revolver to $115 million (from $90 million last quarter) and the line of credit to $35 million (from $20 million last quarter). Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $373.8 million at September 30, 2015. Finished nickel production in the quarter was up 16% year over year at 9,730 tonnes (Sherritt's Share), driven by Ambatovy's strong performance. Net direct cash costs fell for the third consecutive quarter this year, to US$4.07 per pound at the Moa JV and US$4.24 per pound at Ambatovy. This demonstrates the longer term potential for Ambatovy's cash costs to be equal or better than the Moa JV cash costs, as production ramps up to full capacity and maintenance costs continue to decline. Ambatovy Financial Completion was announced by press release September 21, 2015. Ten certificates were filed to meet the criteria, covering a range of construction, operational, environmental, financial and legal obligations. With financial completion achieved, the project financing that was put in place for construction is now non-recourse to all of the partners. Reducing combined administrative expenses has been a priority this year, with year to date combined administrative expenses down 25% over the nine month period last year. This quarter's combined administrative expenses of $18.6 million are down 10% from last year, although higher than their levels in Q2, due to $4.5 million in Ambatovy arbitration award legal costs discussed in Note 6 to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Financial Statements), and related to the close-out of construction contracts that were in dispute. No other income statement impact was recorded from these awards. All amounts are Canadian dollars unless otherwise indicated. For additional information see the Non-GAAP measures section of this press release. Compared to the same period in the prior year. Shown on Sherritt's attributable share ownership basis. OUTLOOK AND SIGNIFICANT ITEMS During the quarter, the Corporation recorded an impairment expense of $80.6 million ($0.27 per share) on its oil assets in Cuba and Spain. This impairment arises mainly from lower oil price forecasts impacting future cash flows, with lower production from the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) Extension wells being a contributing factor. Oil production guidance was reduced to 18,500 barrels of oil per day (bopd) on a Gross Working Interest (GWI) basis, and 11,300 bopd on a Net Working Interest basis (NWI) for the year ending December 31, 2015 from the previously forecast level of 19,000 bopd reflecting the results this year from the PSC Extension drilling. Drilling activity on the PSC Extension has ended, and capital expenditures have been reduced with new guidance of $71 million expected for the full year. During the quarter, SNC-Lavalin exercised their put option to divest their 5% equity interest in the Ambatovy JV, selling their equity stake and share of partner loans to existing partner Sumitomo Corporation for approximately $600 million. Sherritt had the right to acquire this equity stake along with Sumitomo, but declined. As a result, the Ambatovy call option expired, resulting in a $13.7 million loss (non-cash) within the net finance expense this quarter. Sumitomo now owns 32.5% of Ambatovy, with Sherritt at 40% and Korea Resources at 27.5%. Sherritt also announces that Dean Chambers has agreed to continue in his current role as Executive Vice President and CFO, and will adjust his planned retirement timing. Given Mr. Chambers' long executive tenure and critical role with the Ambatovy partner and lender groups, Dean is particularly well suited to his current role at this time. David Bacon has confirmed his intention to return to his former employer in an expanded role.  During the third quarter, $118.6 million ($0.40 per share) in adjusting items occurred that mainly included the Oil & Gas impairment described earlier, a $13.7 million adjustment for the expiry of the call option associated with the SNC-Lavalin put exercise, and an unrealized $10.2 million foreign exchange loss. Other less material adjustments of $7.5 million in aggregate represent Ambatovy inventory impairment and legal costs on unfavourable Ambatovy arbitration awards relating to construction contracts that have now been closed out, and are described in Note 6 to the Financial Statements. Subsequent to the quarter end, a third arbitration award was received, which was in Sherritt's favour and will have a positive cash flow impact if and when collected. REVIEW OF OPERATIONS METALS Includes results for certain 100% owned assets at Fort Saskatchewan plant. Includes results for Sherritt's marketing organization for certain Ambatovy sales. Represents the post-commercial production period except for production volumes and nickel recovery. For additional information, see the Non-GAAP measures section of this release. METAL MARKETS Nickel spot prices hit a multi-year low of US$4.22 per pound on August 24, 2015, a day of commodity and broader equity market panic after Chinese stock market indices fell by 9%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average opened down 1,000 points. Since that time, nickel prices have rebounded to some degree, trading in a range of US$4.50 - $4.75 per pound in recent weeks. Average realized prices of nickel at the Moa Joint Venture and the Ambatovy Joint Venture were $6.31 and $6.02 per pound, respectively, following the reference price decline, but benefitting from foreign exchange translation as the Canadian dollar weakened by approximately eight cents from the second quarter to the third quarter this year. The average cobalt reference price of US$13.32 per pound in the third quarter was also down from its year ago comparable of US$14.74, and close to the Q2 2015 average reference price of US$13.61 per pound. Average realized prices of cobalt this quarter were up marginally from their year ago levels, as the decline in the reference price was offset by the weaker Canadian dollar. The cobalt market remains fairly well balanced with continued strong demand in the aerospace and rechargeable battery sectors and lower than forecast production in Zambia. Moa Joint Venture (50% interest) and Fort Site Adjusted EBITDA of $2.2 million continued to follow commodity price declines, despite a third consecutive quarter of improved Net Direct Cash Costs. Finished nickel production of 4,521 tonnes (50% basis) for the third quarter of 2015 was marginally lower than the prior year quarter, but up 17% from production in Q2 of 3,877 tonnes (50% basis) when the annual refinery shutdown occurred. Finished cobalt production of 491 tonnes (50% basis) for the third quarter of 2015 was higher than the prior year quarter, and higher than Q2 2015 cobalt production of 429 tonnes (50% basis), again reflecting the shutdown, and a higher cobalt ratio in the mined ore year to date. The nickel recovery at Moa of 89% in the quarter was up from the 86% recovery in Q3 of last year, and consistent with Q2 2015 nickel recovery levels. The net direct cash cost of US$4.07 per pound of nickel was an improvement of 22% (US$1.18 per pound) from the third quarter of 2014, and the lowest reported year to date. Lower fuel oil and energy prices and lower third party feed costs have been significant drivers to improved cash costs, and the effort to focus on controllable costs has paid off. Cobalt by-product credits of US$1.39 per pound are fairly consistent each quarter, ranging from US$1.25 to US$1.40 over the last six quarters. Fertilizer revenues this quarter of $11.8 million were lower than costs of $12.7 million. Costs were impacted by higher maintenance expenses (shutdown-related) that were carried through inventory and impacted third quarter fertilizer costs due to the timing of sales. This quarter included deferred revenue of $20.5 million of cash received on pre-sales of fertilizer to be delivered primarily in Q4 and the spring season of 2016, at which time their revenue will be recognized. Capital spending of $19.6 million in the quarter and $43.6 million year to date is higher than its comparison periods, due to the once in 10 year maintenance shutdown at Fort Saskatchewan last quarter, and a weaker Canadian dollar, with expansion capital as budgeted for the construction of the 2,000 tonne per day acid plant on track for the second half of 2016. Ambatovy Joint Venture (40% interest) Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter was negative $2.5 million during the quarter compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $4.3 million in the same quarter last year. For the nine month period ended September 30, 2015, Adjusted EBITDA of $0.1 million compares with $2 million in the same period last year. During the quarter, finished nickel production was 5,209 tonnes (40% basis), a record production quarter and an improvement of 39 % over last year. Finished cobalt production of 392 tonnes (40% basis) was also up 20% year over year and up 48% from production levels in the second quarter. As announced October 6, 2015, Sherritt received confirmation that finished nickel briquettes from Ambatovy now meet the standards to qualify for delivery to London Metal Exchange (LME) warehouses. This recognition demonstrates the technical and metallurgical capabilities that Sherritt has contributed as operator during Ambatovy's ramp-up. LME delivery status allows Ambatovy or its customers the flexibility and commercial advantage of delivering nickel product to LME warehouses where logistics benefits exist or to mitigate short term variance in customer demand. Robust third quarter production of both nickel and cobalt is attributable to process control enhancements and improved operational stability, continuing the ramp-up of production to nameplate capacity. During the quarter, the second ore thickener returned to production. A planned autoclave train turnaround was executed in September, with further turnarounds scheduled in October and November. The Q3 nickel recovery was 88% compared to 86% in Q2, primarily due to efficiency improvements in the mixed sulphide precipitation circuit. The net direct cash cost (NDCC) of nickel was US$4.24 per pound in the third quarter of 2015, and has been coming down sharply each quarter this year, from US$5.74 per pound in Q1 and US$5.48 per pound in Q2. Net direct cash costs at Ambatovy are now in line with the Moa JV, reflecting increased production, lower maintenance and labour costs, and lower commodity input costs. In September this year, Ambatovy achieved financial completion (see \"Highlights\", page 1). Under the terms of the Ambatovy Joint Venture Financing, a supermajority group of the lenders may, within 45 days of achieving financial completion, initiate a challenge to reinstate the completion guarantees. In order for any challenge to succeed, the lenders would need to prove that one or more of the completion certificates is false in a materially adverse way to the lenders' interest. During a challenge, if one occurs, Sherritt's proportionate share of the outstanding project debt would remain non-recourse to Sherritt until a final ruling or settlement occurs. Filing of the Financial Certificate required the deposit of US$115 million (100% basis) to fund the Senior Debt Reserve Account (SDRA), from which payments of semi-annual principal and interest can be made on the Ambatovy Joint Venture Financing. In the third quarter, the Ambatovy partners provided US$174 million in funding. From this funding and the opening cash balance, the SDRA was funded, and US$65 million was paid out to settle arbitration rulings as described in Note 6 to the Financial Statements. On a year to date basis, Ambatovy partners have funded US$264 million, with Sherritt's share being 40% or US$105.6 million. With submission of the final certificates, the US$1.7 billion Ambatovy Joint Venture Financing (100% basis, balance at September 30, 2015) has become non-recourse to the Ambatovy partners, and the interest rate has increased from LIBOR plus 1.4% to LIBOR plus approximately 2.5%. Going into the fourth quarter this year, the Ambatovy cash and cash equivalents position (100% basis) is at $200.5 million as reported in Note 6 to the Financial Statements. OIL AND GAS Adjusted EBITDA was 56% ($26.9 million) lower in the third quarter compared to the prior year period, with realized oil and gas prices down 47% over the same period. In the Cuban operations, the average-realized price in the third quarter was $36.36 per barrel, as oil prices reached multi-year lows in August this year. GWI oil production in Cuba of 17,693 bopd decreased by 9% in the third quarter compared to the prior year period, primarily due to natural reservoir declines and lower than expected production from the PSC Extension wells. Counting three wells drilled in 2014 and five drilled this year, a total of eight new wells have now been drilled and completed, which is one more than required to fulfill commitments under the PSC Extension for the Puerto Escondido/Yumuri oil fields. Of the eight, six are currently producing oil, one is suspended and one has been abandoned. Oil production from these new PSC Extension wells is below expectations, with production guidance revised accordingly. NWI oil production in Cuba of 10,354 bopd increased by 3% over the same quarter in 2014 despite the 9% decrease in Cuban GWI oil production. Cost recovery oil production of 4,349 bopd compared to 2,428 bopd in the same period last year illustrates the higher proportion of cost recovery oil when oil prices are low. The allocation of cost recovery barrels in any particular period is limited to a fixed percentage of GWI volumes within each cost pool. In the first quarter this year, when oil prices were similar to prices in the third quarter, the caps on the applicable cost pools prevented a higher cost recovery allocation. Expenditures above the caps were then carried forward, and were applied for cost recoveries in the second and third quarter. Eligible costs are being carried forward for application in future quarters. Unit operating costs in Cuba decreased 9% ($0.94 per barrel) to $9.04 (GWI basis) in the third quarter compared to the prior year period, reflecting lower well workover costs. The robust free cash flow generation of $35.7 million in the quarter benefited from the collection of overdue receivables, and a quarter of comparatively low capital spending, at $11.7 million. Overdue receivables continue to be paid in accordance with the schedule agreed with the Cuban partners, with overdue receivables expected to fall to normal levels by year end. On a year to date basis, capital spending of $55.2 million is up 22% year over year, consistent with the higher capital expenditures required to drill the PSC Extension. Further evaluation of the wells drilled under the PSC Extension will be carried out this quarter, but drilling results to date and continuing capital and cost discipline have prompted further capital reductions, leading to a revised estimate of $71 million ($68 million sustaining and $3 million exploration) for 2015 compared to the previous guidance of $81 million. As referenced in the Q3 2015 MD&A and Note 17 to the Financial Statements, an impairment expense of $80.6 million ($0.27 per share) was recorded on Cuban and Spain oil assets in the quarter. The lower oil price forecast, combined with drilling results on the PSC extension that were below expectations, are the reasons for the impairment. POWER Quarterly Adjusted EBITDA increased by 20% ($1.6 million) year over year with higher production and higher realized prices. Higher gas availability led to higher production, while the average realized price benefitted from the weaker Canadian dollar. The average-realized price of electricity was 20% higher ($9.07 per MWh) in the third quarter compared to the prior year period. Operating costs increased by 30% ($4.03 per MWh) in the third quarter compared to the prior year period, due to an increase in equipment purchases and processing equipment repairs, as well as the weaker Canadian dollar. Free cash flow generation of $14.7 million in the quarter included a $4.0 million payment of interest on the Energas conditional sales agreement ($35.1 million year to date). Principal on the Energas conditional sales agreement also continues to be repaid on schedule, with a further $10.4 million received in the quarter ($25.8 million year to date). STRATEGIC PRIORITIES 2015 Sherritt continues to execute against its stated strategy to focus on its core competencies, improve its liquidity position and streamline its operations, consisting of the following near-term priorities:  OUTLOOK In the current quarter, the changes to expected production and capital spending come from Oil & Gas, where expected production on both a GWI and NWI basis have been reduced to reflect the drilling results on the PSC Extension wells at Puerto Escondido/Yumuri. Drilling activity has ended, and capital spending has also been reduced accordingly. NON-GAAP MEASURES The Corporation uses combined results, Adjusted EBITDA, average-realized price, unit operating cost, and adjusted operating cash flow to monitor the performance of the Corporation and its operating divisions and believes these measures enable investors and analysts to compare the Corporation's financial performance with its competitors and evaluate the results of its underlying business. These measures do not have a standard definition under IFRS and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. As these measures do not have a standardized meaning, they may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other companies. See Sherritt's Management's Discussion and Analysis for the period ended September 30, 2015 for further information. Teck Resourses Limited (TSE: TCK) Teck is Canada's largest diversified resource company, committed to responsible mining and mineral development.

Our nearly 11,000 employees worldwide have expertise across a wide range of activities related to mining and minerals processing includingexploration, development, smelting, refining, safety, environmental protection, product stewardship, recycling and research. Headquartered in Vancouver, Canada, we own, or have an interest in, 12 mines in Canada, the United States, Chile and Peru. We also operate a large metallurgical complex, are partners in a wind power facility, and are a significant producer of specialty metals such as germanium and indium. We are actively exploring for copper, zinc and gold in the Americas, Asia Pacific, Europe and Africa. TECK REPORTS UNAUDITED THIRD QUARTER RESULTS FOR 2015 October 22, 2015 - Vancouver, BC - Teck Resources Limited (TSX: TCK.A and TCK.B, NYSE: TCK) (\"Teck\") reported adjusted profit attributable to shareholders of $29 million, or $0.05 per share, in the third quarter of 2015. Teck also reported non-cash after-tax impairment charges of $2.2 billion resulting in a third quarter loss attributable to shareholders of $2.1 billion, or $3.73 per share. The impairment charges are non-cash revaluations of assets to reflect lower market expectations of commodity prices. \"We are taking significant steps to meet the challenge of low commodity prices,\" said Don Lindsay, President and CEO. \"We have reduced costs throughout the company and we've raised nearly $1 billion in two streaming transactions. We used a portion of those proceeds to reduce debt by $400 million and our current cash balance of $1.8 billion exceeds our remaining $1.5 billion share of capital required for Fort Hills.\" Highlights and Significant Items Gross profit before depreciation and amortization was $670 million in the third quarter* compared with $752 million in the third quarter of 2014. Cash flow from operations, before working capital changes, was $302 million in the third* quarter of 2015 compared with $553 million a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA (not including non-cash impairment charges of $2.9 billion) was $389* million in the third quarter. Adjusted EBITDA before final pricing adjustments was $530 million. We recorded impairment charges in the aggregate of $2.2 billion on an after-tax basis ($2.9* billion pre-tax) including $1.5 billion on our steelmaking coal assets, $0.3 billion on copper and $0.4 billion on the Fort Hills oil sands project resulting in a loss attributable to shareholders of $2.1 billion. Our debt to debt-plus-equity ratio was 36% at September 30, and our net debt to net-debtplus-equity* ratio was 32%. Giving effect to the impairments and our recent streaming transaction and debt repayments, our pro forma debt to debt-plus-equity ratio and net debt to net-debt-plus-equity ratios at September 30, 2015 were 35% and 30%, respectively. Subsequent to quarter end, we completed the sale of a silver stream linked to our share of the Antamina mine. Taken together with the gold stream sold from the Carmen de Andacollo Operations which closed during the third quarter, these transactions have increased our cash position by approximately $1 billion. Our cash balance of $1.8 billion as of October 21 is more than our $1.5 billion share of costs required to complete Fort Hills. We also have an additional US$3 billion undrawn credit facility that can be used for general corporate purposes and US$1.2 billion available for cash draws or for letters of credit. We have certain contractual arrangements that may result in us having to issue letters of credit that would utilize substantially all of this US$1.2 billion facility. Our cost reduction program combined with a falling Canadian dollar, lower oil prices, and higher copper grades have contributed to reduce our U.S. dollar unit costs for our products with copper and steelmaking coal unit costs falling by US$0.20 per pound and US$20 per tonne, respectively, compared to last year. In response to steelmaking coal market conditions, our steelmaking coal mines took threeweek shutdowns during the third quarter to reduce production and product inventory. In the fourth quarter we expect that production rates will be aligned with sales volumes. We have reached agreements with the majority of our customers for the fourth quarter of 2015, based on a quarterly benchmark of US$89 per tonne for the highest quality product and we expect total sales in the fourth quarter, including spot sales, to be at least 6 million tonnes of steelmaking coal. The Red Dog concentrate shipping season is expected to be completed on October 22 with shipments of 1,048,000 tonnes of zinc concentrate. We expect sales of 200,000 tonnes in the fourth quarter reflecting the normal seasonal pattern of Red Dog sales. Our Quebrada Blanca operation restarted normal production activities in late August after unexpected ground movement in late June caused a temporary shutdown of processing facilities. We expect to produce 38,000 tonnes of copper cathode in 2015, a reduction of about 10,000 tonnes compared to the original plan. This document contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the cautionary language under the heading \"CAUTIONARY STATEMENT ON FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION\" below. Overview Prices for our products continued to fall in the third quarter. These declines have had a significant effect on our reported earnings this period, as we recorded $141 million of negative pricing adjustments in addition to the direct effect of lower prices on gross profit. Furthermore, we recorded $2.9 billion (pre-tax) ($2.2 billion after-tax) of impairment charges based on market expectations of lower prices over the short, medium and long terms. The details of these charges are noted below. Lower price forecasts also resulted in negative credit rating actions. More details on our credit rating impacts are included in the \"Financial Position and Liquidity\" section below. To meet the challenge of low prices, we have taken significant steps. We reduced costs across all aspects of our organization in an ongoing and highly focused program. We reduced capital expenditures in the current year and are reducing our planned spending in future years. After the end of the quarter, we completed the sale of a silver stream linked to our share of the Antamina mine. Taken together with the gold stream sold from the Carmen de Andacollo Operation which closed during the third quarter, these transactions have increased our cash position by approximately $1 billion. Subsequent to quarter end we reduced our debt, repaying US$300 million on October 1. While we have reduced spending, we continue to advance our growth plans on a selective basis. The construction of the Fort Hills project remains on time and on budget and we continue to advance permitting and design optimization activities for the Quebrada Blanca Phase 2 project with a clear focus on capital expenditure reduction. In the longer term, the merging of our Relincho project with Goldcorp's El Morro project in Project Corridor is expected to result in a less capital intensive project with higher potential returns. We continue to focus on capital discipline and cost reduction. Profit and Adjusted Profit Profit (loss) attributable to shareholders was $(2.1) billion, or $(3.73) per share, in the third quarter compared with $84 million or $0.14 per share in the same period last year. Adjusted profit attributable to shareholders, before items identified in the table below, was $29 million, or $0.05 per share, in the third quarter compared with $159 million or $0.28 per share in the same period last year. During the quarter we recorded asset and goodwill impairment charges on a number of our operating assets, including our investment in the Fort Hills project, the Carmen de Andacollo and the Pend Oreille zinc mines and a number of our steelmaking coal mines. These charges total $2.9 billion on a pre-tax basis and $2.2 billion on an after-tax basis. The write-downs were triggered primarily by lowered expectations for commodity prices in both the short and longterm. The economic models we use in determining the amount of impairment charges use current prices in the initial years and transition to longer term prices in years three to five. Longterm assumptions are as follows; steelmaking coal US$130 per tonne, copper US$3.00 per pound, zinc US$1.00 per pound, WTI US$75 per barrel and $1.25 Canadian to U.S. dollar exchange rate. Adjusted profit of $29 million includes inventory write-downs totaling $61 million resulting from low commodity prices, and final pricing adjustments of $141 million primarily on our copper and zinc receivables. These total $129 million on an after-tax basis and are included in reported adjusted profits. STEELMAKING COAL BUSINESS UNIT Performance Gross profit before depreciation and amortization from our steelmaking coal business unit increased from year ago levels as the benefits of our cost reduction program and lower diesel prices more than offset lower sales volumes and realized steelmaking coal prices. The average realized steelmaking coal price of US$88 per tonne was 20% lower than the third quarter of 2014, reflecting oversupplied steelmaking coal market conditions and a decline in spot price assessments. The favourable effect of a stronger U.S. dollar in the third quarter partly offset the lower price, which weakened by 3% in Canadian dollar terms compared with the same period a year ago. Third quarter production of 5.5 million tonnes was 19% lower than the same period a year ago matching our guidance for the period as all of our sites completed the three week shutdown previously announced. Unit production costs at the mines were 10% lower this quarter than in the comparative period, despite the lower production rates as a result of the ongoing effects of existing and new initiatives undertaken through our cost reduction program, and lower diesel prices. Property, plant and equipment expenditures totaled $21 million in the third quarter, of which $13 million was spent on sustaining capital. Capitalized stripping costs were $84 million in the third quarter compared with $81 million a year ago. We continue to implement the water quality management measures contemplated by our Elk Valley Water Quality Plan. The water treatment facility built at our Line Creek Operations is now in the process of being commissioned and is expected to be operating at design capacity in early 2016. Markets Steelmaking coal prices declined further during the quarter. Although Chinese imports have declined substantially compared to the prior year, demand in the rest of the world continues to be strong for our products. However, given oversupply in the market, we do not expect a substantial recovery in price until additional supply cuts occur or demand increases. Steelmaking coal prices for the fourth quarter of 2015 have been agreed with the majority of our quarterly priced customers based on US$89 per tonne for the highest quality products. This is consistent with prices reportedly achieved by our competitors. Additional sales priced on a spot basis will reflect market conditions when sales are concluded. Operations Each of the mines were shut down for three weeks during the quarter with shipments to customers fulfilled from existing inventories where required. Line Creek recovered quickly and efficiently from the landslide event they experienced in early July and by the end of the quarter had made up the vast majority of the production lost while down for repairs to the critical infrastructure including the site's main access road and raw steelmaking coal conveyance system. In addition, the business unit's processing yields remained higher than budget and site costs were lower than in the comparative period. Our cost reduction initiatives continue to produce significant results and remain focused on improvements in equipment and labour productivity, reduced use of contractors, reduced consumable usage and limiting the use of higher cost equipment. However, a number of factors have partially offset the strong performance of our cost reduction program. These included the effects of the strengthening U.S. dollar on some inputs and higher electricity costs. In the third quarter of 2015, we continued to experience the positive effects of lower diesel prices. Combined with reduced usage from a number of our cost reduction initiatives and slightly shorter haul distances, diesel costs per tonne produced have decreased by 38% compared to the third quarter of 2014. Cost of Sales Site cost of sales in the third quarter of 2015, before depreciation and inventory write-downs, was $45 per tonne, $5 per tonne or 10% lower than a year ago. Our total cost of sales for the quarter also included a $10 per tonne charge for the amortization of capitalized stripping costs and $18 per tonne for other depreciation. In U.S. dollar terms, unit costs have fallen by $20 per tonne from $84 per tonne to $64 per tonne due to reductions in the site costs as shown in the Canadian dollar unit cost table and the change in exchange rates. Outlook Vessel nominations for quarterly contract shipments are determined by customers and final sales and average prices for the quarter will depend on product mix, market direction for spot priced sales, timely arrival of vessels, as well as the performance of the rail transportation network and steelmaking coal-loading facilities. We continue to expect our 2015 steelmaking coal production to be in the range of 25 to 26 million tonnes and now expect unit costs to be in the range of $83 to $86 per tonne (US$64 to US$66 per tonne). In addition, capital expenditures are now expected to total $500 million, including $395 million of capitalized mining. COPPER BUSINESS UNIT Performance Gross profit before depreciation and amortization from our copper business unit decreased by $91 million in the third quarter compared with a year ago (see table below). This was primarily due to lower realized copper prices and inventory write-downs, which was partially offset by lower unit operating costs and the positive effects of the stronger U.S. dollar. Copper production increased by 13% (10,000 tonnes) compared to a year ago, despite reduced production as a result of ground movement at Quebrada Blanca in June and the closure of Duck Pond which ceased operating on June 30, 2015. Copper production at Highland Valley Copper was 10,500 tonnes higher than a year ago primarily due to higher grade and recoveries while our share of production from Antamina increased by 6,500 tonnes as a result of record mill throughput during the quarter. Copper production was also higher at Carmen de Andacollo, although production was lower at Quebrada Blanca after processing facilities were temporarily shut down due to unanticipated ground movement in late June. Capital expenditures totaled $69 million, including $37 million for sustaining capital and $25 million for new mine development, of which $21 million was for the Quebrada Blanca Phase 2 project. Capitalized stripping costs were $51 million in the third quarter, lower than the $55 million a year ago. Markets LME copper prices averaged US$2.39 per pound in the third quarter of 2015, down 13% over the prior period. Copper prices remained volatile trading to the lowest levels since 2009. Total reported exchange stocks rose 51,872 tonnes during the quarter to 0.5 million tonnes. Total reported global copper stocks are now estimated to be 8.3 days of global consumption, below the estimated 25 year average of 28 days of global consumption. Operational issues at copper mines continue to impact current and future mine production. As a result of these supply disruptions and price related mine suspensions, large copper surpluses originally forecast for 2015 and 2016 have moved closer to balance despite weaker demand growth. Market fundamentals remain positive over the medium to long-term with supply constrained by lower grades, ongoing operational difficulties and project delays or deferrals due to the current low prices. Operations Highland Valley Copper Copper production was 40,200 tonnes in the third quarter or 35% higher than a year ago, due to higher copper grades and higher recoveries. Mill throughput was lower than a year ago due to harder ore in the current phase of the Valley pit. Molybdenum production declined to 0.7 million pounds from 1.6 million pounds a year ago primarily due to lower grade, partially offset by higher recovery. Operating costs increased $18 million or 16% compared to the same period a year ago as a result of higher sales. Unit costs declined significantly compared to a year ago due to higher sales and substantial progress on cost savings programs. As we continue to mine the higher grade but harder ore in the current phase of the Valley pit, throughput is expected to remain similar for the remainder of 2015. Grades are expected to be lower in the final quarter compared to the previous quarter, but will remain above reserve grade. The crusher relocation project for the Valley pit was successfully completed in the third quarter for a total cost of $56 million, well below the budget of $69 million. This project provides access to over 30 million tonnes of reserves as part of our current life of mine plan. Antamina Copper production in the third quarter increased by 36% compared with a year ago primarily as a result of higher mill throughput. The mix of mill feed in the quarter was 57% copper-only ore and 43% copper-zinc ore compared to 63% and 37%, respectively, in the same period a year ago. Our share of zinc production of 16,300 tonnes in the third quarter decreased by 1% compared with a year ago due to lower grades, partially offset by higher mill throughput and greater copper-zinc ore processed. Antamina achieved mill throughput of 14.3 million tonnes for the quarter, an average of 155,400 tonnes per day, 16% higher than the same period last year. Recent debottlenecking projects focused primarily on the crushing and conveying system have enabled throughputs much higher than the 130,000 tonnes per day design capacity of the original expansion project. Throughput rates going forward will be dependent on ore hardness and the mix of ore feeds to the plant, but are expected to continue above original design capacity rates. Operating costs in the third quarter were 14% higher compared to a year ago due to higher sales. Significant progress has been made in reducing U.S. dollar unit costs, with savings more than offset by foreign currency translation and the effects of the weaker Canadian dollar. On October 7, 2015, we announced that we and a subsidiary had entered into a long-term streaming agreement with a subsidiary of Franco-Nevada Corporation (Franco-Nevada) linked to production at the Antamina mine. Compania Minera Antamina S.A., in which we hold a 22.5% interest and which owns and operates Antamina is not a party to the agreement and operations will not be affected. Franco-Nevada made a payment of US$610 million and will pay 5% of the spot price at the time of delivery for each ounce of silver delivered under the agreement. We will deliver silver to Franco-Nevada equivalent to 22.5% of payable silver sold by CMA, using a silver payability factor of 90%. After 86 million ounces of silver have been delivered under the agreement, the stream will be reduced by one third. Quebrada Blanca Copper production in the third quarter decreased by 46% compared with a year ago due to the precautionary suspension of mining in the area adjacent to the SX/EW plant and a temporary shutdown of the processing facilities. Heap leach ore placed decreased by 37% as a result of the ground movement. Normal operations resumed in August, although mining continues to be restricted and stable operations were achieved for the month of September at better than planned unit costs. We will continue to operate the south side of the EW plant only which has sufficient production capacity for the remainder of the mine life. Production for 2015 is expected to be about 38,000 tonnes of copper cathode. The full impact on the mine life and future operating plans continues to be assessed in conjunction with remedial plans to ensure stability of the mine, plant and associated infrastructure. These plans will be finalized by the end of the year as we complete our engineering assessments, budgeting and further cost reduction processes. Operating costs increased by $32 million or 49% compared with the same period a year ago primarily as a result of inventory write-downs to reflect lower copper prices and the effects of the weaker Canadian dollar. We continue to progress the updating of environmental permits for the existing facilities for the supergene operation. The review and indigenous consultation processes by the relevant regulatory agencies are still in progress as we await approval. All three labour agreements at Quebrada Blanca were successfully negotiated during the quarter, each with a term of two years. Carmen de Andacollo Copper production in the third quarter increased by 9% compared with a year ago primarily as a result of higher copper recovery and higher throughput. In late September, a major earthquake in the region damaged our ship loading facilities at the port of Coquimbo. To date production has not been materially affected, but shipments of concentrate have been temporarily suspended through the port facility while the operator completes damage assessments and repairs. Alternate loading arrangements are being arranged with resumption of shipping anticipated within the next two weeks. There is sufficient storage capacity at the port and mine site through to the end of October. Operating costs decreased by $4 million or 5% compared with a year ago due to lower sales, and partially offset by the effect of the stronger U.S. dollar. U.S. dollar unit costs were similar to the same period a year ago. During the quarter and extending into early October, both Carmen de Andacollo labour agreements were successfully re-negotiated for a four-year term. On July 8th, 2015, our subsidiary Compania Minera Teck Carmen de Andacollo (Carmen de Andacollo) sold an interest in gold reserves and resources from the Carmen de Andacollo mine to RGLD Gold AG (RGLDAG), a wholly owned subsidiary of Royal Gold, Inc. Under the terms of the agreement, RGLDAG is entitled to an amount of gold equal to 100% of the payable gold produced from the Andacollo mine until 900,000 ounces have been delivered, and 50% thereafter. RGLDAG will pay a cash price of 15% of the monthly average gold price at the time of each delivery. Carmen de Andacollo and Royal Gold Chile Limitada, a wholly owned subsidiary of Royal Gold, Inc., terminated an earlier royalty agreement entered into in 2010. Royal Gold Chile Limitada was entitled to a payment based on 75% of payable gold produced from the Andacollo mine until 910,000 ounces had been delivered, and 50% thereafter. Approximately 260,000 ounces of payable gold subject to the royalty agreement were produced through June 30, 2015, the effective date of the termination. Net cash proceeds to us from the transaction were US$162 million. Cost of Sales Unit cash costs of product sold in the third quarter of 2015 as reported in U.S. dollars, before cash margins for by-products, decreased primarily due to higher sales volumes, continued cost reduction efforts and the favourable effects of a stronger U.S. dollar at our Canadian operations. Copper Development Projects Quebrada Blanca Phase 2 During the third quarter of 2015, activities continued to focus on capital optimization and permitting for the Quebrada Blanca Phase 2 project. A decision has been made to move the proposed tailings facility to a location closer to the mine site. The proposed facility is expected to provide sufficient capacity for tailings from ore mined during the first 25 years of the mine life. This decision, as well as other plant and infrastructure optimizations in the current design, is expected to materially reduce initial capital costs for the project. We expect to complete a new cost estimate in the first half of 2016 as engineering on these design changes progresses. The design is expected to have a lower capital intensity as throughput and production rates are not anticipated to be lower. Additional baseline work is required as a result of these changes and we now anticipate submitting an Environmental Impact Assessment to the authorities mid to late 2016. Project Corridor In August we announced an agreement with Goldcorp Inc. to combine the El Morro and Relincho projects, located approximately 40 kilometres apart in the Huasco Province in the Atacama region of Chile, into a single project. Teck and Goldcorp will contribute their respective project interests into a 50/50 joint venture with closing of the transaction anticipated in the fourth quarter. In combination with community consultation, a pre-feasibility study is expected to commence in early 2016 and be completed in approximately 18 months. Other Copper Projects We continue to minimize expenditures on all other copper projects. Targeted studies continue at the Galore Creek, Schaft Creek and Mesaba projects as we further explore ways to enhance the value of these projects. The pre-feasibility study continued to progress at our 50% owned Zafranal copper-gold project located in southern Peru and is now anticipated to be complete at the end of the first quarter in 2016. Outlook We expect full year production for copper in the range of 345 to 350 thousand tonnes. ZINC BUSINESS UNIT Performance Gross profit before depreciation and amortization from our zinc business unit was unchanged year over year. A lower realized zinc price in U.S. dollars and lower contributions from coproducts and by-products were offset by the favourable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, lower royalties, higher sales and lower operating costs. Refined zinc production from our Trail Operations increased by 11% compared to last year due to improved operating efficiencies in the electrolytic plant and to the improved reliability of the new acid plant, leading to higher throughput. The table below summarizes the gross profit change, before depreciation and amortization, in our zinc business unit for the quarter. Markets LME zinc prices averaged US$0.84 per pound in the third quarter of 2015, down 16% over the prior quarter. Zinc prices fell to a low of US$0.71 per pound in the quarter, the lowest level since 2009. Reported zinc exchange stocks rose 111,560 tonnes during the quarter to end at 756,060 tonnes. Total global reported stocks are now estimated at 19 days of global consumption down from the 25 year average of 42 days. Demand for refined zinc in our key North American markets remains weaker again this quarter with our customers facing headwinds from reduced demand and continued imports of low-cost galvanized sheet. Zinc stocks continue to decline in both metal and concentrates year to date. Zinc supply will become further constrained later in 2015 and into 2016 with planned mine closures including the recently announced closures from major suppliers taking effect. Operations Red Dog Zinc grade and recovery was similar to 2014, however, mill throughput was lower than the third quarter of 2014 due to lower throughput rate and unplanned mill downtime resulting in 12% less zinc production. Higher lead grade offset by lower recovery and throughput than in 2014 resulted in 8% less lead production. Zinc sales volumes were similar to the third quarter of 2014. Operating costs in the current quarter increased due to the effects of the stronger U.S. dollar. Capitalized stripping costs were $11 million in the third quarter compared with $9 million a year ago. Trail Zinc production was 11% higher this quarter than in the third quarter of 2014 as a result of improved reliability of the new acid plants and good current efficiency in the zinc cell house. Lead production was 8% lower than a year ago as the annual KIVCET shutdown was advanced from the fourth quarter to the third quarter. Cost of sales increased by 5%, largely related to higher zinc production and sales during the quarter. Pend Oreille Mill throughput was 81% of design capacity of 2,000 tonnes per day during the third quarter due to delays in fully implementing pillar recovery mining. The concentrator is performing as anticipated with recoveries expected to improve as mill feed variability is reduced. Outlook The Pend Oreille mine is forecasted to reach the full production rate of 44,000 tonnes per year of zinc metal at the end of the fourth quarter of 2015 once pillar recovery mining is fully implemented. The 2015 shipping season is expected to be completed on October 22, 2015 following the shipment of 1,048,000 tonnes of zinc concentrate and 216,000 tonnes of lead concentrate compared with 1,025,000 tonnes and 205,000 tonnes, respectively, for the 2014 season. This represents all of Red Dog's concentrates available to be shipped from the operation. Sales volumes of contained zinc are estimated at approximately 200,000 tonnes in the fourth quarter of 2015. ENERGY BUSINESS UNIT Fort Hills Project Construction of the Fort Hills project is progressing substantially in accordance with the project schedule. In the third quarter of 2015 our capital expenditures were $217 million compared with a cash spending estimate of $213 million. Our capital expenditures in 2015 were $664 million to date compared with our cash forecast spending estimate which was $691 million. Our share of Fort Hills cash expenditures in 2015 is estimated at $850 million. Since sanction, the project has achieved and continues to track to key milestones. Engineering activity is progressing well, and is now 94% complete, construction is progressing per plan and is now approximately 43% complete. Equipment and material deliveries are continuing and offsite modular fabrication, site civil works and process facility construction are well underway. Site construction workforce is currently approximately 4,800 and will continue to ramp-up to peak in 2016. The capital cost and schedule outlook have not changed since we announced project sanction in October 2013. We continue to target first oil in the fourth quarter of 2017, with 90% of our planned production capacity of 180,000 barrels per day (bpd) expected within 12 months. Our share of production is expected to be 36,000 bpd (13 million barrels per year) of bitumen. We are continuing to review options to sell diluted bitumen into the North American and overseas markets which may include the use of pipelines from Hardisty or rail to access tidewater ports and U.S. Gulf Coast refineries. Frontier Energy Project The Frontier regulatory application review continues with the provincial and federal regulators. We responded to the regulators' information requests and provided a project update in June 2015. The project update improves the economic and social benefits and overall environmental performance of the project. We expect responses from the regulators on the updated project in the fourth quarter of 2015. The earliest anticipated first oil date for our Frontier Project is now 2026, which reflects additional time required for updates to the project in light of the lease exchange transaction and revisions to the project scope. The regulatory review process is expected to continue through 2015; making late 2016 or early 2017 the earliest date in which a decision is expected. Our expenditures on Frontier are limited to supporting this process. Wintering Hills Wind Power Facility During the third quarter, our share of the power generation from Wintering Hills was 28 GWhs, resulting in 18,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent offsets. Our share of expected power generation in 2015 is 135 GWhs, resulting in approximately 85,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent offsets, although actual generation will depend on weather conditions and other factors. OTHER OPERATING COST AND EXPENSES Other operating expenses, net of other income, were $174 million in the third quarter compared with $41 million a year ago. This includes negative pricing adjustments of $141 million, including adjustments, on copper and zinc of $98 million and $34 million, respectively. We also made additional environmental provisions of $15 million. The table below outlines our outstanding receivable positions, provisionally valued at September 30 and June 30, 2015. Finance expense was $79 million in the third quarter, similar to a year ago. Debt interest expense increased due to the effect of the stronger U.S. dollar, as all our debt and related interest expense is U.S. dollar denominated. We capitalized a total of $59 million in interest in the quarter. Other non-operating expense of $44 million included foreign exchange losses of $35 million on that portion of our debt which is not offset by investments in U.S. dollar denominated foreign subsidiaries and a loss on marketable securities of $13 million. The income and resource recovery for the third quarter was $767 million, or 26% of pre-tax loss. This effective tax rate reflects the effect of impairment charges and is not comparable with our historical and expected future tax rates. Impairment charges of $2,895 million including an impairment of goodwill, which is not tax-deductible, resulted in a tax recovery of $741 million. Before impairment charges, we recorded a tax recovery of $27 million on pre-tax loss of $27 million. This unusual result comes about, in part, as a higher proportion of our earnings have come from lower tax rate jurisdictions or bear lower rates of tax due to the nature of the underlying items. We also evaluate tax assets and liabilities on a quarterly basis based on facts and circumstances, expected future earnings levels, and assessments and resolutions of tax matters and changes in these evaluations can significantly affect our tax rate at lower income levels. Due to available tax pools, we are currently shielded from cash income taxes, but not resource taxes in Canada. We remain subject to cash taxes in foreign jurisdictions. FINANCIAL POSITION AND LIQUIDITY Our cash position increased from $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion in the quarter. Significant outflows included $217 million on Fort Hills project expenditures. Significant inflows included a net $209 million (US$162 million) on our share of the Carmen de Andacollo gold stream transaction. Subsequent to quarter end, we received an additional $789 million (US$610 million) in October from the silver streaming agreement with Franco-Nevada related to our Antamina mine and repaid US$300 million on a note due October 1. Our cash flow in the last quarter of the year will be affected by the seasonality of Red Dog sales and the reduction of inventories. Based on the repayment of US$300 million of notes that were due October 1 and cash received from the silver streaming agreement, as well as current commodity prices and exchange rates, we now expect our year-end cash balance to be approximately $1.8 billion, assuming existing debt levels. We maintain various committed and uncommitted credit facilities for liquidity and for the issuance of letters of credit. All of our bank credit facilities are unsecured and any borrowings rank pari passu with our outstanding public notes. None of our notes or credit facilities are guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries. We maintain two primary revolving committed credit facilities. Our US$3 billion facility matures in July 2020 and has a letter of credit sub-limit of US$1 billion. Any letters of credit issued under this facility would reduce the amount of the facility that can be drawn for cash. Our US$1.2 billion facility matures in June 2017 and can be drawn fully for cash or for letters of credit. Both facilities require us to pay a commitment fee on undrawn amounts and a specified spread above LIBOR on any drawn amounts, which varies with our credit rating, but does not further vary if our ratings from both Moody's and S&P are below Ba1 or BB high, respectively. Drawings under both facilities are available for general corporate purposes. Both facilities were undrawn at September 30, 2015. Borrowing under our primary committed credit facilities is subject to our compliance with the covenants in the agreement and our ability to make certain representations and warranties at the time of the borrowing request. Our credit facilities, but not our public notes, include a financial covenant that requires us to maintain our debt to debt-plus-equity ratio below 50%. Borrowing under the credit facilities is not conditioned on us maintaining any particular credit rating or there being no general developments that could be expected to have a material adverse effect on us. While we have no current intention to incur secured debt, we are restricted under our bank and public note covenants from creating liens on certain assets to secure indebtedness unless those liens also secure our credit facilities and notes. We are restricted from creating liens on major assets. There are a number of exceptions from these negative pledge covenants, including an exception for liens securing debt that does not exceed 10% of consolidated net tangible assets. As at September 30, 2015, our consolidated net tangible assets for the purposes of our credit facilities and public notes totaled approximately $32.3 billion, 10%, of which is approximately $3.2 billion In addition to our two primary revolving committed credit facilities, we also maintain uncommitted bilateral credit facilities with various banks and with Export Development Canada for the issuance of letters of credit, primarily to support our future reclamation obligations. At September 30, 2015 these facilities totaled $1.5 billion and outstanding letters of credit issued thereunder were $1.15 billion. We expect these amounts to increase by approximately $225 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 for an increased reclamation estimate at our Red Dog mine and for water related permitting in the Elk Valley. These facilities are typically renewed on an annual basis. From time to time, at our election, we may reduce the fees paid to banks issuing letters of credit by making short-term deposits of excess cash with those banks. The deposits earn a competitive rate of interest and are generally refundable on demand. At September 30 we had US$400 million of such deposits. Our reclamation obligations are included in \"Other Liabilities and Provisions\" on our balance sheet. Associated letters of credit would not become a liability unless the letter of credit is drawn by the beneficiary, which drawing would be triggered if we did not perform our obligations under the relevant contact or permit. In the event of the drawing, we would be required to reimburse the issuing bank for the amount drawn on the letter of credit. Issued letters of credit do not constitute debt for the purpose of the debt-to-debt plus equity covenant in our bank credit agreements. Since the end of the second quarter, Moody's, S&P and Fitch revised our credit ratings to Ba1, BB and BB+, respectively, in each case with a negative outlook. DBRS currently rates us BBB with a negative outlook. As a consequence of these ratings actions, we are required to deliver an aggregate of US$672 million of letters of credit pursuant to long-term power purchase agreements for the Quebrada Blanca Phase 2 project. We are in discussions with our counterparty regarding deferring the issuance of these letters of credit, which are otherwise required to be issued before the end of October, however, there is no assurance that this deferral will be permitted. The letters of credit would be terminated if and when we regain investment grade ratings. We may also be required to post letters of credit under certain pipeline and storage agreements we entered into in connection with the Fort Hills project. If required, these letters of credit would be in amounts up to approximately $425 million and increasing to approximately $650 million in 2017 prior to the relevant in-service date. Following such in-service date, the letter of credit amount would reduce to up to approximately $450 million. These Fort Hills related letters of credit would also be terminated if and when we regain investment grade ratings. The ratings actions described above do not affect our credit facilities beyond the rate of the commitment fee and cost of borrowing. There are no restrictions on borrowing, or additional covenants, triggered under our credit facilities as a result of the downgrade. Operating Cash Flow Cash flow from operations, before changes in non-cash working capital items, was $302 million in the third quarter compared with $553 million a year ago. Changes in working capital items increased cash by $258 million in the third quarter. The decrease in working capital in the quarter was due to lower inventory and receivables compared to the second quarter. This is a matter of the timing of a number of operating items. Investing Activities Expenditures on property, plant and equipment were $217 million in the third quarter for the Fort Hills oil sands project, $83 million on sustaining capital and $18 million on major enhancement projects. The largest components of sustaining expenditures were $17 million at our Red Dog Operations and $14 million at Highland Valley Copper. Major enhancement expenditures included approximately $7 million at our steelmaking coal operations. Capitalized stripping expenditures were $146 million in the third quarter compared with $145 million a year ago. The majority of this item constitutes the advancement of pits for future production at our steelmaking coal mines. Financing Activities Financing activities in the third quarter consisted of capital lease repayments of $13 million (2014 - $16 million) and debt interest payments of $188 million (2014 - $156 million). We distributed $21 million to minority interests in our operations (2014 - $6 million) and paid dividends of $86 million (2014 - $259 million). We repaid US$300 million on a note on October 1. OUTLOOK We continue to experience challenging markets for our products and prices for some of our products have declined and lower prices may persist for some time. Commodity markets have historically been volatile, prices can change rapidly and customers can alter shipment plans. This can have a substantial effect on our business. Reduced supply of steelmaking coal from U.S. and Canada is offset by weaker demand, particularly in China, and by increased Australian supply, maintaining downward pressure on prices. We are also significantly affected by foreign exchange rates. In the last nine months, the U.S. dollar strengthened by approximately 15% against the Canadian dollar, which has had a positive effect on the profitability of our Canadian operations. It will, to a lesser extent, put upward pressure on the portion of our operating costs and capital spending that is denominated in U.S. dollars. In October 2013, we approved an estimated $2.9 billion (our share) to complete the development of the Fort Hills oil sands project, of which approximately $1.5 billion remains to be spent. We have access to cash and credit lines which are expected to be sufficient to meet our capital commitments and working capital needs over this period. We are taking further steps to manage our capital spending profile and we continuously monitor all aspects of our cost reduction program, our capital spending and key markets as conditions evolve. In addition, we could be subject to labour unrest or other disturbances as a result of delays in or the failure of negotiations of new contracts, which could limit our ability to maintain steelmaking coal or copper production in accordance with our plans. If this were to occur, the potential shortfall in planned production could be material. We continue to monitor market conditions for steelmaking coal and currently expect production rates to match our sales projections for the fourth quarter. Foreign Exchange, Debt Revaluation and Interest Expense The sales of our products are denominated in U.S. dollars, while a significant portion of our expenses are incurred in local currencies, particularly the Canadian dollar and the Chilean peso. Foreign exchange fluctuations can have a significant effect on our operating margins, unless such fluctuations are offset by related changes to commodity prices. Our U.S. dollar denominated debt is subject to revaluation based on changes in the Canadian/U.S. dollar exchange rate. As at September 30, 2015, $6.1 billion of our U.S. dollar denominated debt is designated as a hedge against our foreign operations that have a U.S. dollar functional currency. As a result, any foreign exchange gains or losses arising on that amount of our U.S. dollar debt are recorded in other comprehensive income, with the remainder being charged to profit. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND DERIVATIVES We hold a number of financial instruments and derivatives which are recorded on our balance sheet at fair value with gains and losses in each period included in other comprehensive income and profit for the period as appropriate. The most significant of these instruments are marketable securities, foreign exchange forward sales contracts, metal-related forward contracts and settlements receivable and payable. Some of our gains and losses on metalrelated financial instruments are affected by smelter price participation and are taken into account in determining royalties and other expenses. All are subject to varying rates of taxation depending on their nature and jurisdiction. OUTSTANDING SHARE DATA As at October 21, 2015 there were 566.8 million Class B subordinate voting shares and 9.4 million Class A common shares outstanding. In addition, there were 16.0 million stock options outstanding with exercise prices ranging between $4.15 and $58.80 per share. More information on these instruments and the terms of their conversion is set out in Note 19 of our 2014 audited financial statements. INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Any system of internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. There have been no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2015 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS - IMPAIRMENT TESTING In preparing consolidated financial statements, management makes estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses across all reportable segments. Management makes estimates and judgments that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our estimates and judgments are based on historical experience and other factors we consider to be reasonable, including expectations of future events. Critical accounting estimates and judgments are those that could affect the consolidated financial statements materially, are highly uncertain and where changes are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Impairment testing is an area that requires significant judgment, both in assessing whether certain factors would be considered an indicator of impairment and when an indicator is present, determining the assumptions used in preparing discounted cash models. We consider both internal and external information to determine whether there is an indicator of impairment present and accordingly, when impairment testing is required. When impairment testing is required, discounted cash flow models are used to estimate the recoverable amounts of respective assets. Significant assumptions used in preparing these discounted cash flow models include commodity prices, reserves and resources, operating costs, capital expenditures, discount rates, foreign exchange rates, tax assumptions and inflation rates. These inputs are based on management's best estimates of what an independent market participant would consider appropriate and are reviewed by senior management. Changes in these inputs may alter the results of impairment testing, the amount of impairment charges recorded in the statement of income and the resulting carrying values of assets. In light of current economic conditions we have revised our market participant long-term price expectations for copper, zinc, steelmaking coal and oil and performed a detailed review of impairment indicators across all of our operations and assets. Where required, we have estimated the recoverable amount of our assets on a fair value less costs of disposal basis (FVLCD) and have determined that this was higher than the value in use of these assets. In our copper, zinc, steelmaking coal and energy business units we have identified Cash Generating Units with carrying values that exceed the estimated recoverable amounts. FVLCD was estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology taking into account assumptions likely to be made by market participants. Cash flow projections are based on current life of mine plans and exploration potential. Commodity Prices Commodity price assumptions are based on a number of factors, including forward curves in the near term, and are benchmarked with external sources of information, including information published by our peers and where possible, market transactions, to ensure they are within the range of values used by market participants. Our key commodity price assumptions are based on current prices over the next three years escalating to a real long-term price. For steelmaking coal, copper and zinc, we start with a 2016 price of US$96 per tonne, US$2.50 per pound and US$0.85 per pound for each respective commodity. These prices are gradually escalated over the next three years, reaching a real long-term price in 2020 of US$130 per tonne, US$3.00 per pound and US$1.00 per pound for steelmaking coal, copper and zinc, respectively. For impairment testing of assets within our energy business unit, we have used a long-term West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price of US$75 per barrel and a Western Canadian Select (WCS) differential of US$10.50 per barrel. Reserves and Resources Future mineral production is included in projected cash flows based on mineral reserve and resource estimates and exploration and evaluation work, undertaken by appropriately qualified persons. Operating Costs and Capital Expenditures Operating costs and capital expenditures are based on life of mine plans and internal management forecasts. Cost estimates incorporate management experience and expertise, current operating costs, the nature and location of each operation and the risks associated with each operation. Future capital expenditures are based on management's best estimate of expected future capital requirements, which are generally for the extraction and processing of existing reserves and resources. All committed and anticipated capital expenditures based on future cost estimates have been included in the projected cash flows. Operating cost and capital expenditure assumptions are continuously subject to on-going optimization and review by management. Discount Rates Discount rates used are based on the weighted average cost of capital for a mining industry peer group and are calculated with reference to current market information. Adjustments to the rate are made for any risks that are not reflected in the underlying cash flows. A 5.8% real, 7.9% nominal, post-tax discount rate was used to discount cash flow projections in all of our FVLCD discounted cash flows. Foreign Exchange Rates Foreign exchange rates are benchmarked with external sources of information based on a range used by market participants. The long-term Canadian - U.S. dollar foreign exchange assumption used was 1 U.S. dollar to 1.25 Canadian dollars. Inflation Rates Inflation rates are based on average historical inflation for the location of each operation and long-term government bond yields. Inflation rates are benchmarked with external sources of information and are within a range used by market participants. The inflation rate for all FVLCD calculations is 2%. Turqoise Hill Resources Ltd. (TSE: TRQ) Turquoise Hill Resources (TRQ: TSX, NYSE & NASDAQ) is an international mining company with copper-gold and coal mines in the Asia Pacific region. Principal assets: A 66% interest in Oyu Tolgoi, one of the world's largest copper-gold-silver mines now producing and shipping concentrate to customers in China. A 22.63% interest in established Mongolian coal miner SouthGobi Resources (SGQ: TSX, 1878: HK). Turquoise Hill announces financial results and review of operations for the third quarter of 2015 VANCOUVER, CANADA - Turquoise Hill Resources today announced its financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. All figures are in US dollars unless otherwise stated. . HIGHLIGHTS Oyu Tolgoi achieved a strong safety performance with an All Injury Frequency Rate of 0.31 per 200,000 hours worked for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Oyu Tolgoi recorded revenue of $431.7 million in Q3'15 on sales of 226,000 tonnes of concentrate, a 2.5% increase over Q2'15, reflecting higher sales volumes partially offset by lower copper prices. Turquoise Hill reported income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders of $44.0 million. In Q3'15, a non-cash charge of $76.4 million was recorded within operating expenses for provision against non-current ore stockpile inventory. Turquoise Hill generated operating cash flow before interest and taxes of $171.7 million during Q3'15. Oyu Tolgoi's Q3'15 mine production was at record levels while concentrate produced and contained copper were on par with Q2'15 even considering the planned concentrator shutdown in July 2015. During Q3'15, mined production increased 8.5% over Q2'15 due to shorter hauling routes and ongoing productivity initiatives. Copper in concentrates for Q3'15 increased 1.3% due to higher head grades while gold in concentrates decreased 48.3% over Q2'15 due to slower than anticipated access to gold-rich ore. Increased copper and gold production is expected in Q4'15 compared to Q3'15 as higher-grade ore is accessed in the open pit. Turquoise Hill continues to expect Oyu Tolgoi to produce 175,000 to 195,000 tonnes of copper and 600,000 to 700,000 ounces of gold in concentrates in 2015. In August 2015, Oyu Tolgoi filed revised schedules for the 2015 Oyu Tolgoi Feasibility Study with the Mongolian Minerals Council. Underground pre-start activities are underway in parallel with an update to the feasibility study capital estimate, which is expected to be completed in Q1'16. Turquoise Hill continues to expect signing of project financing by the end of 2015 and the decision for underground construction in early Q2'16. Capital expenditure for 2015 is now expected to be approximately $120 million, of which approximately $115 million relates to sustaining capital, due to operational efficiencies, changes to the mine plan during the year and capital optimization. Operating cash costs for 2015 are now expected to be approximately $900 million reflecting operational improvements throughout the year and excluding one-time costs related to the May 2015 underground agreement as well as pre-start costs for underground development. Sales contracts have been signed for more than 80% of Oyu Tolgoi's expected 2016 concentrate production. In September 2015, Oyu Tolgoi surpassed 1.5 million tonnes of concentrate shipped. Turquoise Hill's cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2015 were $1.3 billion. FINANCIAL RESULTS In Q3'15, the Company recorded net income attributable to owners of Turquoise Hill of $21.2 million or $0.01 per share compared with net loss of $94.0 million or ($0.05) per share in Q3'14, an increase of $115.2 million. The increase is mainly attributable to a $227.3 million non-cash impairment charge recorded in Q3'14 on reclassification of SouthGobi to assets held for sale. Operating cash flows before interest and taxes in Q3'15 were $171.7 million compared with $256.3 million in Q3'14, reflecting continued production and delivery cost improvements and effective working capital management, offset by the impact of lower commodity prices on sales revenue. Additions to property, plant and equipment, excluding adjustments relating to asset retirement obligations ($9.7 million), were $31.1 million in Q3'15 all of which related to sustaining capital activities including the tailing storage facility. Turquoise Hill's cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2015 were $1.3 billion. OYU TOLGOI The Oyu Tolgoi mine is approximately 550 kilometres south of Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia's capital city, and 80 kilometres north of the Mongolia-China border. Mineralization on the property consists of porphyry-style copper, gold, silver and molybdenum contained in a linear structural trend (the Oyu Tolgoi Trend) that has a strike length extending over 26 kilometres. Mineral resources have been identified in a series of deposits throughout this trend. They include, from south to north, the Heruga Deposit, the Southern Oyu deposits (Southwest Oyu, South Oyu, Wedge and Central Oyu) and the Hugo Dummett deposits (Hugo South, Hugo North and Hugo North Extension). Mining of ore commenced in May 2012 and first concentrate was produced in January 2013. The Oyu Tolgoi mine has initially been developed as an open-pit operation. A copper concentrator plant, with related facilities and necessary infrastructure to support a nominal throughput of 100,000 tonnes of ore per day, has been constructed to process ore mined from the Southern Oyu open pit. Long term development plans for Oyu Tolgoi are based on a 95,000-tonne-per-day underground block-cave mine. In August 2013, development of the underground mine was delayed pending resolution of matters with the Government of Mongolia. On May 18, 2015, Turquoise Hill, the Government of Mongolia and Rio Tinto announced the signing of the Oyu Tolgoi Underground Mine Development and Financing Plan, which addressed key outstanding shareholder matters and set out an agreed basis for the funding of the project. Preparation for underground development Following the filing of revised schedules for the 2015 Oyu Tolgoi Feasibility Study with the Mongolian Minerals Council in August 2015, pre-start activities are underway in parallel with an update to the capital estimate, which is expected to be completed in Q1'16. Pre-start activities include ramp-up of the owners and EPCM team, reestimate activities, detailed engineering and early procurement for equipment and materials required for necessary critical works that are key enablers for recommencement of underground lateral development mining activity. Care and maintenance activities have continued for Shaft #1, facilities and mobile equipment. Turquoise Hill expects the decision for underground construction in early Q2'16. The Company continues to expect signing of project financing by the end of 2015. In September 2015, the Government of Mongolia signed the request of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) for host country approval (HCA) with respect to guarantees to be issued by MIGA in connection with the Oyu Tolgoi project financing. The signing of the HCA was a significant milestone in the project financing timeline. In October 2015, the project financing information circular was provided to the banking syndicate allowing for each institution's respective internal consideration and approval. Prior to the suspension in August 2013, underground lateral development at Hugo North had advanced approximately 16 kilometres off Shaft #1. Sinking of Shaft #2, the primary operations access and initial production hoisting shaft, had reached a depth of 1,168 metres below surface, 91% of its final depth of 1,284 metres. The 96 metre-high Shaft #2 concrete headframe has been constructed. Sinking of Shaft #5, a dedicated exhaust ventilation shaft, had reached a depth of 208 metres, 17% of its final depth of 1,174 metres. Surface facilities, including offices, mine dry, and workshop, are in place to support initial pre-production development and construction. Q3'15 performance Safety continues to be a major focus throughout Oyu Tolgoi's operations and the mine's management is committed to reducing risk and injury. Oyu Tolgoi achieved a solid safety performance with an All Injury Frequency Rate of 0.31 per 200,000 hours worked for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Revenue in Q3'15 increased 2.5% over Q2'15. Higher revenues reflect higher volumes of copper-gold concentrate sales, partially offset by a fall in copper prices. The Q3'15 mix of revenue by metals is the result of inventory with higher contained copper and gold drawn down during the quarter from concentrate produced in Q2'15. Gross margin at 41.6% for the quarter reduced from 46.4% in Q2'15 due to the effect of lower copper prices. Production and delivery costs include primarily the cash costs in inventory sold as well as allocated mine administration costs. Depreciation and depletion includes the depreciation and depletion in inventory sold as well as any depreciation of assets used in the selling and delivery process, including the depreciation of capitalized production phase stripping costs. A non-cash charge of $76.4 million was recorded in Q3'15, within operating expenses, for additional provision against non-current ore stockpiles, following re-estimation of realizable value to reflect lower copper and gold prices and updated assumptions for timing of processing. Total additions capitalized to property, plant and equipment, on an accruals basis, for Q3'15 were $31.1 million (Q3'14: $38.3 million) all attributed to sustaining activities, including the tailings storage facility and deferred stripping. Total additions for Q3'15 include an adjustment of $4.0 million, which reduced the carrying amount of underground evaluation costs capitalized in previous quarters to be in accordance with the Company's accounting policy on the recognition of exploration and evaluation costs. Total cash operating costs at Oyu Tolgoi in Q3'15 were $222.5 million. Following transition to IFRS, the 5% royalty payable to the Government of Mongolia, previously deducted from revenue, is reflected as a cash operating expense, and production phase stripping costs, previously included within cash operating expense, are capitalized and depreciated. During Q3'15, Oyu Tolgoi continued to improve and optimize operations in order to reduce costs across the mine's operation. Oyu Tolgoi's C1 costs in Q3'15 were $0.40 per pound, compared with $0.73 per pound in Q2'15. The decrease was mainly due to a $22.1 million charge in Q2'15 for settlement of amounts not previously paid or provided for in relation to Mongolian Tax assessments, following signature of the underground agreement on May 18, 2015, and a net reduction in inventory (excluding non-cash write-down) as sales volumes exceeded production. Oyu Tolgoi's open-pit mine has a high-grade zone containing a large proportion of gold in addition to copper; Turquoise Hill anticipates quarterly fluctuation of C1 costs as the quantity of gold in concentrates sold varies after ore from this zone is fed through the mill. All-in sustaining costs in Q3'15 were $1.52 per pound, compared with $1.26 per pound in Q2'15. The increase was mainly due to a non-cash charge for additional provision against non-current ore stockpile partially offset by royalty expenses returning to regular operational levels following the Q2'15 adjustment upon signing of the underground agreement. Oyu Tolgoi's Q3'15 mine production was at record levels while concentrate produced and contained copper was on par with Q2'15 even considering the planned concentrator shutdown in July. During Q3'15, mined production increased 8.5% over Q2'15 due to shorter hauling routes and ongoing productivity initiatives. Copper in concentrates for Q3'15 increased 1.3% due to higher head grades. Gold in concentrates for the quarter decreased 48.3% over Q2'15 due to slower than anticipated access to gold-rich ore. Funding of Oyu Tolgoi by Turquoise Hill In accordance with the ARSHA dated June 8, 2011, Turquoise Hill has funded Oyu Tolgoi's cash requirements beyond internally generated cash flows by a combination of equity investment and shareholder debt. For amounts funded by debt, Oyu Tolgoi must repay such amounts, including accrued interest, before it can pay common share dividends. At September 30, 2015, the aggregate outstanding balance of shareholder loans extended by subsidiaries of the Company to Oyu Tolgoi was $6.8 billion, including accrued interest of $1.4 billion. These loans bear interest at an effective annual rate of LIBOR plus 6.5%. In Q3'15, Oyu Tolgoi repaid a total amount of $180.0 million with respect to these loans, including accrued interest of $57.9 million. In accordance with the ARSHA, a subsidiary of the Company has funded the common share investments in Oyu Tolgoi on behalf of Erdenes. These funded amounts earn interest at an effective annual rate of LIBOR plus 6.5% and are repayable, by Erdenes to a subsidiary of the Company, via a pledge over Erdenes' share of Oyu Tolgoi common share dividends. Erdenes also has the right to reduce the outstanding balance by making cash payments at any time. As at September 30, 2015, the cumulative amount of such funding was $751.1 million, representing approximately 34% of invested common share equity; unrecognized interest on the funding amounted to $214.9 million. Operational outlook Increased copper and gold production is expected in Q4'15 when compared to Q3'15 as higher-grade ore is anticipated to be accessed in the open pit. Turquoise Hill continues to expect Oyu Tolgoi to produce 175,000 to 195,000 tonnes of copper and 600,000 to 700,000 ounces of gold in concentrates in 2015. The Company expects copper production to be at the top of the range while gold production is expected to be in the middle of the range. Capital expenditure for 2015 is now expected to be approximately $120 million, of which approximately $115 million relates to sustaining capital. The Company previously expected capital expenditure of approximately $230 million, of which approximately $185 million related to sustaining capital. The reduction is the result of operational efficiencies, changes to the mine plan during the year and capital optimization. Operating cash costs for 2015 are now expected to be approximately $900 million. The Company previously expected operating cash costs of approximately $1 billion. The reduction reflects changes from operational improvements throughout the year and excludes one-time costs related to the May 2015 underground agreement as well as pre-start costs for underground development. Sales contracts have been signed for more than 80% of Oyu Tolgoi's expected 2016 concentrate production. Q3'15 exploration Oyu Tolgoi's exploration strategy is focused on developing a project pipeline prioritized in areas that can impact the current development of the Oyu Tolgoi orebodies, seeking low-cost development options; in particular looking for shallower targets. Historical datasets are added to and reinterpreted to enable future discovery. SOUTHGOBI On April 23, 2015, the Company completed sale of 48.7 million shares in SouthGobi to Novel Sunrise Investments Limited (NSI) at a price of C$0.35 per common share payable in cash, and on June 3, 2015 a further 1.7 million shares were sold to NSI at a price of C$0.35 per share. Half of the aggregate cash proceeds, representing C$8.5 million in total, were received at closing; the balance of approximately C$8.5 million was received on August 4, 2015. At September 30, 2015, Turquoise Hill owned 52.4 million SouthGobi common shares, representing approximately 21.3% of the issued and outstanding SouthGobi shares at that date. The carrying value of this interest at September 30, 2015 was $14.6 million based on the quoted share price. At September 30, 2015, SouthGobi is classified as an investment in associate within assets held for sale in the Company's financial statements. OTHER EXPLORATION Desk top studies, data compilation and detailed satellite imagery interpretation are in progress for an orbit Area approximately surrounding Oyu Tolgoi. An induced polarization and magnetotellurics survey on Turquoise Hill's Teregt licence (bordering the south of the Oyu Tolgoi licences) was conducted. The results have been analyzed and the interpretation downgraded the previous induced polarization targets. Additional soil and rock geochemical sampling has been done to test for shallow exploration targets. A service agreement is in place with Rio Tinto Holdings (Exploration), under which they provide exploration services to the Company. This agreement benefits Turquoise Hill by allowing access to Rio Tinto's global expertise, knowledge base and skills. CORPORATE ACTIVITIES Management change In September 2015, Turquoise Hill announced the resignation of Stewart Beckman, Senior Vice President, Operations and Technical Development, effective October 1, 2015 due to Mr. Beckman having accepted a new position within Rio Tinto. The Company is conducting a search for Mr. Beckman's replacement, which will be announced in due course. Mr. Beckman will provide support in the interim to ensure a smooth transition. NON-GAAP MEASURES The Company's financial results are prepared in accordance with IFRS. In addition, the Company presents and refers to the following measures (non-GAAP measures) which are not defined in IFRS. A description and calculation of these measures is given below, and may differ in some aspects from equivalent measures provided by other issuers. Cash operating costs This measure comprises Oyu Tolgoi cash operating costs, and is presented in order to provide investors and other stakeholders in the Company with a greater understanding of performance and operations at Oyu Tolgoi. The measure of cash operating costs excludes: depreciation and depletion; exploration and evaluation; charges for asset write-down (including write-down of materials and supplies inventory), and includes management services payments to Rio Tinto, and management services payments to Turquoise Hill which are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements of the Company. C1 cash costs C1 cash costs is a metric representing the cash cost per unit of extracting and processing the Company's principal metal product to a condition in which it may be delivered to customers, net of by-product credits. It is provided in order to support peer group comparability and to provide investors and other stakeholders' useful information about the underlying cash costs of Oyu Tolgoi and the impact of by-product credits on the operations' cost structure. C1 cash costs are relevant to understanding the Company's operating profitability and ability to generate cash flow. When calculating costs associated with producing a pound of copper, the Company includes gold and silver revenue credits as the production cost is reduced as a result of selling these by-products.Turquoise Hill's principal metal product is copper, and C1 cash costs are reported for Oyu Tolgoi only. All-in sustaining costs All-in sustaining costs (AISC) is an extended cash based cost metric, providing further information on the aggregate cash, capital and overhead outlay per unit, and is intended to reflect the costs of producing the Company's principal metal product over the life-cycle of its operations. The measure seeks to reflect the full cost of copper production from current operations and as a result development project capital is not included. AISC allows Turquoise Hill to assess the ability of Oyu Tolgoi to support sustaining capital expenditures for future production from the generation of operating cash flows.

Under the exclusive agreement, Delta Ag will introduce the new precision agriculture platform from Farmers Edge to Australia's dryland growers, bringing them data-driven strategies to optimise on-farm profitability and sustainability. While traditionally ahead of the curve in adopting steering and guidance technologies, the broader Australian market has lagged in utilizing precision agriculture tools relative to the comparable North American agriculture markets. Challenged by adverse weather and volatile commodity and input expenses, precision agriculture in NSW - Australia's most lucrative farming state - represents a virtually untapped market, primed for increased production. Farm owners and managers in this region are well placed to adopt this technology as it becomes increasingly more cost-effective, seamless and proven. As NSW's premier agriculture retailer, Delta Ag's broad customer base has led the state on progressive farming practices and, already, growers from over 60,000 hectares throughout NSW have adopted 'Harvest More Results' from Farmers Edge, which includes: imagery, analysed field-centric yield data and real time fleet management. \"Agriculture in Australia - and across the world - has been plateauing as productivity gains are largely achieved through improved crop varieties and genetic research and development, and growers need to look elsewhere for the productivity gains needed in coming decades,\" said Delta Ag Managing Director, Gerard Hines. \"What we're introducing to Australia is an absolute game changer - an integrated package of software, hardware and 'boots on the ground' support that makes precision farming accessible and achievable for all farmers. This is not just about driving yield; it's about driving total farm performance.\" Through the field-centric technology approach from Farmers Edge, Delta Agribusiness will enable more productive and sustainable farming, ultimately increasing yields for key crops. Under the terms of the agreement, Delta Ag's network of customers will have access to the Farmers Edge Precision Solutions package, a comprehensive turnkey system that includes: Variable Rate Technology, soil sampling and analysis, field-centric weather monitoring, in-field telematics and data transfer, high-resolution satellite imagery, field-centric data analytics, access to integrated farm management platform and a network of highly experienced, trusted advisors on the ground. \"As one of the largest broad acre cropping markets in the world, Australia has led the way in technology on the farm, but it is now poised to see another renaissance with the introduction of precision agriculture strategies,\" said Wade Barnes, President and CEO of Farmers Edge. \"Our partnership with a world-class agribusiness leader like Delta Ag, which has distinguished itself as a pioneer in New South Wales' sustainable agriculture movement, is the next step in advancing better farming throughout the state. By utilizing our field-centric approach to farming, growers will be able to achieve stronger yield performance across the region.\" About Delta Agribusiness Since 2006, Delta Agribusiness has become a leading force in the supply of farm inputs, delivery of farm advisory services and marketing agricultural commodities in NSW, Australia.

(robert.tita@wsj.com) 10:34 ET - There's a chill in the US auto industry air a day after the industry reported a record year of more than 17.5 million sales. There is concern that sales may be going sideways as auto makers--especially those churning out premium luxury--amp up incentives. However, Baird analyst David Leiker points out that the market is still booming and if you are selling pick up trucks and SUVs, times are still good. Truck sales rose roughly 20% in December and up 12% for the year. That means good cash flow especially for the Detroit auto makers. However, car sales continue to soften. How auto makers will juggle inventory levels and the pressure to add incentives to car will be the story for 2016.

The measure is easing more quickly in the biggest markets than nationally, the bank says, \"indicative of moderating business travel.\" As new-hotel openings are poised to accelerate more in those markets than the country overall, JPMorgan cuts price targets and profit estimates across the sector and drops Hyatt (H) to neutral and Choice (CHH) to underweight--whose US room count is actually declining and P/E multiple of 13.6 is notably above the sector's 9.6.

In addition, the number of people quitting their jobs is up, a signal the labor market is strong. In October, 57% of Americans who left a job did so voluntarily.

Campden native James Dyck recently took over as crop systems and environment engineer at the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. He's one of around 20 such engineers in Ontario and is based out of Vineland. He also marks a bit of a changing of the guard at the ministry, as a number of retirements led to a new crop of engineers being hired. And Dyck is trying to get the word out to farmers that he and the ministry are here to help when it comes to utilizing technology. \"It's about getting the best value out of technology. We can act as a resource,\" he said. While technology, such as GPS systems and precision yield monitors are ubiquitous in today's farm machinery, Dyck said many farmers either don't utilize the technology or don't utilize it to its fullest potential. So Dyck, and colleague John Warbick, have been tasked with promoting best practices surrounding technology for farmers. Dyck's focus is on field crops like corn, wheat and soybeans, while Warbick focuses on tender fruit. \"It's nice to get back into the agricultural world,\" said Dyck, who grew up on a pig and cash cropping farm in Campden but previously worked in engineering consulting on building design in Hamilton. Dyck's job sees him organize demonstration and workshops, and also attend agricultural conferences, where he shares information on things such as how technology can improve storage of harvested crops and how precision agriculture can improve yields. While many farmers use precision agriculture, Dyck said the data is often examined and forgotten. \"What's not being taken advantage of is that you're able to take that data year over year,\" he said. By comparing yield results over a longer time frame, farmers can get a sense of what part of a given field routinely overproduce and which routinely under produce. \"My job is to be the bridge between the technological info and the farmers,\" he said. The ministry also has an information contact centre, which Dyck encourages farmers to use. Calling it a one-stop-shop for agricultural information, he said it's a great place for farmers to go when they have any farming-related question.

Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc. - Growing Leaders helps PotashCorp prepare for future - 17/12/2015 This is the philosophy PotashCorp took to heart when it created the Growing Leaders succession program. And now that the first crop of 13 potential leaders has completed their two-year journey, we are preparing to select another group of employees to start the Growing Leaders program in 2016. \"With Growing Leaders we have purposefully, intentionally created a distinct experience for high-potential leaders in our company who have shown great promise for further growth,\" says Candace Laing, PotashCorp's Senior Director, Organization and Talent Development. Participants are drawn from a range of sites, representing each nutrient and our corporate division. Their activities during Growing Leaders include assessing their leadership styles, coaching by peers and senior leadership, and in-depth education about all aspects of PotashCorp's business. The program is structured around four week-long gatherings of the leaders and each participant's individual learning plan. To wrap up, the Growing Leaders undertook an Action Learning Project - working in teams over several months to address an actual organizational challenge/opportunity facing PotashCorp. Three groups recently presented proposals to receptive PotashCorp executives regarding enhanced employee engagement. \"We're accelerating the development of these leaders,\" says Laing. Participants understand that the program is a guarantee of preparation, not necessarily promotion. The intent of Growing Leaders is to create a pool of leaders who are equipped with the skills and organizational knowledge that make them candidates to move into senior leadership positions. What they also gain are the relationships they've developed with their colleagues during the program. These trusted networks will be crucial as work throughout PotashCorp becomes more integrated and teams work together to tackle problems. Anastasia Vander Most, a geologist who is currently the Construction General Foreman at PotashCorp's Allan mine, says she now feels more prepared for any advancement opportunities that may arise. \"Having a better understanding of yourself will ultimately help you progress to where you want to be.\" Cameco Corporation - Cameco Restricts Underground Mining Activities at the Rabbit Lake Operation - 17/12/2015 Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada, December 17, 2015 ALL AMOUNTS ARE STATED IN CDN $ (UNLESS NOTED) Cameco (TSX: CCO; NYSE: CCJ) announced today that underground mining activities have been restricted at the Rabbit Lake operation in northern Saskatchewan.

Underground mining of thick coal seams Rakesh Kumar, Arun Kumar Singh, Arvind Kumar Mishra, Rajendra Singh Abstract This paper reviews underground mining methods for total thickness of a thick coal seam in single lift (TTTCSSL). Review shows the required engineering for extraction of thick seams needs to be fitted with thickness of the seam, behavior of rock-mass and surrounding stress conditions for efficient mining. Variants of TTTCSSL are able to extract a maximum 10-12 m thickness only. An improvement in bending moment of the overlying coal band in longwall top coal caving (LTCC) provides better under-winning opportunity for the roof coal band. An acceptable limit of 25 MPa compressive strength of coal for the success of LTCC may be increased under favorable geo-technical conditions. Bord and pillar in India adopted induced caving of roof coal band for single lift depillaring of total thickness (SLDTT) of a competent thick coal seam developed along floor. Case studies are given to arrest the adverse effects of extraction height on pillars. The Industry Mining Facts Minerals and metals are the building blocks of the computers and smartphones we rely on, of the vehicles and public transit that get us places, of the buildings where we live and work, and of green technologies that help make the world a more sustainable place. Just as we as individuals depend on mining to support our daily lives, Canada relies on the industry to keep the economy humming. Mining is one of Canada's most important economic sectors and a major job creator. A major employer: Approximately 380,000 people across Canada work in the mining and mineral processing industries. Mining is the largest private sector employer of Aboriginal peoples in Canada on a proportional basis, and employment is poised to increase. Canada has one of the largest mining supply sectors globally with more than 3,400 companies supplying engineering, geotechnical, environmental, financial and other services to mining operations. Those who work in mining enjoy the highest wages and salaries of all industrial sectors in Canada with an average annual pay exceeding $110,000, which surpassed the average earnings of workers in forestry, manufacturing, finance and construction by a range of $31,000 to $46,000 for those sectors. An economic engine: Mining contributed $54 billion to Canada's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2013. The industry accounted for 19.6% of the value of Canadian goods exports in 2013. Canada's value of mineral production was nearly $43.6 billion in 2013. The mining industry's payments to Canadian federal and provincial governments total $71 billion in taxes and royalties over the last decade (2003-2012). A global leader: Thanks to its rich geology, Canada is one of the largest mining nations in the world producing more than 60 minerals and metals. Canada ranks in the top five countries in the global production of 11 major minerals and metals: First in potash Second in uranium and cobalt Third in aluminum and tungsten Fourth in platinum group metals, sulphur and titanium Fifth in nickel and diamonds 57% of the world's public mining companies are listed on the TSX and TSX-Venture Exchanges. Together, the two exchanges handled 48% of global mining equity transactions in 2013, and accounted for 46% of global mining equity capital for that year. Globally, Canada is recognized for its leadership in safety and sustainability. Mining companies in Canada were the first in the world to develop an externally-verified performance system for sustainable mining practices with the creation of MAC's Towards Sustainable Mining initiative in 2004. Leading Companies Agnico Eagle Mines Limited Agnico Eagle's mission is to run a high quality, easy to understand business, that generates superior long-term per share returns for our shareholders, creates a great place to work for our employees, and that is a leading contributor to the well-being of the communities in which we operate. Agnico Eagle Reports Record Third Quarter 2015 Gold Production; Strong Operating Performance Leads to Increased Production Guidance and Reduced Costs for 2015 October 28, 2015 Stock Symbol: AEM (NYSE and TSX) (All amounts expressed in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted) TORONTO, Oct. 28, 2015 /PRNewswire/ - Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (NYSE:AEM, TSX:AEM) (\"Agnico Eagle\" or the \"Company\") today reported quarterly net income of $1.3 million, or net income of $0.01 per share for the third quarter of 2015. This result includes losses on financial instruments of $16.6 million ($0.08 per share), a non-cash foreign currency translation loss on deferred tax liabilities of $8.1 million ($0.04 per share), various mark-to-market and other adjustment losses of $9.5 million ($0.04 per share), non-cash stock option expense of $4.1 million ($0.02 per share), non-cash foreign currency translation losses of $0.9 million (nil per share), and non-recurring gains of $1.3 million ($0.01 per share). Excluding these items would result in adjusted net income of $39.2 million or adjusted net income of $0.18 per share for the third quarter of 2015. In the third quarter of 2014, the Company reported a net loss of $15.1 million or a net loss of $0.07 per share. Based on the exploration success in the first half of the year at several of the Company's projects, it was previously announced that exploration expense would increase in the second half of the year. Total exploration expense for the third quarter was $37.1 million. As a result of this increased exploration expense the Amaruq project in Nunavut yielded a significant increase in inferred resources (see August 19, 2015 news release) and an initial resource is expected to be reported by mid-February 2016 at the El Barqueno project in Mexico. For the first nine months of 2015, the Company reported net income of $40.1 million, or $0.19 per share. This compares with the first nine months of 2014 when net income was $104.3 million, or $0.55 per share. Financial results in the 2015 period were negatively impacted by much higher investment in exploration (approximately 102% higher); lower gold prices (approximately 9% lower) and lower by-product metals revenues. Third quarter 2015 cash provided by operating activities was $143.7 million ($217.8 million before changes in non-cash components of working capital). This compares to cash provided by operating activities of $71.2 million in the third quarter of 2014 ($129.2 million before changes in non-cash components of working capital). The increase in cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital during the current period was mainly due to an increase of 26% in gold production. For the first nine months of 2015, cash provided by operating activities was $475.5 million ($547.4 million before changes in non-cash components of working capital), as compared with the first nine months of 2014 when cash provided by operating activities was $504.4 million ($472.8 million before changes in non-cash components of working capital). The increase in cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital during the period was mainly due to a 20% increase in gold production. \"In the third quarter of 2015, we set a new record for quarterly gold production and lowered unit costs which resulted in strong operating cash flow. This has allowed us to continue to invest in our exploration and development pipeline, which represents the long-term future of our business,\" said Sean Boyd, Agnico Eagle's Chief Executive Officer. \"Our increased level of exploration activity continues to pay dividends as witnessed by the new discoveries at Kittila, Amaruq and El Barqueno. These projects are expected to be significant contributors to our production profile in the coming years,\" added Mr. Boyd. Third Quarter 2015 Highlights Include: Strong performance of Abitibi operations drives record quarterly gold production and low costs - Payable gold production1 in the third quarter of 2015 was 441,124 ounces of gold at total cash costs2 per ounce on a by-product basis of $536 and all-in sustaining costs3 on a by-product basis (\"AISC\") of $759 per ounce Two new production records set at Canadian Malartic - New quarterly records were set for average tonnes processed per calendar day (53,703 tonnes on a 100% basis), and ounces of gold produced in a quarter (153,206 ounces on a 100% basis) 2015 production guidance increased and cost forecasts reduced - Expected gold production for 2015 is now forecast to be approximately 1.65 million ounces (previously 1.6 million ounces) with total cash costs on a by-product basis of approximately $590 to $610 per ounce (previously $600 to $620) and AISC of approximately $840 to $860 per ounce (previously $870 to $890) expected Amaruq drilling expands scope of known mineralization - Drilling indicates that the Whale Tail and Mammoth zones form a single mineralized system at least 2.3 kilometres long. In addition, the V zone (part of the IVR area) has been identified as a substantial mineralized structure, locally with abundant visible gold Drilling extends new parallel zone at Kittila - Two recent drill holes have confirmed continuity within the new parallel lens (now called the \"Sisar lens\"). Highlights include: 8.1 grams per tonne (\"g/t\") gold (uncapped) over 8.0 metres at 1,235 metres depth; and 5.5 g/t gold (uncapped) over 3.3 metres at 950 metres depth and 560 metres farther north along strike Improved financial flexibility - In the third quarter, the Company's credit facility was amended and $25 million was repaid. In addition, a 10-year, $50-million term note was issued to Ressources Quebec, a subsidiary of Investissement Quebec. Capital expenditures in 2015 are also forecast to be approximately $50 million lower than previously reported due to positive foreign currency adjustments and deferrals into future periods A quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share was declared Third Quarter Financial and Production Highlights In the third quarter of 2015, strong operational performance continued at the Company's mines. Payable gold production in the third quarter of 2015 was a record 441,124 ounces compared to 349,273 ounces in the third quarter of 2014. The higher level of production in the 2015 period was primarily due to increased throughput levels at LaRonde, Goldex and Canadian Malartic, increased mill capacity at Kittila and higher grades at LaRonde, Meadowbank, Goldex, Kittila, Pinos Altos and La India. A detailed description of the production and cost performance at each mine is set out below. Total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis for the third quarter of 2015 were lower at $536 compared to $716 per ounce for the third quarter of 2014. The reduction in total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis in the third quarter of 2015 was a result of higher silver production, higher gold production at the majority of the Company's mines and weaker local currencies compared to the third quarter of 2014. In the third quarter of 2015 the average value of the Canadian dollar, Euro and Mexican Peso were 8%, 4%, and 23% lower, respectively than the Company's 2015 currency price assumptions (see February 11, 2015 news release). Payable gold production for the first nine months of 2015 was 1,249,012 ounces, compared to payable gold production of 1,041,753 ounces in the comparable 2014 period (which only included 76,639 ounces from Canadian Malartic for production from June 16 to September 30, 2014). For the first nine months of 2015, total cash costs on a by-product basis were $574 per ounce. This compares with $627 per ounce on a by-product basis in the first nine months of 2014. The lower costs in the 2015 period are due to the higher levels of production and favourable currency movements compared to the 2014 period. AISC for the third quarter of 2015 was lower at $759 versus $1,059 per ounce for the third quarter of 2014. The lower AISC is primarily due to higher production, lower total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis, lower general and administrative expenditures and lower capital expenditures. For the first nine months of 2015, AISC was $808 versus $947 per ounce for the 2014 period. The lower AISC in the 2015 period is due to the same reasons set out above. Cash Position Remains Strong; Continued focus on Debt Reduction; Credit lines extended for an additional year through 2020 Cash and cash equivalents and short term investments increased to $208.1 million at September 30, 2015, from the June 30, 2015 balance of $164.0 million. The outstanding balance on the Company's $1.2 billion credit facility was reduced from $375 million at June 30, 2015 to $350 million at September 30, 2015. This results in available credit lines of approximately $850 million, not including the $300 million accordion facility. On September 30, 2015, the Company amended its $1.2 billion Credit Facility to extend the maturity date from June 22, 2019 to June 22, 2020 and improve the pricing terms. On September 30 2015, a private placement of a $50 million, 10-year senior unsecured note (the \"Note\") with a maturity of September 30, 2025 was completed with Ressources Quebec, a subsidiary of Investissement Quebec. The Company has agreed to use the net proceeds from the issuance of the Note at its mining projects in the Province of Quebec. Total capital expenditures made by the Company in the third quarter of 2015 were $122.4 million, including $24.8 million at Meliadine, $19.7 million at Meadowbank, $15.1 million at LaRonde, $14.1 million at Kittila, $13.3 million at Goldex, $12.5 million at Pinos Altos, $9.3 million at Canadian Malartic (50% basis), $7.0 million at La India, $1.2 million at Creston Mascota and $1.1 million at Lapa. Total capital expenditures for the first nine months of 2015 were $316.8 million including $50.6 million at LaRonde, $47.4 million at Meadowbank, $44.6 million at Meliadine, $41.8 million at Pinos Altos, $38.4 million at Kittila, $35.3 million at Goldex, $29.8 million at Canadian Malartic (50% basis), $15.5 million at La India, $5.5 million at Lapa and $1.6 million at Creston Mascota. Total sustaining capital expenditures made by the Company in the third quarter were $72.0 million, including $19.5 million at Meadowbank, $15.1 million at LaRonde, $10.6 million at Kittila, $8.2 million at Canadian Malartic (50% basis), $7.0 million at La India, $6.7 million at Pinos Altos, $2.6 million at Goldex, $1.2 million at Creston Mascota and $1.1 million at Lapa. Total sustaining capital expenditures for the first nine months of 2015 were $214.7 million including $50.6 million at LaRonde, $47.2 million at Meadowbank, $30.7 million at Kittila, $28.0 million at Canadian Malartic (50% basis), $24.0 million at Pinos Altos, $15.5 million at La India, $11.6 million at Goldex, $5.5 million at Lapa, and $1.6 million at Creston Mascota. For 2015, capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $489.0 million, representing approximately a $50 million decrease from the previously announced figure. The decrease is primarily due to favourable currency movements and capital expenditure deferrals into future periods. The Company recorded an income and mining taxes recovery of $15.3 million on the consolidated statements of income for the third quarter of 2015. This was primarily a result of applying effective tax rates on a regional tax basis which were well in excess of the statutory tax rate based on IFRS tax calculation methodology. The Company continues to guide an effective tax rate range between 40% and 45% for 2015. Revised 2015 Guidance - Production Increased and Costs Lowered As a result of strong operational performance in the third quarter of 2015, production guidance for 2015 has been increased to approximately 1.65 million ounces of gold (previously 1.6 million ounces) with total cash costs on a by-product basis of approximately $590 to $610 per ounce (previously $600 to $620) and AISC of approximately $840 to $860 per ounce (previously $870 to $890). NORTHERN BUSINESS OPERATING REVIEW ABITIBI REGION, QUEBEC Agnico Eagle is currently Quebec's largest gold producer with a 100% interest in three mines (LaRonde, Goldex and Lapa) and a 50% interest in the Canadian Malartic mine. These mines are located within 50 kilometres of each other, which provides operating synergies and allows for the sharing of technical expertise. LaRonde Mine - Increased Production Driven by Higher Grades in Lower Mining Area, Phase 1 Commissioning of Coarse Ore Conveyor Underway The 100% owned LaRonde mine in northwestern Quebec achieved commercial production in 1988. The LaRonde mill processed an average of 5,992 tonnes per day (\"tpd\") in the third quarter of 2015, compared with an average of 4,634 tpd in the corresponding period of 2014. Throughput in the 2014 period was lower due to an approximate four week shutdown related to the upgrade and commissioning of the production and service hoist drives at the Penna shaft. Minesite costs per tonne4 were approximately C$101 in the third quarter of 2015, lower than the C$111 per tonne experienced in the third quarter of 2014. The higher costs in the 2014 period were primarily due to the scheduled shutdown noted above. For the first nine months of 2015, the LaRonde mill processed an average of 6,145 tpd, compared to 5,668 tpd in the first nine months of 2014. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$101, compared to C$100 per tonne in the first nine months of 2014. LaRonde's total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis were $558 in the third quarter of 2015 on payable production of 71,860 ounces of gold. This compares with the third quarter of 2014 when total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis were $861 on production of 37,490 ounces of gold. Production in the 2015 period increased as a result of higher throughput and higher gold grades (primarily from the 293 mining pyramid) compared to the 2014 period. Costs in the 2015 period were lower due to higher gold production (partially offset by lower by-product revenues) and favourable foreign exchange rates. In the first nine months of 2015, LaRonde produced 194,760 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $620 on a by-product basis. This is in contrast with the first nine months of 2014 when the mine produced 145,336 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $701 on a by-product basis. Production in the 2015 period was higher and costs were lower due to the factors mentioned above. During the quarter, work was completed on the installation of the coarse ore conveyor system that extends from the 293 level to the crusher on the 280 level. The first phase of commissioning involving the discharge point and rock breaker is underway. The ore pass feeding the rock breaker is expected to be commissioned in the first quarter of 2016. The new conveyor should help to improve mining flexibility and reduce congestion in the deeper portions of the mine. Studies are continuing to assess the potential to extend the mineral reserves and carry out mining activities between the 311 and 371 levels at LaRonde. At present, the mineral reserves extend to the 311 level, which is 3.1 kilometres below the surface. Drilling is ongoing to further expand the known mineral resource between the 311 and 341 levels. Additional holes are also being drilled to evaluate the extent of the mineralization down to the 371 level (a depth of 3.7 kilometres below the surface). Canadian Malartic Mine - New Quarterly Production Records Established In June 2014, Agnico Eagle and Yamana Gold Inc. (\"Yamana\") acquired all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Osisko Mining Corporation (\"Osisko\") and created the Canadian Malartic General Partnership (the \"Partnership\"). The partnership owns and operates the Canadian Malartic mine in northwestern Quebec through a joint management committee. Each of Agnico Eagle and Yamana has an indirect 50% ownership interest in the Partnership. Canadian Malartic had very strong operational performance in the third quarter of 2015. New records were set for quarterly tonnes milled (4.94 million tonnes), tonnes processed per day (53,703 tonnes), and ounces produced (153,206 ounces on a 100% basis). On September 22, 2015, the mine poured its two millionth ounce of gold. During the third quarter of 2015, the Canadian Malartic mill processed an average of 53,703 tpd (on a 100% basis) compared with an average of 52,539 tpd in the corresponding period of 2014. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$22 (C$19.32 excluding royalties) compared to the C$22 (C$19.60 excluding royalties) per tonne experienced in the third quarter of 2014. The costs in the 2015 period were in line with the costs in the 2014 period. Throughput was higher in the 2015 period due to improved crusher operating time. The average stripping ratio in the third quarter of 2015 was 2.04 to 1.0. For the first nine months of 2015, the Canadian Malartic mill processed an average of 52,139 tpd compared with an average of 50,580 tpd in the corresponding period of 2014 (on a 100% basis). Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$23 (C$19.72 excluding royalties) compared to the C$22 (C$19.42 excluding royalties) per tonne experienced in the corresponding period of 2014. The 2014 tonnage and costs are not considered to be representative as they only reflect the period of June 16 through September 30. For the third quarter of 2015, Agnico Eagle's share of production at the Canadian Malartic mine was 76,603 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $544 on a by-product basis. This compares with the third quarter of 2014 when total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis were $735 on production of 64,761 ounces of gold. Production was higher in the 2015 period due to increased mill throughput and higher grades. Costs in the 2015 period were lower due to increased production and favourable foreign exchange rates. In the first nine months of 2015, Agnico Eagle's share of production at the Canadian Malartic mine was 212,937 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $593 on a by-product basis. This is in contrast with production from June 16 to September 30, 2014 which only included 76,639 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $717 on a by-product basis from Canadian Malartic. The Partnership continues to work on initiatives to optimize the operations. Current opportunities include: Improving SAG mill and crusher liners to attempt to reduce the number of planned shutdowns to three per year (currently four per year). New liners were installed in Q3 2015 Improving gyratory crusher availability by redirecting ore containing scrap steel to a separate crusher Maintaining mining throughput levels at two million tonnes per month in the North zone (which contains higher grades) Acquiring an additional remote excavator for use in the North zone Adding two larger production drills which is expected reduce drilling costs Increasing rate of waste rock backfilling of the Gouldie pit which reduces haulage distances and noise Permitting activities for the Barnat Extension and deviation of Highway 117 are continuing. An Environmental Impact Assessment (\"EIA\") for this project was submitted in February 2015. An initial series of questions were received by the Partnership, and final responses were submitted in September 2015. A second round of questions from the government is expected to be received later in the fourth quarter of 2015. Public hearings are then expected to be held in the spring of 2016, with receipt of the necessary permits potentially by year-end 2016. In parallel, the Partnership is currently working on the permitting for improving the efficiency and environmental performance of the existing mobile crusher. At this point, milling levels are expected to be approximately 53,000 tpd through year-end 2016. In March 2015, the Partnership increased its interest in the Malartic CHL property to 100% by acquiring the remaining 30% interest from Abitibi Royalties Inc. The Malartic CHL property adjoins the Canadian Malartic mine to the east and hosts part of the Odyssey North discovery. At the end of the third quarter of 2015, 28 holes (24,537 metres) of drilling had been completed on the Odyssey zones. Drilling and data compilation will continue in the fourth quarter. Update on Pandora and Kirkland Lake Projects Canadian Malartic Corporation, a company in which each of Agnico Eagle and Yamana has an indirect 50% interest, is exploring a portfolio of properties in the Kirkland Lake area of Ontario and the Pandora property in the Abitibi region of Quebec. In the Kirkland Lake area, an internal technical study on the Upper Beaver property is being reviewed. Elsewhere in the region, compilation work is ongoing and a select number of targets are being drilled. At Pandora, underground development on the 101-W exploration drift from the adjacent Lapa mine commenced in February 2015 and approximately 691 metres of development was completed by the end of the third quarter of 2015. For the full year, approximately 940 metres of development is planned. In mid-June 2015, underground drilling resumed from the 101-W exploration drift and approximately half of the proposed 2015 program (approximately 7,000 metres) was completed by the end of the third quarter. The focus of the current exploration program is to test for extensions to the Branch zone and C zone on the Pandora property. Lapa - Zulapa Z7 Zone Continues to Deliver Higher Grades and Recoveries The 100% owned Lapa mine in northwestern Quebec achieved commercial production in May 2009. The Lapa circuit, located at the LaRonde mill, processed an average of 1,583 tpd in the third quarter of 2015. This compares with an average of 1,703 tpd in the third quarter of 2014. Throughput in the 2015 period was lower because of downtime related to repairs carried out on the Lapa ball mill. Repairs were completed in August 2015. During the repair time, excess ore was stockpiled and there is sufficient mill capacity that should allow the Company to meet its annual throughput rate (tonnes and ounces) over the balance of 2015. Minesite costs per tonne were C$114 in the third quarter of 2015, compared to the C$104 in the third quarter of 2014. Costs in the 2015 period were higher due to mining at deeper depths and lower throughput compared to the same period in 2014. For the first nine months of 2015, the Lapa mill processed an average of 1,553 tpd, compared to 1,747 tpd in the first nine months of 2014. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$119, above the C$106 per tonne in the first nine months of 2014 due to the reasons explained above. Payable production in the third quarter of 2015 was 25,668 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $522. This compares with the third quarter of 2014, when production was 24,781 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $606. In the 2015 period, production was higher primarily due to better recoveries (up 8.7%) related to a higher component of free gold in the Zulapa Z7 ore zone. Costs were lower primarily due to increased production and favourable foreign exchange rates. In the first nine months of 2015, Lapa produced 71,038 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $581 on a by-product basis. This compares to the first nine months of 2014 when the mine produced 67,011 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $689 on a by-product basis. The higher production and lower costs in the 2015 period are due to the reasons outlined above. At Lapa, 2015 is the last full year of production based on the current life of mine plan. Commercial production is forecast to end at the mine in the third quarter of 2016, but exploration activities (primarily on the Pandora property) are expected to continue. The permanent employees are expected to be relocated to the Company's other operations where they will replace contract positions. Studies are underway to evaluate other internal opportunities to utilize the Lapa mill, which is located at the LaRonde Metallurgical complex. Goldex - Development Rates Expected to Double by Year End; M Zone Yields Better Than Expected Grades The 100% owned Goldex mine in northwestern Quebec began operation in 2008 but mining operations in the original orebody, the Goldex Extension Zone (\"GEZ\"), were suspended in October 2011. In July 2012, the M and E satellite zones were approved for development. Mining operations resumed on the M and E satellite zones in September 2013. Mining operations at GEZ remain suspended. The Goldex mill processed an average of 6,199 tpd in the third quarter of 2015. This compares with an average of 5,851 tpd in the third quarter of 2014. The higher throughput in the 2015 period was due to more mature mining fronts and productivity improvements compared to the 2014 period. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$34 in the third quarter of 2015, which was slightly higher than the C$32 per tonne experienced in the third quarter of 2014. The increased cost in the 2015 period is primarily due to increased development in the M3 and M4 zones and extensions to the E Zone. For the first nine months of 2015, the Goldex mill processed an average of 6,377 tpd, compared to 5,647 tpd in the first nine months of 2014. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$34 in the first nine months of 2015 which is in line with C$33 in first nine months of 2014. Payable gold production in the third quarter of 2015 was 32,068 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $479. This compares with the third quarter of 2014, when production was 27,611 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $582. The higher production in the 2015 period was largely due to increased tonnage and better grades (especially in the M Zone) and higher recoveries. The decrease in total cash costs in the 2015 period was largely a result of increased production and favourable foreign exchange rates compared to the 2014 period. In the first nine months of 2015, Goldex produced 87,780 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $546 on a by-product basis. This compares to the first nine months of 2014 when the mine produced 70,970 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $661 on a by-product basis. The higher production and lower costs in the 2015 period are due to the same reasons as outlined above. In late July 2015, the Company announced production approval for the Goldex Deep 1 project (see July 29, 2015 news release). Mining will focus on the lower part of the Dx zone and the top of the D zone from a depth of 850 metres to 1,200 metres (level 120). The Company plans to undertake development from the current Goldex infrastructure, with existing equipment and personnel. The planned mining method is long-hole stoping with cemented paste backfill, which is the same method currently used at Goldex M & E zones. Gold production from the Goldex Deep 1 project is currently expected to average in excess of 100,000 ounces per year from 2018 through 2024. In the third quarter of 2015, approximately 1,462 metres of development were carried out in the Deep zone. The ramp has now reached Level 115 on its way to an ultimate depth of level 120. In addition, full restoration of the surface ramp is expected to be completed by the end of this year. This ramp will improve on the ability to move equipment and supplies from the surface into the underground workings. The advancement of the Deep 1 project at Goldex also has the potential to unlock other significant value creating opportunities including: Potential for additional mineral resource conversion in the Deep 1 zone Potential for mining at the Deep 2 (below level 120) Potential to develop the South zone (a narrow high-grade zone accessible via Deep 1 infrastructure) Potential development of the Akasaba West deposit, which is approximately 30 kilometres to the East of Goldex An EIA on the Akasaba West deposit was submitted during the quarter, which allows the environmental review process to commence. The Company anticipates the EIA approval in late 2017 or early 2018. FINLAND AND SWEDEN Agnico Eagle's Kittila mine in Finland is the largest primary gold producer in Europe and hosts the Company's largest mineral reserves. Exploration activities continue to expand the mineral resources and studies are underway to evaluate the potential to cost-effectively increase production. Kittila - Focus Remains On Optimizing Future Production Levels and Exploration Potential of the New Parallel Zone The 100% owned Kittila mine in northern Finland achieved commercial production in 2009. The Kittila mill processed an average of 3,937 tpd in the third quarter of 2015 compared to the 2,559 tpd in the third quarter of 2014. Throughput in the 2014 period was lower due to a planned shutdown to complete the mill expansion. Minesite costs per tonne at Kittila were approximately EUR72 in the third quarter of 2015, compared to EUR86 in the third quarter of 2014. Costs decreased in the third quarter of 2015 due to the increased throughput when compared with the 2014 period. For the first nine months of 2015, the Kittila mill processed an average of 3,981 tpd, compared to 2,895 tpd in the first nine months of 2014. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately EUR75 in the first nine months of 2015, compared to the EUR79 per tonne in the comparable 2014 period. Throughput was higher and costs were lower in the 2015 period due to the reasons outlined above. Since the expansion, the mill has shown potential to operate in excess of 4,000 tpd and efforts are ongoing to optimize throughput and recovery rates. In addition, the Company is also working to optimize underground mining rates and evaluate the potential to develop new mining areas. Unit costs are expected to decrease once steady state operations are achieved. Third quarter 2015 payable gold production at Kittila was 46,455 ounces with total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $639. In the third quarter of 2014, the mine produced 28,230 ounces at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $951. The higher production in the 2015 period is a result of the increased mill capacity compared to the 2014 period and the planned 2014 shutdown. Costs decreased in the third quarter of 2015 primarily due to increased production and a favourable foreign exchange rate. In the first nine months of 2015, Kittila produced 133,095 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $696 on a by-product basis. This is in contrast to the first nine months of 2014, when the mine produced 98,612 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $861 on a by-product basis. The lower cash costs in 2015 are mainly due to reasons described above. Drilling Extends New Parallel Zone at Kittila Previous drilling from the surface at Kittila has outlined a significant zone of deep mineralization at Rimpi with potentially wider widths and better grades than those currently being mined. The main underground ramp at Kittila is being extended to reach the Rimpi zone and a new surface ramp is also being developed to access the shallower portions of the Rimpi deposit. The surface ramp had advanced a total of 825 metres to 134 metres depth by the end of September. In April and July, the Company announced that drilling had encountered a mineralized lens east of the main Kittila ore zone, within the sheared and altered structure that hosts the known Kittila deposits (see April 30, 2015 and July 29, 2015 news releases). The intercepts lay within an area approximately 800 metres long north to south between 975 and 1,300 metres below surface, approximately 100 to 150 metres east of the main ore zone. These intercepts indicate a new parallel lens (now called the \"Sisar lens\" which in English means \"sister lens\"), that could extend upwards to a similar elevation as the main exploration ramp (currently at 800 metres depth) being driven towards Rimpi. This new lens could provide additional tonnage should further drilling outline an economic deposit. Two recent holes drilled from the exploration ramp have confirmed continuity within the Sisar lens. The table below shows the intercepts of the two new holes as well as those reported previously from the Sisar lens. Pierce points for all these holes are shown on the Kittila composite longitudinal section and two cross sections (500 metres apart). All intercepts reported for the Kittila mine show uncapped grades over estimated true widths, based on a current geological interpretation that is being updated as new information becomes available with further drilling.  midpoint below surface (metres) Estimated true width (metres) Gold grade (g/t) (uncapped)  Kittila composite longitudinal section Kittila composite cross sections - 7538000mN and 7538500mN Hole ROD15-703 intersected two lenses in the main zone and one in the Sisar lens. In the main ore zone, this hole intersected 14.3 g/t gold over 6.1 metres at 1,028 metres depth, and 5.8 g/t gold over 3.5 metres at 1,077 metres depth. The upper intercept verifies, widens and increases the grade of the probable reserves between the Suuri and Roura trends, while the lower one extends the mineralization to the north, and will help to convert future resources. The hole then intersected 8.1 g/t gold over 8.0 metres at 1,235 metres depth in the Sisar lens, approximately 150 metres east of the main ore zone, strongly confirming the continuity of the lens. This intercept is between two previously reported intercepts at approximately the same depth: it is approximately 116 metres north of hole ROU10-037 and 250 metres south of hole ROD14-003. At shallower depths and approximately 560 metres farther north, hole ROU15-600 intersected 5.5 g/t gold over 3.3 metres at 950 metres below surface, approximately 100 metres east of the main zone mineralization. This intercept is approximately 130 metres south of the previously reported intercept of hole ROU15-603. Additional holes have been drilled in the vicinity of the new Sisar lens intercepts, and assays are pending. A second underground deep drill rig is expected to start operating in the fourth quarter 2015 and carry on into 2016 to determine continuity and test for extensions of the Sisar lens. At the Kuotko deposit, located approximately 15 kilometres north of Kittila, drilling continues with a focus on infilling and expanding the existing inferred resource of approximately 170,000 ounces (1.8 million tonnes at 2.9 g/t gold). In addition, new mineralized zones have been identified outside of the known resource areas. Metallurgical testing is ongoing and unlike Kittila, the gold mineralization is free milling. Upon completion of the drilling, studies will be carried out to assess the viability of mining the deposit as a satellite open pit. Barsele Project - Drilling Now Underway on the Central Zone On June 11, 2015, Agnico Eagle acquired a 55% interest in the Barsele project in Sweden. The Company can earn an additional 15% interest in the project through the completion of a pre-feasibility study. The Barsele property is known to contain intrusive-hosted gold mineralization and gold-rich volcanogenic massive sulphide mineralization. In 2015, the Company plans to spend approximately $3.25 million on exploration to further evaluate the mineral potential of the property. In September 2015, trenching and mapping programs were carried out that confirmed that the known intrusive-hosted deposits plunge to the southeast. A 16-hole (9,300-metre) drill program commenced in early October to test the depth extension of the Central Zone to 400 to 500 metres below surface. NUNAVUT REGION With the Company's largest producing mine (Meadowbank) and two significant development assets and exploration projects (Meliadine and Amaruq) located in Nunavut, Agnico Eagle has the potential to build an operating platform that could have the ability to generate strong production and cash flows over several decades. Meadowbank - Increased Waste Stripping Capacity Provides Production Flexibility The 100% owned Meadowbank mine in Nunavut, northern Canada, achieved commercial production in March 2010. The Meadowbank mill processed an average of 10,824 tpd in the third quarter of 2015, compared to the 11,492 tpd achieved in the third quarter of 2014. Mill throughput levels were lower in the 2015 period due to a higher percentage of Vault ore processed which has a higher hardness factor, which has an impact on both the primary and secondary grinding circuit efficiency. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$72 in the third quarter of 2015, which compares to C$74 per tonne in the third quarter of 2014. The lower costs in the 2015 period were primarily due to an increase in capitalized versus expensed waste stripping compared to the respective 2014 period. For the first nine months of 2015, the Meadowbank mill processed an average of 11,009 tpd, compared to 11,365 tpd in the first nine months of 2014. Mill throughput levels were lower in the 2015 period primarily due to the reasons outlined above. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$72 in the first nine months of 2015, which was similar to the C$73 per tonne in the comparable 2014 period. Payable production in the third quarter of 2015 was 99,425 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $598. This compares with the third quarter of 2014 when 91,557 ounces were produced at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $777. The higher production in the 2015 period compared to the 2014 period was primarily due to the processing of higher grade ore (an increase of approximately 15%) and slightly better recoveries. Costs in the 2015 period were lower due to increased production and favourable foreign exchange rates. In the first nine months of 2015, Meadowbank produced 279,224 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $646 on a by-product basis. In the first nine months of 2014, the mine produced 366,162 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $561 on a by-product basis. The lower production (down 24%) in the 2015 period compared to the previous period was primarily due to processing fewer tonnes at lower grades and lower mill recoveries (down 2.3%). During the first six months of the 2014 period, the Company encountered ore grades that were higher than expected in both the Portage and Goose pits. In 2013, approximately 246,000 ounces were removed from mineral reserves at the Vault deposit due to a change in the gold price assumption used to calculate mineral reserves at December 31, 2013. Given the current US dollar to Canadian dollar foreign exchange rate (which yields favourable revenues and costs in Canadian dollar terms), lower fuel costs, and the growing significance of the Amaruq Project, the Company made a decision in July 2015 to proceed with the expansion of the Vault pit. With the expansion, the Meadowbank mine is now expected to be in production until the third quarter of 2018 (approximately one year longer than originally forecast). The extension of the Meadowbank mine life is expected to help bridge the production gap between the end of production at Meadowbank and the potential start of production at a satellite operation at Amaruq (not yet approved for construction). Amaruq Project - Drilling Expands Scope of Whale Tail Deposit; Positive Results from the V Zone Area; Phase Two Exploration Program Now Completed Agnico Eagle has a 100% interest in the Amaruq project. The large property consists of 114,761 hectares, approximately 50 kilometres northwest of the Meadowbank mine. In August 2015, the Company announced an updated inferred mineral resource estimate as of June 30, 2015 of 2.0 million ounces gold (9.7 million tonnes grading 6.47 g/t gold). The phase two drilling program for 2015 was completed in mid-October. Total drilling at Amaruq for the year was 108,000 metres (378 holes) completed. This release incorporates some of the drill results received since the last results were released on August 19, 2015. The latest drill results are from the main Whale Tail deposit including the east-plunging high-grade shoot and the former gap area between Whale Tail West and Mammoth Lake. As well, there are recent exploration drill results from the V zone. The 2016 drill program is expected to start in February. Phase Two Drill Results Continue to Expand Mineralized Zones The phase two 2015 drilling program at the Amaruq project began in July with several purposes, including step-out drilling to link Whale Tail and Mammoth Lake mineralization; testing the down-plunge extent of the ore shoot in the east of Whale Tail; and extending the I, V and R zones. Recent intercepts from the project are set out in the table below and the drill hole collars are located on the Amaruq project local geology map. The Whale Tail deposit pierce points are shown on the Whale Tail composite longitudinal section, while the coordinates from the V zone drill-hole collars are given in a second table. All intercepts reported for the Amaruq project show capped grades over estimated true widths, based on a preliminary geological interpretation that is being updated as new information becomes available with further drilling. Amaruq local geology map Whale Tail Deposit Composite Longitudinal Section Recent drilling has confirmed that the Whale Tail and Mammoth zones form a single mineralized system at least 2.3 kilometres long, between surface and locally to a depth of 450 metres. A new intercept lies in between several previously reported intercepts filling the former gap between Whale Tail and the Mammoth Lake mineralization. Hole AMQ15-450 yielded 4.5 g/t gold over 16.9 metres at 166 metres depth including 7.6 g/t gold over 6.7 metres. This area will continue to be investigated in 2016. The mineralized system remains open at depth and along strike. Drilling from the opposite direction (north to south) has enhanced the understanding of the geometry of the deposit. Within the Whale Tail deposit is a thickened higher-grade ore shoot that is at least one kilometre long. This cigar-shaped shoot extends from surface (Whale Tail West) plunging shallowly eastward to a depth of 380 metres (Whale Tail East). The ore shoot remains open. Six recent intercepts within this shoot, from west to east, are hole AMQ15-369 that intersected 8.4 g/t gold over 18.4 metres at 176 metres depth, hole AMQ15-463 that yielded 6.8 g/t gold over 29.7 metres at 293 metres depth, hole AMQ15-422 that intersected 5.7 g/t gold over 29.9 metres at 270 metres depth, hole AMQ15-442 that intersected 8.1 g/t gold over 12.9 metres at 296 metres depth, hole AMQ15-470 that intersected 6.9 g/t gold over 16.1 metres at 357 metres depth and hole AMQ15-444, which yielded two intercepts 6.3 g/t gold over 14.8 metres at 359 metres depth, and 5.8 g/t gold over 10.3 metres at 378 metres depth. (Note that holes AMQ15-369 and AMQ15-444 were drilled from the south.) The results described for the Whale Tail deposit are expected to have a positive impact on the size of the upcoming resources estimate for the Amaruq project. Recent drilling and mapping has shown that the V zone is a significant mineralized structure dipping shallowly to the southeast, with locally abundant visible gold. The structure has been identified from outcrop on surface to a depth of 155 metres in recent drilling; it remains open at depth and laterally. Hole AMQ15-390 intersected the structure yielding 30.1 g/t gold over 5.2 metres at 40 metres depth. Approximately 100 metres to the south of this intercept, hole AMQ15-461 yielded 7.9 g/t gold over 23.4 metres at 115 metres depth. Approximately 150 metres southwest of hole AMQ15-390 was a third high-grade intersection in the V zone: hole AMQ15-491 intersected 21.1 g/t gold over 3.6 metres at 155 metres depth. Other results from the V zone are included in the intercepts table above. These results will lead to a reinterpretation of the I, V, and R zones, which could have a positive impact on the year-end resource estimate. Although additional drilling will be required, the Company believes that the V zone could potentially be a second source of open pit ore at Amaruq. Engineering and environmental baseline studies are underway to support the permitting process for the Amaruq project as a satellite open pit operation to the Meadowbank mine. The most recent drilling at depth in Whale Tail also indicates that this deposit hosts high-grade intercepts below the preliminary ultimate pit shell, suggesting that Whale Tail has underground potential. An application to construct an all-weather access road between Meadowbank and the Amaruq site was filed in the first quarter of 2015 and is currently working its way through the Nunavut permitting process. Meliadine Project - License B Granted; Regional Land Holdings Expanded The Meliadine gold project was acquired in July 2010 and is the Company's largest development project based on mineral reserves and mineral resources. The Company has a 100% interest in the 111,757-hectare property, which is linked to the town of Rankin Inlet in Nunavut by a 25-kilometre all-weather access road. In March 2015, the Company completed and filed with Canadian securities regulators an updated National Instrument 43-101 (\"NI 43-101\") technical report on the Meliadine gold project. The updated technical study was based on extracting only the 3.3 million ounces of gold in proven and probable mineral reserves (13.9 million tonnes of ore at 7.44 g/t gold), which is all contained in the Tiriganiaq and Wesmeg deposits. The Meliadine property also hosts 3.3 million ounces of measured and indicated mineral resources (20.2 million tonnes at 5.06 g/t gold), and 3.5 million ounces of inferred mineral resources (14.1 million tonnes at 7.65 g/t gold). In addition, there are numerous other known gold occurrences in the 80-kilometre-long greenstone belt that require further evaluation. Internal studies are ongoing to evaluate the potential to extract additional ounces from the Tiriganiaq and Wesmeg/Normeg deposits, which could potentially extend the mine life, improve the project economics, and increase the after-tax internal rate of return. These studies are expected to be completed in the first half of 2016. At the end of the third quarter of 2015, approximately 1,960 metres of underground development had been completed, and additional underground equipment has been transported to site to complete the 2015 plan that calls for total underground development of approximately 2,500 metres. This development will allow for more cost-effective exploration and conversion drilling of the deeper parts of the Tiriganiaq and Wesmeg/Normeg deposits and help to optimize potential mining plans. On July 13, 2015, the Kivalliq Inuit Association and Agnico Eagle signed the Inuit Impact Benefit Agreement (\"IIBA\") for the Meliadine gold project. The IIBA addresses protection of Inuit values, culture and language, protection of the land, water and wildlife, provides financial compensation to Inuit over the mine life, and contains provision for training, Inuit employment and contracting. On October 5, 2015, the Nunavut Water Board issued the permit (License B) for Meliadine pre-development work. License A, which is required for production activities, is expected to be granted in the second quarter of 2016. The timing of future capital expenditures on the Meliadine project beyond 2015 and the determination of whether to build a mine at Meliadine are subject to approval by Agnico Eagle's Board of Directors, which will be based on prevailing market conditions and outcomes of the various potential scenarios being evaluated. Acquisition of New Properties in Nunavut Agnico Eagle is currently studying options and alternatives in Nunavut to capitalize on the large and growing mineral resource in the region. As part of this initiative, the Company has recently staked claims totaling 68,012 hectares on properties to the west-northwest of the project, on the continuation of the greenstone belt that hosts the Meliadine deposits. This summer, an airborne VTEM magnetic and electromagnetic survey was flown over the new properties. A field crew initiated prospecting and sampling of areas with geophysical signatures typical of iron formation-hosted Archean/Proto-Proterozoic deposits, similar to those recognized at Meadowbank, Amaruq and Meliadine projects. Close to 800 rock samples have been collected from the properties. Initial results have identified a 2-kilometre-long structure from which 21 rock samples returned values above 1.0 g/t gold including seven values in excess of 10.0 g/t gold, with a maximum value of 42.0 g/t gold. The new properties appear to be geologically similar to the Meadowbank, Meliadine and Amaruq projects where our exploration team has demonstrated the effectiveness of a systematic exploration approach and the strong mineral potential of this part of Nunavut. Assembling and analyzing the data collected this summer will assist in preparing a drill program for 2016 to further investigate the higher potential areas on the new properties. SOUTHERN BUSINESS OPERATING REVIEW Agnico Eagle's southern business operations are focused in Mexico. These operations have been the source of growing precious metals production (gold and silver), stable operating costs and strong free cash flow since 2009. Pinos Altos - Strong Performance Driven by Higher Mill Throughput and Grades The 100% owned Pinos Altos mine in northern Mexico achieved commercial production in November 2009. The Pinos Altos mill processed 5,403 tpd in the third quarter of 2015, compared to 5,040 tpd processed in the third quarter of 2014. During the third quarter of 2015, approximately 49,300 tonnes of ore were stacked on the leach pad at Pinos Altos, compared to 143,500 tonnes in the comparable 2014 period. Minesite costs per tonne at Pinos Altos were $48 in the third quarter of 2015, which is in line with $48 in the third quarter of 2014. Although minesite costs per tonne are unchanged on a year-over-year basis, these costs are subject to variations in the proportion of heap leach ore to milled ore and open pit ore to underground ore, currency exchange rates and routine movements in the waste to ore stripping ratio in the open pit mines. For the first nine months of 2015, the Pinos Altos mill processed an average of 5,638 tpd, compared to 5,311 tpd processed in the first nine months of 2014. Approximately 238,500 tonnes of ore were stacked on the Pinos Altos leach pad during the first nine months of 2015, compared to 436,800 tonnes in the prior year period. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately $46 compared to $48 per tonne in the first nine months of 2014 with variance due to the proportion of heap leach to mill ore and the proportion of underground ore to open pit, variations in the proportion of waste to ore mined and variations in the currency exchange rate. Payable production in the third quarter of 2015 was 47,725 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $392. This compares with production of 41,155 ounces at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $545 in the third quarter of 2014. Higher production in 2015 is largely due to higher mill throughput and higher grades processed over the comparable prior year period. The decrease in the year over year total cash costs per ounce is largely due to increased gold production and higher silver production (offset in part, by a decline in realized silver prices) and favourable foreign exchange rates compared to the prior year period. In the first nine months of 2015, Pinos Altos produced 148,478 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $378 on a by-product basis. This is in contrast to the first nine months of 2014 when the mine produced 130,350 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $513 on a by-product basis. The lower cash costs in the first nine months of 2015 are primarily due to favourable foreign exchange rates and higher gold and silver production compared to the prior year period. The Pinos Altos shaft-sinking project remains on schedule for completion in 2016. The shaft is currently at a depth of approximately 573 metres, and activities during the third quarter of 2015 focused on the development of loading stations on levels 27 and 28. When the shaft is completed (final depth of approximately 603 metres), it will allow better matching of the mill capacity with the future mining capacity at Pinos Altos once the open pit mining operation begins to wind down, as planned over the next several years. The Company continues to evaluate a number of regional satellite opportunities. A 6,000-metre in-fill and conversion drill program on the Sinter deposit is 95% complete with assays still pending from about 50% of the holes. Results received to date indicate that there is good potential to add this deposit to the Pinos Altos mine plan beginning in 2020. Creston Mascota Deposit at Pinos Altos - Initial In-pit Drilling Results Indicate Potential to Extend Mine Life The Creston Mascota deposit at Pinos Altos has been operating as a satellite operation to the Pinos Altos mine since late 2010. Approximately 434,300 tonnes of ore were stacked on the Creston Mascota leach pad during the third quarter of 2015, compared to approximately 469,200 tonnes stacked in the third quarter of 2014. In the 2015 period, fewer tonnes were stacked mainly due to the adverse impact of the rainy season on roads, loading and dumping zones, and the crushing circuit. Minesite costs per tonne at Creston Mascota were $14 in the third quarter of 2015, compared to $17 in the third quarter of 2014. Costs in the 2015 period were lower due to currency fluctuations, lower fuel consumption and reduced power requirements compared to the 2014 period. For the first nine months of 2015, approximately 1,569,800 tonnes of ore were stacked on the Creston Mascota leach pad, compared to 1,242,900 tonnes in the prior year period. In the 2015 period, additional ore was encountered outside the block model, which resulted in more tonnes being stacked in the first half of the year compared to the 2014 period. For the first nine months of 2015, mine site costs per tonne at Creston Mascota were $12, compared to $17 per tonne in the first nine months of 2014. Costs were lower in the 2015 period due to more tonnes stacked and the other reasons outlined above. Payable gold production at Creston Mascota in the third quarter of 2015 was 12,716 ounces at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $436. This compares to 13,377 ounces at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $556 during the third quarter of 2014. Production was lower in the 2015 period due to fewer tonnes stacked, compared to the 2014 period. Cash costs were lower in the 2015 period based on lower minesite costs per tonne (see above), increased silver production (partially offset by a lower realized silver price) and a favourable foreign exchange rate compared to the 2014 period. Payable gold production for the first nine months of 2015 was 40,770 ounces at total cash costs per ounce of $425 on a by-product basis. This compares to 34,853 ounces at total cash costs per ounce of $587 on a by-product basis in the first nine months of 2014. The higher production in the 2015 period was due to more tonnes being stacked (especially in the first half of 2015) compared to the 2014 period. The lower costs in the 2015 period are due to higher gold production, increased silver production (partially offset by a lower realized silver price) and a favourable foreign exchange rate compared to the 2014 period. In the third quarter of 2015, preparation and top soil recovery at the Phase IV heap leach pad were completed. The earthworks have been initiated, with commissioning expected by year-end 2015. Over its mine life, Creston Mascota has added approximately 50% (179,000 ounces of contained gold) to its mineral reserves through infill drilling and improved geological understanding. In April 2015, higher grade mineralization was encountered at the bottom of the pit and outside the Creston Mascota block model. An infill drill program was completed in the third quarter of 2015 with encouraging results, and the interpretation of drill hole assays is ongoing. In September 2015, a 3,500-metre infill and conversion drill program commenced on the Bravo satellite zone. This program is expected to be completed by year-end 2015. The results of recent infill drilling in the pit and the potential of nearby satellite deposits such as Bravo could extend the projected life of the Creston Mascota operations beyond 2018. La India - New Record Set for Quarterly Gold Production The La India mine property in Sonora, Mexico, located approximately 70 kilometres from the Company's Pinos Altos mine, was acquired in November 2011 through the purchase of Grayd Resources, which held a 56,000-hectare land position in the Mulatos Gold belt. Commissioning of the mine commenced ahead of schedule in the third quarter of 2013 and commercial production was declared as of February 1, 2014. Approximately 1,193,900 tonnes of ore were stacked on the La India leach pad during the third quarter of 2015, compared to approximately 1,190,100 tonnes stacked in the third quarter of 2014. Minesite costs per tonne at La India were $11 in the third quarter of 2015, compared to the $10 in the third quarter of 2014. The increase in minesite costs reflect slightly higher maintenance costs and cyanide consumption (due to the rainy season) partially offset by lower costs for fuel and labour, and favourable foreign exchange rates. In the first nine months of 2015, approximately 3,931,900 tonnes of ore were stacked on the La India leach pad, compared to approximately 3,346,500 stacked in the first nine months of 2014. Minesite costs per tonne at La India were $9 in the first nine months of 2015, compared to the $8 in the first nine months of 2014. Tonnage stacked in the 2014 period was lower given that the operation was still ramping up to full capacity. The slightly higher costs in the 2015 period are primarily due to the reasons outlined above. Payable gold production at La India in the third quarter of 2015 was 28,604 ounces at total cash costs per ounce of $436 on a by-product basis were. Production in the third quarter of 2014 was 20,311 ounces at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $547. Production in the 2015 period was positively impacted by rain flushing residual ounces from the heaps and significantly higher ore grades placed on the heaps than planned. Total cash costs in the 2015 period were favourably impacted by higher production volumes and favourable foreign exchange rates. For the first nine months of 2015, La India produced 80,930 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $422 on a by-product basis. This compares to 51,820 ounces at total cash costs per ounce of $483 on a by-product basis in the first nine months of 2014. The higher production and lower costs in the 2015 period are primarily due to the reasons outlined above. During the third quarter of 2015, construction activities on the heap leach expansion were negatively affected by the extraordinary rains during the period. However, any delays related to the rains are not expected to affect future production plans or capital costs. Approximately 77% of the earthworks have been finished with full completion expected later in the fourth quarter of 2015. This leach pad expansion will provide the capacity for the current planned life-of-mine production at La India and approximately 5.0 million tonnes of additional stacking. Construction of the Main Zone haul road was completed during the third quarter of 2015. In the third quarter of 2015, several activities were undertaken to improve the La India block model and potentially expand the mineral reserves and mineral resource. Infill drilling and favourable reconciliation data from the first full year of mining have led to an improved geological model for the Main Zone oxides. In addition, ongoing metallurgical investigations and field-proven production experience with the North Zone sulphides have shown that some of the transition and sulphide material in the Main Zone and La India Zone may also be amenable to heap leaching. Inclusion of sulphide material into the pit designs at the La India mine has the potential to add further oxides as well as sulphides into the year-end 2015 mineral reserve and mineral resource estimate expected to be reported in mid-February 2016. Any additions could potentially extend the mine life beyond 2020. El Barqueno - Drilling Continues with a Focus on Resource Delineation and Defining New Target Areas Agnico Eagle has a 100% interest in the El Barqueno project. The 32,840-hectare property is in the Guachinango gold-silver mining district, Jalisco State, Mexico, approximately 150 kilometres west of the state capital of Guadalajara. It consists of three blocks of land: the original El Barqueno package (El Barqueno I, II and III) acquired from Cayden Resources in November 2014, and two adjacent blocks acquired from Soltoro Limited in June 2015 (El Rayo and El Tecolote). The Company last reported exploration results from this project in a news release dated September 21, 2015. The El Barqueno project contains a number of known mineralized zones and several prospects that require further evaluation. There are currently 10 drill rigs working to define the limits of the Azteca-Zapoteca, Angostura and Pena de Oro prospects, and delineate an initial mineral resource estimate for these deposits. Several other prospects are also under evaluation. An additional drill rig is testing the Zapote-Mixteca prospect, which has been shown to be gold-bearing by recent rock sample and trench results. To the end of the third quarter, 171 holes (42,940 metres) had been drilled. Drilling will continue at El Barqueno until the end of the year. The Company expects that this drilling will lead to the estimation of an initial inferred mineral resource at the Azteca-Zapoteca, Angostura and Pena de Oro areas to open-pit mineable depths. The resources are expected to be reported in mid-February 2016. Conceptual design studies and additional metallurgical testing are underway at El Barqueno. The project may host gold-silver deposits that could potentially be developed into a series of open pits utilizing heap leach processing, similar to Creston Mascota and the La India mine. While it is too early to estimate the extent of the mineral resources and the number of deposits with economic potential at El Barqueno, the Company already has the experience of developing cost-efficient mining operations in Mexico, and increasing their size through successful exploration as well as metallurgical innovation. This body of knowledge will be applied as El Barqueno continues to be explored and studied. Exploration expenditures at El Barqueno in 2015 are currently expected to total approximately $22 million. Quarterly Dividend Declared Agnico Eagle's Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.08 per common share, payable on December 15, 2015 to shareholders of record as of December 1, 2015. Agnico Eagle has declared a cash dividend every year since 1983. Dividend Reinvestment Plan Please follow the link below for information on the Company's dividend reinvestment program. Dividend Reinvestment Plan About Agnico Eagle Agnico Eagle is a senior Canadian gold mining company that has produced precious metals since 1957. Its eight mines are located in Canada, Finland and Mexico, with exploration and development activities in each of these countries as well as in the United States and Sweden. The Company and its shareholders have full exposure to gold prices due to its long-standing policy of no forward gold sales. Agnico Eagle has declared a cash dividend every year since 1983. Note Regarding Certain Measures of Performance This news release discloses certain measures, including ''total cash costs per ounce'' and ''minesite costs per tonne'', \"all-in sustaining costs per ounce\" and \"adjusted net income\" that are not recognized measures under IFRS. These data may not be comparable to data presented by other gold producers. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable financial information presented in the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS and for an explanation of how management uses these measures, other than adjusted net income, see \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Performance Measures\" below. The total cash costs per ounce of gold produced is presented on both a by-product basis (deducting by-product metal revenues from production costs) and co-product basis (before by-product metal revenues). The total cash costs per ounce of gold produced on a by-product basis is calculated by adjusting production costs as recorded in the consolidated statements of income (loss) for by-product revenues, unsold concentrate inventory production costs, smelting, refining and marketing charges and other adjustments, and then dividing by the number of ounces of gold produced. The total cash costs per ounce of gold produced on a co-product basis is calculated in the same manner as the total cash costs per ounce of gold produced on a by-product basis except that no adjustment is made for by-product metal revenues. Accordingly, the calculation of total cash costs per ounce of gold produced on a co-product basis does not reflect a reduction in production costs or smelting, refining and marketing charges associated with the production and sale of by-product metals. The total cash costs per ounce of gold produced is intended to provide information about the cash-generating capabilities of the Company's mining operations. Management also uses these measures to monitor the performance of the Company's mining operations. As market prices for gold are quoted on a per ounce basis, using the total cash costs per ounce of gold produced on a by-product basis measure allows management to assess a mine's cash-generating capabilities at various gold prices. All-in sustaining costs are used to show the full cost of gold production from current operations. The Company calculates all-in sustaining costs per ounce of gold produced as the aggregate of total cash costs on a by-product basis, sustaining capital expenditures (including capitalized exploration), general and administrative expenses (including stock options) and reclamation expenses divided by the amount of gold produced. The all-in sustaining costs per ounce of gold produced on a co-product basis is calculated in the same manner as the total cash costs per ounce of gold produced on a by-product basis except that no adjustment is made for by-product metal revenues. The Company's methodology for calculating all-in sustaining costs may differ from to the methodology used by other producers that disclose all-in sustaining costs. The Company may change the methodology it uses to calculate all-in sustaining costs in the future, including in response to the adoption of formal industry guidance regarding this measure by the World Gold Council. Management is aware that these per ounce measures of performance can be affected by fluctuations in exchange rates, and, in the case of total cash costs per ounce of gold produced on a by-product basis, by-product metal prices. Management compensates for these inherent limitations by using these measures in conjunction with minesite costs per tonne (discussed below) as well as other data prepared in accordance with IFRS. Management also performs sensitivity analyses in order to quantify the effects of fluctuating exchange rates and metal prices. This news release also contains information as to estimated future total cash costs per ounce, all-in sustaining costs and minesite costs per tonne. The estimates are based upon the total cash costs per ounce, all-in sustaining costs and minesite costs per tonne that the Company expects to incur to mine gold at its mines and projects and, consistent with the reconciliation of these actual costs referred to above, do not include production costs attributable to accretion expense and other asset retirement costs, which will vary over time as each project is developed and mined. It is therefore not practicable to reconcile these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable IFRS measure.

The scientific and technical information relating to Agnico Eagle's mineral reserves and mineral resources contained herein has been approved by Daniel Doucet, Senior Corporate Director, Reserve Development, Ing., and a qualified person as defined by NI 43-101. Cautionary Note To U.S. Investors - The SEC permits U.S. mining companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose only those mineral deposits that a company can economically and legally extract or produce. Agnico Eagle reports mineral resource and reserve mineral estimates in accordance with the CIM guidelines for the estimation, classification and reporting of mineral resources and mineral reserves in accordance with the Canadian securities regulatory authorities' NI 43-101. These standards are similar to those used by the SEC's Industry Guide No. 7, as interpreted by Staff at the SEC (\"Guide 7\"). However, the definitions in NI 43-101 differ in certain respects from those under Guide 7. Accordingly, mineral reserve information contained herein may not be comparable to similar information disclosed by U.S. companies. Under the requirements of the SEC, mineralization may not be classified as a \"reserve\" unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically and legally produced or extracted at the time the mineral reserve determination is made. A \"final\" or \"bankable\" feasibility study is required to meet the requirements to designate mineral reserves under Industry Guide 7. Agnico Eagle uses certain terms in this news release, such as \"measured\", \"indicated\", and \"inferred\", and \"resources\" that the SEC guidelines strictly prohibit U.S. registered companies from including in their filings with the SEC. In prior periods, mineral reserves for all properties were typically estimated using historic three-year average metals prices and foreign exchange rates in accordance with the SEC guidelines. These guidelines require the use of prices that reflect current economic conditions at the time of mineral reserve determination, which the Staff of the SEC has interpreted to mean historic three-year average prices. Given the current lower commodity price environment, Agnico Eagle has decided to use price assumptions that are below the three-year averages. The assumptions used for the mineral reserves estimates at all mines and advanced projects as of December 31, 2014 (other than the Canadian Malartic mine), reported by the Company on February 11, 2015, are $1,150 per ounce gold, $18.00 per ounce silver, $1.00 per pound zinc, $3.00 per pound copper, $0.91 per pound lead and C$/US$, US$/Euro and MXP/US$ exchange rates of 1.08, 1.30 and 13.00, respectively. For the mineral reserves estimate at the Canadian Malartic mine, the Company has decided to continue to report the mineral reserves estimated as of June 15, 2014, reported by the Company in a news release dated August 13, 2014, minus the production to the end of 2014. The assumptions used were $1,300 per ounce gold, a cut-off grade between 0.28 g/t and 0.35 g/t gold (depending on the deposit), and a C$/US$ exchange rate of 1.10. NI 43-101 requires mining companies to disclose mineral reserves and mineral resources using the subcategories of \"proven\" mineral reserves, \"probable\" mineral reserves, \"measured\" mineral resources, \"indicated\" mineral resources and \"inferred\" mineral resources. Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. A mineral reserve is the economically mineable part of a measured and/or indicated mineral resource. It includes diluting materials and allowances for losses, which may occur when the material is mined or extracted and is defined by studies at pre-feasibility or feasibility level as appropriate that include application of modifying factors. Such studies demonstrate that, at the time of reporting, extraction could reasonably be justified. Modifying factors are considerations used to convert mineral resources to mineral reserves. These include, but are not restricted to, mining, processing, metallurgical, infrastructure, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental factors. A proven mineral reserve is the economically mineable part of a measured mineral resource. A proven mineral reserve implies a high degree of confidence in the modifying factors. A probable mineral reserve is the economically mineable part of an indicated and, in some circumstances, a measured mineral resource. The confidence in the modifying factors applying to a probable mineral reserve is lower than that applying to a proven mineral reserve. A mineral resource is a concentration or occurrence of solid material of economic interest in or on the Earth's crust in such form, grade or quality and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade or quality, continuity and other geological characteristics of a mineral resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge, including sampling. A measured mineral resource is that part of a mineral resource for which quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics are estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the application of modifying factors to support detailed mine planning and final evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. Geological evidence is derived from detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing and is sufficient to confirm geological and grade or quality continuity between points of observation. An indicated mineral resource is that part of a mineral resource for which quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics are estimated with sufficient confidence to allow the application of modifying factors in sufficient detail to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. Geological evidence is derived from adequately detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing and is sufficient to assume geological and grade or quality continuity between points of observation. An inferred mineral resource is that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of limited geological evidence and sampling. Geological evidence is sufficient to imply but not verify geological and grade or quality continuity. Investors are cautioned not to assume that part or all of an inferred mineral resource exists, or is economically or legally mineable. A feasibility study is a comprehensive technical and economic study of the selected development option for a mineral project that includes appropriately detailed assessments of applicable modifying factors together with any other relevant operational factors and detailed financial analysis that are necessary to demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that extraction is reasonably justified (economically mineable). The results of the study may reasonably serve as the basis for a final decision by a proponent or financial institution to proceed with, or finance, the development of the project. The confidence level of the study will be higher than that of a Pre-Feasibility Study. Agrium Inc. (TSE: AGU) Our vision to help feed the world responsibly means not only helping farmers grow more food, but doing it in ways that protect the environment, support economic vitality and enhance communities. One of the greatest challenges the global community has ever faced is how to sustainably feed a rapidly growing population. This challenge is complex and won't be solved quickly, but we believe we're stronger working together. By collaborating with multiple groups, we build long-term, impactful programs and solutions that we continually learn from and build upon. So that, together, we can feed the world responsibly and improve the lives of future generations. Agrium Reports Solid Third Quarter and Expects Strong Fall Crop Input Demand CALGARY, ALBERTA--(Marketwired - Nov. 5, 2015) - ALL AMOUNTS ARE STATED IN U.S.$ Agrium Inc. (TSX:AGU) (NYSE:AGU) announced today 2015 third quarter net earnings from continuing operations of $99-million ($0.72 diluted earnings per share), compared to $91-million ($0.63 diluted earnings per share) in the third quarter of 2014. The increased net earnings are due to higher sales volumes of Wholesale nutrients combined with lower production costs in the Wholesale business unit, while Retail's earnings were similar to the prior year, despite weaker market conditions. Highlights: Third quarter adjusted net earnings of $97-million or $0.71 per share and $5.73 per share year to date in 2015 on the same basis (see page 2 for adjusted net earnings reconciliation)1. Wholesale's results were boosted by nitrogen and potash performance, which saw higher volumes and lower costs, leading to an improvement in gross profit, despite lower nutrient prices. Agrium achieved 94 percent ammonia capacity utilization in the third quarter, exceeding the 90 percent target rate. The Canpotex proving run is well underway at our Vanscoy potash facility and is progressing as expected. Retail EBITDA2 in the U.S. and Australia were higher than the same quarter last year reflecting Operational Excellence initiatives. Total Retail EBITDA of $129-million for the quarter was in line with the prior year, despite the impact of drought conditions in the Canadian business. Agrium has repurchased 5.6 million shares since the beginning of April under its current Normal Course Issuer Bid. 2015 annual guidance range has been narrowed to $7.10 to $7.40 diluted earnings per share (see page 3 for further details). \"Agrium's performance this quarter is another demonstration of the resilience of our business model. We focused on what we can control, improving our on-stream Wholesale performance and optimizing our distribution network and effectively managing costs in Retail, all of which helped drive a 9 percent increase in earnings over the same period last year despite prevailing market headwinds,\" commented Chuck Magro, Agrium's President and CEO. \"We see strong crop input demand during the fall application season which is now in full swing and we are confident that our strategy and business structure can continue to deliver value to all our shareholders,\" added Mr. Magro. Forecasted annual effective tax rate of 27.5 percent used for adjusted net earnings and per share calculations. These are non-IFRS measures which represent net earnings adjusted for certain income (expenses) that are considered to be non-operational in nature. We believe these measures provide meaningful comparison to the earnings of other companies by eliminating share-based payments expense (recovery), gains (losses) on foreign exchange, gains (losses) on non-qualifying derivative hedges and significant non-operating, non-recurring items. These should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS and may not be directly comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Earnings (loss) from continuing operations before finance costs, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. This is a non-IFRS measure. Refer to section \"Additional IFRS and Non-IFRS Financial Measures\" in the Management's Discussion and Analysis. MARKET OUTLOOK For the third consecutive year, favorable growing conditions have contributed to above-trend global grain yields. Even in geographies which faced challenging conditions early in the growing season, such as parts of the U.S. Corn Belt and Western Canada, yield prospects have come in stronger than anticipated. Despite historically high production, the outlook for grains is more positive than it was a year ago and as of the end of October 2015, cash corn prices were more than 10 percent above 2014 levels, although oilseed prices are lower year-over-year. Excluding China, the global grain stocks to use ratio is projected to decline to the lowest level since 2012/13 and the U.S. corn supply/demand balance is projected to tighten. As a result of projected lower 2015/16 U.S. corn ending stocks, analysts project that U.S. corn area will increase in 2016. We expect normal North American crop nutrient application rates in the 2015/16 fertilizer year and expect that fall demand in 2015 will improve relative to 2014 levels as harvest progress is significantly ahead of last year, supporting a wider application window than the short 2014 season. In addition, we expect the overall planted acreage and crop mix to support increased crop nutrient demand. The devaluation of most non-U.S. currencies over the past year has negatively impacted crop input demand and U.S. dollar prices. While growers in most market driven non-U.S. regions have realized a net benefit from lower local currency values due to improved local currency crop prices, crop nutrient prices in local currencies have increased significantly in some cases, which has been negative for demand. Currency devaluations have directly impacted crop nutrient demand and prices in Brazil and India. In Brazil, higher local prices, combined with lending constraints have negatively impacted import demand, however, downstream inventories have been drawn down to meet farm-level demand. In India, the devaluation of the rupee has pressured phosphate prices in order to be economical under the subsidy regime, while Indian buyers have delayed execution on some contracted potash volumes. Globally, the downstream distribution network has been drawing on nutrient inventories to meet grower demand and purchasing on a just-in-time basis, which has led to relatively slow demand for all products. This has been the case in the U.S. urea market, as offshore imports of urea are estimated to be down 19 percent through the end of October 2015. The urea market has also been under pressure due to the combination of the devaluation of the Chinese yuan and lower anthracite coal prices, which have lowered the marginal cost of production. Chinese production levels in September in 2015 declined by 6 percent from August levels as a result of these market pressures and are expected to drop through the remainder of the year. Similarly for potash, strong shipments of potash in 2014 and the first half of 2015 allowed downstream inventories to increase. Buyers have been drawing upon these inventories in the second half of 2015, and prices have declined as spot sales volumes have declined. We expect pent-up demand to emerge late as fall applications occur and downstream inventories are drawn down. Similar to nitrogen and potash, phosphate demand has been slow in recent months, which has led to a reduction in phosphate production by some major producers. UPDATED ANNUAL 2015 GUIDANCE Based on our Market Outlook, Agrium expects to achieve annual diluted earnings per share of $7.10 to $7.40 in 2015 compared to our previous estimate of $7.00 to $7.50 per share. We have narrowed the guidance range but maintained a range width encompassing approximately $60-million of EBITDA variability to reflect the risk and opportunity associated with weather conditions and fall season length. We are assuming a normal fall season, recognizing there is always a risk that an early onset of inclement weather could bring an early close to the season. We have lowered the high-end and narrowed our anticipated Retail EBITDA range to $1.00-billion to $1.03-billion because of the impact of drought and lower crop prices on our Canadian operations in 2015. Our annual nitrogen production target remains unchanged. We narrowed our potash production range to 1.95 million tonnes to 2.05 million tonnes for 2015. We have updated the range for our annual effective tax rate for 2015 to 27 percent to 28 percent to reflect the anticipated geographic split of our global income. Our estimates of the Canada and U.S. foreign exchange rates and NYMEX for 2015 have been narrowed from our previous estimates based on current market conditions. This guidance and updated additional measures and related assumptions are summarized in the table below. Guidance excludes the impact of share-based payments expense (recovery), gains (losses) on foreign exchange and non-qualifying derivative hedges and significant non-operating, non-recurring items.

Wholesale's sales volumes increased for all three crop nutrients for the third quarter and for nitrogen and phosphate for the first nine months of 2015 primarily as a result of higher operating rates. Realized selling prices for the third quarter decreased as a result of weaker market conditions but overall our average selling price increased for the first nine months of 2015. Product purchased for resale contributed to the decrease in sales as Agrium exited portions of this business. Wholesale's gross profit significantly increased due to lower natural gas input costs, manufacturing cost efficiencies and as a result of higher nitrogen, potash and phosphate volumes produced for the third quarter and first nine months of 2015 compared to the same periods last year. Retail's sales and gross profit decreased for the third quarter and first nine months of 2015 compared to the same periods last year primarily due to unfavorable weather conditions and competitive pricing pressure as a result of lower crop prices which impacted most of our product lines' sales and margins. Expenses General and administrative expense decreased by $9-million (13 percent) for the third quarter and $27-million (12 percent) for the first nine months of 2015 compared to the same periods last year as a result of reduced payroll and office expense costs as we continue to realize reductions related to our Operational Excellence program. Share-based Payments We had a share-based payment recovery of $15-million this quarter compared to a share-based payment expense of $10-million for the third quarter last year due primarily to the decrease in our share price. As a result of our higher average share price for the first nine months of 2015, our share-based payments expense increased by $11-million compared to the same period last year. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased for the third quarter and first nine months of 2015 due to the change in our method of depreciation from the straight-line basis to the units-of-production basis for our Vanscoy potash facility mining and milling assets at the beginning of 2015 and our reassessment of the useful lives of our property, plant and equipment in our Retail business unit in the fourth quarter of 2014 to reflect our expectations on the estimated future economic benefits of our property, plant and equipment. In the first nine months of 2015, other expenses decreased by $8-million due to the following: Gains of $33-million were recognized on natural gas derivatives in the first nine months of 2014 and were recorded directly to other expenses. 2015 did not have comparable results, as starting January 1, 2015, we began to designate all of our natural gas derivatives as qualifying hedges for accounting purposes and the related gains or losses are recorded as part of cost of product sold when we sell the related product while unrealized gains or losses are recorded in equity. We completed the sale of our Niota and Meredosia storage and distribution facilities in the first quarter of 2015 resulting in a gain on sale of purchase for resale assets of $38-million. Effective Tax Rate The effective tax rate on continuing operations of 27 percent for the third quarter is higher than the tax rate of 18 percent in the comparative quarter in 2014 (excluding the effect of the recognition of a previously unrecognized tax benefit of $29-million) because of higher earnings in higher taxed jurisdictions. The effective tax rate of 29 percent for the first nine months of 2015 is higher than the rate of 27 percent for the same period last year (excluding the effect of the recognition of a previously unrecognized tax benefit) due to the increase in the Alberta provincial statutory tax rate. BUSINESS SEGMENT PERFORMANCE Retail sales and gross profit during the quarter were lower than the same period last year due to generally lower crop input prices, weaker non-U.S. currency exchange rates and dry weather conditions in our international and Canadian operations. Regionally, the U.S. EBITDA contribution was up approximately 4 percent over the same period last year. Australia reported a 40 percent increase in EBITDA, due mostly to a focused effort in reducing overall operating costs. Canada and South America EBITDA declined as poor growing conditions hampered demand for all crop inputs. Retail selling expenses as a percentage of sales were marginally higher this quarter due to lower total sales. However, total selling expenses were down $33-million compared to the same period last year as a result of cost reductions primarily in our Canadian and Australian Retail operations. Total crop nutrient sales were 10 percent lower compared to the same period last year due to a reduction in both average crop nutrient selling prices as well as lower sales volumes. Total crop nutrient volumes were 4 percent lower this quarter across our Retail operations compared to the same period last year. Virtually all of the reduction was due to lower demand in our International Retail, due to dry conditions and lower planted wheat acreage. Despite lower corn and total seeded acreage this year in North America, sales tonnes in the region were relatively flat compared to the third quarter of 2014. Crop nutrient margins on a per tonne basis were lower across all regions. Margins from our international Retail declined by 28 percent over the same period last year. North American operations were 15 percent lower as a result of declining crop nutrient prices. Crop protection products Total crop protection sales were down 8 percent year-over-year with most of the reduction due to a combination of drought conditions impacting sales within our Canadian operations, lower demand for insecticides in the U.S. and lower prices for glyphosate products. International crop protection sales also experienced a decline related to dry conditions in those regions. Crop protection margins as a percentage of sales increased year-over-year, largely due to timing of rebates and new programs from suppliers in the U.S. market. Additionally, proprietary crop protection margins as a percentage of sales increased by 5 percent over the same period last year with the most significant increases in Canada and Australia. Seed Seed sales were up 11 percent this quarter compared to the same period last year. The increase was due primarily to excessive moisture conditions in the Eastern U.S. during June, which pushed corn and soybean seeding into July of this year. The excessive moisture also prevented a significant amount of corn and soybean acreage in the region from being planted and much of this area was seeded with wheat, rye grass and other grass seed instead. Seed sales and margins were negatively impacted by competitive pressures across the seed industry, as well as lower sales volumes in Canada. Seed margins as a percentage of sales were 43 percent this quarter compared to 50 percent in 2014. Increased sales volumes of wheat, rye grass and other grass seed, which are lower margin products, were a key contributor to the lower margins. Merchandise Merchandise sales decreased compared to the same period last year as a result of lower fuel prices and demand in Canada and lower animal health sales in Australia. Gross margin as a percentage of sales was higher this quarter due to a decrease in lower margin Canadian fuel sales and our ability to maintain a better cost position in the Australian business, which consistently has higher margin products. Services and other Sales for services and other was down 21 percent this quarter, due mainly to the closure of our livestock export business in Australia. Application and other services sales, gross profit and gross margins were all higher in North America compared to the same period last year. Wholesale sales this quarter were lower than the same period last year due to our decision to sell several non-core, lower-return purchase for resale facilities in 2015 related to our on-going asset portfolio review. Excluding this factor, Wholesale had higher product sales volumes this quarter largely offset by lower selling prices for all three crop nutrients. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $55-million over the prior year, as a result of higher utilization rates from our nitrogen and potash segments resulting in higher sales volumes and lower production costs per tonne. Nitrogen Nitrogen gross profit increased by 69 percent over the same period last year, with results being driven by higher volumes and a significant reduction in cost of product sold due to improved capacity utilization rates and lower natural gas costs in the current period. Sales volumes increased by 3 percent over the same period last year, driven by stronger urea and ammonia sales. This increase was due to higher on-stream time at our production facilities and product availability compared to the same period last year. Cost of product sold per tonne was 35 percent lower than the same period last year. Operational improvements and higher on-stream time compared to the same period in the prior year decreased fixed costs per tonne, while lower natural gas costs reduced variable costs. The weaker Canadian dollar also reduced operating costs at our Canadian plants. Nitrogen margin per tonne was $171 per tonne, a 63 percent improvement over the same period last year, despite an 11 percent reduction in average selling prices. Potash Potash gross profit this quarter was $40-million higher than the same period last year, due to the turnaround to tie-in the Vanscoy capacity expansion that started in the third quarter of 2014 leading to lower sales and margin in the prior year. Sales volumes were 53 percent higher compared to the same period in the prior year. Production volumes this quarter were 560,000 tonnes. Realized sales prices were lower than the same period last year due to competitive pricing pressure in both domestic and international markets. Cost of product sold was reduced as a result of cost efficiencies associated with the continuing ramp-up of the Vanscoy expansion, as well as weakening of the Canadian dollar. As a result, cash cost of product manufactured continues to improve and is $89 per tonne in the current quarter compared to $110 per tonne in the second quarter of 2015. Phosphate Phosphate gross profit was unchanged from the prior year. Sales volumes were slightly higher than last year, while reduced selling prices were largely offset by lower cost of production. As a result, phosphate margins were only 2 percent lower than the same quarter last year. Wholesale Other Gross profit for Wholesale's Other product category decreased this quarter primarily due to lower sales volumes and gross profit for the product purchased for resale business, as these operations were significantly scaled back earlier in 2015 as part of our portfolio review. ESN(r) gross profit increased this quarter due to slightly higher sales volumes and lower cost of product sold, which was partly offset by lower selling prices. Wholesale Earnings from Equity Investees Agrium's share of earnings from equity investees saw a loss of $10-million during the quarter. MOPCO experienced gas curtailments throughout the quarter which restricted nitrogen production. Profertil's sales volumes and costs were impacted by an extended outage during the current quarter. Other EBITDA for our Other non-operating business unit for the third quarter of 2015 had a net expense of $44-million, compared to a net expense of $40-million for the third quarter of 2014. The variance was due to the following: A $12-million higher gross profit elimination expense as a result of higher inter-segment inventory held at the end of the third quarter of 2015; A $22-million increase in other expenses primarily due to higher provisions for environmental remediation and asset retirement obligations and an interest recovery received in 2014; and A $15-million share-based payment recovery for the third quarter of 2015 compared to a $10-million share-based payment expense for the same period last year due to a decrease in Agrium's share price in 2015. Summary of Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Below is a summary of our cash provided by or used in operating, investing, and financing activities as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows: Our investing capital expenditures decreased in the first nine months of 2015 compared to the first nine months of 2014 due to the completion of the tie-in of our Vanscoy potash facility expansion in the fourth quarter of 2014, partially offset by expenditures relating to the Borger nitrogen expansion project. Our sustaining capital expenditures decreased in the first nine months of 2015 as we had less turnarounds compared to the same period last year. We expect Agrium's capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of 2015 to approximate $200--million to $300-million in 2015. We anticipate that we will be able to finance the announced projects through a combination of cash provided from operating activities and existing credit facilities. Short-term Debt Our short-term debt of $1.8-billion at September 30, 2015 is outlined in note 5 of our Summarized Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our short-term debt increased by $1.1-billion during the three months ended September 30, 2015, which in turn contributed to a decrease in our unutilized short-term financing capacity to $1.1-billion at September 30, 2015. Capital Management Our revolving credit facilities require that we maintain specific interest coverage and debt-to-capital ratios, as well as other non-financial covenants as defined in our credit agreements. We were in compliance with all covenants at September 30, 2015. NORMAL COURSE ISSUER BID In January 2015, the Toronto Stock Exchange (\"TSX\") accepted Agrium's notice of intention to make a normal course issuer bid (\"NCIB\") whereby Agrium may purchase up to 7,185,866 common shares on the TSX and New York Stock Exchange during the period from January 26, 2015 to January 25, 2016. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we purchased 5,574,331 shares at an average share price of $100.25 for total consideration of $559-million. Shareholders can obtain a free copy of the NCIB notice submitted to the TSX from Agrium upon request. OUTSTANDING SHARE DATA Agrium had 138,169,000 outstanding shares at October 31, 2015. At that date, under our stock option plans, shares expected to be issued for options outstanding were negligible.

OTHER Barrick Gold Corporation (TSX: ABX) Our vision is the generation of wealth through responsible mining wealth for our owners, our people, and the countries and communities with which we partner. We aim to be the leading mining company focused on gold, growing our cash flow per share by developing and operating high quality assets through disciplined allocation of human and financial capital and operational excellence. Those who founded and first led the company were committed to a culture of partnership and the values underpinning such a culture: trust, transparency, shared responsibility and accountability, and a sense of emotional and financial ownership. The company is returning to its roots as a lean and nimble organization, with minimal bureaucracy. A small head office manages the company with a balance of entrepreneurialism and prudence, focusing on only a few core activities: defining and implementing strategy, allocating human and financial capital, and fulfilling the obligations required of a public company. Leaders at the operational level have greater autonomy, responsibility, and accountability, functioning as business owners. Free from bureaucracy and middle management, they are focused on maximizing free cash flow, and the head office is focused on allocating that cash flow to maximize shareholder returns. Barrick has mining operations in Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile, Dominican Republic, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Saudi Arabia, United States and Zambia. More than 75 percent of the company's gold production comes from the Americas region. Barrick Reports Third Quarter 2015 Results | Growing Free Cash Flow TORONTO, October 28, 2015 The company reported adjusted net earnings of $131 million ($0.11 per share)1and a net loss of $264 million ($0.23 per share) in the third quarter. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $942 million1; EBITDA was $490 million1. Free cash flow was $866 million1, or $256 million excluding proceeds from the Pueblo Viejo streaming transaction. Gold production in the third quarter was 1.66 million ounces at all-in sustaining costs (AISC) of $771 per ounce1 Full-year gold production is expected to be 6.1-6.3 million ounces. Full-year all-in sustaining cost guidance reduced to $830-$870 per ounce from previous range of $840-$880 per ounce. On track to achieve $2 billion in cash flow improvements by end of 2016. Total debt reduced by 15 percent year-to-date, on track to achieve $3 billion debt reduction target. Progressing drilling and feasibility study work to convert resources to reserves over the next five years at Cortez, Goldstrike, Lagunas Norte, Pueblo Viejo, Turquoise Ridge and other sites. Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:ABX)(TSX:ABX) (Barrick or the \"company\") today reported adjusted net earnings of $131 million ($0.11 per share) for the third quarter and a net loss of $264 million ($0.23 per share). Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was$942 million and EBITDA was $490 million. Free cash flow was $866 million, or $256 million excluding the impact of $610 millionin proceeds from the Pueblo Viejo streaming transaction2. Production in the third quarter was in line with expectations at 1.66 million ounces of gold. All-in sustaining costs were $771 per ounce and cash costs were $570 per ounce1. Full-year 2015 gold production is expected to be 6.1-6.3 million ounces at lower all-in sustaining costs of $830-$870 per ounce. Our objective is to grow free cash flow per share from a portfolio of high-quality gold assets through disciplined capital allocation and operational excellence. In support of this objective, we have returned to a leaner, decentralized operating model designed to maximize free cash flow and improve execution. Clear capital allocation criteria, including a 15 percent hurdle rate for all investments, are driving greater financial rigor and stronger returns. The divestment of non-core assets has refocused our portfolio and we have formed vital new strategic partnerships that will drive new opportunities in the future. All of this is driving stronger performance across the business, reflected by two consecutive quarters of positive free cash flow and improved costs. At the same time, we are strengthening our balance sheet and remain on track to reduce debt by $3 billion. This momentum will support our overriding objective of growing free cash flow per share, underpinned by a strong pipeline of organic projects and mine site expansion opportunities in our core regions. STRENGTHENING THE BALANCE SHEET Earlier this year, we set a $3 billion debt reduction target for 2015. We said we would achieve this through the disciplined sale of non-core assets, the formation of new joint ventures and partnerships, and by maximizing free cash flow from our operations. Thus far, we have completed or announced asset sales, joint ventures and partnerships valued at $2.46 billion. We have also generated$282 million in positive free cash flow in the last two quarters despite a lower gold price, reflecting the impact of our efforts to maximize free cash flow across the company. Both asset sales and cash flow improvements have been credit positive, and have resulted in improvements to our debt-to-EBITDA ratio. Achieving our $3 billion debt reduction target will also reduce annual pre-tax interest payments by approximately $140 million. So far this year, total debt has been reduced by 15 percent, from $13.1 billion to $11.2 billion3, significantly reducing our near-term debt repayment obligations. We currently have less than $250 million in debt due before 2018 and approximately $5 billion of our $11.2 billion in outstanding debt matures after 2032. Building on $1.9 billion in repayments already completed this year, we intend to use approximately $1 billion in proceeds from the sale of 50 percent of Zaldivar to reduce debt. The sale is expected to close in the fourth quarter. This would bring total debt repayments to approximately $2.9 billion. We intend to use free cash flow to reach our target of $3 billion. Assuming the completion of $3 billion in repayments, total debt will have been reduced by 23 percent, from $13.1 billion to $10.1 billion. We also expect to announce the outcome of a process for the sale of certain non-core U.S. assets in the fourth quarter. As we move into 2016 and beyond, we will continue to take prudent steps to strengthen our balance sheet, balancing debt repayments with investments in profitable production that will drive growth in free cash flow and EBITDA. Our liquidity position continues to improve, with strong cash flow generation, very modest near-term debt repayment obligations, a$4 billion undrawn credit facility and $3.34 billion in cash on hand at the end of the third quarter. FINANCIAL DISCUSSION Free cash flow increased to $866 million, or $256 million excluding the impact of $610 million in proceeds from the Pueblo Viejo streaming transaction. This compares to $26 million in free cash flow in the second quarter of 2015. Two consecutive quarters of positive free cash flow after a prolonged period of negative free cash flow reflects our driving focus on maximizing free cash flow through greater capital discipline, operational efficiencies and strong cost management. Third quarter 2015 adjusted net earnings were $131 million ($0.11 per share) compared to $222 million ($0.19 per share) in the prior year period. The net loss for the quarter was $264 million ($0.23 per share) compared to net earnings of $125 million ($0.11per share) in the prior year quarter. Lower adjusted net earnings reflect lower realized gold and copper prices and higher depreciation compared to the prior year period, partially offset by increased gold and copper sales. Significant adjusting items for the quarter (net of tax and non-controlling interest effects) include: $455 million in impairment charges primarily related to the reclassification of our Zaldivar mine as held-for-sale; and $29 million in costs arising from the write-down of obsolete supplies inventory; partially offset by $52 million of gains related to the sale of our Cowal mine and 50 percent of our interest in the Porgera mine; and $45 million in unrealized foreign currency translation gains. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $942 million compared to $1.1 billion in the prior year period. On an unadjusted basis, EBITDA was $490 million for the third quarter compared to $1.0 billion in the prior year period. Operating cash flow was $1.26 billion compared to $852 million in the prior year period. Higher operating cash flow in the quarter reflects the impact of $610 million in proceeds from the Pueblo Viejo streaming transaction. OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS AND GUIDANCE Barrick's operations continued to perform in line with expectations for the year, meeting cost and production targets for the third quarter while generating stronger free cash flow. We have tightened our gold production guidance range for 2015, from 6.1-6.4 million ounces to 6.1-6.3 million ounces, reflecting lower anticipated gold production from Acacia Mining plc. All-in sustaining cost guidance for the year has been reduced to $830-$870 per ounce from the previous range of $840-$880 per ounce. Average all-in sustaining costs for our five core mines are now expected to be $700-$725 per ounce in 2015, down from$725-$775 per ounce at the start of this year. These mines are expected to account for about 75 percent of free cash flow from operations and 60-65 percent of production in 2015. Fourth quarter all-in sustaining costs are now expected to be similar to the third quarter while production is expected to be slightly higher, primarily driven by the impact of higher sustaining capital expenditures offset by higher production at Cortez, Pueblo Viejo, Lagunas Norte and Veladero. We expect significantly higher depreciation in the fourth quarter, primarily related to a drawdown in inventory stockpiles at Cortez, Lagunas Norte and Goldstrike and higher sales volumes at Pueblo Viejo. Total copper guidance for 2015 remains unchanged at 480-520 million pounds. Full-year C1 cash costs are now expected to be$1.60-$1.85 per pound5, down from $1.75-$2.00 per pound, driven by currency impacts and improved costs at Lumwana. Cortez The Cortez mine produced 321,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $501 per ounce in the third quarter. Production benefited from higher open pit tonnage and improved underground productivity through the implementation of short interval controls, an initiative identified as part of our Value Realization review for Cortez. Higher production, lower operating costs and lower sustaining capital drove improved all-in sustaining costs. Production in 2015 is now forecast to be 900,000-950,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $675-$725 per ounce. Fourth quarter production at Cortez is expected to be slightly higher than the third quarter, at higher costs. A prefeasibility study for expanded underground mining in an area known as Deep South below currently permitted levels will be completed in late 2015 and results are expected to be disclosed with the company's fourth quarter results. Our Value Realization review at Cortez also identified long-hole stoping as the preferred mining method for the deposit, as compared to the cut-and-fill method previously contemplated for the underground expansion, which could improve the economics of the project. Mineralization in this zone is primarily oxide and higher grade compared to the current underground mine, which is sulfide in nature. The limits of the Lower Zone have not yet been defined, and drilling has indicated the potential for new targets at depth. With a 382-square-mile land package, Cortez remains a highly prospective district for Barrick. Goldstrike The Goldstrike mine contributed 328,000 ounces in the third quarter in line with plan, while all-in sustaining costs of $558 per ounce were better than expected due to lower operating costs and lower sustaining capital. Our innovative thiosulfate (TCM) circuit achieved commercial production in the third quarter, coming in at a capital cost of $610 million. We expect to complete the ramp up of the TCM circuit in the first half of 2016. Goldstrike's production for 2015 is forecast to be 1.00-1.10 million ounces at improved all-in sustaining costs of $650-$700 per ounce. Fourth quarter production is expected to be similar to the third quarter, at slightly higher costs. Exploration at Goldstrike is focused on the underground mine where good potential exists at depth, and we plan to accelerate near-mine development in 2016. During the quarter, we began development of new areas below existing workings at Meikle and Rodeo in order to access deeper reserves which are expected to come into production at the end of 2016. This work will also open up new drilling platforms to better define future potential in these areas. Pueblo Viejo (60 percent) Barrick's 60 percent share of production from Pueblo Viejo for the third quarter was 172,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of$554 per ounce. Production was slightly below plan due to lower gold grades and recoveries from a higher proportion of carbonaceous ore. All-in sustaining costs were impacted by lower silver recoveries associated with a combination of scheduled autoclave maintenance in September, lime boil limitations and unscheduled maintenance on the limestone grinding circuit. Modifications to the lime boil are underway, including the addition of two lime boil tanks which will be operational in November. These additional tanks are expected to improve silver recoveries to the targeted 80 percent level from around 60 percent currently. We continue to forecast attributable production of 625,000-675,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $540-$590 per ounce in 2015. Production is expected to be higher and costs lower in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter on higher grades, improved recoveries and better autoclave availability. At the end of 2014, Pueblo Viejo had approximately six million ounces of gold and 37 million ounces of silver in the measured and indicated resource category (Barrick's 60 percent share)9. A significant portion of these resources are not currently included in reserves due to tailings storage constraints. We have completed a preliminary economic assessment on a plan to remove these constraints to tailings capacity, which if implemented could significantly extend the life of the mine. We expect to complete further engineering work and commission a prefeasibility study in the second half of 2016 to refine the technical and financial analysis for the increase in tailings storage capacity and to confirm whether the measured and indicated resources described above can be brought into reserves. Lagunas Norte The Lagunas Norte mine contributed 108,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $581 per ounce in the third quarter, in line with expectations. Production in 2015 is now anticipated to be 550,000-590,000 ounces at improved all-in sustaining costs of $550-$600 per ounce, with stronger production expected in the fourth quarter driven by improved performance at the Phase Five leach pad. Fourth quarter all-in sustaining costs are expected to be higher than the third quarter, reflecting the sale of higher cost inventory as well as increased sustaining capital for Phase Six leach pad construction. A pre-feasibility study on a plan to extend the mine life by up to 12 years by mining nearly two million ounces of sulfide ore below the existing open pit is on schedule for completion in 2015. Veladero The Veladero mine produced 143,000 ounces of gold in the third quarter at all-in sustaining costs of $914 per ounce. Production was below plan primarily due to lower grades in the Federico Phase Three pit and adverse weather events in August which impacted leach operations. All-in sustaining costs were higher than plan on lower gold ounces sold, timing of sustaining capital and lower silver credits. The addition of reagents to the leach circuit was temporarily halted in September following a valve failure on a pipe carrying processing solution, which led to a discharge to the environment through a diversion channel gate that was open at the time of the incident. Since the incident occurred, our first priority has been the safety of people and the environment. Water samples analyzed by independent third-parties, including the United Nations, have confirmed that there are no risks to the health of downstream communities as a result of this incident. Restrictions on leaching activities were lifted following implementation of additional monitoring and corrective actions. Production guidance for 2015 is unchanged at 575,000-625,000 ounces while all-in sustaining cost guidance has been narrowed to $950-$1,000 per ounce. Fourth quarter production is expected to be higher, at lower all-in sustaining costs driven by better grades, lower capital expenditures and higher silver and inventory credits. Turquoise Ridge (75 percent) The Turquoise Ridge mine contributed 55,000 ounces in the third quarter at all-in sustaining costs of $738 per ounce, in line with expectations. The mine is forecast to produce 175,000-200,000 ounces in 2015 at improved all-in sustaining costs of $750-$800per ounce. Detailed engineering and feasibility work on developing an additional shaft GoC which could bring forward more than one million ounces of production and roughly double output to an average of 500,000 ounces per year (100 percent basis) at all-in sustaining costs of about $625-$675 per ounce GoC is on track to be completed by the end of the year. Work to install additional ventilation capacity has also been initiated. Porgera (47.5 percent) The Porgera mine produced 134,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $986 per ounce, in line with plan. Attributable production in 2015 is now expected to be 400,000-450,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $1,025-$1,125 per ounce, reflecting Barrick's reduced interest following the sale of 50 percent of Barrick (Niugini) Ltd. to Zijin Mining. Recent drought conditions are not expected to have a material impact on production in 2015. We expect to increase our exploration budget at Porgera in 2016 to focus on underground targets which have been identified through a new geological model. Other Mines Barrick's other mines - consisting of Bald Mountain, 50 percent of Round Mountain, Golden Sunlight, Ruby Hill, Hemlo, Cowal, KCGM and Pierina - contributed 298,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $959 per ounce in the third quarter. A sale process is underway for Bald Mountain, Round Mountain, Ruby Hill, Golden Sunlight and the Spring Valley and Hilltop properties, with strong interest received to date. Acacia Mining (63.9 percent) Barrick's share of third quarter production was lower than expected at 104,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $1,195 per ounce due to temporary factors impacting output from Bulyanhulu and Buzwagi. We now expect attributable 2015 production from Acacia to be about 460,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of approximately $1,155 per ounce. Copper Copper production in the third quarter was 140 million pounds at C1 cash costs of $1.53 per pound. For 2015, copper production is anticipated to be 480-520 million pounds at lower C1 cash costs of $1.60-$1.85 per pound, reflecting currency impacts and improved costs at Lumwana. Lumwana contributed 77 million pounds at C1 cash costs of $1.59 per pound in the third quarter, in line with expectations. Power restrictions and potential reductions to smelter capacity in Zambia are not expected to have any material impact on Lumwana's 2015 production guidance. Production is now anticipated to be 260-280 million pounds at lower C1 cash costs of $1.80-$2.00per pound in 2015, reflecting higher grades. Production of 63 million pounds at Zaldivar at C1 cash costs of $1.47 per pound in the third quarter was in line with plan. At Jabal Sayid, first shipments of copper-in-concentrate continue to be anticipated in early 2016. Once the mine reaches full production, average production in the first full five years is expected to be 100 million pounds per year. TARGETING $2 BILLION IN CASH FLOW IMPROVEMENTS This year, we have taken significant actions to improve our business plans, resulting in positive free cash flow for two consecutive quarters. We remain focused on improving productivity and driving down costs to maximize free cash flow from our assets in any gold price environment. In support of this, we are targeting $2 billion in cash flow improvements across the company before the end of 2016, relative to our original internal plans for 2015 and 2016. These improvements are coming from productivity gains and cost reductions across operating expenses, capital spending and corporate overhead. While a majority of these actions will be incorporated into our 2016 plans, the initial outcomes are reflected in improvements to our 2015 guidance. Total capital expenditures for the year are expected to be 20 percent lower than 2014. Combined with reductions in corporate overhead and other operating cost savings, this has allowed us to reduce our 2015 all-in sustaining cost guidance by about $30 per ounce since the start of year, from our original range of $860-$895 per ounce to $830-$870 per ounce in the third quarter. We are now focused on optimizing our 2016 plans, with an emphasis on operating cost and productivity improvements. Our temporary suspension plan for Pascua-Lama has now been approved by the mining authority in Chile. This will enable us to complete the transition to care and maintenance, and should allow us to significantly reduce holding costs at the project in 2016. Implementation of the temporary suspension plan could require adjustments resulting from regulatory and legal actions and weather conditions, which could increase costs associated with the plan. CONVERTING RESOURCES TO RESERVES At the end of 2014, Barrick had 93 million ounces of proven and probable gold reserves and 94 million ounces of measured and indicated gold resources10. At 1.37 grams per tonne, our reserve grade is more than 50 percent higher than the senior peer average11. For more than 20 years, Barrick has maintained an average reserve mine life of between 10 to 20 years with a track record of replacing reserves and resources at our operations. Mine life and production rates at the majority of our mines have far surpassed initial estimates and we continue to identify excellent potential for resource conversion at many of our operations. Of our exploration budget, 65 percent is focused on opportunities at or near our existing operations. Drilling and feasibility study work to convert resources to reserves over the next five years at Cortez, Goldstrike, Lagunas Norte, Pueblo Viejo and Turquoise Ridge are progressing well. In addition, recent drilling at Hemlo and Porgera indicates strong potential for resource additions. We are also working to advance our Goldrush project in Nevada and drilling to define the limits of mineralization at the Alturas project inChile is expected to resume in the fourth quarter, following the South American winter. An illustration of the optionality that exists within our portfolio is the recent drill program at Hemlo. In the first quarter, Barrick completed the acquisition of surface and mineral rights adjacent to the Hemlo property in Ontario from subsidiaries of Newmont Mining. These claims included an area of geological potential adjacent to Barrick's existing underground workings. Barrick is currently undertaking an underground diamond drilling program in this area to evaluate its potential. To date, drilling has encountered a number of high grade intercepts with significant potential. These results highlight the ongoing potential of mineral deposits such as the Hemlo camp, even as they become mature operations. A detailed update on reserves and resources will be provided with the company's fourth quarter results in February 2016.

Cameco Corporation (TSE: CCJ) Cameco is one of the world's largest uranium producers accounting for about 16% of the global production from its mines in Canada, the US and Kazakhstan. Our leading position is backed by about 429 million pounds of proven and probable reserves and extensive resources. Cameco Reports Third Quarter Financial Results SASKATOON, SASKATCHEWAN--(Oct. 30, 2015) higher consolidated revenue and gross profit for the first nine months lower uranium segment gross profit for the quarter and first nine months annual uranium sales outlook confirmed strong performance at Cigar Lake, increased annual production target range ALL AMOUNTS ARE STATED IN CDN $ (UNLESS NOTED) Cameco (TSX:CCO) (NYSE:CCJ) today reported its consolidated financial and operating results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2015 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). \"Our results for the quarter and the first nine months are as expected\" said Tim Gitzel, president and CEO, \"with a higher proportion of our deliveries scheduled for the fourth quarter. \"We've continued to see the oversupply in the market impacting demand and price, and while we can't control the pace of industry recovery, we can ensure that our company is ready at each step along the way. Our positive long-term view has not changed, so today that means preparing for the demand-driven market we see coming, by keeping our costs down and operating our mines safely and efficiently. Those mines continue to return excellent results, particularly Cigar Lake, which has already exceeded our 2015 production target range. The Cigar Lake operation, along with our other world-class assets, are at the core of our strategy to enhance our operating leverage and maintain the flexibility needed to respond quickly as the market improves.\" THIRD QUARTER Net losses attributable to equity holders this quarter were $4 million ($0.01 per share diluted) compared to net losses of $146 million ($0.37 per share diluted) in the third quarter of 2014.

Our 2014 earnings also included a gain on the sale of our interest in BPLP of $127 million, the impairment of our investment in GE-Hitachi Global Laser Enrichment of $184 million and the impairment of our investment in GoviEx Uranium Inc. of $12 million. On an adjusted basis, our earnings for the first nine months of this year were $193 million ($0.49 per share diluted) compared to earnings of $207 million ($0.52 per share diluted) (non-IFRS measure, see section) for the first nine months of 2014. Key variances include: lower gross profit from our uranium segment higher administration costs a favourable settlement of $28 million with respect to a dispute regarding a long-term supply contract with a utility customer recorded in the second quarter of 2014 lower tax recovery Partially offset by: higher gross profit from our fuel services and NUKEM segments lower losses from equity accounted investments Our 2014 adjusted net earnings were also impacted by: an early termination fee of $18 million incurred in 2014 as a result of the cancellation of our toll conversion agreement with Springfields Fuels Ltd., which was to expire in 2016 settlement costs of $12 million with respect to the early redemption our Series C debentures recorded in 2014 Uranium market update In the third quarter, there was no significant change to the market in terms of contract volumes or price. Quantities transacted in the spot market were at normal levels, and spot prices remained in the mid-$30s (US). This is in keeping with the rest of the year so far, and is, we believe, simply a function of the currently over-supplied market. Reactor restarts in Japan remain an important driver of market sentiment in the short term, and the first of these were finally realized: Kyushu's Sendai unit 1 restarted in August and unit 2 in mid-October. Three additional reactors have been approved by the regulator to restart, and twenty more applications await decisions. We remain confident that a significant number of units will be restarted in Japan over time, though the regulatory approval process and restart schedules are clearly hard to predict. Longer term, strong fundamentals underpin a positive outlook for the industry. The 65 reactors under construction today and additional units planned over the next decade means increasing uranium demand as those reactors come online. As future supply continues to be negatively affected by current depressed market conditions, we expect to see a shift from the currently over-supplied market we are experiencing today to a demand-driven market that requires more primary supply. Demand growth combined with the timing, development and execution of new supply projects and the continued performance of existing supply, will determine the pace of that shift. Caution about forward-looking information relating to our uranium market update This discussion of our expectations for the nuclear industry, including its growth profile, future global uranium supply and demand is forward-looking information that is based upon the assumptions and subject to the material risks discussed under the heading Caution about forward-looking information below. Outlook for 2015 Our strategy is to profitably produce at a pace aligned with market signals, while maintaining the ability to respond to conditions as they evolve. Our outlook for 2015 reflects the expenditures necessary to help us achieve our strategy. Our outlook for uranium production, uranium, fuel services and NUKEM revenue, NUKEM unit cost, consolidated tax rate, and capital expenditures has changed. We do not provide an outlook for the items in the table that are marked with a dash. 2015 FINANCIAL OUTLOOK Our 2015 outlook for sales volume does not include sales between our uranium, fuel services and NUKEM segments. For comparison of our 2015 outlook and 2014 results for revenue, we do not include sales between our uranium, fuel services and NUKEM segments. Based on a uranium spot price of $36.50 (US) per pound (the Ux spot price as of October 26, 2015), a long-term price indicator of $44.00 (US) per pound (the Ux long-term indicator on October 26, 2015) and an exchange rate of $1.00 (US) for $1.25 (Cdn). This increase is based on the unit cost of sale for produced material and committed long-term purchases. If we make discretionary purchases in the remainder of 2015, then we expect the overall unit cost of sales to increase further. Direct administration costs do not include stock-based compensation expenses. Our outlook for the tax rate is based on adjusted net earnings. We have increased our uranium production outlook to 27.3 million pounds U3O8 (previously between 25.3 million and 26.3 million pounds) to reflect the higher expected production from Cigar Lake/McClean Lake. See Uranium 2015 Q3 updates below for more information. Our outlook for uranium revenue and for fuel services revenue have both changed to an increase of 5% to 10% in each segment (previously an increase up to 5% in each) due to the effects of foreign exchange. We have also adjusted our outlook for NUKEM revenue to an increase of 30% to 35% (previously an increase of 20% to 25%) due to the effects of foreign exchange; however, the higher revenue expectation is largely offset by our adjusted outlook for NUKEM unit cost of sales, which is now expected to increase 15% to 20% (previously an increase of 5% to 10%), also due to the effects of foreign exchange. We have adjusted our outlook for the consolidated tax rate to a recovery of 25% to 30% (previously 40% to 45%) due to the expected impact of the changes to our revenue outlook noted above, and a change in the distribution of earnings between jurisdictions. We now expect capital expenditures to be $385 million (previously $405 million). The decrease is primarily due to the timing of expenditures on projects at Key Lake and McArthur River, as well as a reduction in planned spending at Cigar Lake due to changes in the mine plan, slightly offset by increased costs at Inkai and our US operations due to the effect of foreign exchange. REVENUE AND EARNINGS SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS For the rest of 2015: an increase of $5 (US) per pound in both the Ux spot price ($36.50 (US) per pound on October 26, 2015) and the Ux long-term price indicator ($44.00 (US) per pound on October 26, 2015) would increase revenue by $22 million and net earnings by $12 million. Conversely, a decrease of $5 (US) per pound would decrease revenue by $19 million and net earnings by $9 million. a one-cent change in the value of the Canadian dollar versus the US dollar would change adjusted net earnings by $3 million, with a decrease in the value of the Canadian dollar versus the US dollar having a positive impact ADJUSTED NET EARNINGS (NON-IFRS MEASURE) Adjusted net earnings are a measure that does not have a standardized meaning or a consistent basis of calculation under IFRS (non-IFRS measure). We use this measure as a more meaningful way to compare our financial performance from period to period. We believe that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, certain investors use this information to evaluate our performance. Adjusted net earnings are our net earnings attributable to equity holders, adjusted to better reflect the underlying financial performance for the reporting period. The adjusted earnings measure reflects the matching of the net benefits of our hedging program with the inflows of foreign currencies in the applicable reporting period, and has also been adjusted for NUKEM purchase price inventory write-downs and recoveries, income taxes on adjustments, impairment charges on non-producing property, and the after tax gain on the sale of our interest in BPLP. Adjusted net earnings are non-standard supplemental information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information prepared according to accounting standards. Other companies may calculate this measure differently, so you may not be able to make a direct comparison to similar measures presented by other companies. Discontinued operation On March 27, 2014, we completed the sale of our 31.6% limited partnership interest in BPLP, which was accounted for effective January 1, 2014. The aggregate sale price for our interest in BPLP and certain related entities was $450 million. We realized an after tax gain of $127 million on this divestiture. As a result of the transaction, we presented the results of BPLP as a discontinued operation and we revised our statement of earnings, statement of comprehensive income and statement of cash flows to reflect the change in presentation. See note 4 to the interim financial statements for more information. TRANSFER PRICING DISPUTES We have been reporting on our transfer pricing disputes with Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) since 2008, when it originated, and with the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) since the first quarter of 2015. Below, we discuss the general nature of transfer pricing disputes and, more specifically, the ongoing disputes we have. Transfer pricing is a complex area of tax law, and it is difficult to predict the outcome of cases like ours. However, tax authorities generally test two things: the governance (structure) of the corporate entities involved in the transactions the price at which goods and services are sold by one member of a corporate group to another We have a global customer base and we established a marketing and trading structure involving foreign subsidiaries, including Cameco Europe Limited (CEL), which entered into various intercompany arrangements, including purchase and sale agreements, as well as uranium purchase and sale agreements with third parties. Cameco and its subsidiaries made reasonable efforts to put arm's length transfer pricing arrangements in place, and these arrangements expose the parties to the risks and rewards accruing to them under these contracts. The intercompany contract prices are generally comparable to those established in comparable contracts between arm's-length parties entered into at that time. For the years 2003 to 2009, CRA has shifted CEL's income (as re-calculated by CRA) back to Canada and applied statutory tax rates, interest and instalment penalties, and, from 2007 to 2009, transfer pricing penalties. The IRS also allocated a portion of CEL's income for 2009 to the US, resulting in such income being taxed in multiple jurisdictions. Taxes of approximately $290 million for the 2003 - 2014 years have already been paid in a jurisdiction outside Canada and the US. Bilateral international tax treaties contain provisions that generally seek to prevent taxation of the same income in both countries. As such, in connection with these disputes, we are considering our options including remedies under international tax treaties that would limit double taxation; however, there is a risk that we will not be successful in eliminating all potential double taxation. The expected income adjustments under our tax disputes are represented by the amounts claimed by CRA and IRS and are described below. CRA dispute Since 2008, CRA has disputed our corporate structure and the related transfer pricing methodology we used for certain intercompany uranium sale and purchase agreements, and issued notices of reassessment for our 2003 through 2009 tax returns. We have recorded a cumulative tax provision of $92 million, where an argument could be made that our transfer price may have fallen outside of an appropriate range of pricing in uranium contracts for the period from 2003 through September 30, 2015. We are confident that we will be successful in our case and continue to believe the ultimate resolution of this matter will not be material to our financial position, results of operations and cash flows in the year(s) of resolution. For the years 2003 through 2009, CRA issued notices of reassessment for approximately $2.8 billion of additional income for Canadian tax purposes, which would result in a related tax expense of about $820 million. We expect to receive the reassessment for 2010 in the fourth quarter. CRA has also issued notices of reassessment for transfer pricing penalties for the years 2007 through 2009 in the amount of $229 million. The Canadian income tax rules include provisions that require larger companies like us to remit 50% of the cash tax plus related interest and penalties at the time of reassessment. To date, under these provisions, after applying elective deductions and tax loss carryovers, we have paid a net amount of $229 million cash to the Government of Canada, which includes the amounts shown in the table below.  These amounts do not include interest and instalment penalties, which totalled approximately $70 million to September 30, 2015. In light of our view of the likely outcome of the case as described above, we expect to recover the amounts remitted to the Government of Canada, including the $229 million already paid to date. We are expecting the trial for the 2003, 2005 and 2006 reassessments to commence during the week of September 26, 2016 and to conclude within four months thereafter. If this timing is adhered to, we expect to receive a Tax Court decision within six to 18 months after the trial is complete. IRS dispute In the first quarter, we received a Revenue Agent's Report (RAR) from the IRS challenging the transfer pricing used under certain intercompany transactions pertaining to the 2009 tax year for certain of our US subsidiaries. The RAR lists the adjustments proposed by the IRS and calculates the tax and any penalties owing based on the proposed adjustments. The current position of the IRS is that a portion of the non-US income reported under our corporate structure and taxed in non-US jurisdictions should be recognized and taxed in the US on the basis that: the prices received by our US mining subsidiaries for the sale of uranium to CEL are too low the compensation being earned by Cameco Inc., one of our US subsidiaries, is inadequate The proposed adjustments result in an increase in taxable income in the US of approximately $108 million (US) and a corresponding increased income tax expense of approximately $32 million (US) for the 2009 taxation year, with interest being charged thereon. In addition, the IRS proposed penalties of approximately $7 million (US) in respect of the adjustment. At present, the RAR pertains only to the 2009 tax year; however, the IRS is also auditing our tax returns for 2010 through 2012 on a similar basis and we expect adjustments in these years to be similar to those made for 2009. If the IRS audits years subsequent to 2012 on a similar basis, we expect these proposed adjustments would also be similar to those made for 2009. We believe that the conclusions of the IRS in the RAR are incorrect and we are contesting them in an administrative appeal, during which we are not required to make any cash payments. At present, this matter is still at an early stage and, until this matter progresses further, we cannot provide an estimation of the likely timeline for a resolution of the dispute. We believe that the ultimate resolution of this matter will not be material to our financial position, results of operations and cash flows in the year(s) of resolution. Caution about forward-looking information relating to our CRA and IRS tax disputes This discussion of our expectations relating to our tax disputes with CRA and IRS and future tax reassessments by CRA and IRS is forward-looking information that is based upon the assumptions and subject to the material risks discussed under the heading Caution about forward-looking information below and also on the more specific assumptions and risks listed below. Actual outcomes may vary significantly. Assumptions CRA will reassess us for the years 2010 through 2014 using a similar methodology as for the years 2003 through 2009, and the reassessments will be issued on the basis we expect we will be able to apply elective deductions to the extent anticipated we will be able to utilize letters of credit to the extent anticipated CRA will seek to impose transfer pricing penalties (in a manner consistent with penalties charged in the years 2007 through 2009) in addition to interest charges and instalment penalties we will be substantially successful in our dispute with CRA and the cumulative tax provision of $92 million to date will be adequate to satisfy any tax liability resulting from the outcome of the dispute to date IRS will continue to propose adjustments for the years 2010 through 2012 and may propose adjustments for later years we will be substantially successful in our dispute with IRS Material risks that could cause actual results to differ materially CRA reassesses us for years 2010 through 2014 using a different methodology than for years 2003 through 2009, or we are unable to apply elective deductions or utilize letters of credit to the same extent as anticipated, resulting in the required cash payments to CRA pending the outcome of the dispute being higher than expected the time lag for the reassessments for each year is different than we currently expect we are unsuccessful and the outcomes of our dispute with CRA and/or IRS result in significantly higher cash taxes, interest charges and penalties than the amount of our cumulative tax provision, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial position, results of operations and cash flows cash tax payable increases due to unanticipated adjustments by CRA or IRS not related to transfer pricing IRS proposes adjustments for years 2010 through 2014 using a different methodology than for 2009 we are unable to effectively eliminate all double taxation THIRD QUARTER Production volumes this quarter were 52% higher compared to the third quarter of 2014, mainly due to production from Cigar Lake and higher production from McArthur River/Key Lake, Rabbit Lake and Inkai, which was partially offset by lower production at our US operations. SeeUranium 2015 Q3 updates below for more information. The 13% decrease in uranium revenues was a result of a 23% decrease in sales volume, partially offset by a 13% increase in the Canadian dollar average realized price. The US dollar average realized price decreased by 5% compared to 2014 mainly due to lower prices on fixed price contracts, while the higher Canadian dollar realized prices this quarter were a result of the weakening of the Canadian dollar compared to 2014. This quarter the exchange rate on the average realized price was $1.00 (US) for $1.29 (Cdn) compared to $1.00 (US) for $1.09 (Cdn) in the third quarter of 2014. Total cost of sales (including D&A) decreased by 12% ($278 million compared to $315 million in 2014) due to a 23% decrease in sales volume, partially offset by a 14% increase in the unit cost of sales. The increase in the unit cost of sales was mainly the result of an increase in the volume of material purchased in the quarter at prices higher than our average cost of inventory and an increase in unit production costs related to the addition of higher cost production from Cigar Lake during ramp up. The net effect was a $22 million decrease in gross profit for the quarter. FIRST NINE MONTHS Production volumes for the first nine months of the year were 24% higher than in the previous year due to the addition of production from Cigar Lake and higher production at McArthur/Key Lake, and Rabbit Lake, partially offset by lower production at our US operations. SeeUranium 2015 Q3 updates below for more information. Uranium revenues increased 1% compared to the first nine months of 2014 due to an 11% increase in the Canadian dollar average realized price, partially offset by a 9% decrease in sales volumes in the first nine months. In our uranium and fuel services segments, our customers choose when in the year to receive deliveries, so our quarterly delivery patterns, sales volumes and revenue can vary significantly. We are on track to meet our 2015 uranium sales targets, and, therefore, expect to deliver between 10 million and 12 million pounds in the fourth quarter. Our Canadian dollar realized prices for the first nine months of 2015 were higher than 2014, primarily as a result of the weakening of the Canadian dollar compared to 2014. For the first nine months of 2015, the exchange rate on the average realized price was $1.00 (US) for $1.25 (Cdn) compared to $1.00 (US) for $1.09 (Cdn) for the same period in 2014. Total cost of sales (including D&A) increased by 2% ($829 million compared to $810 million in 2014) mainly due to a 12% increase in the unit cost of sales, partially offset by a 9% decrease in sales volume for the first nine months. The increase in the unit cost of sales was mainly the result of an increase in the volume of material purchased in the first nine months at prices higher than our average cost of inventory, and an increase in unit production costs related to the addition of higher cost production from Cigar Lake during rampup. The net effect was a $12 million decrease in gross profit for the first nine months. We are active in the uranium market, buying and selling uranium on the spot market and under long-term contracts when we expect it will be beneficial for us. Purchases are impacted by foreign exchange rates, and may, in some cases, require we pay prices higher or lower than current spot prices. Depending on the volume and unit cost of purchases in a quarter, our average cost of inventory can be impacted, which flows through to our cost of sales. The table below shows the costs of produced and purchased uranium incurred in the reporting periods (which are non-IFRS measures, see the paragraphs below the table). These costs do not include selling costs such as royalties, transportation and commissions, nor do they reflect the impact of opening inventories on our reported cost of sales. This quarter, cash costs of purchased material were $37.78 US per pound compared to $27.98 US per pound in the same period in 2014. In the third quarter the exchange rate on purchases averaged $1.00 (US) for $1.25 (Cdn) compared to $1.00 (US) for $1.10 (Cdn) in the third quarter of 2014. For the first nine months, cash costs of purchased material were $37.51 US per pound compared to $33.89 per lb in the same period in 2014. For the first nine months of 2015, the exchange rate on purchases averaged $1.00 (US) for $1.25 (Cdn) compared to $1.00 (US) for $1.10 (Cdn) for the same period in 2014. Cash cost per pound, non-cash cost per pound and total cost per pound for produced and purchased uranium presented in the above table are non-IFRS measures. These measures do not have a standardized meaning or a consistent basis of calculation under IFRS. We use these measures in our assessment of the performance of our uranium business. We believe that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, certain investors use this information to evaluate our performance and ability to generate cash flow. These measures are non-standard supplemental information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared according to accounting standards. These measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under IFRS. Other companies may calculate these measures differently, so you may not be able to make a direct comparison to similar measures presented by other companies. To facilitate a better understanding of these measures, the following table presents a reconciliation of these measures to our unit cost of sales for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2015 and 2014. Fuel services THIRD QUARTER Total revenue for the third quarter of 2015 increased to $83 million from $71 million for the same period last year. A 23% increase in sales volumes was partially offset by a 4% decrease in average realized price, primarily due to the mix of products sold, partially offset by the weakening of the Canadian dollar compared to 2014. The total cost of products and services sold (including D&A) increased by 6% ($70 million compared to $66 million in the third quarter of 2014) due to the increase in sales volumes, partially offset by a decrease in the average unit cost of sales. When compared to 2014, the average unit cost of sales was 13% lower due to the mix of fuel services products sold, partially offset by higher production costs. The net effect was an $8 million increase in gross profit. FIRST NINE MONTHS In the first nine months of the year, total revenue increased by 21% due to an 11% increase in sales volumes and a 9% increase in realized price that was the result of the weakening of the Canadian dollar and the mix of products sold. The total cost of sales (including D&A) increased 13% ($180 million compared to $159 million in 2014) due to an increase in sales volume and a 1% increase in the average unit cost of sales, which resulted from increased production costs, partially offset by the mix of fuel services products sold. The net effect was a $17 million increase in gross profit. NUKEM Includes sales and revenue between our uranium, fuel services and NUKEM segments (130,000 pounds in sales and revenue of $6.0 million in Q3, 2015, nil in Q3, 2014; 873,000 pounds in sales and revenue of $19.3 million in the first nine months of 2015, nil in the first nine months of 2014). THIRD QUARTER During the third quarter of 2015, NUKEM delivered 2.9 million pounds of uranium, an increase of 16% from the same period last year. Total revenues increased by 89% as a result of higher sales volumes and average realized prices which were 37% higher than those realized in the third quarter of 2014. Gross profit percentage was 8% in the third quarter of 2015, a slight increase from 9% recorded in the third quarter of 2014. The allocation of the historic purchase price to the sale of inventory on hand at the time of acquisition of NUKEM, impacted margins for the quarter. The net effect was a $5 million increase in gross profit. FIRST NINE MONTHS During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, NUKEM delivered 6.9 million pounds of uranium, an increase of 47%, due to timing of customer requirements and generally lower activity in the market during 2014. Total revenues increased 90% due to a 47% increase in sales volumes and an 18% increase in average realized price. Gross profit percentage was 10% for the first nine months of 2015, unchanged from the same period in 2014. Included in the 2014 margin was a $6 million write-down of inventory compared to a $3 million recovery in 2015. The write-down in 2014 was a result of a decline in the spot price during the period. The net effect was a $16 million increase in gross profit. Uranium 2015 Q3 updates MCARTHUR RIVER/KEY LAKE Production for the quarter was 26% higher compared to the same period last year and 6% higher for the first nine months due to the timing of mill maintenance. At Key Lake, commissioning of the new calciner is underway and expected to be complete by year end. The existing calciner circuit will remain in place until operational reliability of the new calciner is achieved. The operation remains on track to achieve our planned 2015 production; however, operational tie-ins of the new calciner will require brief production outages in the fourth quarter, and the output of the mill will be sensitive to the performance of the calciners. CIGAR LAKE During the third quarter, Cigar Lake packaged approximately 3.6 million pounds (100% basis, 1.8 million pounds our share) for total production of 6.7 million pounds (100% basis, 3.3 million pounds our share) to the end of September. As of the end of October, the mill has packaged over 8 million pounds (100% basis) and exceeded the 2015 production target range. If production continues at current rates, the McClean Lake mill could produce more than 10 million packaged pounds of uranium (100% basis, 5 million pounds our share) from Cigar Lake in 2015. As we ramp up production to 18 million pounds (100% basis) by 2018, volumes may not be linear year-to-year, but will vary based on our operational experience. To ensure the most efficient operation of the mine and mill throughout the year, we expect to continually manage ore supply and, therefore, may halt and resume mining several times during a quarter without impacting planned annual production. INKAI Production for the quarter was 25% higher compared to the same period last year due to the timing of new wellfield development. Production remains unchanged for the first nine months of the year compared to the same periods in 2014. The operation remains on track to achieve our planned 2015 production.

The Company is gold-focused but also has the largest and most diversified portfolio of royalties and streams by commodity, geography, revenue type and stage of project. The portfolio is actively managed with the aim to maintain over 80% of revenue from precious metals (gold, silver & PGM). The Company does not operate mines, develop projects or conduct exploration. Franco-Nevada's business model is focused on managing and growing its portfolio of royalties and streams. The advantages of this business model are: Market Exposure to the gold price and exploration optionality; Limited exposure to many of the risks associated with operating companies; A free cash-flow business with limited cash calls; A high-margin business that can generate cash through the entire commodity cycle; A scalable and diversified business in which a large number of assets can be managed with a small stable overhead; A forward-looking business in which management focuses on growth opportunities rather than operational or development issues; and A perpetual discovery option over large areas of geologically prospective lands with no cost other than the initial investment. Franco-Nevada's financial results in the short-term are primarily tied to the price of commodities and the amount of production from its portfolio of producing assets. From time to time, financial results are also supplemented by acquisitions of new producing assets. Over the longer-term, results are impacted by the availability of exploration and development capital applied by other companies to advance Franco-Nevada's advanced and exploration assets into production. Franco-Nevada has a long-term focus in making its investments and recognizes it is in a cyclical industry. Franco-Nevada has historically operated by maintaining a strong balance sheet so that it can make investments during commodity cycle downturns. At year-end 2014, Franco-Nevada had $677.8 million in working capital and an undrawn $500.0 million unsecured credit facility. Franco-Nevada's shares are listed on the Toronto and New York stock exchanges under the symbol FNV. An investment in Franco-Nevada's shares is expected to provide investors with yield and more upside than gold ETF without exposure to operating cost inflation. Since its IPO over seven years ago, Franco-Nevada's share price has outperformed the gold price and all relevant gold equity benchmarks. Franco-Nevada Reports Q3 2015 Results and Declares Quarterly Dividend TORONTO, November 11, 2015 - Franco-Nevada Corporation (TSX: FNV; NYSE: FNV) today reported third quarter 2015 financial results realizing 85,637 Gold Equivalent Ounces (\"GEOs\")1 from its mineral assets and $7.8 million in revenue from its oil & gas assets. Net Income and Adjusted Net Income2 were $15.2 million, or $0.10 per share, and $19.4 million, or $0.12 per share, respectively, with Adjusted EBITDA3 being $78.0 million, or $0.50 per share. Prepared in accordance with IFRS and presented in U.S. dollars (unless otherwise noted). \"Franco-Nevada's diversified portfolio continues to perform well,\" said David Harquail, CEO. \"It is significant that these results are before any contributions from our $610 million Antamina silver stream investment which closed in October. We expect to begin recording revenues from the sale of ounces from Antamina in Q4 2015. Also, in November we began funding our gold and silver stream investment in the Cobre Panama project which we expect will be ramping up production in 2018. Franco-Nevada now has net debt of approximately $330 million, an undrawn credit facility of $270 million and remains well-positioned to continue to add to its portfolio.\" Revenues and GEOs by Asset Categories For the third quarter of 2015, revenue was earned 90% from precious metals (83% gold and 7% PGM) and 79% from the Americas (19% U.S., 23% Canada and 37% Latin America). Costs and expenses were impacted by higher depletion expense and costs of sales due to the Candelaria acquisition. Oil & gas production levels were stable with the associated oil & gas revenue decreasing significantly year over year due to lower average oil & gas prices in 2015. Cash provided by operating activities before changes to working capital was $72.4 million. Corporate Updates Antamina: On October 9, 2015, Franco-Nevada closed the previously announced Antamina silver stream with Teck Resources Limited by providing a $610.0 million upfront payment. The payment was funded through a combination of cash on hand and a partial draw of the Company's credit facility. Antamina is expected to contribute between 900,000 to 1,100,000 silver ounces (12,300 to 15,000 GEOs) in Q4 2015. Cobre Panama: Franco-Nevada and First Quantum finalized terms of a replacement precious metals stream agreement on the Cobre Panama project. On November 3, 2015, Franco-Nevada made a $337.9 million initial upfront payment under its $1.0 billion commitment which was funded through cash on hand and proceeds from a partial draw of its credit facility. Credit Facility: Franco-Nevada has entered into an agreement to increase its credit facility to $1.0 billion while maintaining a $250.0 million accordion and extending the maturity to November 2020. Closing is expected to occur prior to the end of November. Portfolio Updates Gold - U.S.: GEOs from U.S. gold assets increased to 14,618 GEOs mainly due to higher production at Goldstrike, Bald Mountain and Gold Quarry, partially offset by lower production at Marigold and fewer ounces under the Fire Creek/Midas fixed deliveries due to a reduction of the monthly ounce obligation in 2015 compared to 2014. Klondex Mines released an updated Mineral Resource estimate for its Midas Mine and Fire Creek project and announced positive drill results from recent underground and surface drilling at its Midas Mine. Gold - Canada: GEOs from Canadian assets decreased in the quarter due to lower production at Hemlo and Sudbury. In Ontario, Lake Shore Gold and Kirkland Lake Gold both announced positive drill results at their respective projects where Franco-Nevada holds various interests. Pretium Resources announced a $540 million construction financing package for its Brucejack project where Franco-Nevada has a 1.2% NSR. At the Phoenix gold project, where Franco-Nevada holds a 2% NSR, Rubicon Minerals announced the temporary suspension of underground activities while it reviews its geological model and develops an implementation plan Gold - Latin America: Candelaria had a strong quarter delivering 19,081 GEOs to Franco-Nevada. During the quarter, Lundin Mining released an updated mine plan for Candelaria which reflected a 26% increase in precious metal production over the next four years. Under the Guadalupe stream agreement, Franco-Nevada funded $4.0 million during the quarter and the final instalment of $8.0 million subsequent to the quarter. Gold - Rest of World: Contributions from Sabodala and Mine Waste Solutions represented approximately 60% of the total GEOs received from Rest of World gold assets for Q3 2015. True Gold announced the commencement of mining at its Karma project and remains on track for gold production at the end of Q1 2016. Franco-Nevada funded $10.4 million in the quarter and $9.7 million subsequent to the quarter under the Karma stream agreement bringing the total funded to $63.4 million. Perseus Mining announced it had signed a Mining Convention with the Ivorian government on its Sissingue project and expects to make a production decision in the fourth quarter of 2015. PGM: PGM GEOs were impacted by declining palladium and platinum prices relative to gold in the quarter. Oil & gas: Revenue from oil & gas assets was $7.8 million in Q3 2015 with similar production levels as Q3 2014. The decrease in revenue is the result of lower average oil & gas prices. On November 6, 2015, Franco-Nevada acquired an additional 0.29% working interest in the Weyburn Unit for C$6.2 million. Dividend Declaration Franco-Nevada is pleased to announce that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.21 per share. The dividend will be paid on December 17, 2015 to shareholders of record on December 3, 2015.

Goldcorp Delivers Strong Free Cash Flow as Third Quarter Gold Production Increases 42% October 29, 2015 (All amounts in $US unless stated otherwise) VANCOUVER, Oct. 29, 2015 /CNW/ - GOLDCORP INC. (TSX: G, NYSE: GG) today reported record third quarter gold production1 of 922,200 ounces, an increase of 42% compared to gold production of 651,700 ounces in the third quarter of 2014. Adjusted quarterly revenues1 were $1.3 billion. Adjusted operating cash flow1,2 was $374 million, compared to $399 million for the third quarter of 2014. Free cash flow3 was $243 million, compared to negative free cash flow of $355 million for the third quarter of 2014. The reported net loss attributable to shareholders of Goldcorp for the quarter was $192 million, or $0.23 per share, compared to a net loss of $44 million, or $0.05 per share, for the third quarter of 2014. The adjusted net loss1,4 was $37 million, or $0.04 per share, compared to adjusted net earnings of $70 million, or $0.09 per share, for the third quarter of 2014. Included in the adjusted net loss is a reduction in the carrying values of inventory stockpiles of $40 million, or $0.05 per share. Third Quarter 2015 Highlights Gold sales1 of 942,600 ounces; gold production of 922,200 ounces. Free cash flow of $243 million before dividends; $168 million after dividends. Revolving credit facility fully repaid. Adjusted revenues of $1.3 billion. All-in sustaining costs1,5 of $848 per ounce. Adjusted operating cash flow of $374 million. Adjusted net loss of $37 million, or $0.04 per share. 2015 production and cost guidance re-confirmed. Announced joint venture (50/50) with Teck Resources Limited (\"Teck\") to combine El Morro and Relincho projects into a single project. \"Our third quarter results highlight the essence of Goldcorp's investment proposition: growing gold production, declining all-in sustaining costs and decreasing capital spending resulting in strong, sustained free cash flow, despite lower metals prices,\" said Chuck Jeannes, Goldcorp President and Chief Executive Officer. \"Record quarterly gold production, successful cost containment efforts and the wind-down of a capital investment program that has brought two high-quality gold mines into commercial production this year contributed to quarterly free cash flow of $243 million. The benefit of managing a strong portfolio of mines was illustrated in the quarter as good results at Penasquito, Cerro Negro and Musselwhite more than offset lower-than-expected production from Eleonore as the mine continues to ramp up. As a result, we remain on track to meet the upper end of our production guidance of between 3.3 and 3.6 million ounces at all-in sustaining costs of between $850 and $900 per ounce. Our focus over the balance of 2015 and into 2016 is on vigilant management of our costs in the current gold price environment, successful replacement of mined gold reserves and the prudent allocation of free cash flow to fortify our already-strong balance sheet and fund the next wave of Goldcorp's promising organic growth opportunities.\" Financial Review Third quarter gold sales were 942,600 ounces at an average realized gold price of $1,114per ounce on production of 922,200 ounces, compared to sales of 641,400 ounces at an average realized gold price of $1,266 per ounce on production of 651,700 ounces for the third quarter of 2014. Silver production totaled 11.3 million ounces compared to 7.8 million ounces in the prior year's third quarter. All-in sustaining costs were $848 per ounce of gold for the third quarter of 2015 compared to $1,066 per ounce in the third quarter of 2014. Excluding non-cash inventory impairments at Los Filos and Penasquito, all-in sustaining costs for the third quarter of 2015 would have been $802 per ounce. Adjusted revenues for the third quarter totaled $1.3 billion. The reported net loss attributable to shareholders of Goldcorp for the third quarter was $192 million, or $0.23 per share, compared to a net loss of $44 million, or $0.05 per share, for the third quarter of 2014. Adjusted net loss for the third quarter totaled $37 million, or $0.04 per share, compared to adjusted net earnings of $70 million, or $0.09 per share, for the third quarter of 2014. The adjusted net loss for the third quarter of 2015 primarily excludes the unrealized losses from the foreign exchange translation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities ($158 million, or $0.19 per share). The adjusted net loss includes the impact of non-cash stock-based compensation expenses which amounted to approximately $14 million, or $0.02 per share, for the quarter. Adjusted operating cash flow for the third quarter was $374 million, compared to $399 million for the third quarter of 2014. Canada At Eleonore in Quebec, third quarter safe gold production totaled 86,700 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $974 per ounce. Production increased over the prior quarter as a result of the expansion of underground mining from two to four horizons, in addition to successful mine optimization initiatives. Stoping productivity and mining flexibility continued to improve, contributing to higher underground mine tonnage quarter over quarter. Throughput during the quarter averaged 6,500 tonnes per day. While recoveries in the third quarter were impacted by the presence of iron sulphides in certain production stopes, metallurgical studies are underway that are expected to minimize the effect on future recoveries. As previously reported on September 8, 2015, initial production stopes at Eleonore are encountering folding and faulting resulting in higher dilution and therefore lower than planned mined grades and gold production. The folding is of varying intensities and is estimated to affect approximately 10% of the overall Eleonore deposit. The Eleonore team continues to work on adjusting stope designs to minimize these impacts. Work on the Eleonore crown pillar pre-feasibility study continued to advance during the third quarter. Major activities included the successful completion of summer field work, underground and surface infrastructure and stope sequencing determination of the dike location, and permitting and stakeholder engagement efforts. The pre-feasibility study is on track to be completed by the end of 2015. Safe gold production at Red Lake in Ontario in the third quarter totaled 77,600 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $1,028 per ounce. Production decreased over the prior quarter as a result of lower grades from remnant pillar mining at the Campbell Complex, the acceleration of development in the Sulphide Zones and lower-than-expected grades in the Footwall Zone. An exploration drift to access the HG Young discovery at depth continued to advance north on the 14 Level at the Campbell Complex. The drift provides a new platform for follow-up drilling down plunge of positive intercepts from the ongoing surface exploration program at HG Young. At Cochenour, exploration drilling continued to assess the core area of the deposit as well as at the tram level, where there have been changes in the orientation of the veins from prior interpretations. Detailed interpretation and analysis is ongoing to support final mine planning and infrastructure. Processing of mill feed from the initial sill-development work was consistent with expectations. Work is ongoing to define the timing of initial stope production and ramp up of Cochenour feed for processing at Red Lake. At Porcupine in Ontario, safe gold production for the third quarter was 71,000 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $882 per ounce. Production decreased over the prior quarter due to lower gold grades, driven primarily by the mining of lower-grade stopes at the Hoyle Pond underground, partially offset by higher tonnage milled as a result of improved mill operations during the quarter. The Hoyle Deep project, which will enable efficient access to lower portions of the Hoyle Pond deposit, continued to progress and remains on track to be fully operational in the first quarter of 2016. At the Hollinger open pit, the environmental control berm was completed in mid-October, enabling mining to take place 24 hours a day. At the Borden project 160 kilometres west of Porcupine, studies are underway to determine the optimization of a combined Borden-Porcupine operation. Options to access the deposit from underground are currently being evaluated in preparation for permit applications. Surface diamond drilling continued during the third quarter with seven drills on site. The current exploration activity in this new gold district remains focused on in-fill drilling with a target to convert a portion of the resources into reserves at the end of 2015. Safe gold production at Musselwhite in Ontario increased over the prior quarter to 71,000 ounces as a result of higher mill throughput and increased grades. Musselwhite's all-in sustaining cost continued to be among the lowest in the portfolio at $697 per ounce. The focus of the exploration program during the third quarter was on reserve replacement. Drilling concluded late in the third quarter on the West Limb zone and the Upper Lynx zone with positive results showing continuity of mineralization in both areas. All critical exploration development for the year is complete. Latin America At Penasquito in Mexico, safe gold production totaled 236,800 ounces for the quarter at an all-in sustaining cost of $467 per ounce. Production was driven primarily by higher gold grades in sulphide as a result of positive model reconciliation. In light of continued strong performance, production at Penasquito will exceed 2015 guidance of between 700,000 and 750,000 ounces. Construction of the Northern Well Field (\"NWF\") remained suspended throughout the third quarter of 2015 due to an illegal blockade by a local community. Penasquito continues to seek a fair resolution of this matter with the community, while taking steps to enforce its contractual rights. Penasquito is also advancing alternatives for completion of the project without crossing through the affected community lands. Contingency planning is ongoing for fresh water supply to the Penasquito mine until the NWF project is operational. The Company believes that there will be timely resolution of this matter to meet the future water needs of Penasquito. The Metallurgical Enhancement Project (\"MEP\") feasibility study continued, which included completion of pilot testing, confirming capital estimates and concentrate marketing studies. The feasibility study remains on schedule to be completed in early 2016. At the Camino Rojo project, ongoing pre-feasibility study work is focused on the evaluation of Camino Rojo as a supplemental source of sulphide feed to the existing Penasquito facility, in addition to a smaller, stand-alone oxide heap leach facility. An update of the geologic model continued during the third quarter and metallurgical testing of sulphide, transition and oxide zones is ongoing. The pre-feasibility study is on track to be completed in 2016. Safe gold production at Los Filos in Mexico for the third quarter of 2015 totaled 70,300 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $1,442 per ounce. Increased production over the prior quarter was a result of higher ore processed. The 2015 exploration program to enhance deeper phases of the El Bermejal pit and extend high grade zones for underground mining was completed. A new life-of-mine plan is progressing with a focus to maximize return on investment in the current lower price metals environment and is expected to be completed by the end of 2015. At Cerro Negro in Argentina, third quarter safe gold production totaled 135,700 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $731 per ounce, driven by the continued strong ramp-up at both the Mariana Central and Eureka mines. Total tonnes milled increased resulting in an average throughput rate of 3,697 tonnes per day for the quarter. Average milling rates for September surpassed the nameplate capacity of 4,000 tonnes per operating day. Exploration in the third quarter continued to focus on surface resource confirmation drilling. The current drilling program is progressing as planned, expanding resources at the Marianas Complex, particularly at the newly-discovered Emilia vein. The Bajo Negro expansion was completed in the third quarter and the results will be included within the year-end resource update. On September 30, 2015, a work stoppage took place at Cerro Negro by miners represented by the Asociacion Obrera Minera Argentina, Province of Santa Cruz. All work activity resumed on October 5, 2015 following the declaration of a mandatory minimum 15-day conciliation period by the Santa Cruz Provincial Secretariat of Labour. Subsequent to the expiration of the conciliation period productive negotiations continue. The Company remains committed to working cooperatively with union representatives and government authorities on a fair and equitable resolution. At the Pueblo Viejo joint venture in the Dominican Republic, Goldcorp's share of third quarter safe gold and silver production totaled 115,000 ounces and 502,700 ounces, respectively, at an all-in sustaining cost of $585 per ounce. Gold production increased over the prior quarter as a result of higher tonnes processed, grades and recoveries. Silver production increased primarily due to higher recoveries. Tonnage processed was higher in the third quarter due to the prior quarter being impacted by autoclave and counter current decantation thickener maintenance. Silver recoveries were higher due to the shut-down of the lime boil tanks during autoclave maintenance in the prior quarter. At El Morro in Chile, an agreement was reached with Teck on August 27, 2015 to combine the El Morro and Relincho projects into a 50/50 joint venture. In addition, an agreement was reached with New Gold to acquire New Gold's 30% interest in the El Morro project for$90 million in cash upon closing, and a 4% gold stream on future gold production from the El Morro property. Closing of both transactions is expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2015. The project will undertake extensive engagement with communities and other stakeholders to help guide the project's development. In combination with community consultation, a pre-feasibility study is expected to commence in mid-2016. 2015 Guidance Outlook The Company today reconfirmed 2015 production guidance, expected to be at the upper-end of between 3.3 and 3.6 million gold ounces. All-in sustaining costs are expected to be between $850 and $900 per gold ounce; $500 and $550 per ounce on a by-product basis; and $625 to $675 per ounce on a co-product basis. Depreciation, depletion and amortization (\"DD&A\") will increase to $450 per gold ounce from the previous guidance of$425 per gold ounce due primarily to production coming from our newer and higher DD&A per ounce sites and additional assets placed in service earlier than anticipated. Capital spending guidance remains unchanged at between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion for 2015. Corporate administration expense guidance, excluding share-based compensation, is expected to be approximately $170 million in 2015. Excluding the impacts of foreign exchange on current and deferred tax assets and liabilities and excluding the dilution and disposition gains on the sale of mining interests and the related taxes, the Company continues to expect an annual effective tax rate on adjusted earnings subject to income tax of 45% in 2015.

In the third quarter of 2015, operating cash flow before stream deposit and change in non-cash working capital increased to $79.9 million from $12.1 million in the third quarter of 2014. The net loss and loss per share in the third quarter of 2015 were $11.8 million and $0.05, respectively, compared to net earnings and earnings per share of$46.2 million and $0.21, respectively, in the third quarter of 2014. Net loss and loss per share in the third quarter of 2015 were affected by, among other things, the following items: Pre-tax loss ($ millions) After-tax loss ($ millions) Per share loss  Hudbay expects to achieve full year 2015 production and cost guidance for all of its operations. Financial and Operating Results Starting with its results for the period ended September 30, 2015, Hudbay has changed its reporting currency to US dollars; accordingly, amounts are in US dollars unless otherwise noted. All comparable figures have been restated in US dollars, as per Note 4 of the unaudited condensed interim financial statements. Operating cash flows before stream deposit and changes in non-cash working capital increased 559% to $79.9 million for the three months ending September 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was the result of significant growth in production and sales of most metals as the Constancia mine achieved commercial production at the end of April 2015. Metals production increases included 389% for copper, 329% for silver, 45% for gold and 7% for zinc, and cash cost per pound of copper produced, net of by-product credits, was $0.90. While operating cash flows benefitted from the significant increase in sales volumes and a low cash cost, these factors were partly offset by lower realized prices for all metals when compared to the prior year's quarter. However, net earnings decreased by $58.0 million. This change occurred primarily as a result of a $34.5 million impairment charge associated with equipment inherited from the acquisition of Augusta. In addition, in the third quarter of 2014, Hudbay recorded net gains of $56.2 million related to the Augusta acquisition. Financial Performance ($000s except per share and cash cost amounts) Three months ended September 30 Nine months ended September 30  Attributable to owners of the Company. Operating cash flow per share and cash cost per pound of copper produced, net of by-product credits are non-IFRS financial performance measures with no standardized definition under IFRS. For further information and a detailed reconciliation, please see page 4 of this news release. Metal reported in concentrate is prior to refining losses or deductions associated with smelter contract terms. During the third quarter of 2015, shipments of copper concentrate from the Constancia mine to the port in Matarani were principally constrained by truck driver availability, and truck turnaround time due to road refurbishment. Due to these issues and the rapid ramp up in production, concentrate on site increased to approximately 65,000 tonnes at quarter end. With a significant increase in trucking capacity in Peru since the middle of September, considerable progress has been made in moving the excess copper concentrate from the Constancia site to port. The majority of the excess inventory is expected to be sold during the fourth quarter. Since September 30, 2015, inventory levels at the Constancia mine site have declined by approximately 30%. As at September 30, 2015, Hudbay had total liquidity of approximately $300 million, including $114 million in cash and cash equivalents as well as commitments under its revolving credit facility. This does not include approximately $60 million in expected net cash flow from the sale of excess unsold copper concentrate inventory. Recent Developments As indicated, there was an impairment loss recognized of $34.5 million to reflect the orderly liquidation value of the previously purchased equipment and certain long lead equipment deposits in the Arizona business unit. This followed from the completion of a value engineering process in the second and third quarters of 2015, which deemed that certain equipment previously purchased or ordered by prior Augusta management is unsuitable to achieve the design objectives for Rosemont, and that different equipment will better meet Rosemont's objectives while observing permitting commitments. Although Hudbay's valuation assumptions in determining the Augusta purchase price allocation allowed for additional capital spending beyond Augusta's previous guidance, the purchase price allocation valued this equipment at cost based on the information available at the time. The collective agreements with each of the seven labour unions representing employees at Hudbay's Manitoba business unit expired on December 31, 2014. All seven unions have now ratified new three-year agreements that provide enhancements to wage rates, pensions and benefits. The labour disruption experienced in the second and third quarters ended in late August. On November 2, 2015, Hudbay completed the sale of Balmat Holding Corporation to Northern Zinc, LLC and Northern Zinc, LLC was concurrently acquired byStar Mountain Resources, Inc. (\"Star Mountain\"). On closing, Hudbay received 550,000 shares of Star Mountain common stock and $1 million in cash; Hudbay previously received $0.5 million in upfront deposit payments and is entitled to receive up to an additional $15.5 million in future cash payments or, at Star Mountain's election, $7 million in cash within three months of the closing date. Peru Operations Review During the third quarter of 2015, mining operations continued as planned and cost optimization is underway. Equipment availabilities are within design parameters and both loading and hauling efficiencies remain consistent with expectations. Optimization of plant performance remains the primary focus, as more is understood about varying ore types. During September, copper recoveries plateaued at 80% due to a greater presence of oxide minerals than previously anticipated in the upper sequence of the mine. However, metals production targets continue to be achieved as the reduced ore recovery has been offset by higher-than-expected copper grades and ore throughput. Monthly ore throughput increased from 2 million tonnes in July to 2.6 million tonnes in September. Commissioning of the molybdenum concentrate circuit has been delayed into the fourth quarter due to the availability of key reagents and due to ore characteristics. Metal production and combined operating costs per tonne at Constancia are expected to be within guidance ranges for 2015. Manitoba Operations Review For the third quarter of 2015, ore processed was relatively consistent compared to the same period of 2014. Compared to the same quarter of the prior year, gold, zinc and copper grades were 17%, 6% and 5% higher, respectively, and silver grades were 15% lower as a result of normal mine sequencing. Combined operating costs per tonne of ore processed in the third quarter of 2015 were 34% higher, compared to the same period in 2014, primarily due to increased commercial production at the Snow Lake operations, which have higher unit costs, as well as increased unit costs at the Flin Flon operations resulting from decreased production at the 777 mine. In the fourth quarter of 2015, Hudbay expects to realize sequential improvements in metals production and unit costs per tonne of ore processed as the 777 mine is beginning to benefit from the effects of its planned mine fleet renewal. Metal production and combined operating costs per tonne in Manitoba are expected to be within guidance ranges for 2015. Non-IFRS Financial Performance Measures Operating cash flow per share and cash cost per pound of copper produced are included in this news release because the company believes that, in the case of operating cash flow per share, it helps investors and management to evaluate changes in cash flow while taking into account changes in shares outstanding, and in the case of cash cost per pound of copper produced, it helps investors assess the performance the company's operations. These measures do not have a meaning prescribed by IFRS and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with IFRS and are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under IFRS. Other companies may calculate these measures differently. Operating Cash Flow per Share The following table presents Hudbay's calculation of operating cash flow per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014: ($000s except shares and per share amounts) Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30  Operating cash flow per share is before stream deposit and change in non-cash working capital. It is a non-IFRS financial performance measure with no standardized meaning under IFRS. Reconciliation of Cash Cost, After By-product Credits (non-IFRS) to Cost of Sales (IFRS) Cash cost per pound of copper produced (\"cash cost\") is a non-IFRS measure that management uses as a key performance indicator to assess the performance of the company's operations. Hudbay's calculation designates copper as its primary metal of production as it has been, and is expected to be, the largest component of revenues. Two changes have been made to the cash cost calculation beginning with reporting for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015. First, the basis of measurement has been changed from pounds of copper sold to pounds of copper produced. This change has been made to better align the costs of production with copper produced in the same period and reduce the variation in cash cost due to inventory sales timing. Second, royalties have been removed from the cash cost. This change increases consistency between Hudbay's cash cost calculation and industry peers. The calculation is presented in two manners: Cash cost, before by-product credits - This measure is gross of by-product revenues and is a function of the efforts and costs incurred to mine and process all ore mined. However, the measure divides this aggregate cost over only pounds of copper produced, Hudbay's primary metal of production. This measure is generally less volatile from period to period, as it is not affected by changes in the price received for by-product metals. It is, however, significantly affected by the relative mix of copper concentrate and finished zinc production, and an increase in production of zinc metal will tend to result in an increase in cash costs under this measure. Cash cost, net of by-product credits - In order to calculate the cost to produce and sell copper, the net of by-product credits measure subtracts the revenues realized from the sale of the metals other than copper. The by-product revenues from zinc, gold, silver, and molybdenum are significant and are integral to the economics of Hudbay's operations. The economics that support Hudbay's decision to produce and sell copper would be different if the company did not receive revenues from the other significant metals being extracted and processed. This measure provides management and investors with an indication of the minimum copper price consistent with positive operating cash flows and operating margins, assuming that realized by-product metal prices are consistent with those prevailing during the reporting period. It also serves as an important operating statistic that management and investors utilize to measure Hudbay's operating performance versus that of its competitors. However, it is important to understand that if by-product metal prices decline alongside copper prices, the cash cost net of by-product credits would increase, requiring a higher copper price than that reported to maintain positive cash flows and operating margins.

OCT 28, 2015 - 17:30 ET Lundin Mining Third Quarter Results TORONTO, ONTARIO--(Marketwired - Oct. 28, 2015) - Lundin Mining Corporation (\"Lundin Mining\" or the \"Company\") (TSX: LUN) (OMX: LUMI) today reported a net loss of $35.3 million or a net loss attributable to Lundin shareholders (after deducting non-controlling interests) of $34.6 million ($0.05 per share) for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. Cash flows of $120.2 million were generated from operations in the quarter, not including the Company's attributable cash flows from Tenke Fungurume. The Company continued to strengthen its balance sheet, generating free-cash flow and reducing net debt during the quarter by a further $43.4 million to $453.8 million, despite lower metal prices and negative price adjustments of $56.4 million related to the re-pricing of provisional sales from prior periods. Mr. Paul Conibear, President and CEO commented, \"We are pleased that our operations continue to generate healthy cash flows despite the low commodity price environment. Our continued focus on cost efficiency and productivity enhancements has enabled us to maintain all mines producing at low cash costs with good margins, and we have been able to reduce our annual capital expenditure guidance by a further $40 million, while maintaining our production profile intact. The combination of our strong balance sheet and steady operations helps ensure that Lundin will remain in a favorable position to continue to generate excellent shareholder value moving forward.\"  Operating earnings is a non-GAAP measure defined as sales, less operating costs (excluding depreciation) and general and administrative costs. Net debt is a non-GAAP measure defined as cash and cash equivalents, less long-term debt and finance leases, before deferred financing fees. Highlights Operational Performance For the third quarter of 2015, production results were strong but financial results were impacted by a lower metal price environment. The Company remains on track to meet overall full year guidance. Candelaria (80%): The Candelaria operations produced, on a 100% basis, 45,195 tonnes of copper, and approximately 434,000 ounces of silver and 25,400 ounces of gold in concentrate, with copper and gold production better than expectations as a result of higher throughput. Copper cash costs1 of $1.44/lb for the quarter remain on track to meet full year guidance of $1.35/lb. Eagle (100%): Eagle's operational results were generally in-line with expectations, with both nickel (6,438 tonnes) and copper (6,514 tonnes) production meeting projections for the quarter. Nickel cash costs of $2.38/lb for the quarter were higher than full year guidance of $2.00/lb largely as a result of lower copper by-product credits. Both production and nickel cash costs remain on track to meet full year guidance. Neves-Corvo (100%): Neves-Corvo produced 13,917 tonnes of copper and 14,363 tonnes of zinc in the third quarter. Copper production exceeded the prior year comparable period by 28% due to higher head grades. Zinc production fell short of the prior year comparable period, resulting from lower mill feed grades and, in particular, below target metal recovery in the zinc plant. Copper cash costs of $1.83/lb for the quarter were higher than full year guidance ($1.55/lb) due primarily to lower by-product production and sales. Zinkgruvan (100%): Zinc production in the third quarter of 2015 was 8% lower than the comparable period in 2014, while lead production for the third quarter of 2015 was higher than the 2014 comparable period. Production variances for both metals were due to normal variations of grades in the ore milled. Cash costs for zinc of $0.41/lb for the quarter were in-line with guidance ($0.40/lb). Aguablanca (100%): Despite the suspension of underground mining operations during the quarter, Aguablanca met production expectations, though current quarter production of 1,708 tonnes of nickel and 1,658 tonnes of copper was lower than the prior year comparable period due to lower throughput, head grades, and recoveries from stockpiled ore. Cash costs of $5.23/lb of nickel for the quarter were higher than full year guidance ($3.75/lb). Tenke (24%): Tenke operations continue to perform well. Lundin's attributable share of third quarter production included 11,761 tonnes of copper cathode and 954 tonnes of cobalt in hydroxide. The Company's attributable share of sales included 12,278 tonnes of copper at an average realized price of $2.32/lb and 1,022 tonnes of cobalt at an average realized price of $8.96/lb. Tenke operating cash costs for the third quarter of 2015 were $1.15/lb of copper sold, marginally higher than the latest guidance. Cash distributions received by Lundin Mining in the quarter from Tenke were $2.5 million. An additional $1.2 million was received from the Freeport Cobalt operations. Year-to-date cash distributions to the Company from Tenke and Freeport Cobalt totalled $20.6 million, in-line with expectations. Cash cost/lb of copper, zinc and nickel are non-GAAP measures defined as all cash costs directly attributable to mining operations, less royalties and by-product credits.  Financial Performance Operating earnings for the quarter ended September 30, 2015 were $94.1 million, an increase of $51.2 million in comparison to the third quarter of the prior year ($42.9 million). The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of Candelaria's ($66.7 million) and Eagle's ($18.5 million) operating results. Operating earnings were also positively impacted by favourable foreign exchange rates ($19.1 million), partially offset by lower realized metal prices and price adjustments ($58.4 million) from our European operations. On a year-to-date basis, operating earnings were $611.1 million, an increase of $450.8 million in comparison to the first nine months of 2014 ($160.3 million). The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of Candelaria's ($371.8 million) and Eagle's ($114.9 million) operating results, and favourable foreign exchange rates ($60.5 million), partially offset by lower realized metal prices and price adjustments ($131.1 million) from our European operations. Sales for the quarter ended September 30, 2015 were $353.2 million, an increase of $186.6 million in comparison to the third quarter of the prior year ($166.6 million). The increase was mainly due to incremental sales from Candelaria and Eagle of $192.0 million and $60.0 million, respectively, partially offset by lower realized metal prices and price adjustments. On a year-to-date basis, sales were $1,386.0 million, an increase of $877.7 million in comparison to the first nine months of 2014 ($508.3 million). The increase was mainly due to incremental sales from Candelaria and Eagle of $740.7 million and $233.4 million, respectively, and higher net European sales volumes ($45.6 million), partially offset by lower realized metal prices and price adjustments. Average metal prices for copper, nickel and zinc for the quarter ended September 30, 2015 were lower (25%, 43%, and 20%, respectively) in comparison to the third quarter of the prior year. On a year-to-date basis, average metal prices for copper, nickel and zinc were lower (18%, 27%, and 5%, respectively) in comparison to the first nine months of 2014. Operating costs (excluding depreciation) for the quarter ended September 30, 2015 were $252.3 million, an increase of $134.7 million in comparison to the third quarter of the prior year ($117.6 million). The increase was largely due to incremental costs from Candelaria and Eagle of $125.2 million and $41.5 million, respectively, partially offset by favourable foreign exchange rates in the EUR and SEK ($19.1 million). On a year-to-date basis, operating costs (excluding depreciation) were $754.5 million, an increase of $425.7 million in comparison to the first nine months of 2014 ($328.8 million). The increase was largely due to incremental costs from Candelaria and Eagle of $368.9 million and $118.5 million, respectively, partially offset by favourable foreign exchange rates in the EUR and SEK ($60.5 million). Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 when measured against the comparable period in 2014. The increase was attributable to the acquisition of Candelaria (Q3 2015 - $58.6 million; YTD - $224.4 million) and the start of commercial production at Eagle (Q3 2015 - $32.0 million; YTD - $102.7 million). Cash flow from operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2015 was $120.2 million, an increase of $62.7 million in comparison to the third quarter of the prior year ($57.5 million). The increase was primarily due to operating earnings from Candelaria ($66.7 million) and Eagle ($18.5 million), and changes in non-cash working capital and long-term inventory ($50.8 million), partially offset by lower operating earnings at our European operations ($33.7 million), primarily due to lower metal prices and higher net income taxes paid ($33.6 million). On a year-to-date basis, cash flow from operations was $606.9 million, an increase of $488.1 million in comparison to the first nine months of 2014 ($118.8 million). The increase was attributable to operating earnings from Candelaria ($371.8 million) and Eagle ($114.9 million), and changes in non-cash working capital and long-term inventory ($138.3 million), partially offset by higher net income taxes paid ($71.7 million) and lower operating earnings at our European operations ($33.8 million). Net loss for the quarter ended September 30, 2015 was $35.3 million compared to net earnings of $33.7 million in the third quarter of the prior year. Net loss was impacted by: lower net earnings at our European operations, primarily the result of lower realized metal prices and price adjustments ($27.8 million); and interest expense associated with the senior secured notes ($20.2 million); andlower income from investment in Tenke ($19.3 million). On a year-to-date basis, net earnings were $101.8 million, an increase of $15.0 million in comparison to the first nine months of 2014 ($86.8 million). Net earnings were impacted by: addition of Candelaria ($112.9 million) and Eagle's first three full quarters of operations ($19.9 million); partially offset by interest expense associated with the senior secured notes ($60.0 million); and lower income from investment in Tenke ($43.0 million); and lower net earnings at our European operations, primarily the result of lower realized metal prices and price adjustments ($18.3 million). Corporate Highlights On July 23, 2015, the Company announced approval of the Environmental Impact Assessment (\"EIA\") for Candelaria 2030 - the project to install new tailings storage facilities and approvals for continued mine operation running to at least year 2030. Financial Position and Financing Net debt position at September 30, 2015 was $453.8 million compared to $829.2 million at December 31, 2014 and $497.2 million at June 30, 2015. The $43.4 million decrease in net debt during the quarter was largely attributable to operating cash flows of $120.2 million, partially offset by investments in mineral properties, plant and equipment of $73.0 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, net debt decreased by $375.4 million due primarily to operating cash flows of $606.9 million, partially offset by investments in mineral properties, plant and equipment of $215.7 million. The Company has a revolving credit facility available for borrowing up to $350 million. As at September 30, 2015, the Company had no amount drawn on the credit facility. A letter of credit in the amount of $19.3 million (SEK 162 million) is outstanding. Net debt at October 28, 2015 is approximately $448 million. Outlook 2015 Production and Cost Guidance Production and cash cost guidance for 2015 has been updated from that disclosed in our Management Discussion and Analysis for the six months ended June 30, 2015, as noted below. Production guidance ranges for all sites have been narrowed to account for production results to date. Cash cost guidance at Neves-Corvo has been increased slightly ($0.05/lb) to reflect lower expected sales of by-products and lower metal prices. Cash cost and production guidance for the Aguablanca Mine reflects that all mining and milling activities are suspended at the Aguablanca nickel-copper mine in Spain. Underground production activities at the operation have been in suspension since late July of 2015. Since that time, the processing plant has been running exclusively on stockpiled material, which has now been exhausted. As the Company has not yet received the needed environmental approvals to recommence underground mining, a decision has been made to fully suspend the operations pending further notice. The full year guidance for cash costs and production are based on an estimate of October production and may change slightly upon finalization of assays and financial results. Guidance on Tenke's cash costs have been updated to reflect the most recent guidance provided by Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (\"Freeport\").  Guidance as outlined in our Management's Discussion and Analysis for the quarter ended June 30, 2015. Cash costs remain dependent upon exchange rates (forecast at EUR/USD:1.15, USD/SEK:8.25, USD/CLP:680) and metal prices (forecast at Cu: $2.50/lb, Ni: $5.00/lb, Zn: $0.85/lb, Pb: $0.80/lb, Au: $1,100/oz, Ag: $15.00/oz, Co: $13.00/lb). Prior guidance forecast USD/CLP at 625, Cu at $2.70/lb, Ni at $6.25/lb and Zn at $0.95/lb. Freeport has provided 2015 sales and cash costs guidance. Tenke's 2015 production is assumed to approximate sales guidance. 2015 Capital Expenditure and Exploration Guidance Capital expenditures for 2015 are expected to be $310 million (excluding Tenke), $40 million less than previous guidance. The Company expects to spend $20 million less on sustaining capital expenditures at our Candelaria and Neves-Corvo operations as part of on-going efforts to defer or reduce non-essential spending during the current metal price environment.  Guidance as outlined in our Management's Discussion and Analysis for the quarter ended June 30, 2015. The Company estimates its share of expansion related initiatives and sustaining capital funding for 2015 at Tenke to be $80 million, unchanged from previous guidance. All of the capital expenditures are expected to be self-funded by cash flow from Tenke operations. The Company expects to receive cash distributions from Tenke in 2015 of approximately $20 million, at the lower end of previous guidance of $20 - $30 million. The total exploration expense is expected to be $60 million, unchanged from previous guidance.

(TSE: POT) Who we are PotashCorp is the world's largest fertilizer company by capacity, producing the three primary crop nutrients: potash (K), nitrogen (N) and phosphate (P). We are the world's leading potash producer by capacity and our Canadian operations represent nearly one-fifth of global capacity1. To enhance our global footprint, we also have investments in four potash-related businesses in South America, the Middle East and Asia. With operations and business interests in seven countries, PotashCorp is an international enterprise and plays an important role in helping the world grow the food it needs. What we produce Our potash, phosphate and nitrogen products help provide the primary nutrients that crops need. They are also used to make livestock feeds and industrial goods. Produced from mineral deposits (potash and phosphate) and from the air we breathe (nitrogen), our main products are: potash, in standard and granular grades DAP (diammonium phosphate), MAP (monoammonium phosphate) and phosphoric acid Ammonia and urea Why fertilizer? With world population rising, arable land per person diminishing and demand increasing for higher quality diets that include more fruits and vegetables and protein from crop-fed livestock, the need to maximize the efficiency of farmland has never been greater. Every crop harvested removes nutrients from the soil, which must be replaced to keep soil healthy and productive. Responsible for more than 40 percent of the world's total crop yield, fertilizers feed plants, which help to feed animals and people. Where we serve Our products serve customers throughout the global marketplace from China, the world's most populous nation and largest fertilizer consumer, to India, with its 1.2 billion people. From Latin America an agricultural superpower to the rice and oil palm producing fields of Other Asian countries and the breadbasket markets of North America. Together these five regions account for nearly three-quarters of the world's population and roughly 80 percent of the total fertilizer consumption. Delivering when we're needed As the world's food challenges become more pressing, we're taking an active role in meeting them, investing heavily in our assets to deliver quality product when and where our customers need it. We are adding to our current potash capacity without building a new mine - an advantage as demand is expected to rise. And through our partnerships and investments, we strive to better serve customers in emerging markets. How we do business We hold ourselves to the highest business standards and consider factors beyond financial performance when evaluating our success. Guided by our Core Values, we cultivate mutually beneficial relationships with our communities, customers, employees, investors and other people critical to our success. Acting with a long-term view, we make decisions that consider people and the planet, always looking for opportunities to improve. OCT 29 2015 Q3: PotashCorp Reports 2015 Third-Quarter Earnings of $0.34 per Share Key Highlights Third-quarter earnings of $0.34 per share1, including $0.03 per share related to notable non-cash charges, primarily in phosphate Annual earnings guidance adjusted to $1.55 - $1.65 per share Preparing for closure of Penobsquis mine and inventory shutdowns at Cory, Allan and Lanigan CEO Commentary \"Broader emerging market concerns have weighed on customer sentiment, contributing to a weaker fertilizer environment in the second half of 2015,\" said PotashCorp President and Chief Executive Officer Jochen Tilk. \"In response, we are moving forward the permanent closure date of our Penobsquis, New Brunswick mine and planning inventory shutdowns in December at three of our Saskatchewan mines. While we anticipate production in the fourth quarter to be reduced by nearly 500,000 tonnes, we do not expect employee layoffs.\" \"Despite challenges over recent months, we are seeing signs of a shift in focus by distributors and farmers to 2016,\" Tilk said. \"We believe the need for increased global agricultural production - coupled with supportive crop prices - provides a compelling opportunity for farmers.\" Saskatoon, Saskatchewan - Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc. (PotashCorp) reported third-quarter earnings of $0.34 per share ($282 million), bringing the nine-month total to $1.28 per share ($1.1 billion). Earnings for both the quarter and the first nine months modestly trailed 2014's comparable period amounts of $0.38 per share ($317 million) and $1.33 per share ($1.1 billion), respectively. Gross margin for the quarter totaled $505 million, below the $589 million generated during the third quarter of 2014, primarily due to weaker nitrogen contributions. For the first nine months, improved potash and phosphate contributions largely offset weaker nitrogen performance, as gross margin totaled $1.9 billion, relatively flat compared to the same period in 2014. Cash from operating activities of $358 million in the third quarter and $1.7 billion for the first nine months of 2015 were below last year's comparable totals of $574 million and $1.9 billion, respectively. Earnings before finance costs, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization (EBITDA)2 of $593 million for the quarter and $2.1 billion for the first nine months were also below 2014's comparative figures. Investments in Arab Potash Company (APC) in Jordan, Israel Chemicals Ltd. (ICL) in Israel and Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile S.A. (SQM) in Chile contributed $37 million to our quarterly earnings, exceeding the $24 million earned in third-quarter 2014. Our nine-month total of $134 million, which included a dividend from Sinofert Holdings Limited (Sinofert) in China, was down from last year's total of $179 million when we received a $69 million special dividend from ICL. The market value of our investments in these four publicly traded companies equated to approximately $4 billion, or $5 per PotashCorp share, at market close on October 28, 2015. Market Conditions Global potash demand remained strong during the quarter as higher volumes to Brazil, India and China helped offset slower purchasing in other markets. With many buyers moving cautiously amidst economic headwinds and significant currency volatility, prices declined in most key potash markets. In nitrogen, prices for nearly all products were lower compared to third-quarter 2014 as market fundamentals weakened. Rising global supply due in part to lower energy prices - combined with weaker shipments to Latin America - largely overshadowed strong demand from India compared to 2014. In phosphate, markets for solid fertilizer remained relatively stable. Increased Chinese exports and weaker demand in Latin America more than offset stronger Indian demand and resulted in relatively flat pricing. Other phosphate products were supported by strong demand in North America and India, driving prices for liquid fertilizers, feed and industrial products above those of 2014's third quarter. Potash Potash gross margin of $294 million for 2015's third quarter was relatively flat compared to the same period last year. This result raised our total for the first nine months to $1.1 billion, 15 percent higher than the comparable period of 2014, primarily due to slightly higher realized prices and lower costs. Shipments for the quarter reached 2.2 million tonnes, increasing the total for the first nine months of 2015 to 7.0 million tonnes driven largely by offshore demand. Sales volumes for both the quarter and the full year surpassed the results for the comparable periods in 2014. Offshore shipments reached 1.5 million tonnes in the third quarter, with the majority of Canpotex's3 volumes to Latin America (40 percent) and Other Asian markets (29 percent), while India and China accounted for 15 percent and 11 percent, respectively. North American sales totaled 0.7 million tonnes. Our average realized potash price of $250 per tonne in the third quarter was down from $281 per tonne in the same period last year due to declining prices in North America and a higher percentage of sales volumes to lower-netback offshore markets. Cost of goods sold of $113 per tonne in the third quarter was 14 percent lower than the same period last year due to the favorable impact of a weakened Canadian dollar and the deferral of annual maintenance at certain locations to the fourth quarter of 2015. Nitrogen Weaker nitrogen prices and lower sales volumes resulted in third-quarter gross margin of $161 million, 31 percent below 2014's comparable period. These factors also caused our nine-month total of $564 million to trail last year's record level. Our US operations accounted for 60 percent of our nitrogen gross margin for the quarter, with Trinidad providing the remainder. Weaker demand, mechanical issues and a planned turnaround at our recently expanded Lima facility kept third-quarter and nine-month sales volumes (1.4 million and 4.4 million tonnes, respectively) below the comparable periods in 2014. Our average realized price of $319 per tonne during the quarter declined from $356 per tonne in the same period last year as lower energy prices and increased global supply weighed on benchmark prices and realizations for all our products. Cost of goods sold for the third quarter was $210 per tonne, relatively flat compared to the same period of 2014. The negative impact of reduced sales volumes was partly offset by lower natural gas costs in the US and Trinidad. Phosphate Third-quarter phosphate gross margin totaled $50 million, trailing the $61 million earned during the same period last year as higher sales volumes and prices were more than offset by increased costs. For the first nine months, gross margin totaled $180 million, exceeding the $135 million generated in the same period of 2014, which included accelerated depreciation charges related to the closure of our Suwannee River chemical plant. Sales volumes of 0.8 million tonnes for the quarter were slightly above the same period in 2014, while the 2.1 million tonnes sold in the first nine months of 2015 was 11 percent lower than the previous year's total due primarily to the absence of production from Suwannee River. Our average realized phosphate price for the third quarter was $538 per tonne, up from the $517 per tonne realized in the same period last year, primarily reflecting higher netbacks for liquid fertilizer products. Cost of goods sold of $475 per tonne in the third quarter was 9 percent higher than the same period in 2014. Increased reliability maintenance, a negative adjustment to our asset retirement obligations and other period costs exceeded the notable charges taken in last year's third quarter and more than offset the positive impact of increased sales volumes. Financial Provincial mining and other taxes for the third quarter increased to $79 million from the $52 million recorded in 2014, reflecting the impact of a weaker Canadian dollar and lower deductible costs due to changes in Saskatchewan's potash taxation regulations in early 2015. Lower total earnings and a discrete tax recovery resulted in income tax expense declining to $90 million in the third quarter, down from $156 million during 2014's comparable period which included a discrete tax expense. In August, we closed the acquisition of our 9.5 percent stake in Brazil-based Fertilizantes Heringer S.A. and entered into a long-term potash supply agreement with the company. Market Outlook Despite broad economic uncertainty, we continue to see strong underlying consumption trends across most key potash markets. We maintain our forecast for 2015 global shipments of 58 to 60 million tonnes, although we no longer expect they will reach the high end of this range. In North America, cautious buying patterns in the third quarter are expected to keep total potash shipments for the year below 2014 levels. Although we anticipate healthy fall application demand will support fourth-quarter shipments, we now forecast total 2015 deliveries of 8.5-9.0 million tonnes. In Latin America, while we expect potash shipments will remain at historically strong levels, credit challenges and currency volatility are likely to result in demand below last year's record level. For the full year, we forecast shipments of 10.5-11.0 million tonnes. In China, we anticipate that encouraging consumption trends for compound fertilizers and bulk blends will support healthy demand through the fourth quarter. We have slightly lowered our total potash shipment range for 2015 to 14.0-14.5 million tonnes to reflect modestly lower deliveries due to the recently implemented value-added tax on fertilizer sales. In India, we remain encouraged by rising consumption trends for compound fertilizers, even in the absence of subsidy reform. Despite this trend, we have lowered our full-year potash shipment estimate to 4.2-4.5 million tonnes due to currency volatility and a weaker-than-normal monsoon. In Other Asian markets (outside of China and India), we have slightly lowered our estimate for potash shipments to 8.3-8.7 million tonnes to reflect lower demand caused by weaker local currencies and adverse weather conditions affecting application requirements in certain regions. Financial Outlook In light of these market factors, we have revised full-year expectations for our potash business. We have lowered our sales volume guidance to a range of 9.0-9.2 million tonnes and now expect potash gross margin of $1.4-$1.5 billion, reflecting weaker volumes and pricing. Consistent with our long-held strategy of matching supply to demand, we are accelerating the permanent closure date of our Penobsquis mine in New Brunswick to the end of November (annual operational capability of approximately 800,000 tonnes). While this will reduce available production levels until our new Picadilly mine is fully ramped up, it is expected to improve our cost profile and help manage inventories. We are also preparing to take three-week inventory shutdowns at our Allan, Cory and Lanigan operations in Saskatchewan, beginning in mid-December. The combination of these shutdowns and the closure of Penobsquis is expected to reduce fourth-quarter production by nearly 500,000 tonnes and lead to slightly higher per-tonne cost of goods sold. We expect there will be no impact on our employment levels at these locations. We have lowered the top end of our previous combined nitrogen and phosphate gross margin guidance range and now estimate we will generate between $1.0-$1.1 billion. In nitrogen, we expect total gross margin below last year's record as increased global supply is expected to keep prices for most products below 2014 levels. Additionally, weaker North American demand, reduced production due to mechanical challenges and an expansion-related turnaround at Lima are expected to keep sales volumes below last year's levels. In phosphate, supportive market fundamentals and our higher-netback product mix are expected to support gross margin above 2014 levels. We have increased our estimate for provincial mining and other taxes to a range of 21-23 percent of potash gross margin due to a weaker Canadian dollar and lower deductible costs. We have lowered our range for income from offshore equity investments to $165-$175 million due to a weaker-than-expected potash earnings environment and we have also slightly increased our estimate for selling and administrative expenses to a range of $245-$250 million. Due to the continued strength of the US dollar, we have revised our full-year foreign exchange rate assumption to CDN$1.26 per US dollar. As a result of the noted changes, we have revised our full-year 2015 earnings guidance to $1.55-$1.65 per share. Other annual guidance numbers - including those noted above - are outlined in the table below. 2015 Guidance  Silver Wheaton Corp.

ANOTHER RECORD QUARTER OF SILVER EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION AND SALES VOLUME FOR SILVER WHEATON IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2015 11/03/2015 VANCOUVER, Nov. 3, 2015 /CNW/ - Silver Wheaton Corp. (\"Silver Wheaton\" or the \"Company\") (TSX: SLW) (NYSE:SLW) is pleased to announce its unaudited results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2015. All figures are presented in United States dollars unless otherwise noted. Silver Wheaton achieved record production for a third quarter in a row and record sales volume for a second quarter in a row, driven by record production at Salobo and Penasquito and record sales volume at San Dimas. In addition, the ramp-up of production at Salobo and Constancia continue to progress as expected. THIRD QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS Record attributable silver equivalent production in Q3 2015 of 11.0 million ounces (6.9 million ounces of silver and 54,500 ounces of gold), compared with 8.9 million ounces in Q3 2014, representing an increase of 24%. Record silver equivalent sales volume in Q3 2015 of 10.2 million ounces (6.6 million ounces of silver and 48,100 ounces of gold), compared with 8.7 million ounces in Q3 2014, representing an increase of 17%. During the three month period ending September 30, 2015, payable silver equivalent ounces attributable to the Company produced but not yet delivered decreased by 0.1 million ounces to approximately 6.3 million ounces. Revenues of $153.3 million in Q3 2015 compared with $165.9 million in Q3 2014, representing a decrease of 8%. Average realized sale price per silver equivalent ounce sold in Q3 2015 of $15.03 ($15.05 per ounce of silver and $1,130 per ounce of gold), compared with $18.98 in Q3 2014, representing a decrease of 21%. Adjusted net earnings1 of $49.8 million ($0.12 per share) in Q3 2015 compared with $72.6 million ($0.20 per share) in Q3 2014, representing a decrease of 31%. During the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $154.0 million related to its 777 silver and gold interest. After including the after tax impact of the impairment charge, net loss of $95.9 million ($0.24 per share) in Q3 2015 compared with net earnings of $4.5 million ($0.01 per share) in Q3 2014.1 Operating cash flows of $99.5 million ($0.25 per share1) in Q3 2015 compared with $120.4 million ($0.34 per share1) in Q3 2014, representing a decrease of 17%. Cash operating margin1 in Q3 2015 of $10.45 per silver equivalent ounce compared with $14.39 in Q3 2014, representing a decrease of 27%. Average cash costs1 in Q3 2015 were $4.26 and $389 per ounce of silver and gold, respectively. On a silver equivalent basis, average cash costs1 decreased to $4.58 compared with $4.59 in Q3 2014. Declared quarterly dividend of $0.05 per common share. On September 18, 2015, the Company announced that it had received TSX approval for a normal course issuer bid (\"NCIB\") of up to 5% of the Company's outstanding Common Shares. To date, the Company has purchased 764,789 shares under the NCIB. On September 24, 2015, the Company announced that it had received Notices of Reassessment from the Canada Revenue Agency (the \"CRA\") for the 2005 to 2010 taxation years (the \"Relevant Taxation Years\"). Subsequent to the quarter, Silver Wheaton filed notices of objection for each of the Relevant Taxation Years. Asset Highlights Salobo had record attributable production of almost 33,000 ounces of gold net to Silver Wheaton in Q3, and the ongoing ramp-up continues to be on track to achieve 100% utilization in Q4 2015. Record attributable production from Penasquito. Record sale volume from San Dimas. Events Subsequent to the Quarter Silver Wheaton agreed to acquire from a subsidiary of Glencore Plc (\"Glencore\") an amount of silver equal to 33.75% of the silver production until delivery of 140 million ounces of silver and 22.5% of the silver production thereafter for the life of mine from the Antamina mine for an upfront cash consideration of US$900 million and ongoing payments of 20% of spot price per silver ounce delivered. \"Silver Wheaton hit record production for a third consecutive quarter, as the company produced 11 million silver equivalent ounces in the third quarter alone. Our cornerstone assets delivered solid results with Penasquito and Salobo setting new production records. With over 32 million ounces produced year to date, we remain well on track to deliver on our original production growth guidance of over 20% in 2015,\" said Randy Smallwood, President and Chief Executive Officer of Silver Wheaton. \"Clearly, not everything has been smooth sailing, as we have also faced persistently low commodity prices, along with the receipt of the Notices of Reassessment from the CRA. I once again want to reiterate our confidence in our structure and that we will vigorously defend our tax filing position; as such, we have filed notices of objections with the CRA in regards to the Reassessments.\" \"While our cornerstone operations have performed exceptionally well, we did take an impairment charge on 777 in the third quarter due to lack of exploration success combined with lower commodity prices. While the low commodity price environment has had its challenges, it has also created some great opportunities. This is clearly evidenced by the announcement of our acquisition of a silver stream on Antamina, one of the lowest cost, largest copper mines in the world. Antamina is an ideal asset for Silver Wheaton, one that readily fits in to our portfolio of top tier assets.\" Financial Review Revenues Revenue was $153.3 million in the third quarter of 2015, on silver equivalent sales of 10.2 million ounces (6.6 million ounces of silver and 48,100 ounces of gold). This represents an 8% decrease from the $165.9 million of revenue generated in the third quarter of 2014 due primarily to a 21% decrease in the average realized silver equivalent price ($15.03 in Q3 2015 compared with $18.98 in Q3 2014), partially offset by a 17% increase in the number of silver equivalent ounces sold. Costs and Expenses Average cash costs1 in the third quarter of 2015 were $4.58 per silver equivalent ounce as compared with $4.59 during the comparable period of 2014. This resulted in a cash operating margin1 of $10.45 per silver equivalent ounce, a reduction of 27% as compared with Q3 2014. The decrease in the cash operating margin was primarily due to a 21% decrease in the average realized silver equivalent price in Q3 2015 compared with Q3 2014. Earnings and Operating Cash Flows Adjusted net earnings1 and cash flow from operations in the third quarter of 2015 were $49.8 million ($0.12 per share) and $99.5 million ($0.25 per share1), compared with $72.6 million ($0.20 per share) and $120.4 million ($0.34 per share1) for the same period in 2014, a decrease of 31% and 17%, respectively. Earnings and cash flow continued to be impacted by lower gold and silver prices. Balance Sheet At September 30, 2015, the Company had approximately $81 million of cash on hand and $647 million outstanding under the Company's $2 billionrevolving term loan. On September 18, 2015 the Company announced it had received TSX approval to purchase up to 20,229,671 common shares (representing 5% of the Company's 404,593,425 total issued and outstanding common shares as of September 11, 2015) over a period of twelve months commencing onSeptember 23, 2015. The NCIB will expire no later than September 22, 2016. During the three months ended September 30, 2015 the Company purchased 119,400 shares under the NCIB at an average price of $12.26 per share. Subsequent to September 30, 2015, the Company purchased an additional 645,389 shares under the NCIB at an average price of $11.86 per share. Asset Impairment On August 8, 2012, the Company entered into an agreement with Hudbay Minerals Inc. (\"Hudbay\") to acquire an amount equal to 100% of the silver and gold production from its currently producing 777 mine, located in Canada, until the end of 2016, and 100% of the silver and 50% of the gold production for the remainder of the mine life. During the third quarter of 2015, the Company's management was informed that as a result of an unsuccessful drilling program at 777, Hudbay's management believes that the mine life for 777 is unlikely to be extended beyond 2020. As a result, during the third quarter of 2015, the estimate of future production from 777 was reduced, with this reduction representing an indicator of impairment related to the 777 silver and gold interests. At September 30, 2015, Silver Wheaton's management estimated that the recoverable amount under the 777 silver and gold interests was$147.5 million, representing its fair value less cost to sell and resulting in an impairment charge of $154.0 million. CRA Audit Update On July 6, 2015, the Company announced that it had received a proposal letter (the \"Proposal\") from the CRA in which the CRA was proposing to reassess Silver Wheaton under the transfer pricing provisions contained in the Income Tax Act (Canada) (the \"Act\"). Subsequent to the issuance of the Proposal, on September 24, 2015, the Company announced that it had received Notices of Reassessment (the \"Reassessments\") from the CRA for the 2005 to 2010 taxation years (the \"Relevant Taxation Years\"). The Reassessments are consistent with the Proposal and seek to increase the Company's income subject to tax in Canada for the Relevant Taxation Years by approximately Cdn$715.3 million which would result in federal and provincial tax of approximately Cdn$201.3 million. In addition, the CRA is seeking to impose transfer pricing penalties of approximately Cdn$71.5 million and interest and other penalties of Cdn$80.6 million for the Relevant Taxation Years. Total tax, interest and penalties sought by the CRA for the Relevant Taxation Years isCdn$353.4 million. The CRA's position in the Reassessments is that the transfer pricing provisions of the Act relating to income earned by the Company's foreign subsidiaries outside of Canada should apply such that the income of Silver Wheaton subject to tax in Canada should be increased by substantially all of the income of the Company's foreign subsidiaries. Management believes that the Company has filed its tax returns and paid applicable taxes in compliance with Canadian tax law, and as a result no amounts have been recorded for any potential liability arising from this matter. Silver Wheaton intends to vigorously defend its tax filing positions. As such, subsequent to September 30, 2015, Silver Wheaton has filed notices of objection for each of the Relevant Taxation Years. The Company will be required to make a deposit of Cdn$176.7 million representing 50% of the reassessed amounts of tax, interest and penalties. Silver Wheaton will seek to post security in the form of a letter of credit for this amount as opposed to a cash deposit. Cash that has been deposited in respect of a reassessment will be refunded, plus interest, if the Company is ultimately successful in challenging that reassessment. Events Subsequent to the Quarter Antamina Subsequent to the quarter, Silver Wheaton, through its wholly owned subsidiary Silver Wheaton (Caymans) Ltd. (\"SWC\"), has agreed to acquire fromAnani Investments Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Glencore plc (\"Glencore\") an amount of silver equal to 33.75% of the silver production until delivery of 140 million ounces of silver and 22.5% of silver production thereafter for the life of mine silver production from the Antamina mine, located in Peru. SWC will pay Glencore cash consideration of US$900 million for the silver stream. In addition, SWC will make ongoing payments of 20% of spot price per silver ounce delivered. The silver stream is effective September 30, 2015, and as a result, production and sales attributable to Silver Wheaton are forecast for the fourth quarter of 2015. Silver production is expected to average 4.7 million ounces per year over the first 20 years. Closing of the transaction is expected to occur prior to the end of November 2015 and is subject to the completion of certain corporate matters and customary conditions. (See Silver Wheaton's November 3, 2015 news release for full details.) Third Quarter Asset Highlights During the third quarter of 2015, attributable silver equivalent production was 11.0 million ounces (6.9 million ounces of silver and 54,500 ounces of gold), representing an increase of 24% compared with the third quarter of 2014. Operational highlights for the quarter ended September 30, 2015, are as follows: Salobo In the third quarter of 2015, Salobo produced a record 32,954 ounces of gold attributable to Silver Wheaton, an increase of approximately 216% relative to the third quarter of 2014. This increase was primarily due to the doubling of the percentage of gold that Silver Wheaton is entitled to and the increased throughput as a result of the expansion to 24 million tonnes per annum, which commenced production in mid-2014. According to Vale's third quarter of 2015 production report, the ramp-up of Salobo was weaker than expected in July and August but recovered in September with capacity utilization exceeding 90%. Salobo is expected to achieve 100% capacity utilization in the fourth quarter. Constancia In the third quarter of 2015, Constancia produced approximately 4,341 ounces of gold and 0.7 million ounces of silver attributable to Silver Wheaton as the mine declared commercial production on April 30, 2015, and it continues to ramp-up as expected. Penasquito In the third quarter of 2015, Penasquito produced a record 2.1 million ounces of silver attributable to Silver Wheaton, an increase of approximately 28% relative to the third quarter of 2014 due to higher grades being mined as substantial mining took place in the heart of the deposit. As disclosed inGoldcorp Inc.'s (\"Goldcorp\") third quarter of 2015 MD&A, construction of the Northern Well Field project remained suspended throughout the third quarter of 2015 due to an illegal blockade by a local community. Penasquito continues to seek a fair resolution of this matter with the community, while taking steps to enforce its contractual rights. Penasquito is also advancing alternatives for completion of the project without crossing through the affected community lands. Goldcorp believes that there will be timely resolution of this matter to meet the future water needs of Penasquito. The Metallurgical Enhancement Project feasibility study remains on schedule to be completed in early 2016. San Dimas In the third quarter of 2015, attributable production from San Dimas was 1.4 million ounces of silver, an increase of approximately 22% relative to the third quarter of 2014.2 This growth was primarily due to increased production as a result of the expansion to 2,500 tonnes per day (tpd), which was completed early in 2014, as well as to the sharing threshold increasing to 6 million ounces3, partially offset by the cessation of Goldcorp's four-year obligation to deliver 1.5 million ounces of silver to the Company on August 6, 2014. Silver sales in the third quarter of 2015 from San Dimas were a record 2.0 million ounces, an increase of 72% relative to the third quarter of 20142, as silver inventories built up in the second quarter of 2014 were subsequently sold. As at September 30, 2015, approximately 0.2 million ounces of cumulative payable silver ounces have been produced at San Dimas but not yet delivered to the Company, representing a decrease of 0.6 million payable silver ounces during the third quarter of 2015. As reported by Primero on July 6, 2015, silver deliveries in the second quarter had been delayed due to the suspension of Primero's import and export licenses in May 2015 by the Mexican customs authorities due to a discrepancy over Primero's address related to its corporate office relocation from Mexico City to Durango, Mexico. As per Primero's August 6, 2015, news release, the import and export license was reinstated and normal course imports and exports resumed, including the sales of all inventoried silver. Finally, as per Primero's third quarter of 2015 MD&A, during the third quarter, Primero achieved key milestones at both the San Dimas mine and the mill, tracking towards the completion of its expansion from 2,500 tpd to 3,000 tpd by the accelerated April 2016 completion date. Primero successfully connected the tunnel between the Sinaloa-Graben and Central mining blocks, providing a critical de-bottlenecking in the flow of machinery through theSan Dimas mine. At the San Dimas mill, Primero has completed the construction of foundations for the new secondary crusher and demolition of the old foundry is well advanced. The installation of the additional tailings pump is now complete and control has been handed over to the operations team. The new tailings filter and thickener are also in the process of fabrication and remain on-schedule for delivery to site in Q1 2016. Sudbury In the third quarter of 2015, attributable gold production from Vale's Sudbury mine was 5,967 ounces, a decrease of approximately 51% relative to the third quarter of 2014. According to Vale's third quarter of 2015 production report, the decrease was primarily due to planned maintenance shutdowns in the Sudbury surface plants in August 2015. As per Vale, key work completed as part of the shutdown encompassed the rebuild of the SAG mill, the overhaul of the acid plant in preparation for the implementation of the AER project (atmospheric emissions reduction project), and the upgrade of the environmental equipment at the Copper Cliff Nickel Refinery. It should also be noted that production in Q3 2014 was at an elevated level, as Vale processed large inventories of feed stock that had built up in Q2 2014 due to planned maintenance of surface facilities. Yauliyacu In the third quarter of 2015, attributable silver production from Yauliyacu was 0.7 million ounces, a decrease of approximately 20% relative to the third quarter of 2014, primarily due to lower grade being mined in the quarter. Barrick In the third quarter of 2015, attributable silver production from Barrick was 0.5 million ounces, an increase of approximately 27% relative to the third quarter of 2014, primarily due to higher grades at the Veladero mine and higher recoveries at the Lagunas Norte mine. 777 In the third quarter of 2015, 777 produced approximately 6,330 ounces of gold and 0.1 million ounces of silver attributable to Silver Wheaton, a decrease of approximately 48% and 37%, respectively, relative to the third quarter of 2014 primarily due to lower throughput and grades. Other Minto: In the third quarter of 2015, attributable gold production from Minto was 4,920 ounces, a decrease of approximately 29% relative to the third quarter of 2014, primarily due to lower grade being mined in the quarter. According to Capstone Mining Corp.'s (\"Capstone\") third quarter production results, the Minto mill processed solely underground and stockpiled ore while transitioning to the next open pit mining area. In addition, Capstone reported that the Yukon Water Board issued the final Water Use Licence on August 5, 2015, and that stripping of the Minto North open pit commenced immediately. Stripping of Minto North is reportedly on schedule for first ore to the mill starting in December 2015, with high grade ore commencing in the second quarter of 2016. Stratoni: In the third quarter of 2015, attributable silver production from Stratoni was 0.1 million ounces, a decrease of approximately 52% relative to the third quarter of 2014, primarily due to lower throughput as a result of fewer production stopes available in the mine as well as a five week suspension of operations in the quarter. As per Eldorado Gold Corporation's (\"Eldorado\") news release dated August 20, 2015, operations at the Stratoni mine were temporarily suspended as a direct result of the revocation by Greece's Ministry of Energy of the technical studies of Eldorado's projects in Halkidiki,Greece. As per Eldorado's news release dated October 5, 2015, mining operations have resumed at Halkidiki. Subsequent to the quarter, the Stratoni silver purchase agreement dated April 23, 2007, was amended in order to incentivize additional exploration and potentially extend the limited remaining mine life of Stratoni. The primary modification is to increase the production price per ounce of silver delivered to SWC over the current fixed price by one of the following amounts: i) US$2.50 if 10,000 meters of drilling is completed outside of the existing ore body and within SWC's defined area of interest (\"Expansion Drilling\"), ii) US$5.00 if 20,000 meters of Expansion Drilling is completed, and iii) US$7.00 if 30,000 meters of Expansion Drilling is completed. Drilling in all three cases must be completed by December 31, 2020, in order for the agreed upon increase in production price to be initiated.4 Produced But Not Yet Delivered 5 As at September 30, 2015, payable silver equivalent ounces produced but not yet delivered to Silver Wheaton by its partners decreased by 0.1 million ounces to approximately 6.3 million silver equivalent payable ounces, as increases at Salobo and Constancia were more than offset by decreases at San Dimas, 777 and Penasquito. Payable ounces produced but not yet delivered to Silver Wheaton are expected to average approximately two to three months of annualized production but may vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of mining operation factors including mine ramp-up, delays in shipments, and so forth. Detailed mine by mine production and sales figures can be found in the Appendix to this press release and in Silver Wheaton's MD&A in the 'Results of Operations and Operational Review' section. Sherritt International Corporation (S: TSX) Sherritt is a world leader in the mining and refining of nickel from lateritic ores with projects and operations in Canada, Cuba and Madagascar. The Corporation is the largest independent energy producer in Cuba, with extensive oil and power operations on the island. Sherritt licenses its proprietary technologies and provides metallurgical services to commercial metals operations worldwide. The Corporation's common shares are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol \"S\". Sherritt is committed to the highest standards of environment, health and safety practices at all of its operations, while making valuable contributions to local communities. Sherritt Announces Q3 2015 Results Nickel Net Direct Cash Costs Decline for the Third Consecutive Quarter TORONTO, ON--(Marketwired - October 27, 2015) - NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION TO UNITED STATES NEWSWIRE SERVICES OR FOR DISSEMINATION IN THE UNITED STATES Sherritt International Corporation (\"Sherritt\" or the \"Corporation\") (TSX: S), a world leader in the mining and refining of nickel from lateritic ores, today reported its financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. \"Operational performance, cost discipline and collecting overdue receivables all played a role this quarter in minimizing our use of cash,\" said David Pathe, President and CEO, Sherritt. \"We continue to operate in a severely depressed commodity pricing environment, with nickel and oil prices declining further during the quarter. In response to this reality, we have executed on further cost-cutting measures, including cutting our dividend and reducing expected capital spending for this year and next. In this environment, achieving financial completion at Ambatovy was a pivotal achievement, making the Ambatovy project debt non-recourse to us and our partners.\" \"We are working hard to position ourselves for long-term success when the commodity cycle turns favourable,\" continued Pathe. \"Operationally, we had record nickel production at Ambatovy, where we saw cash costs drop more than 20% from Q2, down to US$4.24 per pound. At Moa, our cash costs are bordering on first quartile, and I am confident we will get there with the addition of the third acid plant. In total, our two integrated operations now produce around 83,000 tonnes a year of Class 1 nickel.\" Q3 HIGHLIGHTS Nickel prices during the quarter hit a low closing price of US$4.22 per pound on August 24, 2015, a level not seen since 2008, and averaged US$4.78 in the quarter. Crude oil prices also declined since Q2 2015, with WTI crude prices closing at a low of US$38.24 per barrel on the same day and averaging US$46.56 in the quarter. Since quarter end, nickel prices have rebounded modestly from their lows to US$4.75 per pound and WTI is trading at US$44.46 per barrel (both prices at Oct. 26, 2015). Preserving cash was the Corporation's highest priority in the quarter, and cost discipline across all operations mitigated cash funding requirements outside Ambatovy. Total available liquidity at September 30, 2015 was $454.5 million, benefiting from a $40 million increase in available credit, after renewing and increasing the size of the syndicated 364-day revolver to $115 million (from $90 million last quarter) and the line of credit to $35 million (from $20 million last quarter). Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $373.8 million at September 30, 2015. Finished nickel production in the quarter was up 16% year over year at 9,730 tonnes (Sherritt's Share), driven by Ambatovy's strong performance. Net direct cash costs fell for the third consecutive quarter this year, to US$4.07 per pound at the Moa JV and US$4.24 per pound at Ambatovy. This demonstrates the longer term potential for Ambatovy's cash costs to be equal or better than the Moa JV cash costs, as production ramps up to full capacity and maintenance costs continue to decline. Ambatovy Financial Completion was announced by press release September 21, 2015. Ten certificates were filed to meet the criteria, covering a range of construction, operational, environmental, financial and legal obligations. With financial completion achieved, the project financing that was put in place for construction is now non-recourse to all of the partners. Reducing combined administrative expenses has been a priority this year, with year to date combined administrative expenses down 25% over the nine month period last year. This quarter's combined administrative expenses of $18.6 million are down 10% from last year, although higher than their levels in Q2, due to $4.5 million in Ambatovy arbitration award legal costs discussed in Note 6 to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Financial Statements), and related to the close-out of construction contracts that were in dispute. No other income statement impact was recorded from these awards. All amounts are Canadian dollars unless otherwise indicated. For additional information see the Non-GAAP measures section of this press release. Compared to the same period in the prior year. Shown on Sherritt's attributable share ownership basis. OUTLOOK AND SIGNIFICANT ITEMS During the quarter, the Corporation recorded an impairment expense of $80.6 million ($0.27 per share) on its oil assets in Cuba and Spain. This impairment arises mainly from lower oil price forecasts impacting future cash flows, with lower production from the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) Extension wells being a contributing factor. Oil production guidance was reduced to 18,500 barrels of oil per day (bopd) on a Gross Working Interest (GWI) basis, and 11,300 bopd on a Net Working Interest basis (NWI) for the year ending December 31, 2015 from the previously forecast level of 19,000 bopd reflecting the results this year from the PSC Extension drilling. Drilling activity on the PSC Extension has ended, and capital expenditures have been reduced with new guidance of $71 million expected for the full year. During the quarter, SNC-Lavalin exercised their put option to divest their 5% equity interest in the Ambatovy JV, selling their equity stake and share of partner loans to existing partner Sumitomo Corporation for approximately $600 million. Sherritt had the right to acquire this equity stake along with Sumitomo, but declined. As a result, the Ambatovy call option expired, resulting in a $13.7 million loss (non-cash) within the net finance expense this quarter. Sumitomo now owns 32.5% of Ambatovy, with Sherritt at 40% and Korea Resources at 27.5%. Sherritt also announces that Dean Chambers has agreed to continue in his current role as Executive Vice President and CFO, and will adjust his planned retirement timing. Given Mr. Chambers' long executive tenure and critical role with the Ambatovy partner and lender groups, Dean is particularly well suited to his current role at this time. David Bacon has confirmed his intention to return to his former employer in an expanded role.  During the third quarter, $118.6 million ($0.40 per share) in adjusting items occurred that mainly included the Oil & Gas impairment described earlier, a $13.7 million adjustment for the expiry of the call option associated with the SNC-Lavalin put exercise, and an unrealized $10.2 million foreign exchange loss. Other less material adjustments of $7.5 million in aggregate represent Ambatovy inventory impairment and legal costs on unfavourable Ambatovy arbitration awards relating to construction contracts that have now been closed out, and are described in Note 6 to the Financial Statements. Subsequent to the quarter end, a third arbitration award was received, which was in Sherritt's favour and will have a positive cash flow impact if and when collected. REVIEW OF OPERATIONS METALS Includes results for certain 100% owned assets at Fort Saskatchewan plant. Includes results for Sherritt's marketing organization for certain Ambatovy sales. Represents the post-commercial production period except for production volumes and nickel recovery. For additional information, see the Non-GAAP measures section of this release. METAL MARKETS Nickel spot prices hit a multi-year low of US$4.22 per pound on August 24, 2015, a day of commodity and broader equity market panic after Chinese stock market indices fell by 9%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average opened down 1,000 points. Since that time, nickel prices have rebounded to some degree, trading in a range of US$4.50 - $4.75 per pound in recent weeks. Average realized prices of nickel at the Moa Joint Venture and the Ambatovy Joint Venture were $6.31 and $6.02 per pound, respectively, following the reference price decline, but benefitting from foreign exchange translation as the Canadian dollar weakened by approximately eight cents from the second quarter to the third quarter this year. The average cobalt reference price of US$13.32 per pound in the third quarter was also down from its year ago comparable of US$14.74, and close to the Q2 2015 average reference price of US$13.61 per pound. Average realized prices of cobalt this quarter were up marginally from their year ago levels, as the decline in the reference price was offset by the weaker Canadian dollar. The cobalt market remains fairly well balanced with continued strong demand in the aerospace and rechargeable battery sectors and lower than forecast production in Zambia. Moa Joint Venture (50% interest) and Fort Site Adjusted EBITDA of $2.2 million continued to follow commodity price declines, despite a third consecutive quarter of improved Net Direct Cash Costs. Finished nickel production of 4,521 tonnes (50% basis) for the third quarter of 2015 was marginally lower than the prior year quarter, but up 17% from production in Q2 of 3,877 tonnes (50% basis) when the annual refinery shutdown occurred. Finished cobalt production of 491 tonnes (50% basis) for the third quarter of 2015 was higher than the prior year quarter, and higher than Q2 2015 cobalt production of 429 tonnes (50% basis), again reflecting the shutdown, and a higher cobalt ratio in the mined ore year to date. The nickel recovery at Moa of 89% in the quarter was up from the 86% recovery in Q3 of last year, and consistent with Q2 2015 nickel recovery levels. The net direct cash cost of US$4.07 per pound of nickel was an improvement of 22% (US$1.18 per pound) from the third quarter of 2014, and the lowest reported year to date. Lower fuel oil and energy prices and lower third party feed costs have been significant drivers to improved cash costs, and the effort to focus on controllable costs has paid off. Cobalt by-product credits of US$1.39 per pound are fairly consistent each quarter, ranging from US$1.25 to US$1.40 over the last six quarters. Fertilizer revenues this quarter of $11.8 million were lower than costs of $12.7 million. Costs were impacted by higher maintenance expenses (shutdown-related) that were carried through inventory and impacted third quarter fertilizer costs due to the timing of sales. This quarter included deferred revenue of $20.5 million of cash received on pre-sales of fertilizer to be delivered primarily in Q4 and the spring season of 2016, at which time their revenue will be recognized. Capital spending of $19.6 million in the quarter and $43.6 million year to date is higher than its comparison periods, due to the once in 10 year maintenance shutdown at Fort Saskatchewan last quarter, and a weaker Canadian dollar, with expansion capital as budgeted for the construction of the 2,000 tonne per day acid plant on track for the second half of 2016. Ambatovy Joint Venture (40% interest) Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter was negative $2.5 million during the quarter compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $4.3 million in the same quarter last year. For the nine month period ended September 30, 2015, Adjusted EBITDA of $0.1 million compares with $2 million in the same period last year. During the quarter, finished nickel production was 5,209 tonnes (40% basis), a record production quarter and an improvement of 39 % over last year. Finished cobalt production of 392 tonnes (40% basis) was also up 20% year over year and up 48% from production levels in the second quarter. As announced October 6, 2015, Sherritt received confirmation that finished nickel briquettes from Ambatovy now meet the standards to qualify for delivery to London Metal Exchange (LME) warehouses. This recognition demonstrates the technical and metallurgical capabilities that Sherritt has contributed as operator during Ambatovy's ramp-up. LME delivery status allows Ambatovy or its customers the flexibility and commercial advantage of delivering nickel product to LME warehouses where logistics benefits exist or to mitigate short term variance in customer demand. Robust third quarter production of both nickel and cobalt is attributable to process control enhancements and improved operational stability, continuing the ramp-up of production to nameplate capacity. During the quarter, the second ore thickener returned to production. A planned autoclave train turnaround was executed in September, with further turnarounds scheduled in October and November. The Q3 nickel recovery was 88% compared to 86% in Q2, primarily due to efficiency improvements in the mixed sulphide precipitation circuit. The net direct cash cost (NDCC) of nickel was US$4.24 per pound in the third quarter of 2015, and has been coming down sharply each quarter this year, from US$5.74 per pound in Q1 and US$5.48 per pound in Q2. Net direct cash costs at Ambatovy are now in line with the Moa JV, reflecting increased production, lower maintenance and labour costs, and lower commodity input costs. In September this year, Ambatovy achieved financial completion (see \"Highlights\", page 1). Under the terms of the Ambatovy Joint Venture Financing, a supermajority group of the lenders may, within 45 days of achieving financial completion, initiate a challenge to reinstate the completion guarantees. In order for any challenge to succeed, the lenders would need to prove that one or more of the completion certificates is false in a materially adverse way to the lenders' interest. During a challenge, if one occurs, Sherritt's proportionate share of the outstanding project debt would remain non-recourse to Sherritt until a final ruling or settlement occurs. Filing of the Financial Certificate required the deposit of US$115 million (100% basis) to fund the Senior Debt Reserve Account (SDRA), from which payments of semi-annual principal and interest can be made on the Ambatovy Joint Venture Financing. In the third quarter, the Ambatovy partners provided US$174 million in funding. From this funding and the opening cash balance, the SDRA was funded, and US$65 million was paid out to settle arbitration rulings as described in Note 6 to the Financial Statements. On a year to date basis, Ambatovy partners have funded US$264 million, with Sherritt's share being 40% or US$105.6 million. With submission of the final certificates, the US$1.7 billion Ambatovy Joint Venture Financing (100% basis, balance at September 30, 2015) has become non-recourse to the Ambatovy partners, and the interest rate has increased from LIBOR plus 1.4% to LIBOR plus approximately 2.5%. Going into the fourth quarter this year, the Ambatovy cash and cash equivalents position (100% basis) is at $200.5 million as reported in Note 6 to the Financial Statements. OIL AND GAS Adjusted EBITDA was 56% ($26.9 million) lower in the third quarter compared to the prior year period, with realized oil and gas prices down 47% over the same period. In the Cuban operations, the average-realized price in the third quarter was $36.36 per barrel, as oil prices reached multi-year lows in August this year. GWI oil production in Cuba of 17,693 bopd decreased by 9% in the third quarter compared to the prior year period, primarily due to natural reservoir declines and lower than expected production from the PSC Extension wells. Counting three wells drilled in 2014 and five drilled this year, a total of eight new wells have now been drilled and completed, which is one more than required to fulfill commitments under the PSC Extension for the Puerto Escondido/Yumuri oil fields. Of the eight, six are currently producing oil, one is suspended and one has been abandoned. Oil production from these new PSC Extension wells is below expectations, with production guidance revised accordingly. NWI oil production in Cuba of 10,354 bopd increased by 3% over the same quarter in 2014 despite the 9% decrease in Cuban GWI oil production. Cost recovery oil production of 4,349 bopd compared to 2,428 bopd in the same period last year illustrates the higher proportion of cost recovery oil when oil prices are low. The allocation of cost recovery barrels in any particular period is limited to a fixed percentage of GWI volumes within each cost pool. In the first quarter this year, when oil prices were similar to prices in the third quarter, the caps on the applicable cost pools prevented a higher cost recovery allocation. Expenditures above the caps were then carried forward, and were applied for cost recoveries in the second and third quarter. Eligible costs are being carried forward for application in future quarters. Unit operating costs in Cuba decreased 9% ($0.94 per barrel) to $9.04 (GWI basis) in the third quarter compared to the prior year period, reflecting lower well workover costs. The robust free cash flow generation of $35.7 million in the quarter benefited from the collection of overdue receivables, and a quarter of comparatively low capital spending, at $11.7 million. Overdue receivables continue to be paid in accordance with the schedule agreed with the Cuban partners, with overdue receivables expected to fall to normal levels by year end. On a year to date basis, capital spending of $55.2 million is up 22% year over year, consistent with the higher capital expenditures required to drill the PSC Extension. Further evaluation of the wells drilled under the PSC Extension will be carried out this quarter, but drilling results to date and continuing capital and cost discipline have prompted further capital reductions, leading to a revised estimate of $71 million ($68 million sustaining and $3 million exploration) for 2015 compared to the previous guidance of $81 million. As referenced in the Q3 2015 MD&A and Note 17 to the Financial Statements, an impairment expense of $80.6 million ($0.27 per share) was recorded on Cuban and Spain oil assets in the quarter. The lower oil price forecast, combined with drilling results on the PSC extension that were below expectations, are the reasons for the impairment. POWER Quarterly Adjusted EBITDA increased by 20% ($1.6 million) year over year with higher production and higher realized prices. Higher gas availability led to higher production, while the average realized price benefitted from the weaker Canadian dollar. The average-realized price of electricity was 20% higher ($9.07 per MWh) in the third quarter compared to the prior year period. Operating costs increased by 30% ($4.03 per MWh) in the third quarter compared to the prior year period, due to an increase in equipment purchases and processing equipment repairs, as well as the weaker Canadian dollar. Free cash flow generation of $14.7 million in the quarter included a $4.0 million payment of interest on the Energas conditional sales agreement ($35.1 million year to date). Principal on the Energas conditional sales agreement also continues to be repaid on schedule, with a further $10.4 million received in the quarter ($25.8 million year to date). STRATEGIC PRIORITIES 2015 Sherritt continues to execute against its stated strategy to focus on its core competencies, improve its liquidity position and streamline its operations, consisting of the following near-term priorities:  OUTLOOK In the current quarter, the changes to expected production and capital spending come from Oil & Gas, where expected production on both a GWI and NWI basis have been reduced to reflect the drilling results on the PSC Extension wells at Puerto Escondido/Yumuri. Drilling activity has ended, and capital spending has also been reduced accordingly. NON-GAAP MEASURES The Corporation uses combined results, Adjusted EBITDA, average-realized price, unit operating cost, and adjusted operating cash flow to monitor the performance of the Corporation and its operating divisions and believes these measures enable investors and analysts to compare the Corporation's financial performance with its competitors and evaluate the results of its underlying business. These measures do not have a standard definition under IFRS and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. As these measures do not have a standardized meaning, they may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other companies. See Sherritt's Management's Discussion and Analysis for the period ended September 30, 2015 for further information.

Headquartered in Vancouver, Canada, we own, or have an interest in, 12 mines in Canada, the United States, Chile and Peru. We also operate a large metallurgical complex, are partners in a wind power facility, and are a significant producer of specialty metals such as germanium and indium. We are actively exploring for copper, zinc and gold in the Americas, Asia Pacific, Europe and Africa. TECK REPORTS UNAUDITED THIRD QUARTER RESULTS FOR 2015 October 22, 2015 - Vancouver, BC - Teck Resources Limited (TSX: TCK.A and TCK.B, NYSE: TCK) (\"Teck\") reported adjusted profit attributable to shareholders of $29 million, or $0.05 per share, in the third quarter of 2015. Teck also reported non-cash after-tax impairment charges of $2.2 billion resulting in a third quarter loss attributable to shareholders of $2.1 billion, or $3.73 per share. The impairment charges are non-cash revaluations of assets to reflect lower market expectations of commodity prices. \"We are taking significant steps to meet the challenge of low commodity prices,\" said Don Lindsay, President and CEO. \"We have reduced costs throughout the company and we've raised nearly $1 billion in two streaming transactions. We used a portion of those proceeds to reduce debt by $400 million and our current cash balance of $1.8 billion exceeds our remaining $1.5 billion share of capital required for Fort Hills.\" Highlights and Significant Items Gross profit before depreciation and amortization was $670 million in the third quarter* compared with $752 million in the third quarter of 2014. Cash flow from operations, before working capital changes, was $302 million in the third* quarter of 2015 compared with $553 million a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA (not including non-cash impairment charges of $2.9 billion) was $389* million in the third quarter. Adjusted EBITDA before final pricing adjustments was $530 million. We recorded impairment charges in the aggregate of $2.2 billion on an after-tax basis ($2.9* billion pre-tax) including $1.5 billion on our steelmaking coal assets, $0.3 billion on copper and $0.4 billion on the Fort Hills oil sands project resulting in a loss attributable to shareholders of $2.1 billion. Our debt to debt-plus-equity ratio was 36% at September 30, and our net debt to net-debtplus-equity* ratio was 32%. Giving effect to the impairments and our recent streaming transaction and debt repayments, our pro forma debt to debt-plus-equity ratio and net debt to net-debt-plus-equity ratios at September 30, 2015 were 35% and 30%, respectively. Subsequent to quarter end, we completed the sale of a silver stream linked to our share of the Antamina mine. Taken together with the gold stream sold from the Carmen de Andacollo Operations which closed during the third quarter, these transactions have increased our cash position by approximately $1 billion. Our cash balance of $1.8 billion as of October 21 is more than our $1.5 billion share of costs required to complete Fort Hills. We also have an additional US$3 billion undrawn credit facility that can be used for general corporate purposes and US$1.2 billion available for cash draws or for letters of credit. We have certain contractual arrangements that may result in us having to issue letters of credit that would utilize substantially all of this US$1.2 billion facility. Our cost reduction program combined with a falling Canadian dollar, lower oil prices, and higher copper grades have contributed to reduce our U.S. dollar unit costs for our products with copper and steelmaking coal unit costs falling by US$0.20 per pound and US$20 per tonne, respectively, compared to last year. In response to steelmaking coal market conditions, our steelmaking coal mines took threeweek shutdowns during the third quarter to reduce production and product inventory. In the fourth quarter we expect that production rates will be aligned with sales volumes. We have reached agreements with the majority of our customers for the fourth quarter of 2015, based on a quarterly benchmark of US$89 per tonne for the highest quality product and we expect total sales in the fourth quarter, including spot sales, to be at least 6 million tonnes of steelmaking coal. The Red Dog concentrate shipping season is expected to be completed on October 22 with shipments of 1,048,000 tonnes of zinc concentrate. We expect sales of 200,000 tonnes in the fourth quarter reflecting the normal seasonal pattern of Red Dog sales. Our Quebrada Blanca operation restarted normal production activities in late August after unexpected ground movement in late June caused a temporary shutdown of processing facilities. We expect to produce 38,000 tonnes of copper cathode in 2015, a reduction of about 10,000 tonnes compared to the original plan. This document contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the cautionary language under the heading \"CAUTIONARY STATEMENT ON FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION\" below. Overview Prices for our products continued to fall in the third quarter. These declines have had a significant effect on our reported earnings this period, as we recorded $141 million of negative pricing adjustments in addition to the direct effect of lower prices on gross profit. Furthermore, we recorded $2.9 billion (pre-tax) ($2.2 billion after-tax) of impairment charges based on market expectations of lower prices over the short, medium and long terms. The details of these charges are noted below. Lower price forecasts also resulted in negative credit rating actions. More details on our credit rating impacts are included in the \"Financial Position and Liquidity\" section below. To meet the challenge of low prices, we have taken significant steps. We reduced costs across all aspects of our organization in an ongoing and highly focused program. We reduced capital expenditures in the current year and are reducing our planned spending in future years. After the end of the quarter, we completed the sale of a silver stream linked to our share of the Antamina mine. Taken together with the gold stream sold from the Carmen de Andacollo Operation which closed during the third quarter, these transactions have increased our cash position by approximately $1 billion. Subsequent to quarter end we reduced our debt, repaying US$300 million on October 1. While we have reduced spending, we continue to advance our growth plans on a selective basis. The construction of the Fort Hills project remains on time and on budget and we continue to advance permitting and design optimization activities for the Quebrada Blanca Phase 2 project with a clear focus on capital expenditure reduction. In the longer term, the merging of our Relincho project with Goldcorp's El Morro project in Project Corridor is expected to result in a less capital intensive project with higher potential returns. We continue to focus on capital discipline and cost reduction. Profit and Adjusted Profit Profit (loss) attributable to shareholders was $(2.1) billion, or $(3.73) per share, in the third quarter compared with $84 million or $0.14 per share in the same period last year. Adjusted profit attributable to shareholders, before items identified in the table below, was $29 million, or $0.05 per share, in the third quarter compared with $159 million or $0.28 per share in the same period last year. During the quarter we recorded asset and goodwill impairment charges on a number of our operating assets, including our investment in the Fort Hills project, the Carmen de Andacollo and the Pend Oreille zinc mines and a number of our steelmaking coal mines. These charges total $2.9 billion on a pre-tax basis and $2.2 billion on an after-tax basis. The write-downs were triggered primarily by lowered expectations for commodity prices in both the short and longterm. The economic models we use in determining the amount of impairment charges use current prices in the initial years and transition to longer term prices in years three to five. Longterm assumptions are as follows; steelmaking coal US$130 per tonne, copper US$3.00 per pound, zinc US$1.00 per pound, WTI US$75 per barrel and $1.25 Canadian to U.S. dollar exchange rate. Adjusted profit of $29 million includes inventory write-downs totaling $61 million resulting from low commodity prices, and final pricing adjustments of $141 million primarily on our copper and zinc receivables. These total $129 million on an after-tax basis and are included in reported adjusted profits. STEELMAKING COAL BUSINESS UNIT Performance Gross profit before depreciation and amortization from our steelmaking coal business unit increased from year ago levels as the benefits of our cost reduction program and lower diesel prices more than offset lower sales volumes and realized steelmaking coal prices. The average realized steelmaking coal price of US$88 per tonne was 20% lower than the third quarter of 2014, reflecting oversupplied steelmaking coal market conditions and a decline in spot price assessments. The favourable effect of a stronger U.S. dollar in the third quarter partly offset the lower price, which weakened by 3% in Canadian dollar terms compared with the same period a year ago. Third quarter production of 5.5 million tonnes was 19% lower than the same period a year ago matching our guidance for the period as all of our sites completed the three week shutdown previously announced. Unit production costs at the mines were 10% lower this quarter than in the comparative period, despite the lower production rates as a result of the ongoing effects of existing and new initiatives undertaken through our cost reduction program, and lower diesel prices. Property, plant and equipment expenditures totaled $21 million in the third quarter, of which $13 million was spent on sustaining capital. Capitalized stripping costs were $84 million in the third quarter compared with $81 million a year ago. We continue to implement the water quality management measures contemplated by our Elk Valley Water Quality Plan. The water treatment facility built at our Line Creek Operations is now in the process of being commissioned and is expected to be operating at design capacity in early 2016. Markets Steelmaking coal prices declined further during the quarter. Although Chinese imports have declined substantially compared to the prior year, demand in the rest of the world continues to be strong for our products. However, given oversupply in the market, we do not expect a substantial recovery in price until additional supply cuts occur or demand increases. Steelmaking coal prices for the fourth quarter of 2015 have been agreed with the majority of our quarterly priced customers based on US$89 per tonne for the highest quality products. This is consistent with prices reportedly achieved by our competitors. Additional sales priced on a spot basis will reflect market conditions when sales are concluded. Operations Each of the mines were shut down for three weeks during the quarter with shipments to customers fulfilled from existing inventories where required. Line Creek recovered quickly and efficiently from the landslide event they experienced in early July and by the end of the quarter had made up the vast majority of the production lost while down for repairs to the critical infrastructure including the site's main access road and raw steelmaking coal conveyance system. In addition, the business unit's processing yields remained higher than budget and site costs were lower than in the comparative period. Our cost reduction initiatives continue to produce significant results and remain focused on improvements in equipment and labour productivity, reduced use of contractors, reduced consumable usage and limiting the use of higher cost equipment. However, a number of factors have partially offset the strong performance of our cost reduction program. These included the effects of the strengthening U.S. dollar on some inputs and higher electricity costs. In the third quarter of 2015, we continued to experience the positive effects of lower diesel prices. Combined with reduced usage from a number of our cost reduction initiatives and slightly shorter haul distances, diesel costs per tonne produced have decreased by 38% compared to the third quarter of 2014. Cost of Sales Site cost of sales in the third quarter of 2015, before depreciation and inventory write-downs, was $45 per tonne, $5 per tonne or 10% lower than a year ago. Our total cost of sales for the quarter also included a $10 per tonne charge for the amortization of capitalized stripping costs and $18 per tonne for other depreciation. In U.S. dollar terms, unit costs have fallen by $20 per tonne from $84 per tonne to $64 per tonne due to reductions in the site costs as shown in the Canadian dollar unit cost table and the change in exchange rates. Outlook Vessel nominations for quarterly contract shipments are determined by customers and final sales and average prices for the quarter will depend on product mix, market direction for spot priced sales, timely arrival of vessels, as well as the performance of the rail transportation network and steelmaking coal-loading facilities. We continue to expect our 2015 steelmaking coal production to be in the range of 25 to 26 million tonnes and now expect unit costs to be in the range of $83 to $86 per tonne (US$64 to US$66 per tonne). In addition, capital expenditures are now expected to total $500 million, including $395 million of capitalized mining. COPPER BUSINESS UNIT Performance Gross profit before depreciation and amortization from our copper business unit decreased by $91 million in the third quarter compared with a year ago (see table below). This was primarily due to lower realized copper prices and inventory write-downs, which was partially offset by lower unit operating costs and the positive effects of the stronger U.S. dollar. Copper production increased by 13% (10,000 tonnes) compared to a year ago, despite reduced production as a result of ground movement at Quebrada Blanca in June and the closure of Duck Pond which ceased operating on June 30, 2015. Copper production at Highland Valley Copper was 10,500 tonnes higher than a year ago primarily due to higher grade and recoveries while our share of production from Antamina increased by 6,500 tonnes as a result of record mill throughput during the quarter. Copper production was also higher at Carmen de Andacollo, although production was lower at Quebrada Blanca after processing facilities were temporarily shut down due to unanticipated ground movement in late June. Capital expenditures totaled $69 million, including $37 million for sustaining capital and $25 million for new mine development, of which $21 million was for the Quebrada Blanca Phase 2 project. Capitalized stripping costs were $51 million in the third quarter, lower than the $55 million a year ago. Markets LME copper prices averaged US$2.39 per pound in the third quarter of 2015, down 13% over the prior period. Copper prices remained volatile trading to the lowest levels since 2009. Total reported exchange stocks rose 51,872 tonnes during the quarter to 0.5 million tonnes. Total reported global copper stocks are now estimated to be 8.3 days of global consumption, below the estimated 25 year average of 28 days of global consumption. Operational issues at copper mines continue to impact current and future mine production. As a result of these supply disruptions and price related mine suspensions, large copper surpluses originally forecast for 2015 and 2016 have moved closer to balance despite weaker demand growth. Market fundamentals remain positive over the medium to long-term with supply constrained by lower grades, ongoing operational difficulties and project delays or deferrals due to the current low prices. Operations Highland Valley Copper Copper production was 40,200 tonnes in the third quarter or 35% higher than a year ago, due to higher copper grades and higher recoveries. Mill throughput was lower than a year ago due to harder ore in the current phase of the Valley pit. Molybdenum production declined to 0.7 million pounds from 1.6 million pounds a year ago primarily due to lower grade, partially offset by higher recovery. Operating costs increased $18 million or 16% compared to the same period a year ago as a result of higher sales. Unit costs declined significantly compared to a year ago due to higher sales and substantial progress on cost savings programs. As we continue to mine the higher grade but harder ore in the current phase of the Valley pit, throughput is expected to remain similar for the remainder of 2015. Grades are expected to be lower in the final quarter compared to the previous quarter, but will remain above reserve grade. The crusher relocation project for the Valley pit was successfully completed in the third quarter for a total cost of $56 million, well below the budget of $69 million. This project provides access to over 30 million tonnes of reserves as part of our current life of mine plan. Antamina Copper production in the third quarter increased by 36% compared with a year ago primarily as a result of higher mill throughput. The mix of mill feed in the quarter was 57% copper-only ore and 43% copper-zinc ore compared to 63% and 37%, respectively, in the same period a year ago. Our share of zinc production of 16,300 tonnes in the third quarter decreased by 1% compared with a year ago due to lower grades, partially offset by higher mill throughput and greater copper-zinc ore processed. Antamina achieved mill throughput of 14.3 million tonnes for the quarter, an average of 155,400 tonnes per day, 16% higher than the same period last year. Recent debottlenecking projects focused primarily on the crushing and conveying system have enabled throughputs much higher than the 130,000 tonnes per day design capacity of the original expansion project. Throughput rates going forward will be dependent on ore hardness and the mix of ore feeds to the plant, but are expected to continue above original design capacity rates. Operating costs in the third quarter were 14% higher compared to a year ago due to higher sales. Significant progress has been made in reducing U.S. dollar unit costs, with savings more than offset by foreign currency translation and the effects of the weaker Canadian dollar. On October 7, 2015, we announced that we and a subsidiary had entered into a long-term streaming agreement with a subsidiary of Franco-Nevada Corporation (Franco-Nevada) linked to production at the Antamina mine. Compania Minera Antamina S.A., in which we hold a 22.5% interest and which owns and operates Antamina is not a party to the agreement and operations will not be affected. Franco-Nevada made a payment of US$610 million and will pay 5% of the spot price at the time of delivery for each ounce of silver delivered under the agreement. We will deliver silver to Franco-Nevada equivalent to 22.5% of payable silver sold by CMA, using a silver payability factor of 90%. After 86 million ounces of silver have been delivered under the agreement, the stream will be reduced by one third. Quebrada Blanca Copper production in the third quarter decreased by 46% compared with a year ago due to the precautionary suspension of mining in the area adjacent to the SX/EW plant and a temporary shutdown of the processing facilities. Heap leach ore placed decreased by 37% as a result of the ground movement. Normal operations resumed in August, although mining continues to be restricted and stable operations were achieved for the month of September at better than planned unit costs. We will continue to operate the south side of the EW plant only which has sufficient production capacity for the remainder of the mine life. Production for 2015 is expected to be about 38,000 tonnes of copper cathode. The full impact on the mine life and future operating plans continues to be assessed in conjunction with remedial plans to ensure stability of the mine, plant and associated infrastructure. These plans will be finalized by the end of the year as we complete our engineering assessments, budgeting and further cost reduction processes. Operating costs increased by $32 million or 49% compared with the same period a year ago primarily as a result of inventory write-downs to reflect lower copper prices and the effects of the weaker Canadian dollar. We continue to progress the updating of environmental permits for the existing facilities for the supergene operation. The review and indigenous consultation processes by the relevant regulatory agencies are still in progress as we await approval. All three labour agreements at Quebrada Blanca were successfully negotiated during the quarter, each with a term of two years. Carmen de Andacollo Copper production in the third quarter increased by 9% compared with a year ago primarily as a result of higher copper recovery and higher throughput. In late September, a major earthquake in the region damaged our ship loading facilities at the port of Coquimbo. To date production has not been materially affected, but shipments of concentrate have been temporarily suspended through the port facility while the operator completes damage assessments and repairs. Alternate loading arrangements are being arranged with resumption of shipping anticipated within the next two weeks. There is sufficient storage capacity at the port and mine site through to the end of October. Operating costs decreased by $4 million or 5% compared with a year ago due to lower sales, and partially offset by the effect of the stronger U.S. dollar. U.S. dollar unit costs were similar to the same period a year ago. During the quarter and extending into early October, both Carmen de Andacollo labour agreements were successfully re-negotiated for a four-year term. On July 8th, 2015, our subsidiary Compania Minera Teck Carmen de Andacollo (Carmen de Andacollo) sold an interest in gold reserves and resources from the Carmen de Andacollo mine to RGLD Gold AG (RGLDAG), a wholly owned subsidiary of Royal Gold, Inc. Under the terms of the agreement, RGLDAG is entitled to an amount of gold equal to 100% of the payable gold produced from the Andacollo mine until 900,000 ounces have been delivered, and 50% thereafter. RGLDAG will pay a cash price of 15% of the monthly average gold price at the time of each delivery. Carmen de Andacollo and Royal Gold Chile Limitada, a wholly owned subsidiary of Royal Gold, Inc., terminated an earlier royalty agreement entered into in 2010. Royal Gold Chile Limitada was entitled to a payment based on 75% of payable gold produced from the Andacollo mine until 910,000 ounces had been delivered, and 50% thereafter. Approximately 260,000 ounces of payable gold subject to the royalty agreement were produced through June 30, 2015, the effective date of the termination. Net cash proceeds to us from the transaction were US$162 million. Cost of Sales Unit cash costs of product sold in the third quarter of 2015 as reported in U.S. dollars, before cash margins for by-products, decreased primarily due to higher sales volumes, continued cost reduction efforts and the favourable effects of a stronger U.S. dollar at our Canadian operations. Copper Development Projects Quebrada Blanca Phase 2 During the third quarter of 2015, activities continued to focus on capital optimization and permitting for the Quebrada Blanca Phase 2 project. A decision has been made to move the proposed tailings facility to a location closer to the mine site. The proposed facility is expected to provide sufficient capacity for tailings from ore mined during the first 25 years of the mine life. This decision, as well as other plant and infrastructure optimizations in the current design, is expected to materially reduce initial capital costs for the project. We expect to complete a new cost estimate in the first half of 2016 as engineering on these design changes progresses. The design is expected to have a lower capital intensity as throughput and production rates are not anticipated to be lower. Additional baseline work is required as a result of these changes and we now anticipate submitting an Environmental Impact Assessment to the authorities mid to late 2016. Project Corridor In August we announced an agreement with Goldcorp Inc. to combine the El Morro and Relincho projects, located approximately 40 kilometres apart in the Huasco Province in the Atacama region of Chile, into a single project. Teck and Goldcorp will contribute their respective project interests into a 50/50 joint venture with closing of the transaction anticipated in the fourth quarter. In combination with community consultation, a pre-feasibility study is expected to commence in early 2016 and be completed in approximately 18 months. Other Copper Projects We continue to minimize expenditures on all other copper projects. Targeted studies continue at the Galore Creek, Schaft Creek and Mesaba projects as we further explore ways to enhance the value of these projects. The pre-feasibility study continued to progress at our 50% owned Zafranal copper-gold project located in southern Peru and is now anticipated to be complete at the end of the first quarter in 2016. Outlook We expect full year production for copper in the range of 345 to 350 thousand tonnes. ZINC BUSINESS UNIT Performance Gross profit before depreciation and amortization from our zinc business unit was unchanged year over year. A lower realized zinc price in U.S. dollars and lower contributions from coproducts and by-products were offset by the favourable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, lower royalties, higher sales and lower operating costs. Refined zinc production from our Trail Operations increased by 11% compared to last year due to improved operating efficiencies in the electrolytic plant and to the improved reliability of the new acid plant, leading to higher throughput. The table below summarizes the gross profit change, before depreciation and amortization, in our zinc business unit for the quarter. Markets LME zinc prices averaged US$0.84 per pound in the third quarter of 2015, down 16% over the prior quarter. Zinc prices fell to a low of US$0.71 per pound in the quarter, the lowest level since 2009. Reported zinc exchange stocks rose 111,560 tonnes during the quarter to end at 756,060 tonnes. Total global reported stocks are now estimated at 19 days of global consumption down from the 25 year average of 42 days. Demand for refined zinc in our key North American markets remains weaker again this quarter with our customers facing headwinds from reduced demand and continued imports of low-cost galvanized sheet. Zinc stocks continue to decline in both metal and concentrates year to date. Zinc supply will become further constrained later in 2015 and into 2016 with planned mine closures including the recently announced closures from major suppliers taking effect. Operations Red Dog Zinc grade and recovery was similar to 2014, however, mill throughput was lower than the third quarter of 2014 due to lower throughput rate and unplanned mill downtime resulting in 12% less zinc production. Higher lead grade offset by lower recovery and throughput than in 2014 resulted in 8% less lead production. Zinc sales volumes were similar to the third quarter of 2014. Operating costs in the current quarter increased due to the effects of the stronger U.S. dollar. Capitalized stripping costs were $11 million in the third quarter compared with $9 million a year ago. Trail Zinc production was 11% higher this quarter than in the third quarter of 2014 as a result of improved reliability of the new acid plants and good current efficiency in the zinc cell house. Lead production was 8% lower than a year ago as the annual KIVCET shutdown was advanced from the fourth quarter to the third quarter. Cost of sales increased by 5%, largely related to higher zinc production and sales during the quarter. Pend Oreille Mill throughput was 81% of design capacity of 2,000 tonnes per day during the third quarter due to delays in fully implementing pillar recovery mining. The concentrator is performing as anticipated with recoveries expected to improve as mill feed variability is reduced. Outlook The Pend Oreille mine is forecasted to reach the full production rate of 44,000 tonnes per year of zinc metal at the end of the fourth quarter of 2015 once pillar recovery mining is fully implemented. The 2015 shipping season is expected to be completed on October 22, 2015 following the shipment of 1,048,000 tonnes of zinc concentrate and 216,000 tonnes of lead concentrate compared with 1,025,000 tonnes and 205,000 tonnes, respectively, for the 2014 season. This represents all of Red Dog's concentrates available to be shipped from the operation. Sales volumes of contained zinc are estimated at approximately 200,000 tonnes in the fourth quarter of 2015. ENERGY BUSINESS UNIT Fort Hills Project Construction of the Fort Hills project is progressing substantially in accordance with the project schedule. In the third quarter of 2015 our capital expenditures were $217 million compared with a cash spending estimate of $213 million. Our capital expenditures in 2015 were $664 million to date compared with our cash forecast spending estimate which was $691 million. Our share of Fort Hills cash expenditures in 2015 is estimated at $850 million. Since sanction, the project has achieved and continues to track to key milestones. Engineering activity is progressing well, and is now 94% complete, construction is progressing per plan and is now approximately 43% complete. Equipment and material deliveries are continuing and offsite modular fabrication, site civil works and process facility construction are well underway. Site construction workforce is currently approximately 4,800 and will continue to ramp-up to peak in 2016. The capital cost and schedule outlook have not changed since we announced project sanction in October 2013. We continue to target first oil in the fourth quarter of 2017, with 90% of our planned production capacity of 180,000 barrels per day (bpd) expected within 12 months. Our share of production is expected to be 36,000 bpd (13 million barrels per year) of bitumen. We are continuing to review options to sell diluted bitumen into the North American and overseas markets which may include the use of pipelines from Hardisty or rail to access tidewater ports and U.S. Gulf Coast refineries. Frontier Energy Project The Frontier regulatory application review continues with the provincial and federal regulators. We responded to the regulators' information requests and provided a project update in June 2015. The project update improves the economic and social benefits and overall environmental performance of the project. We expect responses from the regulators on the updated project in the fourth quarter of 2015. The earliest anticipated first oil date for our Frontier Project is now 2026, which reflects additional time required for updates to the project in light of the lease exchange transaction and revisions to the project scope. The regulatory review process is expected to continue through 2015; making late 2016 or early 2017 the earliest date in which a decision is expected. Our expenditures on Frontier are limited to supporting this process. Wintering Hills Wind Power Facility During the third quarter, our share of the power generation from Wintering Hills was 28 GWhs, resulting in 18,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent offsets. Our share of expected power generation in 2015 is 135 GWhs, resulting in approximately 85,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent offsets, although actual generation will depend on weather conditions and other factors. OTHER OPERATING COST AND EXPENSES Other operating expenses, net of other income, were $174 million in the third quarter compared with $41 million a year ago. This includes negative pricing adjustments of $141 million, including adjustments, on copper and zinc of $98 million and $34 million, respectively. We also made additional environmental provisions of $15 million. The table below outlines our outstanding receivable positions, provisionally valued at September 30 and June 30, 2015. Finance expense was $79 million in the third quarter, similar to a year ago. Debt interest expense increased due to the effect of the stronger U.S. dollar, as all our debt and related interest expense is U.S. dollar denominated. We capitalized a total of $59 million in interest in the quarter. Other non-operating expense of $44 million included foreign exchange losses of $35 million on that portion of our debt which is not offset by investments in U.S. dollar denominated foreign subsidiaries and a loss on marketable securities of $13 million. The income and resource recovery for the third quarter was $767 million, or 26% of pre-tax loss. This effective tax rate reflects the effect of impairment charges and is not comparable with our historical and expected future tax rates. Impairment charges of $2,895 million including an impairment of goodwill, which is not tax-deductible, resulted in a tax recovery of $741 million. Before impairment charges, we recorded a tax recovery of $27 million on pre-tax loss of $27 million. This unusual result comes about, in part, as a higher proportion of our earnings have come from lower tax rate jurisdictions or bear lower rates of tax due to the nature of the underlying items. We also evaluate tax assets and liabilities on a quarterly basis based on facts and circumstances, expected future earnings levels, and assessments and resolutions of tax matters and changes in these evaluations can significantly affect our tax rate at lower income levels. Due to available tax pools, we are currently shielded from cash income taxes, but not resource taxes in Canada. We remain subject to cash taxes in foreign jurisdictions. FINANCIAL POSITION AND LIQUIDITY Our cash position increased from $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion in the quarter. Significant outflows included $217 million on Fort Hills project expenditures. Significant inflows included a net $209 million (US$162 million) on our share of the Carmen de Andacollo gold stream transaction. Subsequent to quarter end, we received an additional $789 million (US$610 million) in October from the silver streaming agreement with Franco-Nevada related to our Antamina mine and repaid US$300 million on a note due October 1. Our cash flow in the last quarter of the year will be affected by the seasonality of Red Dog sales and the reduction of inventories. Based on the repayment of US$300 million of notes that were due October 1 and cash received from the silver streaming agreement, as well as current commodity prices and exchange rates, we now expect our year-end cash balance to be approximately $1.8 billion, assuming existing debt levels. We maintain various committed and uncommitted credit facilities for liquidity and for the issuance of letters of credit. All of our bank credit facilities are unsecured and any borrowings rank pari passu with our outstanding public notes. None of our notes or credit facilities are guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries. We maintain two primary revolving committed credit facilities. Our US$3 billion facility matures in July 2020 and has a letter of credit sub-limit of US$1 billion. Any letters of credit issued under this facility would reduce the amount of the facility that can be drawn for cash. Our US$1.2 billion facility matures in June 2017 and can be drawn fully for cash or for letters of credit. Both facilities require us to pay a commitment fee on undrawn amounts and a specified spread above LIBOR on any drawn amounts, which varies with our credit rating, but does not further vary if our ratings from both Moody's and S&P are below Ba1 or BB high, respectively. Drawings under both facilities are available for general corporate purposes. Both facilities were undrawn at September 30, 2015. Borrowing under our primary committed credit facilities is subject to our compliance with the covenants in the agreement and our ability to make certain representations and warranties at the time of the borrowing request. Our credit facilities, but not our public notes, include a financial covenant that requires us to maintain our debt to debt-plus-equity ratio below 50%. Borrowing under the credit facilities is not conditioned on us maintaining any particular credit rating or there being no general developments that could be expected to have a material adverse effect on us. While we have no current intention to incur secured debt, we are restricted under our bank and public note covenants from creating liens on certain assets to secure indebtedness unless those liens also secure our credit facilities and notes. We are restricted from creating liens on major assets. There are a number of exceptions from these negative pledge covenants, including an exception for liens securing debt that does not exceed 10% of consolidated net tangible assets. As at September 30, 2015, our consolidated net tangible assets for the purposes of our credit facilities and public notes totaled approximately $32.3 billion, 10%, of which is approximately $3.2 billion In addition to our two primary revolving committed credit facilities, we also maintain uncommitted bilateral credit facilities with various banks and with Export Development Canada for the issuance of letters of credit, primarily to support our future reclamation obligations. At September 30, 2015 these facilities totaled $1.5 billion and outstanding letters of credit issued thereunder were $1.15 billion. We expect these amounts to increase by approximately $225 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 for an increased reclamation estimate at our Red Dog mine and for water related permitting in the Elk Valley. These facilities are typically renewed on an annual basis. From time to time, at our election, we may reduce the fees paid to banks issuing letters of credit by making short-term deposits of excess cash with those banks. The deposits earn a competitive rate of interest and are generally refundable on demand. At September 30 we had US$400 million of such deposits. Our reclamation obligations are included in \"Other Liabilities and Provisions\" on our balance sheet. Associated letters of credit would not become a liability unless the letter of credit is drawn by the beneficiary, which drawing would be triggered if we did not perform our obligations under the relevant contact or permit. In the event of the drawing, we would be required to reimburse the issuing bank for the amount drawn on the letter of credit. Issued letters of credit do not constitute debt for the purpose of the debt-to-debt plus equity covenant in our bank credit agreements. Since the end of the second quarter, Moody's, S&P and Fitch revised our credit ratings to Ba1, BB and BB+, respectively, in each case with a negative outlook. DBRS currently rates us BBB with a negative outlook. As a consequence of these ratings actions, we are required to deliver an aggregate of US$672 million of letters of credit pursuant to long-term power purchase agreements for the Quebrada Blanca Phase 2 project. We are in discussions with our counterparty regarding deferring the issuance of these letters of credit, which are otherwise required to be issued before the end of October, however, there is no assurance that this deferral will be permitted. The letters of credit would be terminated if and when we regain investment grade ratings. We may also be required to post letters of credit under certain pipeline and storage agreements we entered into in connection with the Fort Hills project. If required, these letters of credit would be in amounts up to approximately $425 million and increasing to approximately $650 million in 2017 prior to the relevant in-service date. Following such in-service date, the letter of credit amount would reduce to up to approximately $450 million. These Fort Hills related letters of credit would also be terminated if and when we regain investment grade ratings. The ratings actions described above do not affect our credit facilities beyond the rate of the commitment fee and cost of borrowing. There are no restrictions on borrowing, or additional covenants, triggered under our credit facilities as a result of the downgrade. Operating Cash Flow Cash flow from operations, before changes in non-cash working capital items, was $302 million in the third quarter compared with $553 million a year ago. Changes in working capital items increased cash by $258 million in the third quarter. The decrease in working capital in the quarter was due to lower inventory and receivables compared to the second quarter. This is a matter of the timing of a number of operating items. Investing Activities Expenditures on property, plant and equipment were $217 million in the third quarter for the Fort Hills oil sands project, $83 million on sustaining capital and $18 million on major enhancement projects. The largest components of sustaining expenditures were $17 million at our Red Dog Operations and $14 million at Highland Valley Copper. Major enhancement expenditures included approximately $7 million at our steelmaking coal operations. Capitalized stripping expenditures were $146 million in the third quarter compared with $145 million a year ago. The majority of this item constitutes the advancement of pits for future production at our steelmaking coal mines. Financing Activities Financing activities in the third quarter consisted of capital lease repayments of $13 million (2014 - $16 million) and debt interest payments of $188 million (2014 - $156 million). We distributed $21 million to minority interests in our operations (2014 - $6 million) and paid dividends of $86 million (2014 - $259 million). We repaid US$300 million on a note on October 1. OUTLOOK We continue to experience challenging markets for our products and prices for some of our products have declined and lower prices may persist for some time. Commodity markets have historically been volatile, prices can change rapidly and customers can alter shipment plans. This can have a substantial effect on our business. Reduced supply of steelmaking coal from U.S. and Canada is offset by weaker demand, particularly in China, and by increased Australian supply, maintaining downward pressure on prices. We are also significantly affected by foreign exchange rates. In the last nine months, the U.S. dollar strengthened by approximately 15% against the Canadian dollar, which has had a positive effect on the profitability of our Canadian operations. It will, to a lesser extent, put upward pressure on the portion of our operating costs and capital spending that is denominated in U.S. dollars. In October 2013, we approved an estimated $2.9 billion (our share) to complete the development of the Fort Hills oil sands project, of which approximately $1.5 billion remains to be spent. We have access to cash and credit lines which are expected to be sufficient to meet our capital commitments and working capital needs over this period. We are taking further steps to manage our capital spending profile and we continuously monitor all aspects of our cost reduction program, our capital spending and key markets as conditions evolve. In addition, we could be subject to labour unrest or other disturbances as a result of delays in or the failure of negotiations of new contracts, which could limit our ability to maintain steelmaking coal or copper production in accordance with our plans. If this were to occur, the potential shortfall in planned production could be material. We continue to monitor market conditions for steelmaking coal and currently expect production rates to match our sales projections for the fourth quarter. Foreign Exchange, Debt Revaluation and Interest Expense The sales of our products are denominated in U.S. dollars, while a significant portion of our expenses are incurred in local currencies, particularly the Canadian dollar and the Chilean peso. Foreign exchange fluctuations can have a significant effect on our operating margins, unless such fluctuations are offset by related changes to commodity prices. Our U.S. dollar denominated debt is subject to revaluation based on changes in the Canadian/U.S. dollar exchange rate. As at September 30, 2015, $6.1 billion of our U.S. dollar denominated debt is designated as a hedge against our foreign operations that have a U.S. dollar functional currency. As a result, any foreign exchange gains or losses arising on that amount of our U.S. dollar debt are recorded in other comprehensive income, with the remainder being charged to profit. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND DERIVATIVES We hold a number of financial instruments and derivatives which are recorded on our balance sheet at fair value with gains and losses in each period included in other comprehensive income and profit for the period as appropriate. The most significant of these instruments are marketable securities, foreign exchange forward sales contracts, metal-related forward contracts and settlements receivable and payable. Some of our gains and losses on metalrelated financial instruments are affected by smelter price participation and are taken into account in determining royalties and other expenses. All are subject to varying rates of taxation depending on their nature and jurisdiction. OUTSTANDING SHARE DATA As at October 21, 2015 there were 566.8 million Class B subordinate voting shares and 9.4 million Class A common shares outstanding. In addition, there were 16.0 million stock options outstanding with exercise prices ranging between $4.15 and $58.80 per share. More information on these instruments and the terms of their conversion is set out in Note 19 of our 2014 audited financial statements. INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Any system of internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. There have been no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2015 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS - IMPAIRMENT TESTING In preparing consolidated financial statements, management makes estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses across all reportable segments. Management makes estimates and judgments that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our estimates and judgments are based on historical experience and other factors we consider to be reasonable, including expectations of future events. Critical accounting estimates and judgments are those that could affect the consolidated financial statements materially, are highly uncertain and where changes are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Impairment testing is an area that requires significant judgment, both in assessing whether certain factors would be considered an indicator of impairment and when an indicator is present, determining the assumptions used in preparing discounted cash models. We consider both internal and external information to determine whether there is an indicator of impairment present and accordingly, when impairment testing is required. When impairment testing is required, discounted cash flow models are used to estimate the recoverable amounts of respective assets. Significant assumptions used in preparing these discounted cash flow models include commodity prices, reserves and resources, operating costs, capital expenditures, discount rates, foreign exchange rates, tax assumptions and inflation rates. These inputs are based on management's best estimates of what an independent market participant would consider appropriate and are reviewed by senior management. Changes in these inputs may alter the results of impairment testing, the amount of impairment charges recorded in the statement of income and the resulting carrying values of assets. In light of current economic conditions we have revised our market participant long-term price expectations for copper, zinc, steelmaking coal and oil and performed a detailed review of impairment indicators across all of our operations and assets. Where required, we have estimated the recoverable amount of our assets on a fair value less costs of disposal basis (FVLCD) and have determined that this was higher than the value in use of these assets. In our copper, zinc, steelmaking coal and energy business units we have identified Cash Generating Units with carrying values that exceed the estimated recoverable amounts. FVLCD was estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology taking into account assumptions likely to be made by market participants. Cash flow projections are based on current life of mine plans and exploration potential. Commodity Prices Commodity price assumptions are based on a number of factors, including forward curves in the near term, and are benchmarked with external sources of information, including information published by our peers and where possible, market transactions, to ensure they are within the range of values used by market participants. Our key commodity price assumptions are based on current prices over the next three years escalating to a real long-term price. For steelmaking coal, copper and zinc, we start with a 2016 price of US$96 per tonne, US$2.50 per pound and US$0.85 per pound for each respective commodity. These prices are gradually escalated over the next three years, reaching a real long-term price in 2020 of US$130 per tonne, US$3.00 per pound and US$1.00 per pound for steelmaking coal, copper and zinc, respectively. For impairment testing of assets within our energy business unit, we have used a long-term West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price of US$75 per barrel and a Western Canadian Select (WCS) differential of US$10.50 per barrel. Reserves and Resources Future mineral production is included in projected cash flows based on mineral reserve and resource estimates and exploration and evaluation work, undertaken by appropriately qualified persons. Operating Costs and Capital Expenditures Operating costs and capital expenditures are based on life of mine plans and internal management forecasts. Cost estimates incorporate management experience and expertise, current operating costs, the nature and location of each operation and the risks associated with each operation. Future capital expenditures are based on management's best estimate of expected future capital requirements, which are generally for the extraction and processing of existing reserves and resources. All committed and anticipated capital expenditures based on future cost estimates have been included in the projected cash flows. Operating cost and capital expenditure assumptions are continuously subject to on-going optimization and review by management. Discount Rates Discount rates used are based on the weighted average cost of capital for a mining industry peer group and are calculated with reference to current market information. Adjustments to the rate are made for any risks that are not reflected in the underlying cash flows. A 5.8% real, 7.9% nominal, post-tax discount rate was used to discount cash flow projections in all of our FVLCD discounted cash flows. Foreign Exchange Rates Foreign exchange rates are benchmarked with external sources of information based on a range used by market participants. The long-term Canadian - U.S. dollar foreign exchange assumption used was 1 U.S. dollar to 1.25 Canadian dollars. Inflation Rates Inflation rates are based on average historical inflation for the location of each operation and long-term government bond yields. Inflation rates are benchmarked with external sources of information and are within a range used by market participants. The inflation rate for all FVLCD calculations is 2%. Turqoise Hill Resources Ltd. (TSE: TRQ) Turquoise Hill Resources (TRQ: TSX, NYSE & NASDAQ) is an international mining company with copper-gold and coal mines in the Asia Pacific region. Principal assets: A 66% interest in Oyu Tolgoi, one of the world's largest copper-gold-silver mines now producing and shipping concentrate to customers in China. A 22.63% interest in established Mongolian coal miner SouthGobi Resources (SGQ: TSX, 1878: HK). Turquoise Hill announces financial results and review of operations for the third quarter of 2015 VANCOUVER, CANADA - Turquoise Hill Resources today announced its financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. All figures are in US dollars unless otherwise stated. . HIGHLIGHTS Oyu Tolgoi achieved a strong safety performance with an All Injury Frequency Rate of 0.31 per 200,000 hours worked for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Oyu Tolgoi recorded revenue of $431.7 million in Q3'15 on sales of 226,000 tonnes of concentrate, a 2.5% increase over Q2'15, reflecting higher sales volumes partially offset by lower copper prices. Turquoise Hill reported income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders of $44.0 million. In Q3'15, a non-cash charge of $76.4 million was recorded within operating expenses for provision against non-current ore stockpile inventory. Turquoise Hill generated operating cash flow before interest and taxes of $171.7 million during Q3'15. Oyu Tolgoi's Q3'15 mine production was at record levels while concentrate produced and contained copper were on par with Q2'15 even considering the planned concentrator shutdown in July 2015. During Q3'15, mined production increased 8.5% over Q2'15 due to shorter hauling routes and ongoing productivity initiatives. Copper in concentrates for Q3'15 increased 1.3% due to higher head grades while gold in concentrates decreased 48.3% over Q2'15 due to slower than anticipated access to gold-rich ore. Increased copper and gold production is expected in Q4'15 compared to Q3'15 as higher-grade ore is accessed in the open pit. Turquoise Hill continues to expect Oyu Tolgoi to produce 175,000 to 195,000 tonnes of copper and 600,000 to 700,000 ounces of gold in concentrates in 2015. In August 2015, Oyu Tolgoi filed revised schedules for the 2015 Oyu Tolgoi Feasibility Study with the Mongolian Minerals Council. Underground pre-start activities are underway in parallel with an update to the feasibility study capital estimate, which is expected to be completed in Q1'16. Turquoise Hill continues to expect signing of project financing by the end of 2015 and the decision for underground construction in early Q2'16. Capital expenditure for 2015 is now expected to be approximately $120 million, of which approximately $115 million relates to sustaining capital, due to operational efficiencies, changes to the mine plan during the year and capital optimization. Operating cash costs for 2015 are now expected to be approximately $900 million reflecting operational improvements throughout the year and excluding one-time costs related to the May 2015 underground agreement as well as pre-start costs for underground development. Sales contracts have been signed for more than 80% of Oyu Tolgoi's expected 2016 concentrate production. In September 2015, Oyu Tolgoi surpassed 1.5 million tonnes of concentrate shipped. Turquoise Hill's cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2015 were $1.3 billion. FINANCIAL RESULTS In Q3'15, the Company recorded net income attributable to owners of Turquoise Hill of $21.2 million or $0.01 per share compared with net loss of $94.0 million or ($0.05) per share in Q3'14, an increase of $115.2 million. The increase is mainly attributable to a $227.3 million non-cash impairment charge recorded in Q3'14 on reclassification of SouthGobi to assets held for sale. Operating cash flows before interest and taxes in Q3'15 were $171.7 million compared with $256.3 million in Q3'14, reflecting continued production and delivery cost improvements and effective working capital management, offset by the impact of lower commodity prices on sales revenue. Additions to property, plant and equipment, excluding adjustments relating to asset retirement obligations ($9.7 million), were $31.1 million in Q3'15 all of which related to sustaining capital activities including the tailing storage facility. Turquoise Hill's cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2015 were $1.3 billion. OYU TOLGOI The Oyu Tolgoi mine is approximately 550 kilometres south of Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia's capital city, and 80 kilometres north of the Mongolia-China border. Mineralization on the property consists of porphyry-style copper, gold, silver and molybdenum contained in a linear structural trend (the Oyu Tolgoi Trend) that has a strike length extending over 26 kilometres. Mineral resources have been identified in a series of deposits throughout this trend. They include, from south to north, the Heruga Deposit, the Southern Oyu deposits (Southwest Oyu, South Oyu, Wedge and Central Oyu) and the Hugo Dummett deposits (Hugo South, Hugo North and Hugo North Extension). Mining of ore commenced in May 2012 and first concentrate was produced in January 2013. The Oyu Tolgoi mine has initially been developed as an open-pit operation. A copper concentrator plant, with related facilities and necessary infrastructure to support a nominal throughput of 100,000 tonnes of ore per day, has been constructed to process ore mined from the Southern Oyu open pit. Long term development plans for Oyu Tolgoi are based on a 95,000-tonne-per-day underground block-cave mine. In August 2013, development of the underground mine was delayed pending resolution of matters with the Government of Mongolia. On May 18, 2015, Turquoise Hill, the Government of Mongolia and Rio Tinto announced the signing of the Oyu Tolgoi Underground Mine Development and Financing Plan, which addressed key outstanding shareholder matters and set out an agreed basis for the funding of the project. Preparation for underground development Following the filing of revised schedules for the 2015 Oyu Tolgoi Feasibility Study with the Mongolian Minerals Council in August 2015, pre-start activities are underway in parallel with an update to the capital estimate, which is expected to be completed in Q1'16. Pre-start activities include ramp-up of the owners and EPCM team, reestimate activities, detailed engineering and early procurement for equipment and materials required for necessary critical works that are key enablers for recommencement of underground lateral development mining activity. Care and maintenance activities have continued for Shaft #1, facilities and mobile equipment. Turquoise Hill expects the decision for underground construction in early Q2'16. The Company continues to expect signing of project financing by the end of 2015. In September 2015, the Government of Mongolia signed the request of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) for host country approval (HCA) with respect to guarantees to be issued by MIGA in connection with the Oyu Tolgoi project financing. The signing of the HCA was a significant milestone in the project financing timeline. In October 2015, the project financing information circular was provided to the banking syndicate allowing for each institution's respective internal consideration and approval. Prior to the suspension in August 2013, underground lateral development at Hugo North had advanced approximately 16 kilometres off Shaft #1. Sinking of Shaft #2, the primary operations access and initial production hoisting shaft, had reached a depth of 1,168 metres below surface, 91% of its final depth of 1,284 metres. The 96 metre-high Shaft #2 concrete headframe has been constructed. Sinking of Shaft #5, a dedicated exhaust ventilation shaft, had reached a depth of 208 metres, 17% of its final depth of 1,174 metres. Surface facilities, including offices, mine dry, and workshop, are in place to support initial pre-production development and construction. Q3'15 performance Safety continues to be a major focus throughout Oyu Tolgoi's operations and the mine's management is committed to reducing risk and injury. Oyu Tolgoi achieved a solid safety performance with an All Injury Frequency Rate of 0.31 per 200,000 hours worked for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Revenue in Q3'15 increased 2.5% over Q2'15. Higher revenues reflect higher volumes of copper-gold concentrate sales, partially offset by a fall in copper prices. The Q3'15 mix of revenue by metals is the result of inventory with higher contained copper and gold drawn down during the quarter from concentrate produced in Q2'15. Gross margin at 41.6% for the quarter reduced from 46.4% in Q2'15 due to the effect of lower copper prices. Production and delivery costs include primarily the cash costs in inventory sold as well as allocated mine administration costs. Depreciation and depletion includes the depreciation and depletion in inventory sold as well as any depreciation of assets used in the selling and delivery process, including the depreciation of capitalized production phase stripping costs. A non-cash charge of $76.4 million was recorded in Q3'15, within operating expenses, for additional provision against non-current ore stockpiles, following re-estimation of realizable value to reflect lower copper and gold prices and updated assumptions for timing of processing. Total additions capitalized to property, plant and equipment, on an accruals basis, for Q3'15 were $31.1 million (Q3'14: $38.3 million) all attributed to sustaining activities, including the tailings storage facility and deferred stripping. Total additions for Q3'15 include an adjustment of $4.0 million, which reduced the carrying amount of underground evaluation costs capitalized in previous quarters to be in accordance with the Company's accounting policy on the recognition of exploration and evaluation costs. Total cash operating costs at Oyu Tolgoi in Q3'15 were $222.5 million. Following transition to IFRS, the 5% royalty payable to the Government of Mongolia, previously deducted from revenue, is reflected as a cash operating expense, and production phase stripping costs, previously included within cash operating expense, are capitalized and depreciated. During Q3'15, Oyu Tolgoi continued to improve and optimize operations in order to reduce costs across the mine's operation. Oyu Tolgoi's C1 costs in Q3'15 were $0.40 per pound, compared with $0.73 per pound in Q2'15. The decrease was mainly due to a $22.1 million charge in Q2'15 for settlement of amounts not previously paid or provided for in relation to Mongolian Tax assessments, following signature of the underground agreement on May 18, 2015, and a net reduction in inventory (excluding non-cash write-down) as sales volumes exceeded production. Oyu Tolgoi's open-pit mine has a high-grade zone containing a large proportion of gold in addition to copper; Turquoise Hill anticipates quarterly fluctuation of C1 costs as the quantity of gold in concentrates sold varies after ore from this zone is fed through the mill. All-in sustaining costs in Q3'15 were $1.52 per pound, compared with $1.26 per pound in Q2'15. The increase was mainly due to a non-cash charge for additional provision against non-current ore stockpile partially offset by royalty expenses returning to regular operational levels following the Q2'15 adjustment upon signing of the underground agreement. Oyu Tolgoi's Q3'15 mine production was at record levels while concentrate produced and contained copper was on par with Q2'15 even considering the planned concentrator shutdown in July. During Q3'15, mined production increased 8.5% over Q2'15 due to shorter hauling routes and ongoing productivity initiatives. Copper in concentrates for Q3'15 increased 1.3% due to higher head grades. Gold in concentrates for the quarter decreased 48.3% over Q2'15 due to slower than anticipated access to gold-rich ore. Funding of Oyu Tolgoi by Turquoise Hill In accordance with the ARSHA dated June 8, 2011, Turquoise Hill has funded Oyu Tolgoi's cash requirements beyond internally generated cash flows by a combination of equity investment and shareholder debt. For amounts funded by debt, Oyu Tolgoi must repay such amounts, including accrued interest, before it can pay common share dividends. At September 30, 2015, the aggregate outstanding balance of shareholder loans extended by subsidiaries of the Company to Oyu Tolgoi was $6.8 billion, including accrued interest of $1.4 billion. These loans bear interest at an effective annual rate of LIBOR plus 6.5%. In Q3'15, Oyu Tolgoi repaid a total amount of $180.0 million with respect to these loans, including accrued interest of $57.9 million. In accordance with the ARSHA, a subsidiary of the Company has funded the common share investments in Oyu Tolgoi on behalf of Erdenes. These funded amounts earn interest at an effective annual rate of LIBOR plus 6.5% and are repayable, by Erdenes to a subsidiary of the Company, via a pledge over Erdenes' share of Oyu Tolgoi common share dividends. Erdenes also has the right to reduce the outstanding balance by making cash payments at any time. As at September 30, 2015, the cumulative amount of such funding was $751.1 million, representing approximately 34% of invested common share equity; unrecognized interest on the funding amounted to $214.9 million. Operational outlook Increased copper and gold production is expected in Q4'15 when compared to Q3'15 as higher-grade ore is anticipated to be accessed in the open pit. Turquoise Hill continues to expect Oyu Tolgoi to produce 175,000 to 195,000 tonnes of copper and 600,000 to 700,000 ounces of gold in concentrates in 2015. The Company expects copper production to be at the top of the range while gold production is expected to be in the middle of the range. Capital expenditure for 2015 is now expected to be approximately $120 million, of which approximately $115 million relates to sustaining capital. The Company previously expected capital expenditure of approximately $230 million, of which approximately $185 million related to sustaining capital. The reduction is the result of operational efficiencies, changes to the mine plan during the year and capital optimization. Operating cash costs for 2015 are now expected to be approximately $900 million. The Company previously expected operating cash costs of approximately $1 billion. The reduction reflects changes from operational improvements throughout the year and excludes one-time costs related to the May 2015 underground agreement as well as pre-start costs for underground development. Sales contracts have been signed for more than 80% of Oyu Tolgoi's expected 2016 concentrate production. Q3'15 exploration Oyu Tolgoi's exploration strategy is focused on developing a project pipeline prioritized in areas that can impact the current development of the Oyu Tolgoi orebodies, seeking low-cost development options; in particular looking for shallower targets. Historical datasets are added to and reinterpreted to enable future discovery. SOUTHGOBI On April 23, 2015, the Company completed sale of 48.7 million shares in SouthGobi to Novel Sunrise Investments Limited (NSI) at a price of C$0.35 per common share payable in cash, and on June 3, 2015 a further 1.7 million shares were sold to NSI at a price of C$0.35 per share. Half of the aggregate cash proceeds, representing C$8.5 million in total, were received at closing; the balance of approximately C$8.5 million was received on August 4, 2015. At September 30, 2015, Turquoise Hill owned 52.4 million SouthGobi common shares, representing approximately 21.3% of the issued and outstanding SouthGobi shares at that date. The carrying value of this interest at September 30, 2015 was $14.6 million based on the quoted share price. At September 30, 2015, SouthGobi is classified as an investment in associate within assets held for sale in the Company's financial statements. OTHER EXPLORATION Desk top studies, data compilation and detailed satellite imagery interpretation are in progress for an orbit Area approximately surrounding Oyu Tolgoi. An induced polarization and magnetotellurics survey on Turquoise Hill's Teregt licence (bordering the south of the Oyu Tolgoi licences) was conducted. The results have been analyzed and the interpretation downgraded the previous induced polarization targets. Additional soil and rock geochemical sampling has been done to test for shallow exploration targets. A service agreement is in place with Rio Tinto Holdings (Exploration), under which they provide exploration services to the Company. This agreement benefits Turquoise Hill by allowing access to Rio Tinto's global expertise, knowledge base and skills. CORPORATE ACTIVITIES Management change In September 2015, Turquoise Hill announced the resignation of Stewart Beckman, Senior Vice President, Operations and Technical Development, effective October 1, 2015 due to Mr. Beckman having accepted a new position within Rio Tinto. The Company is conducting a search for Mr. Beckman's replacement, which will be announced in due course. Mr. Beckman will provide support in the interim to ensure a smooth transition. NON-GAAP MEASURES The Company's financial results are prepared in accordance with IFRS. In addition, the Company presents and refers to the following measures (non-GAAP measures) which are not defined in IFRS. A description and calculation of these measures is given below, and may differ in some aspects from equivalent measures provided by other issuers. Cash operating costs This measure comprises Oyu Tolgoi cash operating costs, and is presented in order to provide investors and other stakeholders in the Company with a greater understanding of performance and operations at Oyu Tolgoi. The measure of cash operating costs excludes: depreciation and depletion; exploration and evaluation; charges for asset write-down (including write-down of materials and supplies inventory), and includes management services payments to Rio Tinto, and management services payments to Turquoise Hill which are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements of the Company. C1 cash costs C1 cash costs is a metric representing the cash cost per unit of extracting and processing the Company's principal metal product to a condition in which it may be delivered to customers, net of by-product credits. It is provided in order to support peer group comparability and to provide investors and other stakeholders' useful information about the underlying cash costs of Oyu Tolgoi and the impact of by-product credits on the operations' cost structure. C1 cash costs are relevant to understanding the Company's operating profitability and ability to generate cash flow. When calculating costs associated with producing a pound of copper, the Company includes gold and silver revenue credits as the production cost is reduced as a result of selling these by-products.Turquoise Hill's principal metal product is copper, and C1 cash costs are reported for Oyu Tolgoi only. All-in sustaining costs All-in sustaining costs (AISC) is an extended cash based cost metric, providing further information on the aggregate cash, capital and overhead outlay per unit, and is intended to reflect the costs of producing the Company's principal metal product over the life-cycle of its operations. The measure seeks to reflect the full cost of copper production from current operations and as a result development project capital is not included. AISC allows Turquoise Hill to assess the ability of Oyu Tolgoi to support sustaining capital expenditures for future production from the generation of operating cash flows. QUALIFIED PERSON Disclosure of a scientific or technical nature in this MD&A in respect of the Oyu Tolgoi mine was prepared under the supervision of Bernard Peters (responsibility for overall preparation and mineral reserves), B.

A total of $2.7-million was generated through a sale leaseback transaction. The proceeds will be used to pay down debt. The asset disposition is part of the company's comprehensive program to: (1) restructure operations by narrowing the number of sectors in which it operates to redeploy resources, effort and capital to higher-growth areas where the company has a competitive advantage and (2) strengthen its financial position through the sale of real estate and non-core assets to reduce its leverage. As part of this program, the company has now sold $55-million of real estate and non-core assets. The company also renewed its senior credit facility for two years until December, 2017, on favourable terms and conditions. Transformation strategy GVIC's core focus is to operate as an information and marketing solutions company, pursuing growth in sectors where the provision of essential information and related services provides high customer utility and value. The related go-to-market strategy is being pursued through two operational segments: - Content and marketing solutions (evolution of media business); - Data, analytics and intelligence. Sector focus As part of this transformational strategy, the decision was made to focus operational efforts on the provision of information and marketing solutions in the following sectors: - Agriculture: The company has a strong national presence in the agriculture information sector. The company's agriculture publications, websites, weather models and networks, databases, and trade shows are the leading sources of information for Canadian farmers, ranchers, agribusinesses and those involved in the Canadian agriculture industry. The agriculture industry is experiencing rapid change and innovation with new technologies and methods, such as precision farming, an open grain marketing system and other trends, increasing the need for and value of information. The company is well positioned to capitalize on these trends. - Energy: The energy sector is a truly global industry with strong long-term needs for information. While the industry is currently suffering from a cyclical downturn, opportunities exist as operations continue and businesses look to reduce costs and increase efficiencies. The company has strong brands such as the Daily Oil Bulletin that have served the Canadian oil patch for decades. Given the pure scale of this sector, many information product growth opportunities exist that the company will be able to capitalize on. - Mining: Like energy, mining is a global sector with strong long-term needs for information, in which Canada is a major player and GVIC has strong brands and market positions. The company has been investing in its mining information products and is well positioned for when the current cyclical downturn reverses. - Environmental risk and compliance: Eris, GVIC's environmental risk information business, is the main provider in Canada of phase 1 environmental information and recently launched into the United States, where it is the main competitor to the largest operator in the American market. Phase 1 environmental information is used by buyers and sellers of commercial real estate and financial lenders in evaluating mortgage lending risk, amongst other things. A variety of other growth opportunities exist in environmental risk and compliance information. - Real estate: The REW website, the company's real estate listing portal in the Lower Mainland in British Columbia, now has 98 per cent of the residential listings in Vancouver and recently launched into the Greater Victoria market. The REW website has a significant growth opportunity as a platform for residential and other real estate information and marketing. - Mutual funds: Fundata is the market leader of mutual fund listings information in Canada and is expanding through analytics and other products and areas. It provides GVIC with steady and growing cash flow, and offsets some of the cyclical risk of natural resources cash flows. - Community media: The community media business is a mature industry but generates significant cash flow for the company. The products continue to provide value for advertisers, and opportunities exist to leverage the local brands, marketing reach and customer relationships to generate new revenues.

According to news reporting originating in Truro, Canada, by VerticalNews journalists, research stated, \"Wild blueberry fields have a significant proportion of bare spots/weed patches, scattered throughout the field, emphasizing the need for targeted fertilizer applications. The existing prescription map-based variable rate (VR) spreader cannot take account of the presence of small, irregularly shaped bare spots/weed patches during fertilization as only each half of the boom (3.66 m; 6 nozzles) is controlled-not each individual nozzle.\" The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Dalhousie University, \"The objective of this study was to modify the existing VR spreader for spot-application (SA) of fertilizer only in plant areas. The sensing and control system developed was capable of discriminating bare spots/weeds from plants, and shifting the independent control from 6 nozzles (3.66 m) to each pair of nozzles (1.22 m). The modified VR granular (MVRG) fertilizer spreader was able to use a prescription map and the sensing and control systems simultaneously within a field, to avoid fertilization in variable sized bare spots/weed patches. The performance of the MVRG fertilizer spreader was evaluated under two different lighting conditions and three ground speeds. Twelve bare spots/weed patches and plant areas were randomly selected in the wild blueberry field and weighed sticky collectors were placed to collect clay filler which was used as an analogue of fertilizer. The MVRG fertilizer spreader was operated on SA (application only in plant areas) and uniform (application in plants and bare spots/weed patches) modes alternately and the collectors were collected and re-weighed. Results of this study suggested that the MVRG spreader was capable of detecting plants/bare spots/weeds for SA of fertilizer.\" According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Spot application of fertilizer can help to reduce excessive fertilizer usage in bare spots/weeds, which will increase farm profitability.\" Our news correspondents report that additional information may be obtained by contacting H.S.

The 33-year-old, who owns a dairy farm near Corner Brook, followed a strict schedule of 5 a.m. and 5 p.m. milkings, and had to be in the barn early each day to prepare. But ever since installing the \"robots\" - a robotic milking system he purchased last October - the cows milk themselves and Mr. Simmons sleeps in. The same \"robots\" allow him to check on the cows - who wear devices similar to FitBits to track everything from body temperature to activity level - on an iPhone app. \"I know what I need to do before I even get to the barn,\" Mr. Simmons said. He and his wife, Sara, still work as hard as ever but now they work smarter. In Newfoundland, theirs is the first dairy farm to use a robotic milking system - stalls that cows enter and exit of their own will, where lasers and a 3-D camera guide a robotic arm toward the animals' udders. But across Canada, Mr. Simmons is just one of many who are turning to cuttingedge technology, parking robots and drones in their barns next to plows and tractors. In the past, the Simmonses would rely on visual cues to know if a cow was sick: if her eyes looked sunken in, or if her chewing slowed down dramatically. But these signs take days to develop, if ever - cattle are natural prey, so they hide their symptoms to avoid appearing weak to predators. But now, with each one of their approximately 100 dairy cows wearing a black collar with a little red tracking device, the Simmonses know the minute one of their cows is behaving abnormally. \"You know when you start to get a flu ... you think you've got a tickle or you might have a little ache in your back, but you're not quite sure?\" Mr. Simmons said. \"This allows us to help take care of cows before they feel that tickle.\" The Simmonses' system is made by Lely, a Dutch company, and inside each collar device is a pedometer - which tracks that cow's activity and chewing - and a transponder. The transponder means that when a cow enters the robot - drawn into the stall by the snacks she receives once inside - the stall \"recognizes\" the cow and adjusts the settings accordingly. Much of the technology that the Simmonses use on their farm has been available for decades - Lely first prototyped an early model of the milking robot in 1992. But recent breakthroughs in \"wearable\" technology - and the development of popular mass-market products like FitBits that track people's activity and diet - mean the devices are now more reliable and affordable. In total, the system cost the Simmonses $750,000, which includes renovations to their barn. But the result has been increased milk production and a reduction in the number of staff - benefits that Mr. Simmons says will balance out the cost in the long run. The technology is meant to address persistent problems in the world of farming: increased cost of production and a shortage of skilled labour. The Simmonses in Newfoundland, for example, have found themselves competing with the Alberta oil fields for the same group of \"fly-in, fly-out\" workers. Another big part of the labour issue, experts say, is an aging population. Between 1991 and 2011, the average age of a farm operator rose from 47 to 54, according to Statistics Canada. In the same period, the number of those under the age of 55 dropped by about 42 per cent. \"The people who had a lot of expertise - the older generation - are starting to leave pretty rapidly,\" said Andrew Uden, who grew up on a Nebraska cattle farm and is now the chief operations officer at Quantified Ag, a tech company developing wearable devices for beef cattle. The new technology allows farmers to get by with fewer workers, and help make up for less experience by delivering accurate data directly from the fields, or from the animals themselves. The trend in recent years has been toward \"precision agriculture\" - using technology to gather hyper-specific data so farmers can be more efficient in their methods. Farmers, for example, can now use drones to fly over their fields, collecting data on every square inch so that they can customize how much fertilizer or insecticide to deliver to specific areas. Mr. Uden added that even those young people who do enter farming often come wanting a different type of lifestyle. \"A lot of kids don't go to college for four, five years, come out with a degree, to go ride a horse and pull sick cattle all day long,\" he said. The Simmonses are examples of this. Both David and Sara grew up on farms, earned college diplomas, and returned afterward to take over the dairy operations at Mr. Simmons's family farm. The technological changes mean they can now have breakfast and supper together most days with their young daughter. \"Our time is more flexible,\" Mr. Simmons said. \"If our little girl has an activity or playdate or birthday party, we never miss it.\""}, {"title": "INDUSTRY SNAPSHOTS; CANADA - MINING", "article": "LATEST COMPANY NEWS News and Commentary Canadian Oil Sands granted one more month to fend off Suncor's hostile bid - 30/11/2015 Canadian Oil Sands has just over a month to hold off Suncor Energy and its hostile bid.

Barrick Gold Corporation - Barrick Reports Mechanical Issue at Pueblo Viejo Oxygen Plant - 23/11/2015 TORONTO, November 23, 2015 -- Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:ABX)(TSX:ABX) (\"Barrick\" or the \"company\") today announced that a mechanical issue at the Pueblo Viejo mine in the Dominican Republic is expected to result in reduced production at the operation until mid-January 2016. Pueblo Viejo is a joint venture owned by Barrick (60 percent) and Goldcorp Inc . (40 percent). Two of three electric motors at the mine's oxygen plant experienced an unexpected failure on November 19 and have been shipped to a specialized facility in the United States for repair. One motor remains operational. The plant provides the oxygen required for the autoclave processing facility that treats Pueblo Viejo's refractory ore. Until the damaged motors are repaired, the autoclave facility will operate at a reduced capacity. The cause of the motor failure is currently under investigation. Taking into account the potential impact of lower production from Pueblo Viejo in the fourth quarter, and based on our current rate of production, Barrick now expects to produce 6.0-6.15 million ounces of gold in 2015 at all-in sustaining costs of $830-$870 per ounce. Current estimates indicate repairs can be completed with units back in service by mid-January. While repairs are underway, Pueblo Viejo is bringing forward maintenance activities previously scheduled for January to optimize the processing downtime. Pueblo Viejo has Property and Machinery Breakdown Insurance, including Business Interruption coverage, which is triggered after 30 days. Environmental management in North American mining sector Zunaira Asif, Zhi Chen Abstract This paper reviews the environmental issues and management practices in the mining sector in the North America. The sustainable measures on waste management are recognized as one of the most serious environmental concerns in the mining industry. For mining activities, it will be no surprise that the metal recovery reagents and acid effluents are a threat to the ecosystem as well as hazards to human health. In addition, poor air quality and ventilation in underground mines can lead to occupational illness and death of workers. Electricity usage and fuel consumption are major factors that contribute to greenhouse gases. On the other hand, many sustainability challenges are faced in the management of tailings and disposal of waste rock. This paper aims to highlight the problems that arise due to poor air quality and acid mine drainage. The paper also addresses some of the advantages and limitations of tailing and waste rock management that still have to be studied in context of the mining sector. This paper suggests that implementation of suitable environmental management tools like life cycle assessment (LCA), cleaner production technologies (CPTs), and multicriteria decision analysis (MCD) are important as it ultimately lead to improve environmental performance and enabling a mine to focus on the next stage of sustainability. The Industry Mining Facts Minerals and metals are the building blocks of the computers and smartphones we rely on, of the vehicles and public transit that get us places, of the buildings where we live and work, and of green technologies that help make the world a more sustainable place. Just as we as individuals depend on mining to support our daily lives, Canada relies on the industry to keep the economy humming. Mining is one of Canada's most important economic sectors and a major job creator. A major employer: Approximately 380,000 people across Canada work in the mining and mineral processing industries. Mining is the largest private sector employer of Aboriginal peoples in Canada on a proportional basis, and employment is poised to increase. Canada has one of the largest mining supply sectors globally with more than 3,400 companies supplying engineering, geotechnical, environmental, financial and other services to mining operations. Those who work in mining enjoy the highest wages and salaries of all industrial sectors in Canada with an average annual pay exceeding $110,000, which surpassed the average earnings of workers in forestry, manufacturing, finance and construction by a range of $31,000 to $46,000 for those sectors. An economic engine: Mining contributed $54 billion to Canada's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2013. The industry accounted for 19.6% of the value of Canadian goods exports in 2013. Canada's value of mineral production was nearly $43.6 billion in 2013. The mining industry's payments to Canadian federal and provincial governments total $71 billion in taxes and royalties over the last decade (2003-2012). A global leader: Thanks to its rich geology, Canada is one of the largest mining nations in the world producing more than 60 minerals and metals. Canada ranks in the top five countries in the global production of 11 major minerals and metals: First in potash Second in uranium and cobalt Third in aluminum and tungsten Fourth in platinum group metals, sulphur and titanium Fifth in nickel and diamonds 57% of the world's public mining companies are listed on the TSX and TSX-Venture Exchanges. Together, the two exchanges handled 48% of global mining equity transactions in 2013, and accounted for 46% of global mining equity capital for that year. Globally, Canada is recognized for its leadership in safety and sustainability. Mining companies in Canada were the first in the world to develop an externally-verified performance system for sustainable mining practices with the creation of MAC's Towards Sustainable Mining initiative in 2004. Leading Companies Agnico Eagle Mines Limited Agnico Eagle 's mission is to run a high quality, easy to understand business, that generates superior long-term per share returns for our shareholders, creates a great place to work for our employees, and that is a leading contributor to the well-being of the communities in which we operate. Agnico Eagle Reports Record Third Quarter 2015 Gold Production; Strong Operating Performance Leads to Increased Production Guidance and Reduced Costs for 2015 October 28, 2015 Stock Symbol: AEM (NYSE and TSX) (All amounts expressed in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted) TORONTO, Oct. 28, 2015 /PRNewswire/ - Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (NYSE:AEM, TSX:AEM) (\"Agnico Eagle \" or the \"Company\") today reported quarterly net income of $1.3 million, or net income of $0.01 per share for the third quarter of 2015. This result includes losses on financial instruments of $16.6 million ($0.08 per share), a non-cash foreign currency translation loss on deferred tax liabilities of $8.1 million ($0.04 per share), various mark-to-market and other adjustment losses of $9.5 million ($0.04 per share), non-cash stock option expense of $4.1 million ($0.02 per share), non-cash foreign currency translation losses of $0.9 million (nil per share), and non-recurring gains of $1.3 million ($0.01 per share). Excluding these items would result in adjusted net income of $39.2 million or adjusted net income of $0.18 per share for the third quarter of 2015. In the third quarter of 2014, the Company reported a net loss of $15.1 million or a net loss of $0.07 per share. Based on the exploration success in the first half of the year at several of the Company's projects, it was previously announced that exploration expense would increase in the second half of the year. Total exploration expense for the third quarter was $37.1 million. As a result of this increased exploration expense the Amaruq project in Nunavut yielded a significant increase in inferred resources (see August 19, 2015 news release) and an initial resource is expected to be reported by mid-February 2016 at the El Barqueno project in Mexico. For the first nine months of 2015, the Company reported net income of $40.1 million, or $0.19 per share. This compares with the first nine months of 2014 when net income was $104.3 million, or $0.55 per share. Financial results in the 2015 period were negatively impacted by much higher investment in exploration (approximately 102% higher); lower gold prices (approximately 9% lower) and lower by-product metals revenues. Third quarter 2015 cash provided by operating activities was $143.7 million ($217.8 million before changes in non-cash components of working capital). This compares to cash provided by operating activities of $71.2 million in the third quarter of 2014 ($129.2 million before changes in non-cash components of working capital). The increase in cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital during the current period was mainly due to an increase of 26% in gold production. For the first nine months of 2015, cash provided by operating activities was $475.5 million ($547.4 million before changes in non-cash components of working capital), as compared with the first nine months of 2014 when cash provided by operating activities was $504.4 million ($472.8 million before changes in non-cash components of working capital). The increase in cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital during the period was mainly due to a 20% increase in gold production. \"In the third quarter of 2015, we set a new record for quarterly gold production and lowered unit costs which resulted in strong operating cash flow. This has allowed us to continue to invest in our exploration and development pipeline, which represents the long-term future of our business,\" said Sean Boyd , Agnico Eagle's Chief Executive Officer. \"Our increased level of exploration activity continues to pay dividends as witnessed by the new discoveries at Kittila, Amaruq and El Barqueno. These projects are expected to be significant contributors to our production profile in the coming years,\" added Mr. Boyd. Third Quarter 2015 Highlights Include: Strong performance of Abitibi operations drives record quarterly gold production and low costs - Payable gold production1 in the third quarter of 2015 was 441,124 ounces of gold at total cash costs2 per ounce on a by-product basis of $536 and all-in sustaining costs3 on a by-product basis (\"AISC\") of $759 per ounce Two new production records set at Canadian Malartic - New quarterly records were set for average tonnes processed per calendar day (53,703 tonnes on a 100% basis), and ounces of gold produced in a quarter (153,206 ounces on a 100% basis) 2015 production guidance increased and cost forecasts reduced - Expected gold production for 2015 is now forecast to be approximately 1.65 million ounces (previously 1.6 million ounces) with total cash costs on a by-product basis of approximately $590 to $610 per ounce (previously $600 to $620) and AISC of approximately $840 to $860 per ounce (previously $870 to $890) expected Amaruq drilling expands scope of known mineralization - Drilling indicates that the Whale Tail and Mammoth zones form a single mineralized system at least 2.3 kilometres long. In addition, the V zone (part of the IVR area) has been identified as a substantial mineralized structure, locally with abundant visible gold Drilling extends new parallel zone at Kittila - Two recent drill holes have confirmed continuity within the new parallel lens (now called the \"Sisar lens\"). Highlights include: 8.1 grams per tonne (\"g/t\") gold (uncapped) over 8.0 metres at 1,235 metres depth; and 5.5 g/t gold (uncapped) over 3.3 metres at 950 metres depth and 560 metres farther north along strike Improved financial flexibility - In the third quarter, the Company's credit facility was amended and $25 million was repaid. In addition, a 10-year, $50-million term note was issued to Ressources Quebec, a subsidiary of Investissement Quebec . Capital expenditures in 2015 are also forecast to be approximately $50 million lower than previously reported due to positive foreign currency adjustments and deferrals into future periods A quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share was declared Third Quarter Financial and Production Highlights In the third quarter of 2015, strong operational performance continued at the Company's mines. Payable gold production in the third quarter of 2015 was a record 441,124 ounces compared to 349,273 ounces in the third quarter of 2014. The higher level of production in the 2015 period was primarily due to increased throughput levels at LaRonde, Goldex and Canadian Malartic, increased mill capacity at Kittila and higher grades at LaRonde, Meadowbank, Goldex, Kittila, Pinos Altos and La India. A detailed description of the production and cost performance at each mine is set out below. Total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis for the third quarter of 2015 were lower at $536 compared to $716 per ounce for the third quarter of 2014. The reduction in total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis in the third quarter of 2015 was a result of higher silver production, higher gold production at the majority of the Company's mines and weaker local currencies compared to the third quarter of 2014. In the third quarter of 2015 the average value of the Canadian dollar, Euro and Mexican Peso were 8%, 4%, and 23% lower, respectively than the Company's 2015 currency price assumptions (see February 11, 2015 news release). Payable gold production for the first nine months of 2015 was 1,249,012 ounces, compared to payable gold production of 1,041,753 ounces in the comparable 2014 period (which only included 76,639 ounces from Canadian Malartic for production from June 16 to September 30, 2014). For the first nine months of 2015, total cash costs on a by-product basis were $574 per ounce. This compares with $627 per ounce on a by-product basis in the first nine months of 2014. The lower costs in the 2015 period are due to the higher levels of production and favourable currency movements compared to the 2014 period. AISC for the third quarter of 2015 was lower at $759 versus $1,059 per ounce for the third quarter of 2014. The lower AISC is primarily due to higher production, lower total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis, lower general and administrative expenditures and lower capital expenditures. For the first nine months of 2015, AISC was $808 versus $947 per ounce for the 2014 period. The lower AISC in the 2015 period is due to the same reasons set out above. Cash Position Remains Strong; Continued focus on Debt Reduction; Credit lines extended for an additional year through 2020 Cash and cash equivalents and short term investments increased to $208.1 million at September 30, 2015, from the June 30, 2015 balance of $164.0 million. The outstanding balance on the Company's $1.2 billion credit facility was reduced from $375 million at June 30, 2015 to $350 million at September 30, 2015. This results in available credit lines of approximately $850 million, not including the $300 million accordion facility. On September 30, 2015, the Company amended its $1.2 billion Credit Facility to extend the maturity date from June 22, 2019 to June 22, 2020 and improve the pricing terms. On September 30 2015, a private placement of a $50 million, 10-year senior unsecured note (the \"Note\") with a maturity of September 30, 2025 was completed with Ressources Quebec, a subsidiary of Investissement Quebec . The Company has agreed to use the net proceeds from the issuance of the Note at its mining projects in the Province of Quebec. Total capital expenditures made by the Company in the third quarter of 2015 were $122.4 million, including $24.8 million at Meliadine, $19.7 million at Meadowbank, $15.1 million at LaRonde, $14.1 million at Kittila, $13.3 million at Goldex, $12.5 million at Pinos Altos, $9.3 million at Canadian Malartic (50% basis), $7.0 million at La India, $1.2 million at Creston Mascota and $1.1 million at Lapa. Total capital expenditures for the first nine months of 2015 were $316.8 million including $50.6 million at LaRonde, $47.4 million at Meadowbank, $44.6 million at Meliadine, $41.8 million at Pinos Altos, $38.4 million at Kittila, $35.3 million at Goldex, $29.8 million at Canadian Malartic (50% basis), $15.5 million at La India, $5.5 million at Lapa and $1.6 million at Creston Mascota. Total sustaining capital expenditures made by the Company in the third quarter were $72.0 million, including $19.5 million at Meadowbank, $15.1 million at LaRonde, $10.6 million at Kittila, $8.2 million at Canadian Malartic (50% basis), $7.0 million at La India, $6.7 million at Pinos Altos, $2.6 million at Goldex, $1.2 million at Creston Mascota and $1.1 million at Lapa. Total sustaining capital expenditures for the first nine months of 2015 were $214.7 million including $50.6 million at LaRonde, $47.2 million at Meadowbank, $30.7 million at Kittila, $28.0 million at Canadian Malartic (50% basis), $24.0 million at Pinos Altos, $15.5 million at La India, $11.6 million at Goldex, $5.5 million at Lapa, and $1.6 million at Creston Mascota. For 2015, capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $489.0 million, representing approximately a $50 million decrease from the previously announced figure. The decrease is primarily due to favourable currency movements and capital expenditure deferrals into future periods. The Company recorded an income and mining taxes recovery of $15.3 million on the consolidated statements of income for the third quarter of 2015. This was primarily a result of applying effective tax rates on a regional tax basis which were well in excess of the statutory tax rate based on IFRS tax calculation methodology. The Company continues to guide an effective tax rate range between 40% and 45% for 2015. Revised 2015 Guidance - Production Increased and Costs Lowered As a result of strong operational performance in the third quarter of 2015, production guidance for 2015 has been increased to approximately 1.65 million ounces of gold (previously 1.6 million ounces) with total cash costs on a by-product basis of approximately $590 to $610 per ounce (previously $600 to $620) and AISC of approximately $840 to $860 per ounce (previously $870 to $890). NORTHERN BUSINESS OPERATING REVIEW ABITIBI REGION, QUEBEC Agnico Eagle is currently Quebec's largest gold producer with a 100% interest in three mines (LaRonde, Goldex and Lapa) and a 50% interest in the Canadian Malartic mine. These mines are located within 50 kilometres of each other, which provides operating synergies and allows for the sharing of technical expertise. LaRonde Mine - Increased Production Driven by Higher Grades in Lower Mining Area, Phase 1 Commissioning of Coarse Ore Conveyor Underway The 100% owned LaRonde mine in northwestern Quebec achieved commercial production in 1988. The LaRonde mill processed an average of 5,992 tonnes per day (\"tpd\") in the third quarter of 2015, compared with an average of 4,634 tpd in the corresponding period of 2014. Throughput in the 2014 period was lower due to an approximate four week shutdown related to the upgrade and commissioning of the production and service hoist drives at the Penna shaft. Minesite costs per tonne4 were approximately C$101 in the third quarter of 2015, lower than the C$111 per tonne experienced in the third quarter of 2014. The higher costs in the 2014 period were primarily due to the scheduled shutdown noted above. For the first nine months of 2015, the LaRonde mill processed an average of 6,145 tpd, compared to 5,668 tpd in the first nine months of 2014. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$101, compared to C$100 per tonne in the first nine months of 2014. LaRonde's total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis were $558 in the third quarter of 2015 on payable production of 71,860 ounces of gold. This compares with the third quarter of 2014 when total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis were $861 on production of 37,490 ounces of gold. Production in the 2015 period increased as a result of higher throughput and higher gold grades (primarily from the 293 mining pyramid) compared to the 2014 period. Costs in the 2015 period were lower due to higher gold production (partially offset by lower by-product revenues) and favourable foreign exchange rates. In the first nine months of 2015, LaRonde produced 194,760 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $620 on a by-product basis. This is in contrast with the first nine months of 2014 when the mine produced 145,336 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $701 on a by-product basis. Production in the 2015 period was higher and costs were lower due to the factors mentioned above. During the quarter, work was completed on the installation of the coarse ore conveyor system that extends from the 293 level to the crusher on the 280 level. The first phase of commissioning involving the discharge point and rock breaker is underway. The ore pass feeding the rock breaker is expected to be commissioned in the first quarter of 2016. The new conveyor should help to improve mining flexibility and reduce congestion in the deeper portions of the mine. Studies are continuing to assess the potential to extend the mineral reserves and carry out mining activities between the 311 and 371 levels at LaRonde. At present, the mineral reserves extend to the 311 level, which is 3.1 kilometres below the surface. Drilling is ongoing to further expand the known mineral resource between the 311 and 341 levels. Additional holes are also being drilled to evaluate the extent of the mineralization down to the 371 level (a depth of 3.7 kilometres below the surface). Canadian Malartic Mine - New Quarterly Production Records Established In June 2014, Agnico Eagle and Yamana Gold Inc . (\"Yamana\") acquired all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Osisko Mining Corporation (\"Osisko\") and created the Canadian Malartic General Partnership (the \"Partnership\"). The partnership owns and operates the Canadian Malartic mine in northwestern Quebec through a joint management committee. Each of Agnico Eagle and Yamana has an indirect 50% ownership interest in the Partnership. Canadian Malartic had very strong operational performance in the third quarter of 2015. New records were set for quarterly tonnes milled (4.94 million tonnes), tonnes processed per day (53,703 tonnes), and ounces produced (153,206 ounces on a 100% basis). On September 22, 2015, the mine poured its two millionth ounce of gold. During the third quarter of 2015, the Canadian Malartic mill processed an average of 53,703 tpd (on a 100% basis) compared with an average of 52,539 tpd in the corresponding period of 2014. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$22 (C$19.32 excluding royalties) compared to the C$22 (C$19.60 excluding royalties) per tonne experienced in the third quarter of 2014. The costs in the 2015 period were in line with the costs in the 2014 period. Throughput was higher in the 2015 period due to improved crusher operating time. The average stripping ratio in the third quarter of 2015 was 2.04 to 1.0. For the first nine months of 2015, the Canadian Malartic mill processed an average of 52,139 tpd compared with an average of 50,580 tpd in the corresponding period of 2014 (on a 100% basis). Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$23 (C$19.72 excluding royalties) compared to the C$22 (C$19.42 excluding royalties) per tonne experienced in the corresponding period of 2014. The 2014 tonnage and costs are not considered to be representative as they only reflect the period of June 16 through September 30. For the third quarter of 2015, Agnico Eagle 's share of production at the Canadian Malartic mine was 76,603 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $544 on a by-product basis. This compares with the third quarter of 2014 when total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis were $735 on production of 64,761 ounces of gold. Production was higher in the 2015 period due to increased mill throughput and higher grades. Costs in the 2015 period were lower due to increased production and favourable foreign exchange rates. In the first nine months of 2015, Agnico Eagle 's share of production at the Canadian Malartic mine was 212,937 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $593 on a by-product basis. This is in contrast with production from June 16 to September 30, 2014 which only included 76,639 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $717 on a by-product basis from Canadian Malartic. The Partnership continues to work on initiatives to optimize the operations. Current opportunities include: Improving SAG mill and crusher liners to attempt to reduce the number of planned shutdowns to three per year (currently four per year). New liners were installed in Q3 2015 Improving gyratory crusher availability by redirecting ore containing scrap steel to a separate crusher Maintaining mining throughput levels at two million tonnes per month in the North zone (which contains higher grades) Acquiring an additional remote excavator for use in the North zone Adding two larger production drills which is expected reduce drilling costs Increasing rate of waste rock backfilling of the Gouldie pit which reduces haulage distances and noise Permitting activities for the Barnat Extension and deviation of Highway 117 are continuing. An Environmental Impact Assessment (\"EIA\") for this project was submitted in February 2015. An initial series of questions were received by the Partnership, and final responses were submitted in September 2015. A second round of questions from the government is expected to be received later in the fourth quarter of 2015. Public hearings are then expected to be held in the spring of 2016, with receipt of the necessary permits potentially by year-end 2016. In parallel, the Partnership is currently working on the permitting for improving the efficiency and environmental performance of the existing mobile crusher. At this point, milling levels are expected to be approximately 53,000 tpd through year-end 2016. In March 2015, the Partnership increased its interest in the Malartic CHL property to 100% by acquiring the remaining 30% interest from Abitibi Royalties Inc . The Malartic CHL property adjoins the Canadian Malartic mine to the east and hosts part of the Odyssey North discovery. At the end of the third quarter of 2015, 28 holes (24,537 metres) of drilling had been completed on the Odyssey zones. Drilling and data compilation will continue in the fourth quarter. Update on Pandora and Kirkland Lake Projects Canadian Malartic Corporation, a company in which each of Agnico Eagle and Yamana has an indirect 50% interest, is exploring a portfolio of properties in the Kirkland Lake area of Ontario and the Pandora property in the Abitibi region of Quebec. In the Kirkland Lake area, an internal technical study on the Upper Beaver property is being reviewed. Elsewhere in the region, compilation work is ongoing and a select number of targets are being drilled. At Pandora, underground development on the 101-W exploration drift from the adjacent Lapa mine commenced in February 2015 and approximately 691 metres of development was completed by the end of the third quarter of 2015. For the full year, approximately 940 metres of development is planned. In mid-June 2015, underground drilling resumed from the 101-W exploration drift and approximately half of the proposed 2015 program (approximately 7,000 metres) was completed by the end of the third quarter. The focus of the current exploration program is to test for extensions to the Branch zone and C zone on the Pandora property. Lapa - Zulapa Z7 Zone Continues to Deliver Higher Grades and Recoveries The 100% owned Lapa mine in northwestern Quebec achieved commercial production in May 2009. The Lapa circuit, located at the LaRonde mill, processed an average of 1,583 tpd in the third quarter of 2015. This compares with an average of 1,703 tpd in the third quarter of 2014. Throughput in the 2015 period was lower because of downtime related to repairs carried out on the Lapa ball mill. Repairs were completed in August 2015. During the repair time, excess ore was stockpiled and there is sufficient mill capacity that should allow the Company to meet its annual throughput rate (tonnes and ounces) over the balance of 2015. Minesite costs per tonne were C$114 in the third quarter of 2015, compared to the C$104 in the third quarter of 2014. Costs in the 2015 period were higher due to mining at deeper depths and lower throughput compared to the same period in 2014. For the first nine months of 2015, the Lapa mill processed an average of 1,553 tpd, compared to 1,747 tpd in the first nine months of 2014. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$119, above the C$106 per tonne in the first nine months of 2014 due to the reasons explained above. Payable production in the third quarter of 2015 was 25,668 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $522. This compares with the third quarter of 2014, when production was 24,781 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $606. In the 2015 period, production was higher primarily due to better recoveries (up 8.7%) related to a higher component of free gold in the Zulapa Z7 ore zone. Costs were lower primarily due to increased production and favourable foreign exchange rates. In the first nine months of 2015, Lapa produced 71,038 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $581 on a by-product basis. This compares to the first nine months of 2014 when the mine produced 67,011 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $689 on a by-product basis. The higher production and lower costs in the 2015 period are due to the reasons outlined above. At Lapa, 2015 is the last full year of production based on the current life of mine plan. Commercial production is forecast to end at the mine in the third quarter of 2016, but exploration activities (primarily on the Pandora property) are expected to continue. The permanent employees are expected to be relocated to the Company's other operations where they will replace contract positions. Studies are underway to evaluate other internal opportunities to utilize the Lapa mill, which is located at the LaRonde Metallurgical complex. Goldex - Development Rates Expected to Double by Year End; M Zone Yields Better Than Expected Grades The 100% owned Goldex mine in northwestern Quebec began operation in 2008 but mining operations in the original orebody, the Goldex Extension Zone (\"GEZ\"), were suspended in October 2011. In July 2012, the M and E satellite zones were approved for development. Mining operations resumed on the M and E satellite zones in September 2013. Mining operations at GEZ remain suspended. The Goldex mill processed an average of 6,199 tpd in the third quarter of 2015. This compares with an average of 5,851 tpd in the third quarter of 2014. The higher throughput in the 2015 period was due to more mature mining fronts and productivity improvements compared to the 2014 period. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$34 in the third quarter of 2015, which was slightly higher than the C$32 per tonne experienced in the third quarter of 2014. The increased cost in the 2015 period is primarily due to increased development in the M3 and M4 zones and extensions to the E Zone. For the first nine months of 2015, the Goldex mill processed an average of 6,377 tpd, compared to 5,647 tpd in the first nine months of 2014. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$34 in the first nine months of 2015 which is in line with C$33 in first nine months of 2014. Payable gold production in the third quarter of 2015 was 32,068 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $479. This compares with the third quarter of 2014, when production was 27,611 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $582. The higher production in the 2015 period was largely due to increased tonnage and better grades (especially in the M Zone) and higher recoveries. The decrease in total cash costs in the 2015 period was largely a result of increased production and favourable foreign exchange rates compared to the 2014 period. In the first nine months of 2015, Goldex produced 87,780 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $546 on a by-product basis. This compares to the first nine months of 2014 when the mine produced 70,970 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $661 on a by-product basis. The higher production and lower costs in the 2015 period are due to the same reasons as outlined above. In late July 2015, the Company announced production approval for the Goldex Deep 1 project (see July 29, 2015 news release). Mining will focus on the lower part of the Dx zone and the top of the D zone from a depth of 850 metres to 1,200 metres (level 120). The Company plans to undertake development from the current Goldex infrastructure, with existing equipment and personnel. The planned mining method is long-hole stoping with cemented paste backfill, which is the same method currently used at Goldex M & E zones. Gold production from the Goldex Deep 1 project is currently expected to average in excess of 100,000 ounces per year from 2018 through 2024. In the third quarter of 2015, approximately 1,462 metres of development were carried out in the Deep zone. The ramp has now reached Level 115 on its way to an ultimate depth of level 120. In addition, full restoration of the surface ramp is expected to be completed by the end of this year. This ramp will improve on the ability to move equipment and supplies from the surface into the underground workings. The advancement of the Deep 1 project at Goldex also has the potential to unlock other significant value creating opportunities including: Potential for additional mineral resource conversion in the Deep 1 zone Potential for mining at the Deep 2 (below level 120) Potential to develop the South zone (a narrow high-grade zone accessible via Deep 1 infrastructure) Potential development of the Akasaba West deposit, which is approximately 30 kilometres to the East of Goldex An EIA on the Akasaba West deposit was submitted during the quarter, which allows the environmental review process to commence. The Company anticipates the EIA approval in late 2017 or early 2018. FINLAND AND SWEDEN Agnico Eagle 's Kittila mine in Finland is the largest primary gold producer in Europe and hosts the Company's largest mineral reserves. Exploration activities continue to expand the mineral resources and studies are underway to evaluate the potential to cost-effectively increase production. Kittila - Focus Remains On Optimizing Future Production Levels and Exploration Potential of the New Parallel Zone The 100% owned Kittila mine in northern Finland achieved commercial production in 2009. The Kittila mill processed an average of 3,937 tpd in the third quarter of 2015 compared to the 2,559 tpd in the third quarter of 2014. Throughput in the 2014 period was lower due to a planned shutdown to complete the mill expansion. Minesite costs per tonne at Kittila were approximately EUR72 in the third quarter of 2015, compared to EUR86 in the third quarter of 2014. Costs decreased in the third quarter of 2015 due to the increased throughput when compared with the 2014 period. For the first nine months of 2015, the Kittila mill processed an average of 3,981 tpd, compared to 2,895 tpd in the first nine months of 2014. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately EUR75 in the first nine months of 2015, compared to the EUR79 per tonne in the comparable 2014 period. Throughput was higher and costs were lower in the 2015 period due to the reasons outlined above. Since the expansion, the mill has shown potential to operate in excess of 4,000 tpd and efforts are ongoing to optimize throughput and recovery rates. In addition, the Company is also working to optimize underground mining rates and evaluate the potential to develop new mining areas. Unit costs are expected to decrease once steady state operations are achieved. Third quarter 2015 payable gold production at Kittila was 46,455 ounces with total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $639. In the third quarter of 2014, the mine produced 28,230 ounces at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $951. The higher production in the 2015 period is a result of the increased mill capacity compared to the 2014 period and the planned 2014 shutdown. Costs decreased in the third quarter of 2015 primarily due to increased production and a favourable foreign exchange rate. In the first nine months of 2015, Kittila produced 133,095 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $696 on a by-product basis. This is in contrast to the first nine months of 2014, when the mine produced 98,612 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $861 on a by-product basis. The lower cash costs in 2015 are mainly due to reasons described above. Drilling Extends New Parallel Zone at Kittila Previous drilling from the surface at Kittila has outlined a significant zone of deep mineralization at Rimpi with potentially wider widths and better grades than those currently being mined. The main underground ramp at Kittila is being extended to reach the Rimpi zone and a new surface ramp is also being developed to access the shallower portions of the Rimpi deposit. The surface ramp had advanced a total of 825 metres to 134 metres depth by the end of September. In April and July, the Company announced that drilling had encountered a mineralized lens east of the main Kittila ore zone, within the sheared and altered structure that hosts the known Kittila deposits (see April 30, 2015 and July 29, 2015 news releases). The intercepts lay within an area approximately 800 metres long north to south between 975 and 1,300 metres below surface, approximately 100 to 150 metres east of the main ore zone. These intercepts indicate a new parallel lens (now called the \"Sisar lens\" which in English means \"sister lens\"), that could extend upwards to a similar elevation as the main exploration ramp (currently at 800 metres depth) being driven towards Rimpi. This new lens could provide additional tonnage should further drilling outline an economic deposit. Two recent holes drilled from the exploration ramp have confirmed continuity within the Sisar lens. The table below shows the intercepts of the two new holes as well as those reported previously from the Sisar lens. Pierce points for all these holes are shown on the Kittila composite longitudinal section and two cross sections (500 metres apart). All intercepts reported for the Kittila mine show uncapped grades over estimated true widths, based on a current geological interpretation that is being updated as new information becomes available with further drilling.  midpoint below surface (metres) Estimated true width (metres) Gold grade (g/t) (uncapped)  Kittila composite longitudinal section Kittila composite cross sections - 7538000mN and 7538500mN Hole ROD15-703 intersected two lenses in the main zone and one in the Sisar lens. In the main ore zone, this hole intersected 14.3 g/t gold over 6.1 metres at 1,028 metres depth, and 5.8 g/t gold over 3.5 metres at 1,077 metres depth. The upper intercept verifies, widens and increases the grade of the probable reserves between the Suuri and Roura trends, while the lower one extends the mineralization to the north, and will help to convert future resources. The hole then intersected 8.1 g/t gold over 8.0 metres at 1,235 metres depth in the Sisar lens, approximately 150 metres east of the main ore zone, strongly confirming the continuity of the lens. This intercept is between two previously reported intercepts at approximately the same depth: it is approximately 116 metres north of hole ROU10-037 and 250 metres south of hole ROD14-003. At shallower depths and approximately 560 metres farther north, hole ROU15-600 intersected 5.5 g/t gold over 3.3 metres at 950 metres below surface, approximately 100 metres east of the main zone mineralization. This intercept is approximately 130 metres south of the previously reported intercept of hole ROU15-603. Additional holes have been drilled in the vicinity of the new Sisar lens intercepts, and assays are pending. A second underground deep drill rig is expected to start operating in the fourth quarter 2015 and carry on into 2016 to determine continuity and test for extensions of the Sisar lens. At the Kuotko deposit, located approximately 15 kilometres north of Kittila, drilling continues with a focus on infilling and expanding the existing inferred resource of approximately 170,000 ounces (1.8 million tonnes at 2.9 g/t gold). In addition, new mineralized zones have been identified outside of the known resource areas. Metallurgical testing is ongoing and unlike Kittila, the gold mineralization is free milling. Upon completion of the drilling, studies will be carried out to assess the viability of mining the deposit as a satellite open pit. Barsele Project - Drilling Now Underway on the Central Zone On June 11, 2015, Agnico Eagle acquired a 55% interest in the Barsele project in Sweden. The Company can earn an additional 15% interest in the project through the completion of a pre-feasibility study. The Barsele property is known to contain intrusive-hosted gold mineralization and gold-rich volcanogenic massive sulphide mineralization. In 2015, the Company plans to spend approximately $3.25 million on exploration to further evaluate the mineral potential of the property. In September 2015, trenching and mapping programs were carried out that confirmed that the known intrusive-hosted deposits plunge to the southeast. A 16-hole (9,300-metre) drill program commenced in early October to test the depth extension of the Central Zone to 400 to 500 metres below surface. NUNAVUT REGION With the Company's largest producing mine (Meadowbank) and two significant development assets and exploration projects (Meliadine and Amaruq) located in Nunavut, Agnico Eagle has the potential to build an operating platform that could have the ability to generate strong production and cash flows over several decades. Meadowbank - Increased Waste Stripping Capacity Provides Production Flexibility The 100% owned Meadowbank mine in Nunavut, northern Canada, achieved commercial production in March 2010. The Meadowbank mill processed an average of 10,824 tpd in the third quarter of 2015, compared to the 11,492 tpd achieved in the third quarter of 2014. Mill throughput levels were lower in the 2015 period due to a higher percentage of Vault ore processed which has a higher hardness factor, which has an impact on both the primary and secondary grinding circuit efficiency. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$72 in the third quarter of 2015, which compares to C$74 per tonne in the third quarter of 2014. The lower costs in the 2015 period were primarily due to an increase in capitalized versus expensed waste stripping compared to the respective 2014 period. For the first nine months of 2015, the Meadowbank mill processed an average of 11,009 tpd, compared to 11,365 tpd in the first nine months of 2014. Mill throughput levels were lower in the 2015 period primarily due to the reasons outlined above. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$72 in the first nine months of 2015, which was similar to the C$73 per tonne in the comparable 2014 period. Payable production in the third quarter of 2015 was 99,425 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $598. This compares with the third quarter of 2014 when 91,557 ounces were produced at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $777. The higher production in the 2015 period compared to the 2014 period was primarily due to the processing of higher grade ore (an increase of approximately 15%) and slightly better recoveries. Costs in the 2015 period were lower due to increased production and favourable foreign exchange rates. In the first nine months of 2015, Meadowbank produced 279,224 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $646 on a by-product basis. In the first nine months of 2014, the mine produced 366,162 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $561 on a by-product basis. The lower production (down 24%) in the 2015 period compared to the previous period was primarily due to processing fewer tonnes at lower grades and lower mill recoveries (down 2.3%). During the first six months of the 2014 period, the Company encountered ore grades that were higher than expected in both the Portage and Goose pits. In 2013, approximately 246,000 ounces were removed from mineral reserves at the Vault deposit due to a change in the gold price assumption used to calculate mineral reserves at December 31, 2013. Given the current US dollar to Canadian dollar foreign exchange rate (which yields favourable revenues and costs in Canadian dollar terms), lower fuel costs, and the growing significance of the Amaruq Project, the Company made a decision in July 2015 to proceed with the expansion of the Vault pit. With the expansion, the Meadowbank mine is now expected to be in production until the third quarter of 2018 (approximately one year longer than originally forecast). The extension of the Meadowbank mine life is expected to help bridge the production gap between the end of production at Meadowbank and the potential start of production at a satellite operation at Amaruq (not yet approved for construction). Amaruq Project - Drilling Expands Scope of Whale Tail Deposit; Positive Results from the V Zone Area; Phase Two Exploration Program Now Completed Agnico Eagle has a 100% interest in the Amaruq project. The large property consists of 114,761 hectares, approximately 50 kilometres northwest of the Meadowbank mine. In August 2015, the Company announced an updated inferred mineral resource estimate as of June 30, 2015 of 2.0 million ounces gold (9.7 million tonnes grading 6.47 g/t gold). The phase two drilling program for 2015 was completed in mid-October. Total drilling at Amaruq for the year was 108,000 metres (378 holes) completed. This release incorporates some of the drill results received since the last results were released on August 19, 2015. The latest drill results are from the main Whale Tail deposit including the east-plunging high-grade shoot and the former gap area between Whale Tail West and Mammoth Lake. As well, there are recent exploration drill results from the V zone. The 2016 drill program is expected to start in February. Phase Two Drill Results Continue to Expand Mineralized Zones The phase two 2015 drilling program at the Amaruq project began in July with several purposes, including step-out drilling to link Whale Tail and Mammoth Lake mineralization; testing the down-plunge extent of the ore shoot in the east of Whale Tail; and extending the I, V and R zones. Recent intercepts from the project are set out in the table below and the drill hole collars are located on the Amaruq project local geology map. The Whale Tail deposit pierce points are shown on the Whale Tail composite longitudinal section, while the coordinates from the V zone drill-hole collars are given in a second table. All intercepts reported for the Amaruq project show capped grades over estimated true widths, based on a preliminary geological interpretation that is being updated as new information becomes available with further drilling. Amaruq local geology map Whale Tail Deposit Composite Longitudinal Section Recent drilling has confirmed that the Whale Tail and Mammoth zones form a single mineralized system at least 2.3 kilometres long, between surface and locally to a depth of 450 metres. A new intercept lies in between several previously reported intercepts filling the former gap between Whale Tail and the Mammoth Lake mineralization. Hole AMQ15-450 yielded 4.5 g/t gold over 16.9 metres at 166 metres depth including 7.6 g/t gold over 6.7 metres. This area will continue to be investigated in 2016. The mineralized system remains open at depth and along strike. Drilling from the opposite direction (north to south) has enhanced the understanding of the geometry of the deposit. Within the Whale Tail deposit is a thickened higher-grade ore shoot that is at least one kilometre long. This cigar-shaped shoot extends from surface (Whale Tail West) plunging shallowly eastward to a depth of 380 metres (Whale Tail East). The ore shoot remains open. Six recent intercepts within this shoot, from west to east, are hole AMQ15-369 that intersected 8.4 g/t gold over 18.4 metres at 176 metres depth, hole AMQ15-463 that yielded 6.8 g/t gold over 29.7 metres at 293 metres depth, hole AMQ15-422 that intersected 5.7 g/t gold over 29.9 metres at 270 metres depth, hole AMQ15-442 that intersected 8.1 g/t gold over 12.9 metres at 296 metres depth, hole AMQ15-470 that intersected 6.9 g/t gold over 16.1 metres at 357 metres depth and hole AMQ15-444, which yielded two intercepts 6.3 g/t gold over 14.8 metres at 359 metres depth, and 5.8 g/t gold over 10.3 metres at 378 metres depth. (Note that holes AMQ15-369 and AMQ15-444 were drilled from the south.) The results described for the Whale Tail deposit are expected to have a positive impact on the size of the upcoming resources estimate for the Amaruq project. Recent drilling and mapping has shown that the V zone is a significant mineralized structure dipping shallowly to the southeast, with locally abundant visible gold. The structure has been identified from outcrop on surface to a depth of 155 metres in recent drilling; it remains open at depth and laterally. Hole AMQ15-390 intersected the structure yielding 30.1 g/t gold over 5.2 metres at 40 metres depth. Approximately 100 metres to the south of this intercept, hole AMQ15-461 yielded 7.9 g/t gold over 23.4 metres at 115 metres depth. Approximately 150 metres southwest of hole AMQ15-390 was a third high-grade intersection in the V zone: hole AMQ15-491 intersected 21.1 g/t gold over 3.6 metres at 155 metres depth. Other results from the V zone are included in the intercepts table above. These results will lead to a reinterpretation of the I, V, and R zones, which could have a positive impact on the year-end resource estimate. Although additional drilling will be required, the Company believes that the V zone could potentially be a second source of open pit ore at Amaruq. Engineering and environmental baseline studies are underway to support the permitting process for the Amaruq project as a satellite open pit operation to the Meadowbank mine. The most recent drilling at depth in Whale Tail also indicates that this deposit hosts high-grade intercepts below the preliminary ultimate pit shell, suggesting that Whale Tail has underground potential. An application to construct an all-weather access road between Meadowbank and the Amaruq site was filed in the first quarter of 2015 and is currently working its way through the Nunavut permitting process. Meliadine Project - License B Granted; Regional Land Holdings Expanded The Meliadine gold project was acquired in July 2010 and is the Company's largest development project based on mineral reserves and mineral resources. The Company has a 100% interest in the 111,757-hectare property, which is linked to the town of Rankin Inlet in Nunavut by a 25-kilometre all-weather access road. In March 2015, the Company completed and filed with Canadian securities regulators an updated National Instrument 43-101 (\"NI 43-101\") technical report on the Meliadine gold project. The updated technical study was based on extracting only the 3.3 million ounces of gold in proven and probable mineral reserves (13.9 million tonnes of ore at 7.44 g/t gold), which is all contained in the Tiriganiaq and Wesmeg deposits. The Meliadine property also hosts 3.3 million ounces of measured and indicated mineral resources (20.2 million tonnes at 5.06 g/t gold), and 3.5 million ounces of inferred mineral resources (14.1 million tonnes at 7.65 g/t gold). In addition, there are numerous other known gold occurrences in the 80-kilometre-long greenstone belt that require further evaluation. Internal studies are ongoing to evaluate the potential to extract additional ounces from the Tiriganiaq and Wesmeg/Normeg deposits, which could potentially extend the mine life, improve the project economics, and increase the after-tax internal rate of return. These studies are expected to be completed in the first half of 2016. At the end of the third quarter of 2015, approximately 1,960 metres of underground development had been completed, and additional underground equipment has been transported to site to complete the 2015 plan that calls for total underground development of approximately 2,500 metres. This development will allow for more cost-effective exploration and conversion drilling of the deeper parts of the Tiriganiaq and Wesmeg/Normeg deposits and help to optimize potential mining plans. On July 13, 2015, the Kivalliq Inuit Association and Agnico Eagle signed the Inuit Impact Benefit Agreement (\"IIBA\") for the Meliadine gold project. The IIBA addresses protection of Inuit values, culture and language, protection of the land, water and wildlife, provides financial compensation to Inuit over the mine life, and contains provision for training, Inuit employment and contracting. On October 5, 2015, the Nunavut Water Board issued the permit (License B) for Meliadine pre-development work. License A, which is required for production activities, is expected to be granted in the second quarter of 2016. The timing of future capital expenditures on the Meliadine project beyond 2015 and the determination of whether to build a mine at Meliadine are subject to approval by Agnico Eagle 's Board of Directors, which will be based on prevailing market conditions and outcomes of the various potential scenarios being evaluated. Acquisition of New Properties in Nunavut Agnico Eagle is currently studying options and alternatives in Nunavut to capitalize on the large and growing mineral resource in the region. As part of this initiative, the Company has recently staked claims totaling 68,012 hectares on properties to the west-northwest of the project, on the continuation of the greenstone belt that hosts the Meliadine deposits. This summer, an airborne VTEM magnetic and electromagnetic survey was flown over the new properties. A field crew initiated prospecting and sampling of areas with geophysical signatures typical of iron formation-hosted Archean/Proto-Proterozoic deposits, similar to those recognized at Meadowbank, Amaruq and Meliadine projects. Close to 800 rock samples have been collected from the properties. Initial results have identified a 2-kilometre-long structure from which 21 rock samples returned values above 1.0 g/t gold including seven values in excess of 10.0 g/t gold, with a maximum value of 42.0 g/t gold. The new properties appear to be geologically similar to the Meadowbank, Meliadine and Amaruq projects where our exploration team has demonstrated the effectiveness of a systematic exploration approach and the strong mineral potential of this part of Nunavut. Assembling and analyzing the data collected this summer will assist in preparing a drill program for 2016 to further investigate the higher potential areas on the new properties. SOUTHERN BUSINESS OPERATING REVIEW Agnico Eagle 's southern business operations are focused in Mexico. These operations have been the source of growing precious metals production (gold and silver), stable operating costs and strong free cash flow since 2009. Pinos Altos - Strong Performance Driven by Higher Mill Throughput and Grades The 100% owned Pinos Altos mine in northern Mexico achieved commercial production in November 2009. The Pinos Altos mill processed 5,403 tpd in the third quarter of 2015, compared to 5,040 tpd processed in the third quarter of 2014. During the third quarter of 2015, approximately 49,300 tonnes of ore were stacked on the leach pad at Pinos Altos, compared to 143,500 tonnes in the comparable 2014 period. Minesite costs per tonne at Pinos Altos were $48 in the third quarter of 2015, which is in line with $48 in the third quarter of 2014. Although minesite costs per tonne are unchanged on a year-over-year basis, these costs are subject to variations in the proportion of heap leach ore to milled ore and open pit ore to underground ore, currency exchange rates and routine movements in the waste to ore stripping ratio in the open pit mines. For the first nine months of 2015, the Pinos Altos mill processed an average of 5,638 tpd, compared to 5,311 tpd processed in the first nine months of 2014. Approximately 238,500 tonnes of ore were stacked on the Pinos Altos leach pad during the first nine months of 2015, compared to 436,800 tonnes in the prior year period. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately $46 compared to $48 per tonne in the first nine months of 2014 with variance due to the proportion of heap leach to mill ore and the proportion of underground ore to open pit, variations in the proportion of waste to ore mined and variations in the currency exchange rate. Payable production in the third quarter of 2015 was 47,725 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $392. This compares with production of 41,155 ounces at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $545 in the third quarter of 2014. Higher production in 2015 is largely due to higher mill throughput and higher grades processed over the comparable prior year period. The decrease in the year over year total cash costs per ounce is largely due to increased gold production and higher silver production (offset in part, by a decline in realized silver prices) and favourable foreign exchange rates compared to the prior year period. In the first nine months of 2015, Pinos Altos produced 148,478 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $378 on a by-product basis. This is in contrast to the first nine months of 2014 when the mine produced 130,350 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $513 on a by-product basis. The lower cash costs in the first nine months of 2015 are primarily due to favourable foreign exchange rates and higher gold and silver production compared to the prior year period. The Pinos Altos shaft-sinking project remains on schedule for completion in 2016. The shaft is currently at a depth of approximately 573 metres, and activities during the third quarter of 2015 focused on the development of loading stations on levels 27 and 28. When the shaft is completed (final depth of approximately 603 metres), it will allow better matching of the mill capacity with the future mining capacity at Pinos Altos once the open pit mining operation begins to wind down, as planned over the next several years. The Company continues to evaluate a number of regional satellite opportunities. A 6,000-metre in-fill and conversion drill program on the Sinter deposit is 95% complete with assays still pending from about 50% of the holes. Results received to date indicate that there is good potential to add this deposit to the Pinos Altos mine plan beginning in 2020. Creston Mascota Deposit at Pinos Altos - Initial In-pit Drilling Results Indicate Potential to Extend Mine Life The Creston Mascota deposit at Pinos Altos has been operating as a satellite operation to the Pinos Altos mine since late 2010. Approximately 434,300 tonnes of ore were stacked on the Creston Mascota leach pad during the third quarter of 2015, compared to approximately 469,200 tonnes stacked in the third quarter of 2014. In the 2015 period, fewer tonnes were stacked mainly due to the adverse impact of the rainy season on roads, loading and dumping zones, and the crushing circuit. Minesite costs per tonne at Creston Mascota were $14 in the third quarter of 2015, compared to $17 in the third quarter of 2014. Costs in the 2015 period were lower due to currency fluctuations, lower fuel consumption and reduced power requirements compared to the 2014 period. For the first nine months of 2015, approximately 1,569,800 tonnes of ore were stacked on the Creston Mascota leach pad, compared to 1,242,900 tonnes in the prior year period. In the 2015 period, additional ore was encountered outside the block model, which resulted in more tonnes being stacked in the first half of the year compared to the 2014 period. For the first nine months of 2015, mine site costs per tonne at Creston Mascota were $12, compared to $17 per tonne in the first nine months of 2014. Costs were lower in the 2015 period due to more tonnes stacked and the other reasons outlined above. Payable gold production at Creston Mascota in the third quarter of 2015 was 12,716 ounces at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $436. This compares to 13,377 ounces at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $556 during the third quarter of 2014. Production was lower in the 2015 period due to fewer tonnes stacked, compared to the 2014 period. Cash costs were lower in the 2015 period based on lower minesite costs per tonne (see above), increased silver production (partially offset by a lower realized silver price) and a favourable foreign exchange rate compared to the 2014 period. Payable gold production for the first nine months of 2015 was 40,770 ounces at total cash costs per ounce of $425 on a by-product basis. This compares to 34,853 ounces at total cash costs per ounce of $587 on a by-product basis in the first nine months of 2014. The higher production in the 2015 period was due to more tonnes being stacked (especially in the first half of 2015) compared to the 2014 period. The lower costs in the 2015 period are due to higher gold production, increased silver production (partially offset by a lower realized silver price) and a favourable foreign exchange rate compared to the 2014 period. In the third quarter of 2015, preparation and top soil recovery at the Phase IV heap leach pad were completed. The earthworks have been initiated, with commissioning expected by year-end 2015. Over its mine life, Creston Mascota has added approximately 50% (179,000 ounces of contained gold) to its mineral reserves through infill drilling and improved geological understanding. In April 2015, higher grade mineralization was encountered at the bottom of the pit and outside the Creston Mascota block model. An infill drill program was completed in the third quarter of 2015 with encouraging results, and the interpretation of drill hole assays is ongoing. In September 2015, a 3,500-metre infill and conversion drill program commenced on the Bravo satellite zone. This program is expected to be completed by year-end 2015. The results of recent infill drilling in the pit and the potential of nearby satellite deposits such as Bravo could extend the projected life of the Creston Mascota operations beyond 2018. La India - New Record Set for Quarterly Gold Production The La India mine property in Sonora, Mexico, located approximately 70 kilometres from the Company's Pinos Altos mine, was acquired in November 2011 through the purchase of Grayd Resources, which held a 56,000-hectare land position in the Mulatos Gold belt. Commissioning of the mine commenced ahead of schedule in the third quarter of 2013 and commercial production was declared as of February 1, 2014. Approximately 1,193,900 tonnes of ore were stacked on the La India leach pad during the third quarter of 2015, compared to approximately 1,190,100 tonnes stacked in the third quarter of 2014. Minesite costs per tonne at La India were $11 in the third quarter of 2015, compared to the $10 in the third quarter of 2014. The increase in minesite costs reflect slightly higher maintenance costs and cyanide consumption (due to the rainy season) partially offset by lower costs for fuel and labour, and favourable foreign exchange rates. In the first nine months of 2015, approximately 3,931,900 tonnes of ore were stacked on the La India leach pad, compared to approximately 3,346,500 stacked in the first nine months of 2014. Minesite costs per tonne at La India were $9 in the first nine months of 2015, compared to the $8 in the first nine months of 2014. Tonnage stacked in the 2014 period was lower given that the operation was still ramping up to full capacity. The slightly higher costs in the 2015 period are primarily due to the reasons outlined above. Payable gold production at La India in the third quarter of 2015 was 28,604 ounces at total cash costs per ounce of $436 on a by-product basis were. Production in the third quarter of 2014 was 20,311 ounces at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $547. Production in the 2015 period was positively impacted by rain flushing residual ounces from the heaps and significantly higher ore grades placed on the heaps than planned. Total cash costs in the 2015 period were favourably impacted by higher production volumes and favourable foreign exchange rates. For the first nine months of 2015, La India produced 80,930 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $422 on a by-product basis. This compares to 51,820 ounces at total cash costs per ounce of $483 on a by-product basis in the first nine months of 2014. The higher production and lower costs in the 2015 period are primarily due to the reasons outlined above. During the third quarter of 2015, construction activities on the heap leach expansion were negatively affected by the extraordinary rains during the period. However, any delays related to the rains are not expected to affect future production plans or capital costs. Approximately 77% of the earthworks have been finished with full completion expected later in the fourth quarter of 2015. This leach pad expansion will provide the capacity for the current planned life-of-mine production at La India and approximately 5.0 million tonnes of additional stacking. Construction of the Main Zone haul road was completed during the third quarter of 2015. In the third quarter of 2015, several activities were undertaken to improve the La India block model and potentially expand the mineral reserves and mineral resource. Infill drilling and favourable reconciliation data from the first full year of mining have led to an improved geological model for the Main Zone oxides. In addition, ongoing metallurgical investigations and field-proven production experience with the North Zone sulphides have shown that some of the transition and sulphide material in the Main Zone and La India Zone may also be amenable to heap leaching. Inclusion of sulphide material into the pit designs at the La India mine has the potential to add further oxides as well as sulphides into the year-end 2015 mineral reserve and mineral resource estimate expected to be reported in mid-February 2016. Any additions could potentially extend the mine life beyond 2020. El Barqueno - Drilling Continues with a Focus on Resource Delineation and Defining New Target Areas Agnico Eagle has a 100% interest in the El Barqueno project. The 32,840-hectare property is in the Guachinango gold-silver mining district, Jalisco State, Mexico, approximately 150 kilometres west of the state capital of Guadalajara. It consists of three blocks of land: the original El Barqueno package (El Barqueno I, II and III) acquired from Cayden Resources in November 2014, and two adjacent blocks acquired from Soltoro Limited in June 2015 (El Rayo and El Tecolote). The Company last reported exploration results from this project in a news release dated September 21, 2015. The El Barqueno project contains a number of known mineralized zones and several prospects that require further evaluation. There are currently 10 drill rigs working to define the limits of the Azteca-Zapoteca, Angostura and Pena de Oro prospects, and delineate an initial mineral resource estimate for these deposits. Several other prospects are also under evaluation. An additional drill rig is testing the Zapote-Mixteca prospect, which has been shown to be gold-bearing by recent rock sample and trench results. To the end of the third quarter, 171 holes (42,940 metres) had been drilled. Drilling will continue at El Barqueno until the end of the year. The Company expects that this drilling will lead to the estimation of an initial inferred mineral resource at the Azteca-Zapoteca, Angostura and Pena de Oro areas to open-pit mineable depths. The resources are expected to be reported in mid-February 2016. Conceptual design studies and additional metallurgical testing are underway at El Barqueno. The project may host gold-silver deposits that could potentially be developed into a series of open pits utilizing heap leach processing, similar to Creston Mascota and the La India mine. While it is too early to estimate the extent of the mineral resources and the number of deposits with economic potential at El Barqueno, the Company already has the experience of developing cost-efficient mining operations in Mexico, and increasing their size through successful exploration as well as metallurgical innovation. This body of knowledge will be applied as El Barqueno continues to be explored and studied. Exploration expenditures at El Barqueno in 2015 are currently expected to total approximately $22 million. Quarterly Dividend Declared Agnico Eagle 's Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.08 per common share, payable on December 15, 2015 to shareholders of record as of December 1, 2015. Agnico Eagle has declared a cash dividend every year since 1983. Dividend Reinvestment Plan Please follow the link below for information on the Company's dividend reinvestment program. Dividend Reinvestment Plan About Agnico Eagle Agnico Eagle is a senior Canadian gold mining company that has produced precious metals since 1957. Its eight mines are located in Canada, Finland and Mexico, with exploration and development activities in each of these countries as well as in the United States and Sweden. The Company and its shareholders have full exposure to gold prices due to its long-standing policy of no forward gold sales. Agnico Eagle has declared a cash dividend every year since 1983. Note Regarding Certain Measures of Performance This news release discloses certain measures, including ''total cash costs per ounce'' and ''minesite costs per tonne'', \"all-in sustaining costs per ounce\" and \"adjusted net income\" that are not recognized measures under IFRS. These data may not be comparable to data presented by other gold producers. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable financial information presented in the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS and for an explanation of how management uses these measures, other than adjusted net income, see \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Performance Measures\" below. The total cash costs per ounce of gold produced is presented on both a by-product basis (deducting by-product metal revenues from production costs) and co-product basis (before by-product metal revenues). The total cash costs per ounce of gold produced on a by-product basis is calculated by adjusting production costs as recorded in the consolidated statements of income (loss) for by-product revenues, unsold concentrate inventory production costs, smelting, refining and marketing charges and other adjustments, and then dividing by the number of ounces of gold produced. The total cash costs per ounce of gold produced on a co-product basis is calculated in the same manner as the total cash costs per ounce of gold produced on a by-product basis except that no adjustment is made for by-product metal revenues. Accordingly, the calculation of total cash costs per ounce of gold produced on a co-product basis does not reflect a reduction in production costs or smelting, refining and marketing charges associated with the production and sale of by-product metals. The total cash costs per ounce of gold produced is intended to provide information about the cash-generating capabilities of the Company's mining operations. Management also uses these measures to monitor the performance of the Company's mining operations. As market prices for gold are quoted on a per ounce basis, using the total cash costs per ounce of gold produced on a by-product basis measure allows management to assess a mine's cash-generating capabilities at various gold prices. All-in sustaining costs are used to show the full cost of gold production from current operations. The Company calculates all-in sustaining costs per ounce of gold produced as the aggregate of total cash costs on a by-product basis, sustaining capital expenditures (including capitalized exploration), general and administrative expenses (including stock options) and reclamation expenses divided by the amount of gold produced. The all-in sustaining costs per ounce of gold produced on a co-product basis is calculated in the same manner as the total cash costs per ounce of gold produced on a by-product basis except that no adjustment is made for by-product metal revenues. The Company's methodology for calculating all-in sustaining costs may differ from to the methodology used by other producers that disclose all-in sustaining costs. The Company may change the methodology it uses to calculate all-in sustaining costs in the future, including in response to the adoption of formal industry guidance regarding this measure by the World Gold Council . Management is aware that these per ounce measures of performance can be affected by fluctuations in exchange rates, and, in the case of total cash costs per ounce of gold produced on a by-product basis, by-product metal prices. Management compensates for these inherent limitations by using these measures in conjunction with minesite costs per tonne (discussed below) as well as other data prepared in accordance with IFRS. Management also performs sensitivity analyses in order to quantify the effects of fluctuating exchange rates and metal prices. This news release also contains information as to estimated future total cash costs per ounce, all-in sustaining costs and minesite costs per tonne. The estimates are based upon the total cash costs per ounce, all-in sustaining costs and minesite costs per tonne that the Company expects to incur to mine gold at its mines and projects and, consistent with the reconciliation of these actual costs referred to above, do not include production costs attributable to accretion expense and other asset retirement costs, which will vary over time as each project is developed and mined. It is therefore not practicable to reconcile these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable IFRS measure.

The scientific and technical information relating to Agnico Eagle 's mineral reserves and mineral resources contained herein has been approved by Daniel Doucet, Senior Corporate Director, Reserve Development, Ing., and a qualified person as defined by NI 43-101. Cautionary Note To U.S. Investors - The SEC permits U.S. mining companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose only those mineral deposits that a company can economically and legally extract or produce. Agnico Eagle reports mineral resource and reserve mineral estimates in accordance with the CIM guidelines for the estimation, classification and reporting of mineral resources and mineral reserves in accordance with the Canadian securities regulatory authorities' NI 43-101. These standards are similar to those used by the SEC's Industry Guide No. 7, as interpreted by Staff at the SEC (\"Guide 7\"). However, the definitions in NI 43-101 differ in certain respects from those under Guide 7. Accordingly, mineral reserve information contained herein may not be comparable to similar information disclosed by U.S. companies. Under the requirements of the SEC, mineralization may not be classified as a \"reserve\" unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically and legally produced or extracted at the time the mineral reserve determination is made. A \"final\" or \"bankable\" feasibility study is required to meet the requirements to designate mineral reserves under Industry Guide 7. Agnico Eagle uses certain terms in this news release, such as \"measured\", \"indicated\", and \"inferred\", and \"resources\" that the SEC guidelines strictly prohibit U.S. registered companies from including in their filings with the SEC. In prior periods, mineral reserves for all properties were typically estimated using historic three-year average metals prices and foreign exchange rates in accordance with the SEC guidelines. These guidelines require the use of prices that reflect current economic conditions at the time of mineral reserve determination, which the Staff of the SEC has interpreted to mean historic three-year average prices. Given the current lower commodity price environment, Agnico Eagle has decided to use price assumptions that are below the three-year averages. The assumptions used for the mineral reserves estimates at all mines and advanced projects as of December 31, 2014 (other than the Canadian Malartic mine), reported by the Company on February 11, 2015, are $1,150 per ounce gold, $18.00 per ounce silver, $1.00 per pound zinc, $3.00 per pound copper, $0.91 per pound lead and C$/US$, US$/Euro and MXP/US$ exchange rates of 1.08, 1.30 and 13.00, respectively. For the mineral reserves estimate at the Canadian Malartic mine, the Company has decided to continue to report the mineral reserves estimated as of June 15, 2014, reported by the Company in a news release dated August 13, 2014, minus the production to the end of 2014. The assumptions used were $1,300 per ounce gold, a cut-off grade between 0.28 g/t and 0.35 g/t gold (depending on the deposit), and a C$/US$ exchange rate of 1.10. NI 43-101 requires mining companies to disclose mineral reserves and mineral resources using the subcategories of \"proven\" mineral reserves, \"probable\" mineral reserves, \"measured\" mineral resources, \"indicated\" mineral resources and \"inferred\" mineral resources. Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. A mineral reserve is the economically mineable part of a measured and/or indicated mineral resource. It includes diluting materials and allowances for losses, which may occur when the material is mined or extracted and is defined by studies at pre-feasibility or feasibility level as appropriate that include application of modifying factors. Such studies demonstrate that, at the time of reporting, extraction could reasonably be justified. Modifying factors are considerations used to convert mineral resources to mineral reserves. These include, but are not restricted to, mining, processing, metallurgical, infrastructure, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental factors. A proven mineral reserve is the economically mineable part of a measured mineral resource. A proven mineral reserve implies a high degree of confidence in the modifying factors. A probable mineral reserve is the economically mineable part of an indicated and, in some circumstances, a measured mineral resource. The confidence in the modifying factors applying to a probable mineral reserve is lower than that applying to a proven mineral reserve. A mineral resource is a concentration or occurrence of solid material of economic interest in or on the Earth's crust in such form, grade or quality and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade or quality, continuity and other geological characteristics of a mineral resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge, including sampling. A measured mineral resource is that part of a mineral resource for which quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics are estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the application of modifying factors to support detailed mine planning and final evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. Geological evidence is derived from detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing and is sufficient to confirm geological and grade or quality continuity between points of observation. An indicated mineral resource is that part of a mineral resource for which quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics are estimated with sufficient confidence to allow the application of modifying factors in sufficient detail to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. Geological evidence is derived from adequately detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing and is sufficient to assume geological and grade or quality continuity between points of observation. An inferred mineral resource is that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of limited geological evidence and sampling. Geological evidence is sufficient to imply but not verify geological and grade or quality continuity. Investors are cautioned not to assume that part or all of an inferred mineral resource exists, or is economically or legally mineable. A feasibility study is a comprehensive technical and economic study of the selected development option for a mineral project that includes appropriately detailed assessments of applicable modifying factors together with any other relevant operational factors and detailed financial analysis that are necessary to demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that extraction is reasonably justified (economically mineable). The results of the study may reasonably serve as the basis for a final decision by a proponent or financial institution to proceed with, or finance, the development of the project. The confidence level of the study will be higher than that of a Pre-Feasibility Study. Agrium Inc.

One of the greatest challenges the global community has ever faced is how to sustainably feed a rapidly growing population. This challenge is complex and won't be solved quickly, but we believe we're stronger working together. By collaborating with multiple groups, we build long-term, impactful programs and solutions that we continually learn from and build upon. So that, together, we can feed the world responsibly and improve the lives of future generations. Agrium Reports Solid Third Quarter and Expects Strong Fall Crop Input Demand CALGARY, ALBERTA--(Marketwired - Nov. 5, 2015) - ALL AMOUNTS ARE STATED IN U.S.$ Agrium Inc. (TSX:AGU) (NYSE:AGU) announced today 2015 third quarter net earnings from continuing operations of $99-million ($0.72 diluted earnings per share), compared to $91-million ($0.63 diluted earnings per share) in the third quarter of 2014. The increased net earnings are due to higher sales volumes of Wholesale nutrients combined with lower production costs in the Wholesale business unit, while Retail's earnings were similar to the prior year, despite weaker market conditions. Highlights: Third quarter adjusted net earnings of $97-million or $0.71 per share and $5.73 per share year to date in 2015 on the same basis (see page 2 for adjusted net earnings reconciliation)1. Wholesale's results were boosted by nitrogen and potash performance, which saw higher volumes and lower costs, leading to an improvement in gross profit, despite lower nutrient prices. Agrium achieved 94 percent ammonia capacity utilization in the third quarter, exceeding the 90 percent target rate. The Canpotex proving run is well underway at our Vanscoy potash facility and is progressing as expected. Retail EBITDA2 in the U.S. and Australia were higher than the same quarter last year reflecting Operational Excellence initiatives. Total Retail EBITDA of $129-million for the quarter was in line with the prior year, despite the impact of drought conditions in the Canadian business. Agrium has repurchased 5.6 million shares since the beginning of April under its current Normal Course Issuer Bid. 2015 annual guidance range has been narrowed to $7.10 to $7.40 diluted earnings per share (see page 3 for further details). \"Agrium's performance this quarter is another demonstration of the resilience of our business model. We focused on what we can control, improving our on-stream Wholesale performance and optimizing our distribution network and effectively managing costs in Retail, all of which helped drive a 9 percent increase in earnings over the same period last year despite prevailing market headwinds,\" commented Chuck Magro, Agrium's President and CEO. \"We see strong crop input demand during the fall application season which is now in full swing and we are confident that our strategy and business structure can continue to deliver value to all our shareholders,\" added Mr. Magro. Forecasted annual effective tax rate of 27.5 percent used for adjusted net earnings and per share calculations. These are non-IFRS measures which represent net earnings adjusted for certain income (expenses) that are considered to be non-operational in nature. We believe these measures provide meaningful comparison to the earnings of other companies by eliminating share-based payments expense (recovery), gains (losses) on foreign exchange, gains (losses) on non-qualifying derivative hedges and significant non-operating, non-recurring items. These should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS and may not be directly comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Earnings (loss) from continuing operations before finance costs, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. This is a non-IFRS measure. Refer to section \"Additional IFRS and Non-IFRS Financial Measures\" in the Management's Discussion and Analysis. MARKET OUTLOOK For the third consecutive year, favorable growing conditions have contributed to above-trend global grain yields. Even in geographies which faced challenging conditions early in the growing season, such as parts of the U.S. Corn Belt and Western Canada, yield prospects have come in stronger than anticipated. Despite historically high production, the outlook for grains is more positive than it was a year ago and as of the end of October 2015, cash corn prices were more than 10 percent above 2014 levels, although oilseed prices are lower year-over-year. Excluding China, the global grain stocks to use ratio is projected to decline to the lowest level since 2012/13 and the U.S. corn supply/demand balance is projected to tighten. As a result of projected lower 2015/16 U.S. corn ending stocks, analysts project that U.S. corn area will increase in 2016. We expect normal North American crop nutrient application rates in the 2015/16 fertilizer year and expect that fall demand in 2015 will improve relative to 2014 levels as harvest progress is significantly ahead of last year, supporting a wider application window than the short 2014 season. In addition, we expect the overall planted acreage and crop mix to support increased crop nutrient demand. The devaluation of most non-U.S. currencies over the past year has negatively impacted crop input demand and U.S. dollar prices. While growers in most market driven non-U.S. regions have realized a net benefit from lower local currency values due to improved local currency crop prices, crop nutrient prices in local currencies have increased significantly in some cases, which has been negative for demand. Currency devaluations have directly impacted crop nutrient demand and prices in Brazil and India. In Brazil, higher local prices, combined with lending constraints have negatively impacted import demand, however, downstream inventories have been drawn down to meet farm-level demand. In India, the devaluation of the rupee has pressured phosphate prices in order to be economical under the subsidy regime, while Indian buyers have delayed execution on some contracted potash volumes. Globally, the downstream distribution network has been drawing on nutrient inventories to meet grower demand and purchasing on a just-in-time basis, which has led to relatively slow demand for all products. This has been the case in the U.S. urea market, as offshore imports of urea are estimated to be down 19 percent through the end of October 2015. The urea market has also been under pressure due to the combination of the devaluation of the Chinese yuan and lower anthracite coal prices, which have lowered the marginal cost of production. Chinese production levels in September in 2015 declined by 6 percent from August levels as a result of these market pressures and are expected to drop through the remainder of the year. Similarly for potash, strong shipments of potash in 2014 and the first half of 2015 allowed downstream inventories to increase. Buyers have been drawing upon these inventories in the second half of 2015, and prices have declined as spot sales volumes have declined. We expect pent-up demand to emerge late as fall applications occur and downstream inventories are drawn down. Similar to nitrogen and potash, phosphate demand has been slow in recent months, which has led to a reduction in phosphate production by some major producers. UPDATED ANNUAL 2015 GUIDANCE Based on our Market Outlook, Agrium expects to achieve annual diluted earnings per share of $7.10 to $7.40 in 2015 compared to our previous estimate of $7.00 to $7.50 per share. We have narrowed the guidance range but maintained a range width encompassing approximately $60-million of EBITDA variability to reflect the risk and opportunity associated with weather conditions and fall season length. We are assuming a normal fall season, recognizing there is always a risk that an early onset of inclement weather could bring an early close to the season. We have lowered the high-end and narrowed our anticipated Retail EBITDA range to $1.00-billion to $1.03-billion because of the impact of drought and lower crop prices on our Canadian operations in 2015. Our annual nitrogen production target remains unchanged. We narrowed our potash production range to 1.95 million tonnes to 2.05 million tonnes for 2015. We have updated the range for our annual effective tax rate for 2015 to 27 percent to 28 percent to reflect the anticipated geographic split of our global income. Our estimates of the Canada and U.S. foreign exchange rates and NYMEX for 2015 have been narrowed from our previous estimates based on current market conditions. This guidance and updated additional measures and related assumptions are summarized in the table below. Guidance excludes the impact of share-based payments expense (recovery), gains (losses) on foreign exchange and non-qualifying derivative hedges and significant non-operating, non-recurring items.

Wholesale's sales volumes increased for all three crop nutrients for the third quarter and for nitrogen and phosphate for the first nine months of 2015 primarily as a result of higher operating rates. Realized selling prices for the third quarter decreased as a result of weaker market conditions but overall our average selling price increased for the first nine months of 2015. Product purchased for resale contributed to the decrease in sales as Agrium exited portions of this business. Wholesale's gross profit significantly increased due to lower natural gas input costs, manufacturing cost efficiencies and as a result of higher nitrogen, potash and phosphate volumes produced for the third quarter and first nine months of 2015 compared to the same periods last year. Retail's sales and gross profit decreased for the third quarter and first nine months of 2015 compared to the same periods last year primarily due to unfavorable weather conditions and competitive pricing pressure as a result of lower crop prices which impacted most of our product lines' sales and margins. Expenses General and administrative expense decreased by $9-million (13 percent) for the third quarter and $27-million (12 percent) for the first nine months of 2015 compared to the same periods last year as a result of reduced payroll and office expense costs as we continue to realize reductions related to our Operational Excellence program. Share-based Payments We had a share-based payment recovery of $15-million this quarter compared to a share-based payment expense of $10-million for the third quarter last year due primarily to the decrease in our share price. As a result of our higher average share price for the first nine months of 2015, our share-based payments expense increased by $11-million compared to the same period last year. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased for the third quarter and first nine months of 2015 due to the change in our method of depreciation from the straight-line basis to the units-of-production basis for our Vanscoy potash facility mining and milling assets at the beginning of 2015 and our reassessment of the useful lives of our property, plant and equipment in our Retail business unit in the fourth quarter of 2014 to reflect our expectations on the estimated future economic benefits of our property, plant and equipment. In the first nine months of 2015, other expenses decreased by $8-million due to the following: Gains of $33-million were recognized on natural gas derivatives in the first nine months of 2014 and were recorded directly to other expenses. 2015 did not have comparable results, as starting January 1, 2015, we began to designate all of our natural gas derivatives as qualifying hedges for accounting purposes and the related gains or losses are recorded as part of cost of product sold when we sell the related product while unrealized gains or losses are recorded in equity. We completed the sale of our Niota and Meredosia storage and distribution facilities in the first quarter of 2015 resulting in a gain on sale of purchase for resale assets of $38-million. Effective Tax Rate The effective tax rate on continuing operations of 27 percent for the third quarter is higher than the tax rate of 18 percent in the comparative quarter in 2014 (excluding the effect of the recognition of a previously unrecognized tax benefit of $29-million) because of higher earnings in higher taxed jurisdictions. The effective tax rate of 29 percent for the first nine months of 2015 is higher than the rate of 27 percent for the same period last year (excluding the effect of the recognition of a previously unrecognized tax benefit) due to the increase in the Alberta provincial statutory tax rate. BUSINESS SEGMENT PERFORMANCE Retail sales and gross profit during the quarter were lower than the same period last year due to generally lower crop input prices, weaker non-U.S. currency exchange rates and dry weather conditions in our international and Canadian operations. Regionally, the U.S. EBITDA contribution was up approximately 4 percent over the same period last year. Australia reported a 40 percent increase in EBITDA, due mostly to a focused effort in reducing overall operating costs. Canada and South America EBITDA declined as poor growing conditions hampered demand for all crop inputs. Retail selling expenses as a percentage of sales were marginally higher this quarter due to lower total sales. However, total selling expenses were down $33-million compared to the same period last year as a result of cost reductions primarily in our Canadian and Australian Retail operations. Total crop nutrient sales were 10 percent lower compared to the same period last year due to a reduction in both average crop nutrient selling prices as well as lower sales volumes. Total crop nutrient volumes were 4 percent lower this quarter across our Retail operations compared to the same period last year. Virtually all of the reduction was due to lower demand in our International Retail, due to dry conditions and lower planted wheat acreage. Despite lower corn and total seeded acreage this year in North America, sales tonnes in the region were relatively flat compared to the third quarter of 2014. Crop nutrient margins on a per tonne basis were lower across all regions. Margins from our international Retail declined by 28 percent over the same period last year. North American operations were 15 percent lower as a result of declining crop nutrient prices. Crop protection products Total crop protection sales were down 8 percent year-over-year with most of the reduction due to a combination of drought conditions impacting sales within our Canadian operations, lower demand for insecticides in the U.S. and lower prices for glyphosate products. International crop protection sales also experienced a decline related to dry conditions in those regions. Crop protection margins as a percentage of sales increased year-over-year, largely due to timing of rebates and new programs from suppliers in the U.S. market. Additionally, proprietary crop protection margins as a percentage of sales increased by 5 percent over the same period last year with the most significant increases in Canada and Australia. Seed Seed sales were up 11 percent this quarter compared to the same period last year. The increase was due primarily to excessive moisture conditions in the Eastern U.S. during June, which pushed corn and soybean seeding into July of this year. The excessive moisture also prevented a significant amount of corn and soybean acreage in the region from being planted and much of this area was seeded with wheat, rye grass and other grass seed instead. Seed sales and margins were negatively impacted by competitive pressures across the seed industry, as well as lower sales volumes in Canada. Seed margins as a percentage of sales were 43 percent this quarter compared to 50 percent in 2014. Increased sales volumes of wheat, rye grass and other grass seed, which are lower margin products, were a key contributor to the lower margins. Merchandise Merchandise sales decreased compared to the same period last year as a result of lower fuel prices and demand in Canada and lower animal health sales in Australia. Gross margin as a percentage of sales was higher this quarter due to a decrease in lower margin Canadian fuel sales and our ability to maintain a better cost position in the Australian business, which consistently has higher margin products. Services and other Sales for services and other was down 21 percent this quarter, due mainly to the closure of our livestock export business in Australia. Application and other services sales, gross profit and gross margins were all higher in North America compared to the same period last year. Wholesale sales this quarter were lower than the same period last year due to our decision to sell several non-core, lower-return purchase for resale facilities in 2015 related to our on-going asset portfolio review. Excluding this factor, Wholesale had higher product sales volumes this quarter largely offset by lower selling prices for all three crop nutrients. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $55-million over the prior year, as a result of higher utilization rates from our nitrogen and potash segments resulting in higher sales volumes and lower production costs per tonne. Nitrogen Nitrogen gross profit increased by 69 percent over the same period last year, with results being driven by higher volumes and a significant reduction in cost of product sold due to improved capacity utilization rates and lower natural gas costs in the current period. Sales volumes increased by 3 percent over the same period last year, driven by stronger urea and ammonia sales. This increase was due to higher on-stream time at our production facilities and product availability compared to the same period last year. Cost of product sold per tonne was 35 percent lower than the same period last year. Operational improvements and higher on-stream time compared to the same period in the prior year decreased fixed costs per tonne, while lower natural gas costs reduced variable costs. The weaker Canadian dollar also reduced operating costs at our Canadian plants. Nitrogen margin per tonne was $171 per tonne, a 63 percent improvement over the same period last year, despite an 11 percent reduction in average selling prices. Potash Potash gross profit this quarter was $40-million higher than the same period last year, due to the turnaround to tie-in the Vanscoy capacity expansion that started in the third quarter of 2014 leading to lower sales and margin in the prior year. Sales volumes were 53 percent higher compared to the same period in the prior year. Production volumes this quarter were 560,000 tonnes. Realized sales prices were lower than the same period last year due to competitive pricing pressure in both domestic and international markets. Cost of product sold was reduced as a result of cost efficiencies associated with the continuing ramp-up of the Vanscoy expansion, as well as weakening of the Canadian dollar. As a result, cash cost of product manufactured continues to improve and is $89 per tonne in the current quarter compared to $110 per tonne in the second quarter of 2015. Phosphate Phosphate gross profit was unchanged from the prior year. Sales volumes were slightly higher than last year, while reduced selling prices were largely offset by lower cost of production. As a result, phosphate margins were only 2 percent lower than the same quarter last year. Wholesale Other Gross profit for Wholesale's Other product category decreased this quarter primarily due to lower sales volumes and gross profit for the product purchased for resale business, as these operations were significantly scaled back earlier in 2015 as part of our portfolio review. ESN(r) gross profit increased this quarter due to slightly higher sales volumes and lower cost of product sold, which was partly offset by lower selling prices. Wholesale Earnings from Equity Investees Agrium's share of earnings from equity investees saw a loss of $10-million during the quarter. MOPCO experienced gas curtailments throughout the quarter which restricted nitrogen production. Profertil's sales volumes and costs were impacted by an extended outage during the current quarter. Other EBITDA for our Other non-operating business unit for the third quarter of 2015 had a net expense of $44-million, compared to a net expense of $40-million for the third quarter of 2014. The variance was due to the following: A $12-million higher gross profit elimination expense as a result of higher inter-segment inventory held at the end of the third quarter of 2015; A $22-million increase in other expenses primarily due to higher provisions for environmental remediation and asset retirement obligations and an interest recovery received in 2014; and A $15-million share-based payment recovery for the third quarter of 2015 compared to a $10-million share-based payment expense for the same period last year due to a decrease in Agrium's share price in 2015. Summary of Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Below is a summary of our cash provided by or used in operating, investing, and financing activities as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows: Our investing capital expenditures decreased in the first nine months of 2015 compared to the first nine months of 2014 due to the completion of the tie-in of our Vanscoy potash facility expansion in the fourth quarter of 2014, partially offset by expenditures relating to the Borger nitrogen expansion project. Our sustaining capital expenditures decreased in the first nine months of 2015 as we had less turnarounds compared to the same period last year. We expect Agrium's capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of 2015 to approximate $200--million to $300-million in 2015. We anticipate that we will be able to finance the announced projects through a combination of cash provided from operating activities and existing credit facilities. Short-term Debt Our short-term debt of $1.8-billion at September 30, 2015 is outlined in note 5 of our Summarized Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our short-term debt increased by $1.1-billion during the three months ended September 30, 2015, which in turn contributed to a decrease in our unutilized short-term financing capacity to $1.1-billion at September 30, 2015. Capital Management Our revolving credit facilities require that we maintain specific interest coverage and debt-to-capital ratios, as well as other non-financial covenants as defined in our credit agreements. We were in compliance with all covenants at September 30, 2015. NORMAL COURSE ISSUER BID In January 2015, the Toronto Stock Exchange (\"TSX\") accepted Agrium's notice of intention to make a normal course issuer bid (\"NCIB\") whereby Agrium may purchase up to 7,185,866 common shares on the TSX and New York Stock Exchange during the period from January 26, 2015 to January 25, 2016. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we purchased 5,574,331 shares at an average share price of $100.25 for total consideration of $559-million. Shareholders can obtain a free copy of the NCIB notice submitted to the TSX from Agrium upon request. OUTSTANDING SHARE DATA Agrium had 138,169,000 outstanding shares at October 31, 2015. At that date, under our stock option plans, shares expected to be issued for options outstanding were negligible. ADDITIONAL IFRS AND NON-IFRS FINANCIAL MEASURES Certain financial measures in this MD&A are not prescribed by IFRS. We consider these financial measures discussed herein to provide useful information to both management and investors in measuring our financial performance and financial condition. In general, an additional IFRS financial measure is a measure relevant to understanding a company's financial performance that is not a minimum financial statement measure mandated by IFRS. A non-IFRS financial measure generally either excludes or includes amounts not excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS. Non-IFRS financial measures are not recognized measures under IFRS and our method of calculation may not be directly comparable to that of other companies. These non-IFRS measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. The following table outlines our additional IFRS financial measure, its definition and why management uses such measure. Additional IFRS financial measure Definition Why We Use the Measure and Why it is Useful to Investors EBIT Earnings (loss) from continuing operations before finance costs and income taxes. Provides management and investors with information for comparison of our operating results to the operating results of other companies. This measure eliminates the impact of finance and tax structure variables that exist between entities. The following table outlines our non-IFRS financial measures, their definitions and why management uses each measure.

OTHER Barrick Gold Corporation (TSX: ABX) Our vision is the generation of wealth through responsible mining wealth for our owners, our people, and the countries and communities with which we partner. We aim to be the leading mining company focused on gold, growing our cash flow per share by developing and operating high quality assets through disciplined allocation of human and financial capital and operational excellence. Those who founded and first led the company were committed to a culture of partnership and the values underpinning such a culture: trust, transparency, shared responsibility and accountability, and a sense of emotional and financial ownership. The company is returning to its roots as a lean and nimble organization, with minimal bureaucracy. A small head office manages the company with a balance of entrepreneurialism and prudence, focusing on only a few core activities: defining and implementing strategy, allocating human and financial capital, and fulfilling the obligations required of a public company. Leaders at the operational level have greater autonomy, responsibility, and accountability, functioning as business owners. Free from bureaucracy and middle management, they are focused on maximizing free cash flow, and the head office is focused on allocating that cash flow to maximize shareholder returns. Barrick has mining operations in Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile, Dominican Republic, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Saudi Arabia, United States and Zambia. More than 75 percent of the company's gold production comes from the Americas region. Barrick Reports Third Quarter 2015 Results | Growing Free Cash Flow TORONTO, October 28, 2015 The company reported adjusted net earnings of $131 million ($0.11 per share)1and a net loss of $264 million ($0.23 per share) in the third quarter. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $942 million1; EBITDA was $490 million1. Free cash flow was $866 million1, or $256 million excluding proceeds from the Pueblo Viejo streaming transaction. Gold production in the third quarter was 1.66 million ounces at all-in sustaining costs (AISC) of $771 per ounce1 Full-year gold production is expected to be 6.1-6.3 million ounces. Full-year all-in sustaining cost guidance reduced to $830-$870 per ounce from previous range of $840-$880 per ounce. On track to achieve $2 billion in cash flow improvements by end of 2016. Total debt reduced by 15 percent year-to-date, on track to achieve $3 billion debt reduction target. Progressing drilling and feasibility study work to convert resources to reserves over the next five years at Cortez, Goldstrike, Lagunas Norte, Pueblo Viejo, Turquoise Ridge and other sites. Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:ABX)(TSX:ABX) (Barrick or the \"company\") today reported adjusted net earnings of $131 million ($0.11 per share) for the third quarter and a net loss of $264 million ($0.23 per share). Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was$942 million and EBITDA was $490 million. Free cash flow was $866 million, or $256 million excluding the impact of $610 millionin proceeds from the Pueblo Viejo streaming transaction2. Production in the third quarter was in line with expectations at 1.66 million ounces of gold. All-in sustaining costs were $771 per ounce and cash costs were $570 per ounce1. Full-year 2015 gold production is expected to be 6.1-6.3 million ounces at lower all-in sustaining costs of $830-$870 per ounce. Our objective is to grow free cash flow per share from a portfolio of high-quality gold assets through disciplined capital allocation and operational excellence. In support of this objective, we have returned to a leaner, decentralized operating model designed to maximize free cash flow and improve execution. Clear capital allocation criteria, including a 15 percent hurdle rate for all investments, are driving greater financial rigor and stronger returns. The divestment of non-core assets has refocused our portfolio and we have formed vital new strategic partnerships that will drive new opportunities in the future. All of this is driving stronger performance across the business, reflected by two consecutive quarters of positive free cash flow and improved costs. At the same time, we are strengthening our balance sheet and remain on track to reduce debt by $3 billion. This momentum will support our overriding objective of growing free cash flow per share, underpinned by a strong pipeline of organic projects and mine site expansion opportunities in our core regions. STRENGTHENING THE BALANCE SHEET Earlier this year, we set a $3 billion debt reduction target for 2015. We said we would achieve this through the disciplined sale of non-core assets, the formation of new joint ventures and partnerships, and by maximizing free cash flow from our operations. Thus far, we have completed or announced asset sales, joint ventures and partnerships valued at $2.46 billion. We have also generated$282 million in positive free cash flow in the last two quarters despite a lower gold price, reflecting the impact of our efforts to maximize free cash flow across the company. Both asset sales and cash flow improvements have been credit positive, and have resulted in improvements to our debt-to-EBITDA ratio. Achieving our $3 billion debt reduction target will also reduce annual pre-tax interest payments by approximately $140 million. So far this year, total debt has been reduced by 15 percent, from $13.1 billion to $11.2 billion3, significantly reducing our near-term debt repayment obligations. We currently have less than $250 million in debt due before 2018 and approximately $5 billion of our $11.2 billion in outstanding debt matures after 2032. Building on $1.9 billion in repayments already completed this year, we intend to use approximately $1 billion in proceeds from the sale of 50 percent of Zaldivar to reduce debt. The sale is expected to close in the fourth quarter. This would bring total debt repayments to approximately $2.9 billion. We intend to use free cash flow to reach our target of $3 billion. Assuming the completion of $3 billion in repayments, total debt will have been reduced by 23 percent, from $13.1 billion to $10.1 billion. We also expect to announce the outcome of a process for the sale of certain non-core U.S. assets in the fourth quarter. As we move into 2016 and beyond, we will continue to take prudent steps to strengthen our balance sheet, balancing debt repayments with investments in profitable production that will drive growth in free cash flow and EBITDA. Our liquidity position continues to improve, with strong cash flow generation, very modest near-term debt repayment obligations, a$4 billion undrawn credit facility and $3.34 billion in cash on hand at the end of the third quarter. FINANCIAL DISCUSSION Free cash flow increased to $866 million, or $256 million excluding the impact of $610 million in proceeds from the Pueblo Viejo streaming transaction. This compares to $26 million in free cash flow in the second quarter of 2015. Two consecutive quarters of positive free cash flow after a prolonged period of negative free cash flow reflects our driving focus on maximizing free cash flow through greater capital discipline, operational efficiencies and strong cost management. Third quarter 2015 adjusted net earnings were $131 million ($0.11 per share) compared to $222 million ($0.19 per share) in the prior year period. The net loss for the quarter was $264 million ($0.23 per share) compared to net earnings of $125 million ($0.11per share) in the prior year quarter. Lower adjusted net earnings reflect lower realized gold and copper prices and higher depreciation compared to the prior year period, partially offset by increased gold and copper sales. Significant adjusting items for the quarter (net of tax and non-controlling interest effects) include: $455 million in impairment charges primarily related to the reclassification of our Zaldivar mine as held-for-sale; and $29 million in costs arising from the write-down of obsolete supplies inventory; partially offset by $52 million of gains related to the sale of our Cowal mine and 50 percent of our interest in the Porgera mine; and $45 million in unrealized foreign currency translation gains. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $942 million compared to $1.1 billion in the prior year period. On an unadjusted basis, EBITDA was $490 million for the third quarter compared to $1.0 billion in the prior year period. Operating cash flow was $1.26 billion compared to $852 million in the prior year period. Higher operating cash flow in the quarter reflects the impact of $610 million in proceeds from the Pueblo Viejo streaming transaction. OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS AND GUIDANCE Barrick's operations continued to perform in line with expectations for the year, meeting cost and production targets for the third quarter while generating stronger free cash flow. We have tightened our gold production guidance range for 2015, from 6.1-6.4 million ounces to 6.1-6.3 million ounces, reflecting lower anticipated gold production from Acacia Mining plc. All-in sustaining cost guidance for the year has been reduced to $830-$870 per ounce from the previous range of $840-$880 per ounce. Average all-in sustaining costs for our five core mines are now expected to be $700-$725 per ounce in 2015, down from$725-$775 per ounce at the start of this year. These mines are expected to account for about 75 percent of free cash flow from operations and 60-65 percent of production in 2015. Fourth quarter all-in sustaining costs are now expected to be similar to the third quarter while production is expected to be slightly higher, primarily driven by the impact of higher sustaining capital expenditures offset by higher production at Cortez, Pueblo Viejo, Lagunas Norte and Veladero. We expect significantly higher depreciation in the fourth quarter, primarily related to a drawdown in inventory stockpiles at Cortez, Lagunas Norte and Goldstrike and higher sales volumes at Pueblo Viejo. Total copper guidance for 2015 remains unchanged at 480-520 million pounds. Full-year C1 cash costs are now expected to be$1.60-$1.85 per pound5, down from $1.75-$2.00 per pound, driven by currency impacts and improved costs at Lumwana. Cortez The Cortez mine produced 321,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $501 per ounce in the third quarter. Production benefited from higher open pit tonnage and improved underground productivity through the implementation of short interval controls, an initiative identified as part of our Value Realization review for Cortez. Higher production, lower operating costs and lower sustaining capital drove improved all-in sustaining costs. Production in 2015 is now forecast to be 900,000-950,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $675-$725 per ounce. Fourth quarter production at Cortez is expected to be slightly higher than the third quarter, at higher costs. A prefeasibility study for expanded underground mining in an area known as Deep South below currently permitted levels will be completed in late 2015 and results are expected to be disclosed with the company's fourth quarter results. Our Value Realization review at Cortez also identified long-hole stoping as the preferred mining method for the deposit, as compared to the cut-and-fill method previously contemplated for the underground expansion, which could improve the economics of the project. Mineralization in this zone is primarily oxide and higher grade compared to the current underground mine, which is sulfide in nature. The limits of the Lower Zone have not yet been defined, and drilling has indicated the potential for new targets at depth. With a 382-square-mile land package, Cortez remains a highly prospective district for Barrick. Goldstrike The Goldstrike mine contributed 328,000 ounces in the third quarter in line with plan, while all-in sustaining costs of $558 per ounce were better than expected due to lower operating costs and lower sustaining capital. Our innovative thiosulfate (TCM) circuit achieved commercial production in the third quarter, coming in at a capital cost of $610 million. We expect to complete the ramp up of the TCM circuit in the first half of 2016. Goldstrike's production for 2015 is forecast to be 1.00-1.10 million ounces at improved all-in sustaining costs of $650-$700 per ounce. Fourth quarter production is expected to be similar to the third quarter, at slightly higher costs. Exploration at Goldstrike is focused on the underground mine where good potential exists at depth, and we plan to accelerate near-mine development in 2016. During the quarter, we began development of new areas below existing workings at Meikle and Rodeo in order to access deeper reserves which are expected to come into production at the end of 2016. This work will also open up new drilling platforms to better define future potential in these areas. Pueblo Viejo (60 percent) Barrick's 60 percent share of production from Pueblo Viejo for the third quarter was 172,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of$554 per ounce. Production was slightly below plan due to lower gold grades and recoveries from a higher proportion of carbonaceous ore. All-in sustaining costs were impacted by lower silver recoveries associated with a combination of scheduled autoclave maintenance in September, lime boil limitations and unscheduled maintenance on the limestone grinding circuit. Modifications to the lime boil are underway, including the addition of two lime boil tanks which will be operational in November. These additional tanks are expected to improve silver recoveries to the targeted 80 percent level from around 60 percent currently. We continue to forecast attributable production of 625,000-675,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $540-$590 per ounce in 2015. Production is expected to be higher and costs lower in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter on higher grades, improved recoveries and better autoclave availability. At the end of 2014, Pueblo Viejo had approximately six million ounces of gold and 37 million ounces of silver in the measured and indicated resource category (Barrick's 60 percent share)9. A significant portion of these resources are not currently included in reserves due to tailings storage constraints. We have completed a preliminary economic assessment on a plan to remove these constraints to tailings capacity, which if implemented could significantly extend the life of the mine. We expect to complete further engineering work and commission a prefeasibility study in the second half of 2016 to refine the technical and financial analysis for the increase in tailings storage capacity and to confirm whether the measured and indicated resources described above can be brought into reserves. Lagunas Norte The Lagunas Norte mine contributed 108,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $581 per ounce in the third quarter, in line with expectations. Production in 2015 is now anticipated to be 550,000-590,000 ounces at improved all-in sustaining costs of $550-$600 per ounce, with stronger production expected in the fourth quarter driven by improved performance at the Phase Five leach pad. Fourth quarter all-in sustaining costs are expected to be higher than the third quarter, reflecting the sale of higher cost inventory as well as increased sustaining capital for Phase Six leach pad construction. A pre-feasibility study on a plan to extend the mine life by up to 12 years by mining nearly two million ounces of sulfide ore below the existing open pit is on schedule for completion in 2015. Veladero The Veladero mine produced 143,000 ounces of gold in the third quarter at all-in sustaining costs of $914 per ounce. Production was below plan primarily due to lower grades in the Federico Phase Three pit and adverse weather events in August which impacted leach operations. All-in sustaining costs were higher than plan on lower gold ounces sold, timing of sustaining capital and lower silver credits. The addition of reagents to the leach circuit was temporarily halted in September following a valve failure on a pipe carrying processing solution, which led to a discharge to the environment through a diversion channel gate that was open at the time of the incident. Since the incident occurred, our first priority has been the safety of people and the environment. Water samples analyzed by independent third-parties, including the United Nations, have confirmed that there are no risks to the health of downstream communities as a result of this incident. Restrictions on leaching activities were lifted following implementation of additional monitoring and corrective actions. Production guidance for 2015 is unchanged at 575,000-625,000 ounces while all-in sustaining cost guidance has been narrowed to $950-$1,000 per ounce. Fourth quarter production is expected to be higher, at lower all-in sustaining costs driven by better grades, lower capital expenditures and higher silver and inventory credits. Turquoise Ridge (75 percent) The Turquoise Ridge mine contributed 55,000 ounces in the third quarter at all-in sustaining costs of $738 per ounce, in line with expectations. The mine is forecast to produce 175,000-200,000 ounces in 2015 at improved all-in sustaining costs of $750-$800per ounce. Detailed engineering and feasibility work on developing an additional shaft GoC which could bring forward more than one million ounces of production and roughly double output to an average of 500,000 ounces per year (100 percent basis) at all-in sustaining costs of about $625-$675 per ounce GoC is on track to be completed by the end of the year. Work to install additional ventilation capacity has also been initiated. Porgera (47.5 percent) The Porgera mine produced 134,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $986 per ounce, in line with plan. Attributable production in 2015 is now expected to be 400,000-450,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $1,025-$1,125 per ounce, reflecting Barrick's reduced interest following the sale of 50 percent of Barrick (Niugini) Ltd. to Zijin Mining. Recent drought conditions are not expected to have a material impact on production in 2015. We expect to increase our exploration budget at Porgera in 2016 to focus on underground targets which have been identified through a new geological model. Other Mines Barrick's other mines - consisting of Bald Mountain, 50 percent of Round Mountain, Golden Sunlight, Ruby Hill, Hemlo, Cowal, KCGM and Pierina - contributed 298,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $959 per ounce in the third quarter. A sale process is underway for Bald Mountain, Round Mountain, Ruby Hill, Golden Sunlight and the Spring Valley and Hilltop properties, with strong interest received to date. Acacia Mining (63.9 percent) Barrick's share of third quarter production was lower than expected at 104,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $1,195 per ounce due to temporary factors impacting output from Bulyanhulu and Buzwagi. We now expect attributable 2015 production from Acacia to be about 460,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of approximately $1,155 per ounce. Copper Copper production in the third quarter was 140 million pounds at C1 cash costs of $1.53 per pound. For 2015, copper production is anticipated to be 480-520 million pounds at lower C1 cash costs of $1.60-$1.85 per pound, reflecting currency impacts and improved costs at Lumwana. Lumwana contributed 77 million pounds at C1 cash costs of $1.59 per pound in the third quarter, in line with expectations. Power restrictions and potential reductions to smelter capacity in Zambia are not expected to have any material impact on Lumwana's 2015 production guidance. Production is now anticipated to be 260-280 million pounds at lower C1 cash costs of $1.80-$2.00per pound in 2015, reflecting higher grades. Production of 63 million pounds at Zaldivar at C1 cash costs of $1.47 per pound in the third quarter was in line with plan. At Jabal Sayid, first shipments of copper-in-concentrate continue to be anticipated in early 2016. Once the mine reaches full production, average production in the first full five years is expected to be 100 million pounds per year. TARGETING $2 BILLION IN CASH FLOW IMPROVEMENTS This year, we have taken significant actions to improve our business plans, resulting in positive free cash flow for two consecutive quarters. We remain focused on improving productivity and driving down costs to maximize free cash flow from our assets in any gold price environment. In support of this, we are targeting $2 billion in cash flow improvements across the company before the end of 2016, relative to our original internal plans for 2015 and 2016. These improvements are coming from productivity gains and cost reductions across operating expenses, capital spending and corporate overhead. While a majority of these actions will be incorporated into our 2016 plans, the initial outcomes are reflected in improvements to our 2015 guidance. Total capital expenditures for the year are expected to be 20 percent lower than 2014. Combined with reductions in corporate overhead and other operating cost savings, this has allowed us to reduce our 2015 all-in sustaining cost guidance by about $30 per ounce since the start of year, from our original range of $860-$895 per ounce to $830-$870 per ounce in the third quarter. We are now focused on optimizing our 2016 plans, with an emphasis on operating cost and productivity improvements. Our temporary suspension plan for Pascua-Lama has now been approved by the mining authority in Chile. This will enable us to complete the transition to care and maintenance, and should allow us to significantly reduce holding costs at the project in 2016. Implementation of the temporary suspension plan could require adjustments resulting from regulatory and legal actions and weather conditions, which could increase costs associated with the plan. CONVERTING RESOURCES TO RESERVES At the end of 2014, Barrick had 93 million ounces of proven and probable gold reserves and 94 million ounces of measured and indicated gold resources10. At 1.37 grams per tonne, our reserve grade is more than 50 percent higher than the senior peer average11. For more than 20 years, Barrick has maintained an average reserve mine life of between 10 to 20 years with a track record of replacing reserves and resources at our operations. Mine life and production rates at the majority of our mines have far surpassed initial estimates and we continue to identify excellent potential for resource conversion at many of our operations. Of our exploration budget, 65 percent is focused on opportunities at or near our existing operations. Drilling and feasibility study work to convert resources to reserves over the next five years at Cortez, Goldstrike, Lagunas Norte, Pueblo Viejo and Turquoise Ridge are progressing well. In addition, recent drilling at Hemlo and Porgera indicates strong potential for resource additions. We are also working to advance our Goldrush project in Nevada and drilling to define the limits of mineralization at the Alturas project inChile is expected to resume in the fourth quarter, following the South American winter. An illustration of the optionality that exists within our portfolio is the recent drill program at Hemlo. In the first quarter, Barrick completed the acquisition of surface and mineral rights adjacent to the Hemlo property in Ontario from subsidiaries of Newmont Mining. These claims included an area of geological potential adjacent to Barrick's existing underground workings. Barrick is currently undertaking an underground diamond drilling program in this area to evaluate its potential. To date, drilling has encountered a number of high grade intercepts with significant potential. These results highlight the ongoing potential of mineral deposits such as the Hemlo camp, even as they become mature operations. A detailed update on reserves and resources will be provided with the company's fourth quarter results in February 2016.

Cameco Corporation (TSE: CCJ) Cameco is one of the world's largest uranium producers accounting for about 16% of the global production from its mines in Canada, the US and Kazakhstan. Our leading position is backed by about 429 million pounds of proven and probable reserves and extensive resources. Cameco Reports Third Quarter Financial Results SASKATOON, SASKATCHEWAN--(Oct. 30, 2015) higher consolidated revenue and gross profit for the first nine months lower uranium segment gross profit for the quarter and first nine months annual uranium sales outlook confirmed strong performance at Cigar Lake, increased annual production target range ALL AMOUNTS ARE STATED IN CDN $ (UNLESS NOTED) Cameco (TSX:CCO) (NYSE:CCJ) today reported its consolidated financial and operating results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2015 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). \"Our results for the quarter and the first nine months are as expected\" said Tim Gitzel, president and CEO, \"with a higher proportion of our deliveries scheduled for the fourth quarter. \"We've continued to see the oversupply in the market impacting demand and price, and while we can't control the pace of industry recovery, we can ensure that our company is ready at each step along the way. Our positive long-term view has not changed, so today that means preparing for the demand-driven market we see coming, by keeping our costs down and operating our mines safely and efficiently. Those mines continue to return excellent results, particularly Cigar Lake, which has already exceeded our 2015 production target range. The Cigar Lake operation, along with our other world-class assets, are at the core of our strategy to enhance our operating leverage and maintain the flexibility needed to respond quickly as the market improves.\" THIRD QUARTER Net losses attributable to equity holders this quarter were $4 million ($0.01 per share diluted) compared to net losses of $146 million ($0.37 per share diluted) in the third quarter of 2014. In addition to the items noted below, our net losses were affected by mark-to-market losses on foreign exchange derivatives. Net losses in the third quarter of 2014 included the impairment of our investment in GE-Hitachi Global Laser Enrichment of $184 million and the impairment of our investment in GoviEx Uranium Inc. of $12 million. On an adjusted basis, our earnings this quarter were $78 million ($0.20 per share diluted) compared to earnings of $93 million ($0.23 per share diluted) (non-IFRS measure, see section) in the third quarter of 2014. The change was mainly due to: lower gross profit from our uranium segment lower tax recovery partially offset by: higher gross profit from our fuel services and NUKEM segments FIRST NINE MONTHS Net earnings in the first nine months of the year were $75 million ($0.19 per share diluted) compared to earnings of $113 million ($0.28 per share diluted) in the first nine months of 2014. In addition to the items noted below, our net earnings were affected by mark-to-market losses on foreign exchange derivatives. Our 2014 earnings also included a gain on the sale of our interest in BPLP of $127 million, the impairment of our investment in GE-Hitachi Global Laser Enrichment of $184 million and the impairment of our investment in GoviEx Uranium Inc. of $12 million. On an adjusted basis, our earnings for the first nine months of this year were $193 million ($0.49 per share diluted) compared to earnings of $207 million ($0.52 per share diluted) (non-IFRS measure, see section) for the first nine months of 2014. Key variances include: lower gross profit from our uranium segment higher administration costs a favourable settlement of $28 million with respect to a dispute regarding a long-term supply contract with a utility customer recorded in the second quarter of 2014 lower tax recovery Partially offset by: higher gross profit from our fuel services and NUKEM segments lower losses from equity accounted investments Our 2014 adjusted net earnings were also impacted by: an early termination fee of $18 million incurred in 2014 as a result of the cancellation of our toll conversion agreement with Springfields Fuels Ltd., which was to expire in 2016 settlement costs of $12 million with respect to the early redemption our Series C debentures recorded in 2014 Uranium market update In the third quarter, there was no significant change to the market in terms of contract volumes or price. Quantities transacted in the spot market were at normal levels, and spot prices remained in the mid-$30s (US). This is in keeping with the rest of the year so far, and is, we believe, simply a function of the currently over-supplied market. Reactor restarts in Japan remain an important driver of market sentiment in the short term, and the first of these were finally realized: Kyushu's Sendai unit 1 restarted in August and unit 2 in mid-October. Three additional reactors have been approved by the regulator to restart, and twenty more applications await decisions. We remain confident that a significant number of units will be restarted in Japan over time, though the regulatory approval process and restart schedules are clearly hard to predict. Longer term, strong fundamentals underpin a positive outlook for the industry. The 65 reactors under construction today and additional units planned over the next decade means increasing uranium demand as those reactors come online. As future supply continues to be negatively affected by current depressed market conditions, we expect to see a shift from the currently over-supplied market we are experiencing today to a demand-driven market that requires more primary supply. Demand growth combined with the timing, development and execution of new supply projects and the continued performance of existing supply, will determine the pace of that shift. Caution about forward-looking information relating to our uranium market update This discussion of our expectations for the nuclear industry, including its growth profile, future global uranium supply and demand is forward-looking information that is based upon the assumptions and subject to the material risks discussed under the heading Caution about forward-looking information below. Outlook for 2015 Our strategy is to profitably produce at a pace aligned with market signals, while maintaining the ability to respond to conditions as they evolve. Our outlook for 2015 reflects the expenditures necessary to help us achieve our strategy. Our outlook for uranium production, uranium, fuel services and NUKEM revenue, NUKEM unit cost, consolidated tax rate, and capital expenditures has changed. We do not provide an outlook for the items in the table that are marked with a dash. 2015 FINANCIAL OUTLOOK Our 2015 outlook for sales volume does not include sales between our uranium, fuel services and NUKEM segments. For comparison of our 2015 outlook and 2014 results for revenue, we do not include sales between our uranium, fuel services and NUKEM segments. Based on a uranium spot price of $36.50 (US) per pound (the Ux spot price as of October 26, 2015), a long-term price indicator of $44.00 (US) per pound (the Ux long-term indicator on October 26, 2015) and an exchange rate of $1.00 (US) for $1.25 (Cdn). This increase is based on the unit cost of sale for produced material and committed long-term purchases. If we make discretionary purchases in the remainder of 2015, then we expect the overall unit cost of sales to increase further. Direct administration costs do not include stock-based compensation expenses. Our outlook for the tax rate is based on adjusted net earnings. We have increased our uranium production outlook to 27.3 million pounds U3O8 (previously between 25.3 million and 26.3 million pounds) to reflect the higher expected production from Cigar Lake/McClean Lake. See Uranium 2015 Q3 updates below for more information. Our outlook for uranium revenue and for fuel services revenue have both changed to an increase of 5% to 10% in each segment (previously an increase up to 5% in each) due to the effects of foreign exchange. We have also adjusted our outlook for NUKEM revenue to an increase of 30% to 35% (previously an increase of 20% to 25%) due to the effects of foreign exchange; however, the higher revenue expectation is largely offset by our adjusted outlook for NUKEM unit cost of sales, which is now expected to increase 15% to 20% (previously an increase of 5% to 10%), also due to the effects of foreign exchange. We have adjusted our outlook for the consolidated tax rate to a recovery of 25% to 30% (previously 40% to 45%) due to the expected impact of the changes to our revenue outlook noted above, and a change in the distribution of earnings between jurisdictions. We now expect capital expenditures to be $385 million (previously $405 million). The decrease is primarily due to the timing of expenditures on projects at Key Lake and McArthur River, as well as a reduction in planned spending at Cigar Lake due to changes in the mine plan, slightly offset by increased costs at Inkai and our US operations due to the effect of foreign exchange. REVENUE AND EARNINGS SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS For the rest of 2015: an increase of $5 (US) per pound in both the Ux spot price ($36.50 (US) per pound on October 26, 2015) and the Ux long-term price indicator ($44.00 (US) per pound on October 26, 2015) would increase revenue by $22 million and net earnings by $12 million. Conversely, a decrease of $5 (US) per pound would decrease revenue by $19 million and net earnings by $9 million. a one-cent change in the value of the Canadian dollar versus the US dollar would change adjusted net earnings by $3 million, with a decrease in the value of the Canadian dollar versus the US dollar having a positive impact ADJUSTED NET EARNINGS (NON-IFRS MEASURE) Adjusted net earnings are a measure that does not have a standardized meaning or a consistent basis of calculation under IFRS (non-IFRS measure). We use this measure as a more meaningful way to compare our financial performance from period to period. We believe that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, certain investors use this information to evaluate our performance. Adjusted net earnings are our net earnings attributable to equity holders, adjusted to better reflect the underlying financial performance for the reporting period. The adjusted earnings measure reflects the matching of the net benefits of our hedging program with the inflows of foreign currencies in the applicable reporting period, and has also been adjusted for NUKEM purchase price inventory write-downs and recoveries, income taxes on adjustments, impairment charges on non-producing property, and the after tax gain on the sale of our interest in BPLP. Adjusted net earnings are non-standard supplemental information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information prepared according to accounting standards. Other companies may calculate this measure differently, so you may not be able to make a direct comparison to similar measures presented by other companies. Discontinued operation On March 27, 2014, we completed the sale of our 31.6% limited partnership interest in BPLP, which was accounted for effective January 1, 2014. The aggregate sale price for our interest in BPLP and certain related entities was $450 million. We realized an after tax gain of $127 million on this divestiture. As a result of the transaction, we presented the results of BPLP as a discontinued operation and we revised our statement of earnings, statement of comprehensive income and statement of cash flows to reflect the change in presentation. See note 4 to the interim financial statements for more information. TRANSFER PRICING DISPUTES We have been reporting on our transfer pricing disputes with Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) since 2008, when it originated, and with the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) since the first quarter of 2015. Below, we discuss the general nature of transfer pricing disputes and, more specifically, the ongoing disputes we have. Transfer pricing is a complex area of tax law, and it is difficult to predict the outcome of cases like ours. However, tax authorities generally test two things: the governance (structure) of the corporate entities involved in the transactions the price at which goods and services are sold by one member of a corporate group to another We have a global customer base and we established a marketing and trading structure involving foreign subsidiaries, including Cameco Europe Limited (CEL), which entered into various intercompany arrangements, including purchase and sale agreements, as well as uranium purchase and sale agreements with third parties. Cameco and its subsidiaries made reasonable efforts to put arm's length transfer pricing arrangements in place, and these arrangements expose the parties to the risks and rewards accruing to them under these contracts. The intercompany contract prices are generally comparable to those established in comparable contracts between arm's-length parties entered into at that time. For the years 2003 to 2009, CRA has shifted CEL's income (as re-calculated by CRA) back to Canada and applied statutory tax rates, interest and instalment penalties, and, from 2007 to 2009, transfer pricing penalties. The IRS also allocated a portion of CEL's income for 2009 to the US, resulting in such income being taxed in multiple jurisdictions. Taxes of approximately $290 million for the 2003 - 2014 years have already been paid in a jurisdiction outside Canada and the US. Bilateral international tax treaties contain provisions that generally seek to prevent taxation of the same income in both countries. As such, in connection with these disputes, we are considering our options including remedies under international tax treaties that would limit double taxation; however, there is a risk that we will not be successful in eliminating all potential double taxation. The expected income adjustments under our tax disputes are represented by the amounts claimed by CRA and IRS and are described below. CRA dispute Since 2008, CRA has disputed our corporate structure and the related transfer pricing methodology we used for certain intercompany uranium sale and purchase agreements, and issued notices of reassessment for our 2003 through 2009 tax returns. We have recorded a cumulative tax provision of $92 million, where an argument could be made that our transfer price may have fallen outside of an appropriate range of pricing in uranium contracts for the period from 2003 through September 30, 2015. We are confident that we will be successful in our case and continue to believe the ultimate resolution of this matter will not be material to our financial position, results of operations and cash flows in the year(s) of resolution. For the years 2003 through 2009, CRA issued notices of reassessment for approximately $2.8 billion of additional income for Canadian tax purposes, which would result in a related tax expense of about $820 million. We expect to receive the reassessment for 2010 in the fourth quarter. CRA has also issued notices of reassessment for transfer pricing penalties for the years 2007 through 2009 in the amount of $229 million. The Canadian income tax rules include provisions that require larger companies like us to remit 50% of the cash tax plus related interest and penalties at the time of reassessment. To date, under these provisions, after applying elective deductions and tax loss carryovers, we have paid a net amount of $229 million cash to the Government of Canada, which includes the amounts shown in the table below.  These amounts do not include interest and instalment penalties, which totalled approximately $70 million to September 30, 2015. In light of our view of the likely outcome of the case as described above, we expect to recover the amounts remitted to the Government of Canada, including the $229 million already paid to date. We are expecting the trial for the 2003, 2005 and 2006 reassessments to commence during the week of September 26, 2016 and to conclude within four months thereafter. If this timing is adhered to, we expect to receive a Tax Court decision within six to 18 months after the trial is complete. IRS dispute In the first quarter, we received a Revenue Agent's Report (RAR) from the IRS challenging the transfer pricing used under certain intercompany transactions pertaining to the 2009 tax year for certain of our US subsidiaries. The RAR lists the adjustments proposed by the IRS and calculates the tax and any penalties owing based on the proposed adjustments. The current position of the IRS is that a portion of the non-US income reported under our corporate structure and taxed in non-US jurisdictions should be recognized and taxed in the US on the basis that: the prices received by our US mining subsidiaries for the sale of uranium to CEL are too low the compensation being earned by Cameco Inc., one of our US subsidiaries, is inadequate The proposed adjustments result in an increase in taxable income in the US of approximately $108 million (US) and a corresponding increased income tax expense of approximately $32 million (US) for the 2009 taxation year, with interest being charged thereon. In addition, the IRS proposed penalties of approximately $7 million (US) in respect of the adjustment. At present, the RAR pertains only to the 2009 tax year; however, the IRS is also auditing our tax returns for 2010 through 2012 on a similar basis and we expect adjustments in these years to be similar to those made for 2009. If the IRS audits years subsequent to 2012 on a similar basis, we expect these proposed adjustments would also be similar to those made for 2009. We believe that the conclusions of the IRS in the RAR are incorrect and we are contesting them in an administrative appeal, during which we are not required to make any cash payments. At present, this matter is still at an early stage and, until this matter progresses further, we cannot provide an estimation of the likely timeline for a resolution of the dispute. We believe that the ultimate resolution of this matter will not be material to our financial position, results of operations and cash flows in the year(s) of resolution. Caution about forward-looking information relating to our CRA and IRS tax disputes This discussion of our expectations relating to our tax disputes with CRA and IRS and future tax reassessments by CRA and IRS is forward-looking information that is based upon the assumptions and subject to the material risks discussed under the heading Caution about forward-looking information below and also on the more specific assumptions and risks listed below. Actual outcomes may vary significantly. Assumptions CRA will reassess us for the years 2010 through 2014 using a similar methodology as for the years 2003 through 2009, and the reassessments will be issued on the basis we expect we will be able to apply elective deductions to the extent anticipated we will be able to utilize letters of credit to the extent anticipated CRA will seek to impose transfer pricing penalties (in a manner consistent with penalties charged in the years 2007 through 2009) in addition to interest charges and instalment penalties we will be substantially successful in our dispute with CRA and the cumulative tax provision of $92 million to date will be adequate to satisfy any tax liability resulting from the outcome of the dispute to date IRS will continue to propose adjustments for the years 2010 through 2012 and may propose adjustments for later years we will be substantially successful in our dispute with IRS Material risks that could cause actual results to differ materially CRA reassesses us for years 2010 through 2014 using a different methodology than for years 2003 through 2009, or we are unable to apply elective deductions or utilize letters of credit to the same extent as anticipated, resulting in the required cash payments to CRA pending the outcome of the dispute being higher than expected the time lag for the reassessments for each year is different than we currently expect we are unsuccessful and the outcomes of our dispute with CRA and/or IRS result in significantly higher cash taxes, interest charges and penalties than the amount of our cumulative tax provision, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial position, results of operations and cash flows cash tax payable increases due to unanticipated adjustments by CRA or IRS not related to transfer pricing IRS proposes adjustments for years 2010 through 2014 using a different methodology than for 2009 we are unable to effectively eliminate all double taxation THIRD QUARTER Production volumes this quarter were 52% higher compared to the third quarter of 2014, mainly due to production from Cigar Lake and higher production from McArthur River/Key Lake, Rabbit Lake and Inkai, which was partially offset by lower production at our US operations. SeeUranium 2015 Q3 updates below for more information. The 13% decrease in uranium revenues was a result of a 23% decrease in sales volume, partially offset by a 13% increase in the Canadian dollar average realized price. The US dollar average realized price decreased by 5% compared to 2014 mainly due to lower prices on fixed price contracts, while the higher Canadian dollar realized prices this quarter were a result of the weakening of the Canadian dollar compared to 2014. This quarter the exchange rate on the average realized price was $1.00 (US) for $1.29 (Cdn) compared to $1.00 (US) for $1.09 (Cdn) in the third quarter of 2014. Total cost of sales (including D&A) decreased by 12% ($278 million compared to $315 million in 2014) due to a 23% decrease in sales volume, partially offset by a 14% increase in the unit cost of sales. The increase in the unit cost of sales was mainly the result of an increase in the volume of material purchased in the quarter at prices higher than our average cost of inventory and an increase in unit production costs related to the addition of higher cost production from Cigar Lake during ramp up. The net effect was a $22 million decrease in gross profit for the quarter. FIRST NINE MONTHS Production volumes for the first nine months of the year were 24% higher than in the previous year due to the addition of production from Cigar Lake and higher production at McArthur/Key Lake, and Rabbit Lake, partially offset by lower production at our US operations. SeeUranium 2015 Q3 updates below for more information. Uranium revenues increased 1% compared to the first nine months of 2014 due to an 11% increase in the Canadian dollar average realized price, partially offset by a 9% decrease in sales volumes in the first nine months. In our uranium and fuel services segments, our customers choose when in the year to receive deliveries, so our quarterly delivery patterns, sales volumes and revenue can vary significantly. We are on track to meet our 2015 uranium sales targets, and, therefore, expect to deliver between 10 million and 12 million pounds in the fourth quarter. Our Canadian dollar realized prices for the first nine months of 2015 were higher than 2014, primarily as a result of the weakening of the Canadian dollar compared to 2014. For the first nine months of 2015, the exchange rate on the average realized price was $1.00 (US) for $1.25 (Cdn) compared to $1.00 (US) for $1.09 (Cdn) for the same period in 2014. Total cost of sales (including D&A) increased by 2% ($829 million compared to $810 million in 2014) mainly due to a 12% increase in the unit cost of sales, partially offset by a 9% decrease in sales volume for the first nine months. The increase in the unit cost of sales was mainly the result of an increase in the volume of material purchased in the first nine months at prices higher than our average cost of inventory, and an increase in unit production costs related to the addition of higher cost production from Cigar Lake during rampup. The net effect was a $12 million decrease in gross profit for the first nine months. We are active in the uranium market, buying and selling uranium on the spot market and under long-term contracts when we expect it will be beneficial for us. Purchases are impacted by foreign exchange rates, and may, in some cases, require we pay prices higher or lower than current spot prices. Depending on the volume and unit cost of purchases in a quarter, our average cost of inventory can be impacted, which flows through to our cost of sales. The table below shows the costs of produced and purchased uranium incurred in the reporting periods (which are non-IFRS measures, see the paragraphs below the table). These costs do not include selling costs such as royalties, transportation and commissions, nor do they reflect the impact of opening inventories on our reported cost of sales. This quarter, cash costs of purchased material were $37.78 US per pound compared to $27.98 US per pound in the same period in 2014. In the third quarter the exchange rate on purchases averaged $1.00 (US) for $1.25 (Cdn) compared to $1.00 (US) for $1.10 (Cdn) in the third quarter of 2014. For the first nine months, cash costs of purchased material were $37.51 US per pound compared to $33.89 per lb in the same period in 2014. For the first nine months of 2015, the exchange rate on purchases averaged $1.00 (US) for $1.25 (Cdn) compared to $1.00 (US) for $1.10 (Cdn) for the same period in 2014. Cash cost per pound, non-cash cost per pound and total cost per pound for produced and purchased uranium presented in the above table are non-IFRS measures. These measures do not have a standardized meaning or a consistent basis of calculation under IFRS. We use these measures in our assessment of the performance of our uranium business. We believe that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, certain investors use this information to evaluate our performance and ability to generate cash flow. These measures are non-standard supplemental information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared according to accounting standards. These measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under IFRS. Other companies may calculate these measures differently, so you may not be able to make a direct comparison to similar measures presented by other companies. To facilitate a better understanding of these measures, the following table presents a reconciliation of these measures to our unit cost of sales for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2015 and 2014. Fuel services THIRD QUARTER Total revenue for the third quarter of 2015 increased to $83 million from $71 million for the same period last year. A 23% increase in sales volumes was partially offset by a 4% decrease in average realized price, primarily due to the mix of products sold, partially offset by the weakening of the Canadian dollar compared to 2014. The total cost of products and services sold (including D&A) increased by 6% ($70 million compared to $66 million in the third quarter of 2014) due to the increase in sales volumes, partially offset by a decrease in the average unit cost of sales. When compared to 2014, the average unit cost of sales was 13% lower due to the mix of fuel services products sold, partially offset by higher production costs. The net effect was an $8 million increase in gross profit. FIRST NINE MONTHS In the first nine months of the year, total revenue increased by 21% due to an 11% increase in sales volumes and a 9% increase in realized price that was the result of the weakening of the Canadian dollar and the mix of products sold. The total cost of sales (including D&A) increased 13% ($180 million compared to $159 million in 2014) due to an increase in sales volume and a 1% increase in the average unit cost of sales, which resulted from increased production costs, partially offset by the mix of fuel services products sold. The net effect was a $17 million increase in gross profit. NUKEM Includes sales and revenue between our uranium, fuel services and NUKEM segments (130,000 pounds in sales and revenue of $6.0 million in Q3, 2015, nil in Q3, 2014; 873,000 pounds in sales and revenue of $19.3 million in the first nine months of 2015, nil in the first nine months of 2014). THIRD QUARTER During the third quarter of 2015, NUKEM delivered 2.9 million pounds of uranium, an increase of 16% from the same period last year. Total revenues increased by 89% as a result of higher sales volumes and average realized prices which were 37% higher than those realized in the third quarter of 2014. Gross profit percentage was 8% in the third quarter of 2015, a slight increase from 9% recorded in the third quarter of 2014. The allocation of the historic purchase price to the sale of inventory on hand at the time of acquisition of NUKEM, impacted margins for the quarter. The net effect was a $5 million increase in gross profit. FIRST NINE MONTHS During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, NUKEM delivered 6.9 million pounds of uranium, an increase of 47%, due to timing of customer requirements and generally lower activity in the market during 2014. Total revenues increased 90% due to a 47% increase in sales volumes and an 18% increase in average realized price. Gross profit percentage was 10% for the first nine months of 2015, unchanged from the same period in 2014. Included in the 2014 margin was a $6 million write-down of inventory compared to a $3 million recovery in 2015. The write-down in 2014 was a result of a decline in the spot price during the period. The net effect was a $16 million increase in gross profit. Uranium 2015 Q3 updates MCARTHUR RIVER/KEY LAKE Production for the quarter was 26% higher compared to the same period last year and 6% higher for the first nine months due to the timing of mill maintenance. At Key Lake, commissioning of the new calciner is underway and expected to be complete by year end. The existing calciner circuit will remain in place until operational reliability of the new calciner is achieved. The operation remains on track to achieve our planned 2015 production; however, operational tie-ins of the new calciner will require brief production outages in the fourth quarter, and the output of the mill will be sensitive to the performance of the calciners. CIGAR LAKE During the third quarter, Cigar Lake packaged approximately 3.6 million pounds (100% basis, 1.8 million pounds our share) for total production of 6.7 million pounds (100% basis, 3.3 million pounds our share) to the end of September. As of the end of October, the mill has packaged over 8 million pounds (100% basis) and exceeded the 2015 production target range. If production continues at current rates, the McClean Lake mill could produce more than 10 million packaged pounds of uranium (100% basis, 5 million pounds our share) from Cigar Lake in 2015. As we ramp up production to 18 million pounds (100% basis) by 2018, volumes may not be linear year-to-year, but will vary based on our operational experience. To ensure the most efficient operation of the mine and mill throughout the year, we expect to continually manage ore supply and, therefore, may halt and resume mining several times during a quarter without impacting planned annual production. INKAI Production for the quarter was 25% higher compared to the same period last year due to the timing of new wellfield development. Production remains unchanged for the first nine months of the year compared to the same periods in 2014. The operation remains on track to achieve our planned 2015 production.

FNV) Franco-Nevada is the leading gold-focused royalty and stream company by both gold revenues and number of gold assets. The Company is gold-focused but also has the largest and most diversified portfolio of royalties and streams by commodity, geography, revenue type and stage of project. The portfolio is actively managed with the aim to maintain over 80% of revenue from precious metals (gold, silver & PGM). The Company does not operate mines, develop projects or conduct exploration. Franco-Nevada's business model is focused on managing and growing its portfolio of royalties and streams. The advantages of this business model are: Market Exposure to the gold price and exploration optionality; Limited exposure to many of the risks associated with operating companies; A free cash-flow business with limited cash calls; A high-margin business that can generate cash through the entire commodity cycle; A scalable and diversified business in which a large number of assets can be managed with a small stable overhead; A forward-looking business in which management focuses on growth opportunities rather than operational or development issues; and A perpetual discovery option over large areas of geologically prospective lands with no cost other than the initial investment. Franco-Nevada's financial results in the short-term are primarily tied to the price of commodities and the amount of production from its portfolio of producing assets. From time to time, financial results are also supplemented by acquisitions of new producing assets. Over the longer-term, results are impacted by the availability of exploration and development capital applied by other companies to advance Franco-Nevada's advanced and exploration assets into production. Franco-Nevada has a long-term focus in making its investments and recognizes it is in a cyclical industry. Franco-Nevada has historically operated by maintaining a strong balance sheet so that it can make investments during commodity cycle downturns. At year-end 2014, Franco-Nevada had $677.8 million in working capital and an undrawn $500.0 million unsecured credit facility. Franco-Nevada's shares are listed on the Toronto and New York stock exchanges under the symbol FNV. An investment in Franco-Nevada's shares is expected to provide investors with yield and more upside than gold ETF without exposure to operating cost inflation. Since its IPO over seven years ago, Franco-Nevada's share price has outperformed the gold price and all relevant gold equity benchmarks. Franco-Nevada Reports Q3 2015 Results and Declares Quarterly Dividend TORONTO, November 11, 2015 - Franco-Nevada Corporation (TSX: FNV; NYSE: FNV) today reported third quarter 2015 financial results realizing 85,637 Gold Equivalent Ounces (\"GEOs\")1 from its mineral assets and $7.8 million in revenue from its oil & gas assets. Net Income and Adjusted Net Income2 were $15.2 million, or $0.10 per share, and $19.4 million, or $0.12 per share, respectively, with Adjusted EBITDA3 being $78.0 million, or $0.50 per share. Prepared in accordance with IFRS and presented in U.S. dollars (unless otherwise noted). \"Franco-Nevada's diversified portfolio continues to perform well,\" said David Harquail, CEO. \"It is significant that these results are before any contributions from our $610 million Antamina silver stream investment which closed in October. We expect to begin recording revenues from the sale of ounces from Antamina in Q4 2015. Also, in November we began funding our gold and silver stream investment in the Cobre Panama project which we expect will be ramping up production in 2018. Franco-Nevada now has net debt of approximately $330 million, an undrawn credit facility of $270 million and remains well-positioned to continue to add to its portfolio.\" Revenues and GEOs by Asset Categories For the third quarter of 2015, revenue was earned 90% from precious metals (83% gold and 7% PGM) and 79% from the Americas (19% U.S., 23% Canada and 37% Latin America). Costs and expenses were impacted by higher depletion expense and costs of sales due to the Candelaria acquisition. Oil & gas production levels were stable with the associated oil & gas revenue decreasing significantly year over year due to lower average oil & gas prices in 2015. Cash provided by operating activities before changes to working capital was $72.4 million. Corporate Updates Antamina: On October 9, 2015, Franco-Nevada closed the previously announced Antamina silver stream with Teck Resources Limited by providing a $610.0 million upfront payment. The payment was funded through a combination of cash on hand and a partial draw of the Company's credit facility. Antamina is expected to contribute between 900,000 to 1,100,000 silver ounces (12,300 to 15,000 GEOs) in Q4 2015. Cobre Panama: Franco-Nevada and First Quantum finalized terms of a replacement precious metals stream agreement on the Cobre Panama project. On November 3, 2015, Franco-Nevada made a $337.9 million initial upfront payment under its $1.0 billion commitment which was funded through cash on hand and proceeds from a partial draw of its credit facility. Credit Facility: Franco-Nevada has entered into an agreement to increase its credit facility to $1.0 billion while maintaining a $250.0 million accordion and extending the maturity to November 2020. Closing is expected to occur prior to the end of November. Portfolio Updates Gold - U.S.: GEOs from U.S. gold assets increased to 14,618 GEOs mainly due to higher production at Goldstrike, Bald Mountain and Gold Quarry, partially offset by lower production at Marigold and fewer ounces under the Fire Creek/Midas fixed deliveries due to a reduction of the monthly ounce obligation in 2015 compared to 2014. Klondex Mines released an updated Mineral Resource estimate for its Midas Mine and Fire Creek project and announced positive drill results from recent underground and surface drilling at its Midas Mine. Gold - Canada: GEOs from Canadian assets decreased in the quarter due to lower production at Hemlo and Sudbury. In Ontario, Lake Shore Gold and Kirkland Lake Gold both announced positive drill results at their respective projects where Franco-Nevada holds various interests. Pretium Resources announced a $540 million construction financing package for its Brucejack project where Franco-Nevada has a 1.2% NSR. At the Phoenix gold project, where Franco-Nevada holds a 2% NSR, Rubicon Minerals announced the temporary suspension of underground activities while it reviews its geological model and develops an implementation plan Gold - Latin America: Candelaria had a strong quarter delivering 19,081 GEOs to Franco-Nevada. During the quarter, Lundin Mining released an updated mine plan for Candelaria which reflected a 26% increase in precious metal production over the next four years. Under the Guadalupe stream agreement, Franco-Nevada funded $4.0 million during the quarter and the final instalment of $8.0 million subsequent to the quarter. Gold - Rest of World: Contributions from Sabodala and Mine Waste Solutions represented approximately 60% of the total GEOs received from Rest of World gold assets for Q3 2015. True Gold announced the commencement of mining at its Karma project and remains on track for gold production at the end of Q1 2016. Franco-Nevada funded $10.4 million in the quarter and $9.7 million subsequent to the quarter under the Karma stream agreement bringing the total funded to $63.4 million. Perseus Mining announced it had signed a Mining Convention with the Ivorian government on its Sissingue project and expects to make a production decision in the fourth quarter of 2015. PGM: PGM GEOs were impacted by declining palladium and platinum prices relative to gold in the quarter. Oil & gas: Revenue from oil & gas assets was $7.8 million in Q3 2015 with similar production levels as Q3 2014. The decrease in revenue is the result of lower average oil & gas prices. On November 6, 2015, Franco-Nevada acquired an additional 0.29% working interest in the Weyburn Unit for C$6.2 million. Dividend Declaration Franco-Nevada is pleased to announce that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.21 per share. The dividend will be paid on December 17, 2015 to shareholders of record on December 3, 2015.

Goldcorp Delivers Strong Free Cash Flow as Third Quarter Gold Production Increases 42% October 29, 2015 (All amounts in $US unless stated otherwise) VANCOUVER, Oct. 29, 2015 /CNW/ - GOLDCORP INC. (TSX: G, NYSE: GG) today reported record third quarter gold production1 of 922,200 ounces, an increase of 42% compared to gold production of 651,700 ounces in the third quarter of 2014. Adjusted quarterly revenues1 were $1.3 billion. Adjusted operating cash flow1,2 was $374 million, compared to $399 million for the third quarter of 2014. Free cash flow3 was $243 million, compared to negative free cash flow of $355 million for the third quarter of 2014. The reported net loss attributable to shareholders of Goldcorp for the quarter was $192 million, or $0.23 per share, compared to a net loss of $44 million, or $0.05 per share, for the third quarter of 2014. The adjusted net loss1,4 was $37 million, or $0.04 per share, compared to adjusted net earnings of $70 million, or $0.09 per share, for the third quarter of 2014. Included in the adjusted net loss is a reduction in the carrying values of inventory stockpiles of $40 million, or $0.05 per share. Third Quarter 2015 Highlights Gold sales1 of 942,600 ounces; gold production of 922,200 ounces. Free cash flow of $243 million before dividends; $168 million after dividends. Revolving credit facility fully repaid. Adjusted revenues of $1.3 billion. All-in sustaining costs1,5 of $848 per ounce. Adjusted operating cash flow of $374 million. Adjusted net loss of $37 million, or $0.04 per share. 2015 production and cost guidance re-confirmed. Announced joint venture (50/50) with Teck Resources Limited (\"Teck\") to combine El Morro and Relincho projects into a single project. \"Our third quarter results highlight the essence of Goldcorp's investment proposition: growing gold production, declining all-in sustaining costs and decreasing capital spending resulting in strong, sustained free cash flow, despite lower metals prices,\" said Chuck Jeannes, Goldcorp President and Chief Executive Officer. \"Record quarterly gold production, successful cost containment efforts and the wind-down of a capital investment program that has brought two high-quality gold mines into commercial production this year contributed to quarterly free cash flow of $243 million. The benefit of managing a strong portfolio of mines was illustrated in the quarter as good results at Penasquito, Cerro Negro and Musselwhite more than offset lower-than-expected production from Eleonore as the mine continues to ramp up. As a result, we remain on track to meet the upper end of our production guidance of between 3.3 and 3.6 million ounces at all-in sustaining costs of between $850 and $900 per ounce. Our focus over the balance of 2015 and into 2016 is on vigilant management of our costs in the current gold price environment, successful replacement of mined gold reserves and the prudent allocation of free cash flow to fortify our already-strong balance sheet and fund the next wave of Goldcorp's promising organic growth opportunities.\" Financial Review Third quarter gold sales were 942,600 ounces at an average realized gold price of $1,114per ounce on production of 922,200 ounces, compared to sales of 641,400 ounces at an average realized gold price of $1,266 per ounce on production of 651,700 ounces for the third quarter of 2014. Silver production totaled 11.3 million ounces compared to 7.8 million ounces in the prior year's third quarter. All-in sustaining costs were $848 per ounce of gold for the third quarter of 2015 compared to $1,066 per ounce in the third quarter of 2014. Excluding non-cash inventory impairments at Los Filos and Penasquito, all-in sustaining costs for the third quarter of 2015 would have been $802 per ounce. Adjusted revenues for the third quarter totaled $1.3 billion. The reported net loss attributable to shareholders of Goldcorp for the third quarter was $192 million, or $0.23 per share, compared to a net loss of $44 million, or $0.05 per share, for the third quarter of 2014. Adjusted net loss for the third quarter totaled $37 million, or $0.04 per share, compared to adjusted net earnings of $70 million, or $0.09 per share, for the third quarter of 2014. The adjusted net loss for the third quarter of 2015 primarily excludes the unrealized losses from the foreign exchange translation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities ($158 million, or $0.19 per share). The adjusted net loss includes the impact of non-cash stock-based compensation expenses which amounted to approximately $14 million, or $0.02 per share, for the quarter. Adjusted operating cash flow for the third quarter was $374 million, compared to $399 million for the third quarter of 2014. Canada At Eleonore in Quebec, third quarter safe gold production totaled 86,700 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $974 per ounce. Production increased over the prior quarter as a result of the expansion of underground mining from two to four horizons, in addition to successful mine optimization initiatives. Stoping productivity and mining flexibility continued to improve, contributing to higher underground mine tonnage quarter over quarter. Throughput during the quarter averaged 6,500 tonnes per day. While recoveries in the third quarter were impacted by the presence of iron sulphides in certain production stopes, metallurgical studies are underway that are expected to minimize the effect on future recoveries. As previously reported on September 8, 2015, initial production stopes at Eleonore are encountering folding and faulting resulting in higher dilution and therefore lower than planned mined grades and gold production. The folding is of varying intensities and is estimated to affect approximately 10% of the overall Eleonore deposit. The Eleonore team continues to work on adjusting stope designs to minimize these impacts. Work on the Eleonore crown pillar pre-feasibility study continued to advance during the third quarter. Major activities included the successful completion of summer field work, underground and surface infrastructure and stope sequencing determination of the dike location, and permitting and stakeholder engagement efforts. The pre-feasibility study is on track to be completed by the end of 2015. Safe gold production at Red Lake in Ontario in the third quarter totaled 77,600 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $1,028 per ounce. Production decreased over the prior quarter as a result of lower grades from remnant pillar mining at the Campbell Complex, the acceleration of development in the Sulphide Zones and lower-than-expected grades in the Footwall Zone. An exploration drift to access the HG Young discovery at depth continued to advance north on the 14 Level at the Campbell Complex. The drift provides a new platform for follow-up drilling down plunge of positive intercepts from the ongoing surface exploration program at HG Young. At Cochenour, exploration drilling continued to assess the core area of the deposit as well as at the tram level, where there have been changes in the orientation of the veins from prior interpretations. Detailed interpretation and analysis is ongoing to support final mine planning and infrastructure. Processing of mill feed from the initial sill-development work was consistent with expectations. Work is ongoing to define the timing of initial stope production and ramp up of Cochenour feed for processing at Red Lake. At Porcupine in Ontario, safe gold production for the third quarter was 71,000 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $882 per ounce. Production decreased over the prior quarter due to lower gold grades, driven primarily by the mining of lower-grade stopes at the Hoyle Pond underground, partially offset by higher tonnage milled as a result of improved mill operations during the quarter. The Hoyle Deep project, which will enable efficient access to lower portions of the Hoyle Pond deposit, continued to progress and remains on track to be fully operational in the first quarter of 2016. At the Hollinger open pit, the environmental control berm was completed in mid-October, enabling mining to take place 24 hours a day. At the Borden project 160 kilometres west of Porcupine, studies are underway to determine the optimization of a combined Borden-Porcupine operation. Options to access the deposit from underground are currently being evaluated in preparation for permit applications. Surface diamond drilling continued during the third quarter with seven drills on site. The current exploration activity in this new gold district remains focused on in-fill drilling with a target to convert a portion of the resources into reserves at the end of 2015. Safe gold production at Musselwhite in Ontario increased over the prior quarter to 71,000 ounces as a result of higher mill throughput and increased grades. Musselwhite's all-in sustaining cost continued to be among the lowest in the portfolio at $697 per ounce. The focus of the exploration program during the third quarter was on reserve replacement. Drilling concluded late in the third quarter on the West Limb zone and the Upper Lynx zone with positive results showing continuity of mineralization in both areas. All critical exploration development for the year is complete. Latin America At Penasquito in Mexico, safe gold production totaled 236,800 ounces for the quarter at an all-in sustaining cost of $467 per ounce. Production was driven primarily by higher gold grades in sulphide as a result of positive model reconciliation. In light of continued strong performance, production at Penasquito will exceed 2015 guidance of between 700,000 and 750,000 ounces. Construction of the Northern Well Field (\"NWF\") remained suspended throughout the third quarter of 2015 due to an illegal blockade by a local community. Penasquito continues to seek a fair resolution of this matter with the community, while taking steps to enforce its contractual rights. Penasquito is also advancing alternatives for completion of the project without crossing through the affected community lands. Contingency planning is ongoing for fresh water supply to the Penasquito mine until the NWF project is operational. The Company believes that there will be timely resolution of this matter to meet the future water needs of Penasquito. The Metallurgical Enhancement Project (\"MEP\") feasibility study continued, which included completion of pilot testing, confirming capital estimates and concentrate marketing studies. The feasibility study remains on schedule to be completed in early 2016. At the Camino Rojo project, ongoing pre-feasibility study work is focused on the evaluation of Camino Rojo as a supplemental source of sulphide feed to the existing Penasquito facility, in addition to a smaller, stand-alone oxide heap leach facility. An update of the geologic model continued during the third quarter and metallurgical testing of sulphide, transition and oxide zones is ongoing. The pre-feasibility study is on track to be completed in 2016. Safe gold production at Los Filos in Mexico for the third quarter of 2015 totaled 70,300 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $1,442 per ounce. Increased production over the prior quarter was a result of higher ore processed. The 2015 exploration program to enhance deeper phases of the El Bermejal pit and extend high grade zones for underground mining was completed. A new life-of-mine plan is progressing with a focus to maximize return on investment in the current lower price metals environment and is expected to be completed by the end of 2015. At Cerro Negro in Argentina, third quarter safe gold production totaled 135,700 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $731 per ounce, driven by the continued strong ramp-up at both the Mariana Central and Eureka mines. Total tonnes milled increased resulting in an average throughput rate of 3,697 tonnes per day for the quarter. Average milling rates for September surpassed the nameplate capacity of 4,000 tonnes per operating day. Exploration in the third quarter continued to focus on surface resource confirmation drilling. The current drilling program is progressing as planned, expanding resources at the Marianas Complex, particularly at the newly-discovered Emilia vein. The Bajo Negro expansion was completed in the third quarter and the results will be included within the year-end resource update. On September 30, 2015, a work stoppage took place at Cerro Negro by miners represented by the Asociacion Obrera Minera Argentina, Province of Santa Cruz. All work activity resumed on October 5, 2015 following the declaration of a mandatory minimum 15-day conciliation period by the Santa Cruz Provincial Secretariat of Labour. Subsequent to the expiration of the conciliation period productive negotiations continue. The Company remains committed to working cooperatively with union representatives and government authorities on a fair and equitable resolution. At the Pueblo Viejo joint venture in the Dominican Republic, Goldcorp's share of third quarter safe gold and silver production totaled 115,000 ounces and 502,700 ounces, respectively, at an all-in sustaining cost of $585 per ounce. Gold production increased over the prior quarter as a result of higher tonnes processed, grades and recoveries. Silver production increased primarily due to higher recoveries. Tonnage processed was higher in the third quarter due to the prior quarter being impacted by autoclave and counter current decantation thickener maintenance. Silver recoveries were higher due to the shut-down of the lime boil tanks during autoclave maintenance in the prior quarter. At El Morro in Chile, an agreement was reached with Teck on August 27, 2015 to combine the El Morro and Relincho projects into a 50/50 joint venture. In addition, an agreement was reached with New Gold to acquire New Gold's 30% interest in the El Morro project for$90 million in cash upon closing, and a 4% gold stream on future gold production from the El Morro property. Closing of both transactions is expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2015. The project will undertake extensive engagement with communities and other stakeholders to help guide the project's development. In combination with community consultation, a pre-feasibility study is expected to commence in mid-2016. 2015 Guidance Outlook The Company today reconfirmed 2015 production guidance, expected to be at the upper-end of between 3.3 and 3.6 million gold ounces. All-in sustaining costs are expected to be between $850 and $900 per gold ounce; $500 and $550 per ounce on a by-product basis; and $625 to $675 per ounce on a co-product basis. Depreciation, depletion and amortization (\"DD&A\") will increase to $450 per gold ounce from the previous guidance of$425 per gold ounce due primarily to production coming from our newer and higher DD&A per ounce sites and additional assets placed in service earlier than anticipated. Capital spending guidance remains unchanged at between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion for 2015. Corporate administration expense guidance, excluding share-based compensation, is expected to be approximately $170 million in 2015. Excluding the impacts of foreign exchange on current and deferred tax assets and liabilities and excluding the dilution and disposition gains on the sale of mining interests and the related taxes, the Company continues to expect an annual effective tax rate on adjusted earnings subject to income tax of 45% in 2015.

Competitive Strengths Growth in copper, gold and zinc production with exploration upside Consistent performance from reliable operations Disciplined and clear growth strategy already being executed Strong financial position Experienced management and operating team Hudbay Releases Third Quarter 2015 Results TORONTO, ONTARIO -- (Marketwired) -- 11/05/15 -- HudBay Minerals Inc. (\"Hudbay\" or the \"company\") (TSX: HBM)(NYSE:HBM) today released its third quarter 2015 financial results. In the third quarter of 2015, operating cash flow before stream deposit and change in non-cash working capital increased to $79.9 million from $12.1 million in the third quarter of 2014. The net loss and loss per share in the third quarter of 2015 were $11.8 million and $0.05, respectively, compared to net earnings and earnings per share of$46.2 million and $0.21, respectively, in the third quarter of 2014. Net loss and loss per share in the third quarter of 2015 were affected by, among other things, the following items: Pre-tax loss ($ millions) After-tax loss ($ millions) Per share loss  Hudbay expects to achieve full year 2015 production and cost guidance for all of its operations. Financial and Operating Results Starting with its results for the period ended September 30, 2015, Hudbay has changed its reporting currency to US dollars; accordingly, amounts are in US dollars unless otherwise noted. All comparable figures have been restated in US dollars, as per Note 4 of the unaudited condensed interim financial statements. Operating cash flows before stream deposit and changes in non-cash working capital increased 559% to $79.9 million for the three months ending September 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was the result of significant growth in production and sales of most metals as the Constancia mine achieved commercial production at the end of April 2015. Metals production increases included 389% for copper, 329% for silver, 45% for gold and 7% for zinc, and cash cost per pound of copper produced, net of by-product credits, was $0.90. While operating cash flows benefitted from the significant increase in sales volumes and a low cash cost, these factors were partly offset by lower realized prices for all metals when compared to the prior year's quarter. However, net earnings decreased by $58.0 million. This change occurred primarily as a result of a $34.5 million impairment charge associated with equipment inherited from the acquisition of Augusta. In addition, in the third quarter of 2014, Hudbay recorded net gains of $56.2 million related to the Augusta acquisition. Financial Performance ($000s except per share and cash cost amounts) Three months ended September 30 Nine months ended September 30  Attributable to owners of the Company. Operating cash flow per share and cash cost per pound of copper produced, net of by-product credits are non-IFRS financial performance measures with no standardized definition under IFRS. For further information and a detailed reconciliation, please see page 4 of this news release. Metal reported in concentrate is prior to refining losses or deductions associated with smelter contract terms. During the third quarter of 2015, shipments of copper concentrate from the Constancia mine to the port in Matarani were principally constrained by truck driver availability, and truck turnaround time due to road refurbishment. Due to these issues and the rapid ramp up in production, concentrate on site increased to approximately 65,000 tonnes at quarter end. With a significant increase in trucking capacity in Peru since the middle of September, considerable progress has been made in moving the excess copper concentrate from the Constancia site to port. The majority of the excess inventory is expected to be sold during the fourth quarter. Since September 30, 2015, inventory levels at the Constancia mine site have declined by approximately 30%. As at September 30, 2015, Hudbay had total liquidity of approximately $300 million, including $114 million in cash and cash equivalents as well as commitments under its revolving credit facility. This does not include approximately $60 million in expected net cash flow from the sale of excess unsold copper concentrate inventory. Recent Developments As indicated, there was an impairment loss recognized of $34.5 million to reflect the orderly liquidation value of the previously purchased equipment and certain long lead equipment deposits in the Arizona business unit. This followed from the completion of a value engineering process in the second and third quarters of 2015, which deemed that certain equipment previously purchased or ordered by prior Augusta management is unsuitable to achieve the design objectives for Rosemont, and that different equipment will better meet Rosemont's objectives while observing permitting commitments. Although Hudbay's valuation assumptions in determining the Augusta purchase price allocation allowed for additional capital spending beyond Augusta's previous guidance, the purchase price allocation valued this equipment at cost based on the information available at the time. The collective agreements with each of the seven labour unions representing employees at Hudbay's Manitoba business unit expired on December 31, 2014. All seven unions have now ratified new three-year agreements that provide enhancements to wage rates, pensions and benefits. The labour disruption experienced in the second and third quarters ended in late August. On November 2, 2015, Hudbay completed the sale of Balmat Holding Corporation to Northern Zinc, LLC and Northern Zinc, LLC was concurrently acquired byStar Mountain Resources, Inc. (\"Star Mountain\"). On closing, Hudbay received 550,000 shares of Star Mountain common stock and $1 million in cash; Hudbay previously received $0.5 million in upfront deposit payments and is entitled to receive up to an additional $15.5 million in future cash payments or, at Star Mountain's election, $7 million in cash within three months of the closing date. Peru Operations Review During the third quarter of 2015, mining operations continued as planned and cost optimization is underway. Equipment availabilities are within design parameters and both loading and hauling efficiencies remain consistent with expectations. Optimization of plant performance remains the primary focus, as more is understood about varying ore types. During September, copper recoveries plateaued at 80% due to a greater presence of oxide minerals than previously anticipated in the upper sequence of the mine. However, metals production targets continue to be achieved as the reduced ore recovery has been offset by higher-than-expected copper grades and ore throughput. Monthly ore throughput increased from 2 million tonnes in July to 2.6 million tonnes in September. Commissioning of the molybdenum concentrate circuit has been delayed into the fourth quarter due to the availability of key reagents and due to ore characteristics. Metal production and combined operating costs per tonne at Constancia are expected to be within guidance ranges for 2015. Manitoba Operations Review For the third quarter of 2015, ore processed was relatively consistent compared to the same period of 2014. Compared to the same quarter of the prior year, gold, zinc and copper grades were 17%, 6% and 5% higher, respectively, and silver grades were 15% lower as a result of normal mine sequencing. Combined operating costs per tonne of ore processed in the third quarter of 2015 were 34% higher, compared to the same period in 2014, primarily due to increased commercial production at the Snow Lake operations, which have higher unit costs, as well as increased unit costs at the Flin Flon operations resulting from decreased production at the 777 mine. In the fourth quarter of 2015, Hudbay expects to realize sequential improvements in metals production and unit costs per tonne of ore processed as the 777 mine is beginning to benefit from the effects of its planned mine fleet renewal. Metal production and combined operating costs per tonne in Manitoba are expected to be within guidance ranges for 2015. Non-IFRS Financial Performance Measures Operating cash flow per share and cash cost per pound of copper produced are included in this news release because the company believes that, in the case of operating cash flow per share, it helps investors and management to evaluate changes in cash flow while taking into account changes in shares outstanding, and in the case of cash cost per pound of copper produced, it helps investors assess the performance the company's operations. These measures do not have a meaning prescribed by IFRS and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with IFRS and are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under IFRS. Other companies may calculate these measures differently. Operating Cash Flow per Share The following table presents Hudbay's calculation of operating cash flow per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014: ($000s except shares and per share amounts) Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30  Operating cash flow per share is before stream deposit and change in non-cash working capital. It is a non-IFRS financial performance measure with no standardized meaning under IFRS. Reconciliation of Cash Cost, After By-product Credits (non-IFRS) to Cost of Sales (IFRS) Cash cost per pound of copper produced (\"cash cost\") is a non-IFRS measure that management uses as a key performance indicator to assess the performance of the company's operations. Hudbay's calculation designates copper as its primary metal of production as it has been, and is expected to be, the largest component of revenues. Two changes have been made to the cash cost calculation beginning with reporting for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015. First, the basis of measurement has been changed from pounds of copper sold to pounds of copper produced. This change has been made to better align the costs of production with copper produced in the same period and reduce the variation in cash cost due to inventory sales timing. Second, royalties have been removed from the cash cost. This change increases consistency between Hudbay's cash cost calculation and industry peers. The calculation is presented in two manners: Cash cost, before by-product credits - This measure is gross of by-product revenues and is a function of the efforts and costs incurred to mine and process all ore mined. However, the measure divides this aggregate cost over only pounds of copper produced, Hudbay's primary metal of production. This measure is generally less volatile from period to period, as it is not affected by changes in the price received for by-product metals. It is, however, significantly affected by the relative mix of copper concentrate and finished zinc production, and an increase in production of zinc metal will tend to result in an increase in cash costs under this measure. Cash cost, net of by-product credits - In order to calculate the cost to produce and sell copper, the net of by-product credits measure subtracts the revenues realized from the sale of the metals other than copper. The by-product revenues from zinc, gold, silver, and molybdenum are significant and are integral to the economics of Hudbay's operations. The economics that support Hudbay's decision to produce and sell copper would be different if the company did not receive revenues from the other significant metals being extracted and processed. This measure provides management and investors with an indication of the minimum copper price consistent with positive operating cash flows and operating margins, assuming that realized by-product metal prices are consistent with those prevailing during the reporting period. It also serves as an important operating statistic that management and investors utilize to measure Hudbay's operating performance versus that of its competitors. However, it is important to understand that if by-product metal prices decline alongside copper prices, the cash cost net of by-product credits would increase, requiring a higher copper price than that reported to maintain positive cash flows and operating margins.

OCT 28, 2015 - 17:30 ET Lundin Mining Third Quarter Results TORONTO, ONTARIO--(Marketwired - Oct. 28, 2015) - Lundin Mining Corporation (\"Lundin Mining\" or the \"Company\") (TSX: LUN) (OMX: LUMI) today reported a net loss of $35.3 million or a net loss attributable to Lundin shareholders (after deducting non-controlling interests) of $34.6 million ($0.05 per share) for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. Cash flows of $120.2 million were generated from operations in the quarter, not including the Company's attributable cash flows from Tenke Fungurume. The Company continued to strengthen its balance sheet, generating free-cash flow and reducing net debt during the quarter by a further $43.4 million to $453.8 million, despite lower metal prices and negative price adjustments of $56.4 million related to the re-pricing of provisional sales from prior periods. Mr. Paul Conibear, President and CEO commented, \"We are pleased that our operations continue to generate healthy cash flows despite the low commodity price environment. Our continued focus on cost efficiency and productivity enhancements has enabled us to maintain all mines producing at low cash costs with good margins, and we have been able to reduce our annual capital expenditure guidance by a further $40 million, while maintaining our production profile intact. The combination of our strong balance sheet and steady operations helps ensure that Lundin will remain in a favorable position to continue to generate excellent shareholder value moving forward.\"  Operating earnings is a non-GAAP measure defined as sales, less operating costs (excluding depreciation) and general and administrative costs. Net debt is a non-GAAP measure defined as cash and cash equivalents, less long-term debt and finance leases, before deferred financing fees. Highlights Operational Performance For the third quarter of 2015, production results were strong but financial results were impacted by a lower metal price environment. The Company remains on track to meet overall full year guidance. Candelaria (80%): The Candelaria operations produced, on a 100% basis, 45,195 tonnes of copper, and approximately 434,000 ounces of silver and 25,400 ounces of gold in concentrate, with copper and gold production better than expectations as a result of higher throughput. Copper cash costs1 of $1.44/lb for the quarter remain on track to meet full year guidance of $1.35/lb. Eagle (100%): Eagle's operational results were generally in-line with expectations, with both nickel (6,438 tonnes) and copper (6,514 tonnes) production meeting projections for the quarter. Nickel cash costs of $2.38/lb for the quarter were higher than full year guidance of $2.00/lb largely as a result of lower copper by-product credits. Both production and nickel cash costs remain on track to meet full year guidance. Neves-Corvo (100%): Neves-Corvo produced 13,917 tonnes of copper and 14,363 tonnes of zinc in the third quarter. Copper production exceeded the prior year comparable period by 28% due to higher head grades. Zinc production fell short of the prior year comparable period, resulting from lower mill feed grades and, in particular, below target metal recovery in the zinc plant. Copper cash costs of $1.83/lb for the quarter were higher than full year guidance ($1.55/lb) due primarily to lower by-product production and sales. Zinkgruvan (100%): Zinc production in the third quarter of 2015 was 8% lower than the comparable period in 2014, while lead production for the third quarter of 2015 was higher than the 2014 comparable period. Production variances for both metals were due to normal variations of grades in the ore milled. Cash costs for zinc of $0.41/lb for the quarter were in-line with guidance ($0.40/lb). Aguablanca (100%): Despite the suspension of underground mining operations during the quarter, Aguablanca met production expectations, though current quarter production of 1,708 tonnes of nickel and 1,658 tonnes of copper was lower than the prior year comparable period due to lower throughput, head grades, and recoveries from stockpiled ore. Cash costs of $5.23/lb of nickel for the quarter were higher than full year guidance ($3.75/lb). Tenke (24%): Tenke operations continue to perform well. Lundin's attributable share of third quarter production included 11,761 tonnes of copper cathode and 954 tonnes of cobalt in hydroxide. The Company's attributable share of sales included 12,278 tonnes of copper at an average realized price of $2.32/lb and 1,022 tonnes of cobalt at an average realized price of $8.96/lb. Tenke operating cash costs for the third quarter of 2015 were $1.15/lb of copper sold, marginally higher than the latest guidance. Cash distributions received by Lundin Mining in the quarter from Tenke were $2.5 million. An additional $1.2 million was received from the Freeport Cobalt operations. Year-to-date cash distributions to the Company from Tenke and Freeport Cobalt totalled $20.6 million, in-line with expectations. Cash cost/lb of copper, zinc and nickel are non-GAAP measures defined as all cash costs directly attributable to mining operations, less royalties and by-product credits.  Financial Performance Operating earnings for the quarter ended September 30, 2015 were $94.1 million, an increase of $51.2 million in comparison to the third quarter of the prior year ($42.9 million). The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of Candelaria's ($66.7 million) and Eagle's ($18.5 million) operating results. Operating earnings were also positively impacted by favourable foreign exchange rates ($19.1 million), partially offset by lower realized metal prices and price adjustments ($58.4 million) from our European operations. On a year-to-date basis, operating earnings were $611.1 million, an increase of $450.8 million in comparison to the first nine months of 2014 ($160.3 million). The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of Candelaria's ($371.8 million) and Eagle's ($114.9 million) operating results, and favourable foreign exchange rates ($60.5 million), partially offset by lower realized metal prices and price adjustments ($131.1 million) from our European operations. Sales for the quarter ended September 30, 2015 were $353.2 million, an increase of $186.6 million in comparison to the third quarter of the prior year ($166.6 million). The increase was mainly due to incremental sales from Candelaria and Eagle of $192.0 million and $60.0 million, respectively, partially offset by lower realized metal prices and price adjustments. On a year-to-date basis, sales were $1,386.0 million, an increase of $877.7 million in comparison to the first nine months of 2014 ($508.3 million). The increase was mainly due to incremental sales from Candelaria and Eagle of $740.7 million and $233.4 million, respectively, and higher net European sales volumes ($45.6 million), partially offset by lower realized metal prices and price adjustments. Average metal prices for copper, nickel and zinc for the quarter ended September 30, 2015 were lower (25%, 43%, and 20%, respectively) in comparison to the third quarter of the prior year. On a year-to-date basis, average metal prices for copper, nickel and zinc were lower (18%, 27%, and 5%, respectively) in comparison to the first nine months of 2014. Operating costs (excluding depreciation) for the quarter ended September 30, 2015 were $252.3 million, an increase of $134.7 million in comparison to the third quarter of the prior year ($117.6 million). The increase was largely due to incremental costs from Candelaria and Eagle of $125.2 million and $41.5 million, respectively, partially offset by favourable foreign exchange rates in the EUR and SEK ($19.1 million). On a year-to-date basis, operating costs (excluding depreciation) were $754.5 million, an increase of $425.7 million in comparison to the first nine months of 2014 ($328.8 million). The increase was largely due to incremental costs from Candelaria and Eagle of $368.9 million and $118.5 million, respectively, partially offset by favourable foreign exchange rates in the EUR and SEK ($60.5 million). Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 when measured against the comparable period in 2014. The increase was attributable to the acquisition of Candelaria (Q3 2015 - $58.6 million; YTD - $224.4 million) and the start of commercial production at Eagle (Q3 2015 - $32.0 million; YTD - $102.7 million). Cash flow from operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2015 was $120.2 million, an increase of $62.7 million in comparison to the third quarter of the prior year ($57.5 million). The increase was primarily due to operating earnings from Candelaria ($66.7 million) and Eagle ($18.5 million), and changes in non-cash working capital and long-term inventory ($50.8 million), partially offset by lower operating earnings at our European operations ($33.7 million), primarily due to lower metal prices and higher net income taxes paid ($33.6 million). On a year-to-date basis, cash flow from operations was $606.9 million, an increase of $488.1 million in comparison to the first nine months of 2014 ($118.8 million). The increase was attributable to operating earnings from Candelaria ($371.8 million) and Eagle ($114.9 million), and changes in non-cash working capital and long-term inventory ($138.3 million), partially offset by higher net income taxes paid ($71.7 million) and lower operating earnings at our European operations ($33.8 million). Net loss for the quarter ended September 30, 2015 was $35.3 million compared to net earnings of $33.7 million in the third quarter of the prior year. Net loss was impacted by: lower net earnings at our European operations, primarily the result of lower realized metal prices and price adjustments ($27.8 million); and interest expense associated with the senior secured notes ($20.2 million); andlower income from investment in Tenke ($19.3 million). On a year-to-date basis, net earnings were $101.8 million, an increase of $15.0 million in comparison to the first nine months of 2014 ($86.8 million). Net earnings were impacted by: addition of Candelaria ($112.9 million) and Eagle's first three full quarters of operations ($19.9 million); partially offset by interest expense associated with the senior secured notes ($60.0 million); and lower income from investment in Tenke ($43.0 million); and lower net earnings at our European operations, primarily the result of lower realized metal prices and price adjustments ($18.3 million). Corporate Highlights On July 23, 2015, the Company announced approval of the Environmental Impact Assessment (\"EIA\") for Candelaria 2030 - the project to install new tailings storage facilities and approvals for continued mine operation running to at least year 2030. Financial Position and Financing Net debt position at September 30, 2015 was $453.8 million compared to $829.2 million at December 31, 2014 and $497.2 million at June 30, 2015. The $43.4 million decrease in net debt during the quarter was largely attributable to operating cash flows of $120.2 million, partially offset by investments in mineral properties, plant and equipment of $73.0 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, net debt decreased by $375.4 million due primarily to operating cash flows of $606.9 million, partially offset by investments in mineral properties, plant and equipment of $215.7 million. The Company has a revolving credit facility available for borrowing up to $350 million. As at September 30, 2015, the Company had no amount drawn on the credit facility. A letter of credit in the amount of $19.3 million (SEK 162 million) is outstanding. Net debt at October 28, 2015 is approximately $448 million. Outlook 2015 Production and Cost Guidance Production and cash cost guidance for 2015 has been updated from that disclosed in our Management Discussion and Analysis for the six months ended June 30, 2015, as noted below. Production guidance ranges for all sites have been narrowed to account for production results to date. Cash cost guidance at Neves-Corvo has been increased slightly ($0.05/lb) to reflect lower expected sales of by-products and lower metal prices. Cash cost and production guidance for the Aguablanca Mine reflects that all mining and milling activities are suspended at the Aguablanca nickel-copper mine in Spain. Underground production activities at the operation have been in suspension since late July of 2015. Since that time, the processing plant has been running exclusively on stockpiled material, which has now been exhausted. As the Company has not yet received the needed environmental approvals to recommence underground mining, a decision has been made to fully suspend the operations pending further notice. The full year guidance for cash costs and production are based on an estimate of October production and may change slightly upon finalization of assays and financial results. Guidance on Tenke's cash costs have been updated to reflect the most recent guidance provided by Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (\"Freeport\").  Guidance as outlined in our Management's Discussion and Analysis for the quarter ended June 30, 2015. Cash costs remain dependent upon exchange rates (forecast at EUR/USD:1.15, USD/SEK:8.25, USD/CLP:680) and metal prices (forecast at Cu: $2.50/lb, Ni: $5.00/lb, Zn: $0.85/lb, Pb: $0.80/lb, Au: $1,100/oz, Ag: $15.00/oz, Co: $13.00/lb). Prior guidance forecast USD/CLP at 625, Cu at $2.70/lb, Ni at $6.25/lb and Zn at $0.95/lb. Freeport has provided 2015 sales and cash costs guidance. Tenke's 2015 production is assumed to approximate sales guidance. 2015 Capital Expenditure and Exploration Guidance Capital expenditures for 2015 are expected to be $310 million (excluding Tenke), $40 million less than previous guidance. The Company expects to spend $20 million less on sustaining capital expenditures at our Candelaria and Neves-Corvo operations as part of on-going efforts to defer or reduce non-essential spending during the current metal price environment.  Guidance as outlined in our Management's Discussion and Analysis for the quarter ended June 30, 2015. The Company estimates its share of expansion related initiatives and sustaining capital funding for 2015 at Tenke to be $80 million, unchanged from previous guidance. All of the capital expenditures are expected to be self-funded by cash flow from Tenke operations. The Company expects to receive cash distributions from Tenke in 2015 of approximately $20 million, at the lower end of previous guidance of $20 - $30 million. The total exploration expense is expected to be $60 million, unchanged from previous guidance.

(TSE: POT) Who we are PotashCorp is the world's largest fertilizer company by capacity, producing the three primary crop nutrients: potash (K), nitrogen (N) and phosphate (P). We are the world's leading potash producer by capacity and our Canadian operations represent nearly one-fifth of global capacity1. To enhance our global footprint, we also have investments in four potash-related businesses in South America, the Middle East and Asia. With operations and business interests in seven countries, PotashCorp is an international enterprise and plays an important role in helping the world grow the food it needs. What we produce Our potash, phosphate and nitrogen products help provide the primary nutrients that crops need. They are also used to make livestock feeds and industrial goods. Produced from mineral deposits (potash and phosphate) and from the air we breathe (nitrogen), our main products are: potash, in standard and granular grades DAP (diammonium phosphate), MAP (monoammonium phosphate) and phosphoric acid Ammonia and urea Why fertilizer? With world population rising, arable land per person diminishing and demand increasing for higher quality diets that include more fruits and vegetables and protein from crop-fed livestock, the need to maximize the efficiency of farmland has never been greater. Every crop harvested removes nutrients from the soil, which must be replaced to keep soil healthy and productive. Responsible for more than 40 percent of the world's total crop yield, fertilizers feed plants, which help to feed animals and people. Where we serve Our products serve customers throughout the global marketplace from China, the world's most populous nation and largest fertilizer consumer, to India, with its 1.2 billion people. From Latin America an agricultural superpower to the rice and oil palm producing fields of Other Asian countries and the breadbasket markets of North America. Together these five regions account for nearly three-quarters of the world's population and roughly 80 percent of the total fertilizer consumption. Delivering when we're needed As the world's food challenges become more pressing, we're taking an active role in meeting them, investing heavily in our assets to deliver quality product when and where our customers need it. We are adding to our current potash capacity without building a new mine - an advantage as demand is expected to rise. And through our partnerships and investments, we strive to better serve customers in emerging markets. How we do business We hold ourselves to the highest business standards and consider factors beyond financial performance when evaluating our success. Guided by our Core Values, we cultivate mutually beneficial relationships with our communities, customers, employees, investors and other people critical to our success. Acting with a long-term view, we make decisions that consider people and the planet, always looking for opportunities to improve. OCT 29 2015 Q3: PotashCorp Reports 2015 Third-Quarter Earnings of $0.34 per Share Key Highlights Third-quarter earnings of $0.34 per share1, including $0.03 per share related to notable non-cash charges, primarily in phosphate Annual earnings guidance adjusted to $1.55 - $1.65 per share Preparing for closure of Penobsquis mine and inventory shutdowns at Cory, Allan and Lanigan CEO Commentary \"Broader emerging market concerns have weighed on customer sentiment, contributing to a weaker fertilizer environment in the second half of 2015,\" said PotashCorp President and Chief Executive Officer Jochen Tilk. \"In response, we are moving forward the permanent closure date of our Penobsquis, New Brunswick mine and planning inventory shutdowns in December at three of our Saskatchewan mines. While we anticipate production in the fourth quarter to be reduced by nearly 500,000 tonnes, we do not expect employee layoffs.\" \"Despite challenges over recent months, we are seeing signs of a shift in focus by distributors and farmers to 2016,\" Tilk said. \"We believe the need for increased global agricultural production - coupled with supportive crop prices - provides a compelling opportunity for farmers.\" Saskatoon, Saskatchewan - Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc. (PotashCorp) reported third-quarter earnings of $0.34 per share ($282 million), bringing the nine-month total to $1.28 per share ($1.1 billion). Earnings for both the quarter and the first nine months modestly trailed 2014's comparable period amounts of $0.38 per share ($317 million) and $1.33 per share ($1.1 billion), respectively. Gross margin for the quarter totaled $505 million, below the $589 million generated during the third quarter of 2014, primarily due to weaker nitrogen contributions. For the first nine months, improved potash and phosphate contributions largely offset weaker nitrogen performance, as gross margin totaled $1.9 billion, relatively flat compared to the same period in 2014. Cash from operating activities of $358 million in the third quarter and $1.7 billion for the first nine months of 2015 were below last year's comparable totals of $574 million and $1.9 billion, respectively. Earnings before finance costs, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization (EBITDA)2 of $593 million for the quarter and $2.1 billion for the first nine months were also below 2014's comparative figures. Investments in Arab Potash Company (APC) in Jordan, Israel Chemicals Ltd. (ICL) in Israel and Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile S.A. (SQM) in Chile contributed $37 million to our quarterly earnings, exceeding the $24 million earned in third-quarter 2014. Our nine-month total of $134 million, which included a dividend from Sinofert Holdings Limited (Sinofert) in China, was down from last year's total of $179 million when we received a $69 million special dividend from ICL. The market value of our investments in these four publicly traded companies equated to approximately $4 billion, or $5 per PotashCorp share, at market close on October 28, 2015. Market Conditions Global potash demand remained strong during the quarter as higher volumes to Brazil, India and China helped offset slower purchasing in other markets. With many buyers moving cautiously amidst economic headwinds and significant currency volatility, prices declined in most key potash markets. In nitrogen, prices for nearly all products were lower compared to third-quarter 2014 as market fundamentals weakened. Rising global supply due in part to lower energy prices - combined with weaker shipments to Latin America - largely overshadowed strong demand from India compared to 2014. In phosphate, markets for solid fertilizer remained relatively stable. Increased Chinese exports and weaker demand in Latin America more than offset stronger Indian demand and resulted in relatively flat pricing. Other phosphate products were supported by strong demand in North America and India, driving prices for liquid fertilizers, feed and industrial products above those of 2014's third quarter. Potash Potash gross margin of $294 million for 2015's third quarter was relatively flat compared to the same period last year. This result raised our total for the first nine months to $1.1 billion, 15 percent higher than the comparable period of 2014, primarily due to slightly higher realized prices and lower costs. Shipments for the quarter reached 2.2 million tonnes, increasing the total for the first nine months of 2015 to 7.0 million tonnes driven largely by offshore demand. Sales volumes for both the quarter and the full year surpassed the results for the comparable periods in 2014. Offshore shipments reached 1.5 million tonnes in the third quarter, with the majority of Canpotex's3 volumes to Latin America (40 percent) and Other Asian markets (29 percent), while India and China accounted for 15 percent and 11 percent, respectively. North American sales totaled 0.7 million tonnes. Our average realized potash price of $250 per tonne in the third quarter was down from $281 per tonne in the same period last year due to declining prices in North America and a higher percentage of sales volumes to lower-netback offshore markets. Cost of goods sold of $113 per tonne in the third quarter was 14 percent lower than the same period last year due to the favorable impact of a weakened Canadian dollar and the deferral of annual maintenance at certain locations to the fourth quarter of 2015. Nitrogen Weaker nitrogen prices and lower sales volumes resulted in third-quarter gross margin of $161 million, 31 percent below 2014's comparable period. These factors also caused our nine-month total of $564 million to trail last year's record level. Our US operations accounted for 60 percent of our nitrogen gross margin for the quarter, with Trinidad providing the remainder. Weaker demand, mechanical issues and a planned turnaround at our recently expanded Lima facility kept third-quarter and nine-month sales volumes (1.4 million and 4.4 million tonnes, respectively) below the comparable periods in 2014. Our average realized price of $319 per tonne during the quarter declined from $356 per tonne in the same period last year as lower energy prices and increased global supply weighed on benchmark prices and realizations for all our products. Cost of goods sold for the third quarter was $210 per tonne, relatively flat compared to the same period of 2014. The negative impact of reduced sales volumes was partly offset by lower natural gas costs in the US and Trinidad. Phosphate Third-quarter phosphate gross margin totaled $50 million, trailing the $61 million earned during the same period last year as higher sales volumes and prices were more than offset by increased costs. For the first nine months, gross margin totaled $180 million, exceeding the $135 million generated in the same period of 2014, which included accelerated depreciation charges related to the closure of our Suwannee River chemical plant. Sales volumes of 0.8 million tonnes for the quarter were slightly above the same period in 2014, while the 2.1 million tonnes sold in the first nine months of 2015 was 11 percent lower than the previous year's total due primarily to the absence of production from Suwannee River. Our average realized phosphate price for the third quarter was $538 per tonne, up from the $517 per tonne realized in the same period last year, primarily reflecting higher netbacks for liquid fertilizer products. Cost of goods sold of $475 per tonne in the third quarter was 9 percent higher than the same period in 2014. Increased reliability maintenance, a negative adjustment to our asset retirement obligations and other period costs exceeded the notable charges taken in last year's third quarter and more than offset the positive impact of increased sales volumes. Financial Provincial mining and other taxes for the third quarter increased to $79 million from the $52 million recorded in 2014, reflecting the impact of a weaker Canadian dollar and lower deductible costs due to changes in Saskatchewan's potash taxation regulations in early 2015. Lower total earnings and a discrete tax recovery resulted in income tax expense declining to $90 million in the third quarter, down from $156 million during 2014's comparable period which included a discrete tax expense. In August, we closed the acquisition of our 9.5 percent stake in Brazil-based Fertilizantes Heringer S.A. and entered into a long-term potash supply agreement with the company. Market Outlook Despite broad economic uncertainty, we continue to see strong underlying consumption trends across most key potash markets. We maintain our forecast for 2015 global shipments of 58 to 60 million tonnes, although we no longer expect they will reach the high end of this range. In North America, cautious buying patterns in the third quarter are expected to keep total potash shipments for the year below 2014 levels. Although we anticipate healthy fall application demand will support fourth-quarter shipments, we now forecast total 2015 deliveries of 8.5-9.0 million tonnes. In Latin America, while we expect potash shipments will remain at historically strong levels, credit challenges and currency volatility are likely to result in demand below last year's record level. For the full year, we forecast shipments of 10.5-11.0 million tonnes. In China, we anticipate that encouraging consumption trends for compound fertilizers and bulk blends will support healthy demand through the fourth quarter. We have slightly lowered our total potash shipment range for 2015 to 14.0-14.5 million tonnes to reflect modestly lower deliveries due to the recently implemented value-added tax on fertilizer sales. In India, we remain encouraged by rising consumption trends for compound fertilizers, even in the absence of subsidy reform. Despite this trend, we have lowered our full-year potash shipment estimate to 4.2-4.5 million tonnes due to currency volatility and a weaker-than-normal monsoon. In Other Asian markets (outside of China and India), we have slightly lowered our estimate for potash shipments to 8.3-8.7 million tonnes to reflect lower demand caused by weaker local currencies and adverse weather conditions affecting application requirements in certain regions. Financial Outlook In light of these market factors, we have revised full-year expectations for our potash business. We have lowered our sales volume guidance to a range of 9.0-9.2 million tonnes and now expect potash gross margin of $1.4-$1.5 billion, reflecting weaker volumes and pricing. Consistent with our long-held strategy of matching supply to demand, we are accelerating the permanent closure date of our Penobsquis mine in New Brunswick to the end of November (annual operational capability of approximately 800,000 tonnes). While this will reduce available production levels until our new Picadilly mine is fully ramped up, it is expected to improve our cost profile and help manage inventories. We are also preparing to take three-week inventory shutdowns at our Allan, Cory and Lanigan operations in Saskatchewan, beginning in mid-December. The combination of these shutdowns and the closure of Penobsquis is expected to reduce fourth-quarter production by nearly 500,000 tonnes and lead to slightly higher per-tonne cost of goods sold. We expect there will be no impact on our employment levels at these locations. We have lowered the top end of our previous combined nitrogen and phosphate gross margin guidance range and now estimate we will generate between $1.0-$1.1 billion. In nitrogen, we expect total gross margin below last year's record as increased global supply is expected to keep prices for most products below 2014 levels. Additionally, weaker North American demand, reduced production due to mechanical challenges and an expansion-related turnaround at Lima are expected to keep sales volumes below last year's levels. In phosphate, supportive market fundamentals and our higher-netback product mix are expected to support gross margin above 2014 levels. We have increased our estimate for provincial mining and other taxes to a range of 21-23 percent of potash gross margin due to a weaker Canadian dollar and lower deductible costs. We have lowered our range for income from offshore equity investments to $165-$175 million due to a weaker-than-expected potash earnings environment and we have also slightly increased our estimate for selling and administrative expenses to a range of $245-$250 million. Due to the continued strength of the US dollar, we have revised our full-year foreign exchange rate assumption to CDN$1.26 per US dollar. As a result of the noted changes, we have revised our full-year 2015 earnings guidance to $1.55-$1.65 per share. Other annual guidance numbers - including those noted above - are outlined in the table below. 2015 Guidance  Silver Wheaton Corp.

ANOTHER RECORD QUARTER OF SILVER EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION AND SALES VOLUME FOR SILVER WHEATON IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2015 11/03/2015 VANCOUVER, Nov. 3, 2015 /CNW/ - Silver Wheaton Corp. (\"Silver Wheaton\" or the \"Company\") (TSX: SLW) (NYSE:SLW) is pleased to announce its unaudited results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2015. All figures are presented in United States dollars unless otherwise noted. Silver Wheaton achieved record production for a third quarter in a row and record sales volume for a second quarter in a row, driven by record production at Salobo and Penasquito and record sales volume at San Dimas. In addition, the ramp-up of production at Salobo and Constancia continue to progress as expected. THIRD QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS Record attributable silver equivalent production in Q3 2015 of 11.0 million ounces (6.9 million ounces of silver and 54,500 ounces of gold), compared with 8.9 million ounces in Q3 2014, representing an increase of 24%. Record silver equivalent sales volume in Q3 2015 of 10.2 million ounces (6.6 million ounces of silver and 48,100 ounces of gold), compared with 8.7 million ounces in Q3 2014, representing an increase of 17%. During the three month period ending September 30, 2015, payable silver equivalent ounces attributable to the Company produced but not yet delivered decreased by 0.1 million ounces to approximately 6.3 million ounces. Revenues of $153.3 million in Q3 2015 compared with $165.9 million in Q3 2014, representing a decrease of 8%. Average realized sale price per silver equivalent ounce sold in Q3 2015 of $15.03 ($15.05 per ounce of silver and $1,130 per ounce of gold), compared with $18.98 in Q3 2014, representing a decrease of 21%. Adjusted net earnings1 of $49.8 million ($0.12 per share) in Q3 2015 compared with $72.6 million ($0.20 per share) in Q3 2014, representing a decrease of 31%. During the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $154.0 million related to its 777 silver and gold interest. After including the after tax impact of the impairment charge, net loss of $95.9 million ($0.24 per share) in Q3 2015 compared with net earnings of $4.5 million ($0.01 per share) in Q3 2014.1 Operating cash flows of $99.5 million ($0.25 per share1) in Q3 2015 compared with $120.4 million ($0.34 per share1) in Q3 2014, representing a decrease of 17%. Cash operating margin1 in Q3 2015 of $10.45 per silver equivalent ounce compared with $14.39 in Q3 2014, representing a decrease of 27%. Average cash costs1 in Q3 2015 were $4.26 and $389 per ounce of silver and gold, respectively. On a silver equivalent basis, average cash costs1 decreased to $4.58 compared with $4.59 in Q3 2014. Declared quarterly dividend of $0.05 per common share. On September 18, 2015, the Company announced that it had received TSX approval for a normal course issuer bid (\"NCIB\") of up to 5% of the Company's outstanding Common Shares. To date, the Company has purchased 764,789 shares under the NCIB. On September 24, 2015, the Company announced that it had received Notices of Reassessment from the Canada Revenue Agency (the \"CRA\") for the 2005 to 2010 taxation years (the \"Relevant Taxation Years\"). Subsequent to the quarter, Silver Wheaton filed notices of objection for each of the Relevant Taxation Years. Asset Highlights Salobo had record attributable production of almost 33,000 ounces of gold net to Silver Wheaton in Q3, and the ongoing ramp-up continues to be on track to achieve 100% utilization in Q4 2015. Record attributable production from Penasquito. Record sale volume from San Dimas. Events Subsequent to the Quarter Silver Wheaton agreed to acquire from a subsidiary of Glencore Plc (\"Glencore\") an amount of silver equal to 33.75% of the silver production until delivery of 140 million ounces of silver and 22.5% of the silver production thereafter for the life of mine from the Antamina mine for an upfront cash consideration of US$900 million and ongoing payments of 20% of spot price per silver ounce delivered. \"Silver Wheaton hit record production for a third consecutive quarter, as the company produced 11 million silver equivalent ounces in the third quarter alone. Our cornerstone assets delivered solid results with Penasquito and Salobo setting new production records. With over 32 million ounces produced year to date, we remain well on track to deliver on our original production growth guidance of over 20% in 2015,\" said Randy Smallwood, President and Chief Executive Officer of Silver Wheaton. \"Clearly, not everything has been smooth sailing, as we have also faced persistently low commodity prices, along with the receipt of the Notices of Reassessment from the CRA. I once again want to reiterate our confidence in our structure and that we will vigorously defend our tax filing position; as such, we have filed notices of objections with the CRA in regards to the Reassessments.\" \"While our cornerstone operations have performed exceptionally well, we did take an impairment charge on 777 in the third quarter due to lack of exploration success combined with lower commodity prices. While the low commodity price environment has had its challenges, it has also created some great opportunities. This is clearly evidenced by the announcement of our acquisition of a silver stream on Antamina, one of the lowest cost, largest copper mines in the world. Antamina is an ideal asset for Silver Wheaton, one that readily fits in to our portfolio of top tier assets.\" Financial Review Revenues Revenue was $153.3 million in the third quarter of 2015, on silver equivalent sales of 10.2 million ounces (6.6 million ounces of silver and 48,100 ounces of gold). This represents an 8% decrease from the $165.9 million of revenue generated in the third quarter of 2014 due primarily to a 21% decrease in the average realized silver equivalent price ($15.03 in Q3 2015 compared with $18.98 in Q3 2014), partially offset by a 17% increase in the number of silver equivalent ounces sold. Costs and Expenses Average cash costs1 in the third quarter of 2015 were $4.58 per silver equivalent ounce as compared with $4.59 during the comparable period of 2014. This resulted in a cash operating margin1 of $10.45 per silver equivalent ounce, a reduction of 27% as compared with Q3 2014. The decrease in the cash operating margin was primarily due to a 21% decrease in the average realized silver equivalent price in Q3 2015 compared with Q3 2014. Earnings and Operating Cash Flows Adjusted net earnings1 and cash flow from operations in the third quarter of 2015 were $49.8 million ($0.12 per share) and $99.5 million ($0.25 per share1), compared with $72.6 million ($0.20 per share) and $120.4 million ($0.34 per share1) for the same period in 2014, a decrease of 31% and 17%, respectively. Earnings and cash flow continued to be impacted by lower gold and silver prices. Balance Sheet At September 30, 2015, the Company had approximately $81 million of cash on hand and $647 million outstanding under the Company's $2 billionrevolving term loan. On September 18, 2015 the Company announced it had received TSX approval to purchase up to 20,229,671 common shares (representing 5% of the Company's 404,593,425 total issued and outstanding common shares as of September 11, 2015) over a period of twelve months commencing onSeptember 23, 2015. The NCIB will expire no later than September 22, 2016. During the three months ended September 30, 2015 the Company purchased 119,400 shares under the NCIB at an average price of $12.26 per share. Subsequent to September 30, 2015, the Company purchased an additional 645,389 shares under the NCIB at an average price of $11.86 per share. Asset Impairment On August 8, 2012, the Company entered into an agreement with Hudbay Minerals Inc. (\"Hudbay\") to acquire an amount equal to 100% of the silver and gold production from its currently producing 777 mine, located in Canada, until the end of 2016, and 100% of the silver and 50% of the gold production for the remainder of the mine life. During the third quarter of 2015, the Company's management was informed that as a result of an unsuccessful drilling program at 777, Hudbay's management believes that the mine life for 777 is unlikely to be extended beyond 2020. As a result, during the third quarter of 2015, the estimate of future production from 777 was reduced, with this reduction representing an indicator of impairment related to the 777 silver and gold interests. At September 30, 2015, Silver Wheaton's management estimated that the recoverable amount under the 777 silver and gold interests was$147.5 million, representing its fair value less cost to sell and resulting in an impairment charge of $154.0 million. CRA Audit Update On July 6, 2015, the Company announced that it had received a proposal letter (the \"Proposal\") from the CRA in which the CRA was proposing to reassess Silver Wheaton under the transfer pricing provisions contained in the Income Tax Act (Canada) (the \"Act\"). Subsequent to the issuance of the Proposal, on September 24, 2015, the Company announced that it had received Notices of Reassessment (the \"Reassessments\") from the CRA for the 2005 to 2010 taxation years (the \"Relevant Taxation Years\"). The Reassessments are consistent with the Proposal and seek to increase the Company's income subject to tax in Canada for the Relevant Taxation Years by approximately Cdn$715.3 million which would result in federal and provincial tax of approximately Cdn$201.3 million. In addition, the CRA is seeking to impose transfer pricing penalties of approximately Cdn$71.5 million and interest and other penalties of Cdn$80.6 million for the Relevant Taxation Years. Total tax, interest and penalties sought by the CRA for the Relevant Taxation Years isCdn$353.4 million. The CRA's position in the Reassessments is that the transfer pricing provisions of the Act relating to income earned by the Company's foreign subsidiaries outside of Canada should apply such that the income of Silver Wheaton subject to tax in Canada should be increased by substantially all of the income of the Company's foreign subsidiaries. Management believes that the Company has filed its tax returns and paid applicable taxes in compliance with Canadian tax law, and as a result no amounts have been recorded for any potential liability arising from this matter. Silver Wheaton intends to vigorously defend its tax filing positions. As such, subsequent to September 30, 2015, Silver Wheaton has filed notices of objection for each of the Relevant Taxation Years. The Company will be required to make a deposit of Cdn$176.7 million representing 50% of the reassessed amounts of tax, interest and penalties. Silver Wheaton will seek to post security in the form of a letter of credit for this amount as opposed to a cash deposit. Cash that has been deposited in respect of a reassessment will be refunded, plus interest, if the Company is ultimately successful in challenging that reassessment. Events Subsequent to the Quarter Antamina Subsequent to the quarter, Silver Wheaton, through its wholly owned subsidiary Silver Wheaton (Caymans) Ltd. (\"SWC\"), has agreed to acquire fromAnani Investments Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Glencore plc (\"Glencore\") an amount of silver equal to 33.75% of the silver production until delivery of 140 million ounces of silver and 22.5% of silver production thereafter for the life of mine silver production from the Antamina mine, located in Peru. SWC will pay Glencore cash consideration of US$900 million for the silver stream. In addition, SWC will make ongoing payments of 20% of spot price per silver ounce delivered. The silver stream is effective September 30, 2015, and as a result, production and sales attributable to Silver Wheaton are forecast for the fourth quarter of 2015. Silver production is expected to average 4.7 million ounces per year over the first 20 years. Closing of the transaction is expected to occur prior to the end of November 2015 and is subject to the completion of certain corporate matters and customary conditions. (See Silver Wheaton's November 3, 2015 news release for full details.) Third Quarter Asset Highlights During the third quarter of 2015, attributable silver equivalent production was 11.0 million ounces (6.9 million ounces of silver and 54,500 ounces of gold), representing an increase of 24% compared with the third quarter of 2014. Operational highlights for the quarter ended September 30, 2015, are as follows: Salobo In the third quarter of 2015, Salobo produced a record 32,954 ounces of gold attributable to Silver Wheaton, an increase of approximately 216% relative to the third quarter of 2014. This increase was primarily due to the doubling of the percentage of gold that Silver Wheaton is entitled to and the increased throughput as a result of the expansion to 24 million tonnes per annum, which commenced production in mid-2014. According to Vale's third quarter of 2015 production report, the ramp-up of Salobo was weaker than expected in July and August but recovered in September with capacity utilization exceeding 90%. Salobo is expected to achieve 100% capacity utilization in the fourth quarter. Constancia In the third quarter of 2015, Constancia produced approximately 4,341 ounces of gold and 0.7 million ounces of silver attributable to Silver Wheaton as the mine declared commercial production on April 30, 2015, and it continues to ramp-up as expected. Penasquito In the third quarter of 2015, Penasquito produced a record 2.1 million ounces of silver attributable to Silver Wheaton, an increase of approximately 28% relative to the third quarter of 2014 due to higher grades being mined as substantial mining took place in the heart of the deposit. As disclosed inGoldcorp Inc.'s (\"Goldcorp\") third quarter of 2015 MD&A, construction of the Northern Well Field project remained suspended throughout the third quarter of 2015 due to an illegal blockade by a local community. Penasquito continues to seek a fair resolution of this matter with the community, while taking steps to enforce its contractual rights. Penasquito is also advancing alternatives for completion of the project without crossing through the affected community lands. Goldcorp believes that there will be timely resolution of this matter to meet the future water needs of Penasquito. The Metallurgical Enhancement Project feasibility study remains on schedule to be completed in early 2016. San Dimas In the third quarter of 2015, attributable production from San Dimas was 1.4 million ounces of silver, an increase of approximately 22% relative to the third quarter of 2014.2 This growth was primarily due to increased production as a result of the expansion to 2,500 tonnes per day (tpd), which was completed early in 2014, as well as to the sharing threshold increasing to 6 million ounces3, partially offset by the cessation of Goldcorp's four-year obligation to deliver 1.5 million ounces of silver to the Company on August 6, 2014. Silver sales in the third quarter of 2015 from San Dimas were a record 2.0 million ounces, an increase of 72% relative to the third quarter of 20142, as silver inventories built up in the second quarter of 2014 were subsequently sold. As at September 30, 2015, approximately 0.2 million ounces of cumulative payable silver ounces have been produced at San Dimas but not yet delivered to the Company, representing a decrease of 0.6 million payable silver ounces during the third quarter of 2015. As reported by Primero on July 6, 2015, silver deliveries in the second quarter had been delayed due to the suspension of Primero's import and export licenses in May 2015 by the Mexican customs authorities due to a discrepancy over Primero's address related to its corporate office relocation from Mexico City to Durango, Mexico. As per Primero's August 6, 2015, news release, the import and export license was reinstated and normal course imports and exports resumed, including the sales of all inventoried silver. Finally, as per Primero's third quarter of 2015 MD&A, during the third quarter, Primero achieved key milestones at both the San Dimas mine and the mill, tracking towards the completion of its expansion from 2,500 tpd to 3,000 tpd by the accelerated April 2016 completion date. Primero successfully connected the tunnel between the Sinaloa-Graben and Central mining blocks, providing a critical de-bottlenecking in the flow of machinery through theSan Dimas mine. At the San Dimas mill, Primero has completed the construction of foundations for the new secondary crusher and demolition of the old foundry is well advanced. The installation of the additional tailings pump is now complete and control has been handed over to the operations team. The new tailings filter and thickener are also in the process of fabrication and remain on-schedule for delivery to site in Q1 2016. Sudbury In the third quarter of 2015, attributable gold production from Vale's Sudbury mine was 5,967 ounces, a decrease of approximately 51% relative to the third quarter of 2014. According to Vale's third quarter of 2015 production report, the decrease was primarily due to planned maintenance shutdowns in the Sudbury surface plants in August 2015. As per Vale, key work completed as part of the shutdown encompassed the rebuild of the SAG mill, the overhaul of the acid plant in preparation for the implementation of the AER project (atmospheric emissions reduction project), and the upgrade of the environmental equipment at the Copper Cliff Nickel Refinery. It should also be noted that production in Q3 2014 was at an elevated level, as Vale processed large inventories of feed stock that had built up in Q2 2014 due to planned maintenance of surface facilities. Yauliyacu In the third quarter of 2015, attributable silver production from Yauliyacu was 0.7 million ounces, a decrease of approximately 20% relative to the third quarter of 2014, primarily due to lower grade being mined in the quarter. Barrick In the third quarter of 2015, attributable silver production from Barrick was 0.5 million ounces, an increase of approximately 27% relative to the third quarter of 2014, primarily due to higher grades at the Veladero mine and higher recoveries at the Lagunas Norte mine. 777 In the third quarter of 2015, 777 produced approximately 6,330 ounces of gold and 0.1 million ounces of silver attributable to Silver Wheaton, a decrease of approximately 48% and 37%, respectively, relative to the third quarter of 2014 primarily due to lower throughput and grades. Other Minto: In the third quarter of 2015, attributable gold production from Minto was 4,920 ounces, a decrease of approximately 29% relative to the third quarter of 2014, primarily due to lower grade being mined in the quarter. According to Capstone Mining Corp.'s (\"Capstone\") third quarter production results, the Minto mill processed solely underground and stockpiled ore while transitioning to the next open pit mining area. In addition, Capstone reported that the Yukon Water Board issued the final Water Use Licence on August 5, 2015, and that stripping of the Minto North open pit commenced immediately. Stripping of Minto North is reportedly on schedule for first ore to the mill starting in December 2015, with high grade ore commencing in the second quarter of 2016. Stratoni: In the third quarter of 2015, attributable silver production from Stratoni was 0.1 million ounces, a decrease of approximately 52% relative to the third quarter of 2014, primarily due to lower throughput as a result of fewer production stopes available in the mine as well as a five week suspension of operations in the quarter. As per Eldorado Gold Corporation's (\"Eldorado\") news release dated August 20, 2015, operations at the Stratoni mine were temporarily suspended as a direct result of the revocation by Greece's Ministry of Energy of the technical studies of Eldorado's projects in Halkidiki,Greece. As per Eldorado's news release dated October 5, 2015, mining operations have resumed at Halkidiki. Subsequent to the quarter, the Stratoni silver purchase agreement dated April 23, 2007, was amended in order to incentivize additional exploration and potentially extend the limited remaining mine life of Stratoni. The primary modification is to increase the production price per ounce of silver delivered to SWC over the current fixed price by one of the following amounts: i) US$2.50 if 10,000 meters of drilling is completed outside of the existing ore body and within SWC's defined area of interest (\"Expansion Drilling\"), ii) US$5.00 if 20,000 meters of Expansion Drilling is completed, and iii) US$7.00 if 30,000 meters of Expansion Drilling is completed. Drilling in all three cases must be completed by December 31, 2020, in order for the agreed upon increase in production price to be initiated.4 Produced But Not Yet Delivered 5 As at September 30, 2015, payable silver equivalent ounces produced but not yet delivered to Silver Wheaton by its partners decreased by 0.1 million ounces to approximately 6.3 million silver equivalent payable ounces, as increases at Salobo and Constancia were more than offset by decreases at San Dimas, 777 and Penasquito. Payable ounces produced but not yet delivered to Silver Wheaton are expected to average approximately two to three months of annualized production but may vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of mining operation factors including mine ramp-up, delays in shipments, and so forth. Detailed mine by mine production and sales figures can be found in the Appendix to this press release and in Silver Wheaton's MD&A in the 'Results of Operations and Operational Review' section. Sherritt International Corporation (S: TSX) Sherritt is a world leader in the mining and refining of nickel from lateritic ores with projects and operations in Canada, Cuba and Madagascar. The Corporation is the largest independent energy producer in Cuba, with extensive oil and power operations on the island. Sherritt licenses its proprietary technologies and provides metallurgical services to commercial metals operations worldwide. The Corporation's common shares are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol \"S\". Sherritt is committed to the highest standards of environment, health and safety practices at all of its operations, while making valuable contributions to local communities. Sherritt Announces Q3 2015 Results Nickel Net Direct Cash Costs Decline for the Third Consecutive Quarter TORONTO, ON--(Marketwired - October 27, 2015) - NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION TO UNITED STATES NEWSWIRE SERVICES OR FOR DISSEMINATION IN THE UNITED STATES Sherritt International Corporation (\"Sherritt\" or the \"Corporation\") (TSX: S), a world leader in the mining and refining of nickel from lateritic ores, today reported its financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. \"Operational performance, cost discipline and collecting overdue receivables all played a role this quarter in minimizing our use of cash,\" said David Pathe, President and CEO, Sherritt. \"We continue to operate in a severely depressed commodity pricing environment, with nickel and oil prices declining further during the quarter. In response to this reality, we have executed on further cost-cutting measures, including cutting our dividend and reducing expected capital spending for this year and next. In this environment, achieving financial completion at Ambatovy was a pivotal achievement, making the Ambatovy project debt non-recourse to us and our partners.\" \"We are working hard to position ourselves for long-term success when the commodity cycle turns favourable,\" continued Pathe. \"Operationally, we had record nickel production at Ambatovy, where we saw cash costs drop more than 20% from Q2, down to US$4.24 per pound. At Moa, our cash costs are bordering on first quartile, and I am confident we will get there with the addition of the third acid plant. In total, our two integrated operations now produce around 83,000 tonnes a year of Class 1 nickel.\" Q3 HIGHLIGHTS Nickel prices during the quarter hit a low closing price of US$4.22 per pound on August 24, 2015, a level not seen since 2008, and averaged US$4.78 in the quarter. Crude oil prices also declined since Q2 2015, with WTI crude prices closing at a low of US$38.24 per barrel on the same day and averaging US$46.56 in the quarter. Since quarter end, nickel prices have rebounded modestly from their lows to US$4.75 per pound and WTI is trading at US$44.46 per barrel (both prices at Oct. 26, 2015). Preserving cash was the Corporation's highest priority in the quarter, and cost discipline across all operations mitigated cash funding requirements outside Ambatovy. Total available liquidity at September 30, 2015 was $454.5 million, benefiting from a $40 million increase in available credit, after renewing and increasing the size of the syndicated 364-day revolver to $115 million (from $90 million last quarter) and the line of credit to $35 million (from $20 million last quarter). Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $373.8 million at September 30, 2015. Finished nickel production in the quarter was up 16% year over year at 9,730 tonnes (Sherritt's Share), driven by Ambatovy's strong performance. Net direct cash costs fell for the third consecutive quarter this year, to US$4.07 per pound at the Moa JV and US$4.24 per pound at Ambatovy. This demonstrates the longer term potential for Ambatovy's cash costs to be equal or better than the Moa JV cash costs, as production ramps up to full capacity and maintenance costs continue to decline. Ambatovy Financial Completion was announced by press release September 21, 2015. Ten certificates were filed to meet the criteria, covering a range of construction, operational, environmental, financial and legal obligations. With financial completion achieved, the project financing that was put in place for construction is now non-recourse to all of the partners. Reducing combined administrative expenses has been a priority this year, with year to date combined administrative expenses down 25% over the nine month period last year. This quarter's combined administrative expenses of $18.6 million are down 10% from last year, although higher than their levels in Q2, due to $4.5 million in Ambatovy arbitration award legal costs discussed in Note 6 to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Financial Statements), and related to the close-out of construction contracts that were in dispute. No other income statement impact was recorded from these awards. All amounts are Canadian dollars unless otherwise indicated. For additional information see the Non-GAAP measures section of this press release. Compared to the same period in the prior year. Shown on Sherritt's attributable share ownership basis. OUTLOOK AND SIGNIFICANT ITEMS During the quarter, the Corporation recorded an impairment expense of $80.6 million ($0.27 per share) on its oil assets in Cuba and Spain. This impairment arises mainly from lower oil price forecasts impacting future cash flows, with lower production from the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) Extension wells being a contributing factor. Oil production guidance was reduced to 18,500 barrels of oil per day (bopd) on a Gross Working Interest (GWI) basis, and 11,300 bopd on a Net Working Interest basis (NWI) for the year ending December 31, 2015 from the previously forecast level of 19,000 bopd reflecting the results this year from the PSC Extension drilling. Drilling activity on the PSC Extension has ended, and capital expenditures have been reduced with new guidance of $71 million expected for the full year. During the quarter, SNC-Lavalin exercised their put option to divest their 5% equity interest in the Ambatovy JV, selling their equity stake and share of partner loans to existing partner Sumitomo Corporation for approximately $600 million. Sherritt had the right to acquire this equity stake along with Sumitomo, but declined. As a result, the Ambatovy call option expired, resulting in a $13.7 million loss (non-cash) within the net finance expense this quarter. Sumitomo now owns 32.5% of Ambatovy, with Sherritt at 40% and Korea Resources at 27.5%. Sherritt also announces that Dean Chambers has agreed to continue in his current role as Executive Vice President and CFO, and will adjust his planned retirement timing. Given Mr. Chambers' long executive tenure and critical role with the Ambatovy partner and lender groups, Dean is particularly well suited to his current role at this time. David Bacon has confirmed his intention to return to his former employer in an expanded role.  During the third quarter, $118.6 million ($0.40 per share) in adjusting items occurred that mainly included the Oil & Gas impairment described earlier, a $13.7 million adjustment for the expiry of the call option associated with the SNC-Lavalin put exercise, and an unrealized $10.2 million foreign exchange loss. Other less material adjustments of $7.5 million in aggregate represent Ambatovy inventory impairment and legal costs on unfavourable Ambatovy arbitration awards relating to construction contracts that have now been closed out, and are described in Note 6 to the Financial Statements. Subsequent to the quarter end, a third arbitration award was received, which was in Sherritt's favour and will have a positive cash flow impact if and when collected. REVIEW OF OPERATIONS METALS Includes results for certain 100% owned assets at Fort Saskatchewan plant. Includes results for Sherritt's marketing organization for certain Ambatovy sales. Represents the post-commercial production period except for production volumes and nickel recovery. For additional information, see the Non-GAAP measures section of this release. METAL MARKETS Nickel spot prices hit a multi-year low of US$4.22 per pound on August 24, 2015, a day of commodity and broader equity market panic after Chinese stock market indices fell by 9%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average opened down 1,000 points. Since that time, nickel prices have rebounded to some degree, trading in a range of US$4.50 - $4.75 per pound in recent weeks. Average realized prices of nickel at the Moa Joint Venture and the Ambatovy Joint Venture were $6.31 and $6.02 per pound, respectively, following the reference price decline, but benefitting from foreign exchange translation as the Canadian dollar weakened by approximately eight cents from the second quarter to the third quarter this year. The average cobalt reference price of US$13.32 per pound in the third quarter was also down from its year ago comparable of US$14.74, and close to the Q2 2015 average reference price of US$13.61 per pound. Average realized prices of cobalt this quarter were up marginally from their year ago levels, as the decline in the reference price was offset by the weaker Canadian dollar. The cobalt market remains fairly well balanced with continued strong demand in the aerospace and rechargeable battery sectors and lower than forecast production in Zambia. Moa Joint Venture (50% interest) and Fort Site Adjusted EBITDA of $2.2 million continued to follow commodity price declines, despite a third consecutive quarter of improved Net Direct Cash Costs. Finished nickel production of 4,521 tonnes (50% basis) for the third quarter of 2015 was marginally lower than the prior year quarter, but up 17% from production in Q2 of 3,877 tonnes (50% basis) when the annual refinery shutdown occurred. Finished cobalt production of 491 tonnes (50% basis) for the third quarter of 2015 was higher than the prior year quarter, and higher than Q2 2015 cobalt production of 429 tonnes (50% basis), again reflecting the shutdown, and a higher cobalt ratio in the mined ore year to date. The nickel recovery at Moa of 89% in the quarter was up from the 86% recovery in Q3 of last year, and consistent with Q2 2015 nickel recovery levels. The net direct cash cost of US$4.07 per pound of nickel was an improvement of 22% (US$1.18 per pound) from the third quarter of 2014, and the lowest reported year to date. Lower fuel oil and energy prices and lower third party feed costs have been significant drivers to improved cash costs, and the effort to focus on controllable costs has paid off. Cobalt by-product credits of US$1.39 per pound are fairly consistent each quarter, ranging from US$1.25 to US$1.40 over the last six quarters. Fertilizer revenues this quarter of $11.8 million were lower than costs of $12.7 million. Costs were impacted by higher maintenance expenses (shutdown-related) that were carried through inventory and impacted third quarter fertilizer costs due to the timing of sales. This quarter included deferred revenue of $20.5 million of cash received on pre-sales of fertilizer to be delivered primarily in Q4 and the spring season of 2016, at which time their revenue will be recognized. Capital spending of $19.6 million in the quarter and $43.6 million year to date is higher than its comparison periods, due to the once in 10 year maintenance shutdown at Fort Saskatchewan last quarter, and a weaker Canadian dollar, with expansion capital as budgeted for the construction of the 2,000 tonne per day acid plant on track for the second half of 2016. Ambatovy Joint Venture (40% interest) Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter was negative $2.5 million during the quarter compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $4.3 million in the same quarter last year. For the nine month period ended September 30, 2015, Adjusted EBITDA of $0.1 million compares with $2 million in the same period last year. During the quarter, finished nickel production was 5,209 tonnes (40% basis), a record production quarter and an improvement of 39 % over last year. Finished cobalt production of 392 tonnes (40% basis) was also up 20% year over year and up 48% from production levels in the second quarter. As announced October 6, 2015, Sherritt received confirmation that finished nickel briquettes from Ambatovy now meet the standards to qualify for delivery to London Metal Exchange (LME) warehouses. This recognition demonstrates the technical and metallurgical capabilities that Sherritt has contributed as operator during Ambatovy's ramp-up. LME delivery status allows Ambatovy or its customers the flexibility and commercial advantage of delivering nickel product to LME warehouses where logistics benefits exist or to mitigate short term variance in customer demand. Robust third quarter production of both nickel and cobalt is attributable to process control enhancements and improved operational stability, continuing the ramp-up of production to nameplate capacity. During the quarter, the second ore thickener returned to production. A planned autoclave train turnaround was executed in September, with further turnarounds scheduled in October and November. The Q3 nickel recovery was 88% compared to 86% in Q2, primarily due to efficiency improvements in the mixed sulphide precipitation circuit. The net direct cash cost (NDCC) of nickel was US$4.24 per pound in the third quarter of 2015, and has been coming down sharply each quarter this year, from US$5.74 per pound in Q1 and US$5.48 per pound in Q2. Net direct cash costs at Ambatovy are now in line with the Moa JV, reflecting increased production, lower maintenance and labour costs, and lower commodity input costs. In September this year, Ambatovy achieved financial completion (see \"Highlights\", page 1). Under the terms of the Ambatovy Joint Venture Financing, a supermajority group of the lenders may, within 45 days of achieving financial completion, initiate a challenge to reinstate the completion guarantees. In order for any challenge to succeed, the lenders would need to prove that one or more of the completion certificates is false in a materially adverse way to the lenders' interest. During a challenge, if one occurs, Sherritt's proportionate share of the outstanding project debt would remain non-recourse to Sherritt until a final ruling or settlement occurs. Filing of the Financial Certificate required the deposit of US$115 million (100% basis) to fund the Senior Debt Reserve Account (SDRA), from which payments of semi-annual principal and interest can be made on the Ambatovy Joint Venture Financing. In the third quarter, the Ambatovy partners provided US$174 million in funding. From this funding and the opening cash balance, the SDRA was funded, and US$65 million was paid out to settle arbitration rulings as described in Note 6 to the Financial Statements. On a year to date basis, Ambatovy partners have funded US$264 million, with Sherritt's share being 40% or US$105.6 million. With submission of the final certificates, the US$1.7 billion Ambatovy Joint Venture Financing (100% basis, balance at September 30, 2015) has become non-recourse to the Ambatovy partners, and the interest rate has increased from LIBOR plus 1.4% to LIBOR plus approximately 2.5%. Going into the fourth quarter this year, the Ambatovy cash and cash equivalents position (100% basis) is at $200.5 million as reported in Note 6 to the Financial Statements. OIL AND GAS Adjusted EBITDA was 56% ($26.9 million) lower in the third quarter compared to the prior year period, with realized oil and gas prices down 47% over the same period. In the Cuban operations, the average-realized price in the third quarter was $36.36 per barrel, as oil prices reached multi-year lows in August this year. GWI oil production in Cuba of 17,693 bopd decreased by 9% in the third quarter compared to the prior year period, primarily due to natural reservoir declines and lower than expected production from the PSC Extension wells. Counting three wells drilled in 2014 and five drilled this year, a total of eight new wells have now been drilled and completed, which is one more than required to fulfill commitments under the PSC Extension for the Puerto Escondido/Yumuri oil fields. Of the eight, six are currently producing oil, one is suspended and one has been abandoned. Oil production from these new PSC Extension wells is below expectations, with production guidance revised accordingly. NWI oil production in Cuba of 10,354 bopd increased by 3% over the same quarter in 2014 despite the 9% decrease in Cuban GWI oil production. Cost recovery oil production of 4,349 bopd compared to 2,428 bopd in the same period last year illustrates the higher proportion of cost recovery oil when oil prices are low. The allocation of cost recovery barrels in any particular period is limited to a fixed percentage of GWI volumes within each cost pool. In the first quarter this year, when oil prices were similar to prices in the third quarter, the caps on the applicable cost pools prevented a higher cost recovery allocation. Expenditures above the caps were then carried forward, and were applied for cost recoveries in the second and third quarter. Eligible costs are being carried forward for application in future quarters. Unit operating costs in Cuba decreased 9% ($0.94 per barrel) to $9.04 (GWI basis) in the third quarter compared to the prior year period, reflecting lower well workover costs. The robust free cash flow generation of $35.7 million in the quarter benefited from the collection of overdue receivables, and a quarter of comparatively low capital spending, at $11.7 million. Overdue receivables continue to be paid in accordance with the schedule agreed with the Cuban partners, with overdue receivables expected to fall to normal levels by year end. On a year to date basis, capital spending of $55.2 million is up 22% year over year, consistent with the higher capital expenditures required to drill the PSC Extension. Further evaluation of the wells drilled under the PSC Extension will be carried out this quarter, but drilling results to date and continuing capital and cost discipline have prompted further capital reductions, leading to a revised estimate of $71 million ($68 million sustaining and $3 million exploration) for 2015 compared to the previous guidance of $81 million. As referenced in the Q3 2015 MD&A and Note 17 to the Financial Statements, an impairment expense of $80.6 million ($0.27 per share) was recorded on Cuban and Spain oil assets in the quarter. The lower oil price forecast, combined with drilling results on the PSC extension that were below expectations, are the reasons for the impairment. POWER Quarterly Adjusted EBITDA increased by 20% ($1.6 million) year over year with higher production and higher realized prices. Higher gas availability led to higher production, while the average realized price benefitted from the weaker Canadian dollar. The average-realized price of electricity was 20% higher ($9.07 per MWh) in the third quarter compared to the prior year period. Operating costs increased by 30% ($4.03 per MWh) in the third quarter compared to the prior year period, due to an increase in equipment purchases and processing equipment repairs, as well as the weaker Canadian dollar. Free cash flow generation of $14.7 million in the quarter included a $4.0 million payment of interest on the Energas conditional sales agreement ($35.1 million year to date). Principal on the Energas conditional sales agreement also continues to be repaid on schedule, with a further $10.4 million received in the quarter ($25.8 million year to date). STRATEGIC PRIORITIES 2015 Sherritt continues to execute against its stated strategy to focus on its core competencies, improve its liquidity position and streamline its operations, consisting of the following near-term priorities:  OUTLOOK In the current quarter, the changes to expected production and capital spending come from Oil & Gas, where expected production on both a GWI and NWI basis have been reduced to reflect the drilling results on the PSC Extension wells at Puerto Escondido/Yumuri. Drilling activity has ended, and capital spending has also been reduced accordingly. NON-GAAP MEASURES The Corporation uses combined results, Adjusted EBITDA, average-realized price, unit operating cost, and adjusted operating cash flow to monitor the performance of the Corporation and its operating divisions and believes these measures enable investors and analysts to compare the Corporation's financial performance with its competitors and evaluate the results of its underlying business. These measures do not have a standard definition under IFRS and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. As these measures do not have a standardized meaning, they may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other companies. See Sherritt's Management's Discussion and Analysis for the period ended September 30, 2015 for further information.

Headquartered in Vancouver, Canada, we own, or have an interest in, 12 mines in Canada, the United States, Chile and Peru. We also operate a large metallurgical complex, are partners in a wind power facility, and are a significant producer of specialty metals such as germanium and indium. We are actively exploring for copper, zinc and gold in the Americas, Asia Pacific, Europe and Africa. TECK REPORTS UNAUDITED THIRD QUARTER RESULTS FOR 2015 October 22, 2015 - Vancouver, BC - Teck Resources Limited (TSX: TCK.A and TCK.B, NYSE: TCK) (\"Teck\") reported adjusted profit attributable to shareholders of $29 million, or $0.05 per share, in the third quarter of 2015. Teck also reported non-cash after-tax impairment charges of $2.2 billion resulting in a third quarter loss attributable to shareholders of $2.1 billion, or $3.73 per share. The impairment charges are non-cash revaluations of assets to reflect lower market expectations of commodity prices. \"We are taking significant steps to meet the challenge of low commodity prices,\" said Don Lindsay, President and CEO. \"We have reduced costs throughout the company and we've raised nearly $1 billion in two streaming transactions. We used a portion of those proceeds to reduce debt by $400 million and our current cash balance of $1.8 billion exceeds our remaining $1.5 billion share of capital required for Fort Hills.\" Highlights and Significant Items Gross profit before depreciation and amortization was $670 million in the third quarter* compared with $752 million in the third quarter of 2014. Cash flow from operations, before working capital changes, was $302 million in the third* quarter of 2015 compared with $553 million a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA (not including non-cash impairment charges of $2.9 billion) was $389* million in the third quarter. Adjusted EBITDA before final pricing adjustments was $530 million. We recorded impairment charges in the aggregate of $2.2 billion on an after-tax basis ($2.9* billion pre-tax) including $1.5 billion on our steelmaking coal assets, $0.3 billion on copper and $0.4 billion on the Fort Hills oil sands project resulting in a loss attributable to shareholders of $2.1 billion. Our debt to debt-plus-equity ratio was 36% at September 30, and our net debt to net-debtplus-equity* ratio was 32%. Giving effect to the impairments and our recent streaming transaction and debt repayments, our pro forma debt to debt-plus-equity ratio and net debt to net-debt-plus-equity ratios at September 30, 2015 were 35% and 30%, respectively. Subsequent to quarter end, we completed the sale of a silver stream linked to our share of the Antamina mine. Taken together with the gold stream sold from the Carmen de Andacollo Operations which closed during the third quarter, these transactions have increased our cash position by approximately $1 billion. Our cash balance of $1.8 billion as of October 21 is more than our $1.5 billion share of costs required to complete Fort Hills. We also have an additional US$3 billion undrawn credit facility that can be used for general corporate purposes and US$1.2 billion available for cash draws or for letters of credit. We have certain contractual arrangements that may result in us having to issue letters of credit that would utilize substantially all of this US$1.2 billion facility. Our cost reduction program combined with a falling Canadian dollar, lower oil prices, and higher copper grades have contributed to reduce our U.S. dollar unit costs for our products with copper and steelmaking coal unit costs falling by US$0.20 per pound and US$20 per tonne, respectively, compared to last year. In response to steelmaking coal market conditions, our steelmaking coal mines took threeweek shutdowns during the third quarter to reduce production and product inventory. In the fourth quarter we expect that production rates will be aligned with sales volumes. We have reached agreements with the majority of our customers for the fourth quarter of 2015, based on a quarterly benchmark of US$89 per tonne for the highest quality product and we expect total sales in the fourth quarter, including spot sales, to be at least 6 million tonnes of steelmaking coal. The Red Dog concentrate shipping season is expected to be completed on October 22 with shipments of 1,048,000 tonnes of zinc concentrate. We expect sales of 200,000 tonnes in the fourth quarter reflecting the normal seasonal pattern of Red Dog sales. Our Quebrada Blanca operation restarted normal production activities in late August after unexpected ground movement in late June caused a temporary shutdown of processing facilities. We expect to produce 38,000 tonnes of copper cathode in 2015, a reduction of about 10,000 tonnes compared to the original plan. This document contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the cautionary language under the heading \"CAUTIONARY STATEMENT ON FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION\" below. Overview Prices for our products continued to fall in the third quarter. These declines have had a significant effect on our reported earnings this period, as we recorded $141 million of negative pricing adjustments in addition to the direct effect of lower prices on gross profit. Furthermore, we recorded $2.9 billion (pre-tax) ($2.2 billion after-tax) of impairment charges based on market expectations of lower prices over the short, medium and long terms. The details of these charges are noted below. Lower price forecasts also resulted in negative credit rating actions. More details on our credit rating impacts are included in the \"Financial Position and Liquidity\" section below. To meet the challenge of low prices, we have taken significant steps. We reduced costs across all aspects of our organization in an ongoing and highly focused program. We reduced capital expenditures in the current year and are reducing our planned spending in future years. After the end of the quarter, we completed the sale of a silver stream linked to our share of the Antamina mine. Taken together with the gold stream sold from the Carmen de Andacollo Operation which closed during the third quarter, these transactions have increased our cash position by approximately $1 billion. Subsequent to quarter end we reduced our debt, repaying US$300 million on October 1. While we have reduced spending, we continue to advance our growth plans on a selective basis. The construction of the Fort Hills project remains on time and on budget and we continue to advance permitting and design optimization activities for the Quebrada Blanca Phase 2 project with a clear focus on capital expenditure reduction. In the longer term, the merging of our Relincho project with Goldcorp's El Morro project in Project Corridor is expected to result in a less capital intensive project with higher potential returns. We continue to focus on capital discipline and cost reduction. Profit and Adjusted Profit Profit (loss) attributable to shareholders was $(2.1) billion, or $(3.73) per share, in the third quarter compared with $84 million or $0.14 per share in the same period last year. Adjusted profit attributable to shareholders, before items identified in the table below, was $29 million, or $0.05 per share, in the third quarter compared with $159 million or $0.28 per share in the same period last year. During the quarter we recorded asset and goodwill impairment charges on a number of our operating assets, including our investment in the Fort Hills project, the Carmen de Andacollo and the Pend Oreille zinc mines and a number of our steelmaking coal mines. These charges total $2.9 billion on a pre-tax basis and $2.2 billion on an after-tax basis. The write-downs were triggered primarily by lowered expectations for commodity prices in both the short and longterm. The economic models we use in determining the amount of impairment charges use current prices in the initial years and transition to longer term prices in years three to five. Longterm assumptions are as follows; steelmaking coal US$130 per tonne, copper US$3.00 per pound, zinc US$1.00 per pound, WTI US$75 per barrel and $1.25 Canadian to U.S. dollar exchange rate. Adjusted profit of $29 million includes inventory write-downs totaling $61 million resulting from low commodity prices, and final pricing adjustments of $141 million primarily on our copper and zinc receivables. These total $129 million on an after-tax basis and are included in reported adjusted profits. STEELMAKING COAL BUSINESS UNIT Performance Gross profit before depreciation and amortization from our steelmaking coal business unit increased from year ago levels as the benefits of our cost reduction program and lower diesel prices more than offset lower sales volumes and realized steelmaking coal prices. The average realized steelmaking coal price of US$88 per tonne was 20% lower than the third quarter of 2014, reflecting oversupplied steelmaking coal market conditions and a decline in spot price assessments. The favourable effect of a stronger U.S. dollar in the third quarter partly offset the lower price, which weakened by 3% in Canadian dollar terms compared with the same period a year ago. Third quarter production of 5.5 million tonnes was 19% lower than the same period a year ago matching our guidance for the period as all of our sites completed the three week shutdown previously announced. Unit production costs at the mines were 10% lower this quarter than in the comparative period, despite the lower production rates as a result of the ongoing effects of existing and new initiatives undertaken through our cost reduction program, and lower diesel prices. Property, plant and equipment expenditures totaled $21 million in the third quarter, of which $13 million was spent on sustaining capital. Capitalized stripping costs were $84 million in the third quarter compared with $81 million a year ago. We continue to implement the water quality management measures contemplated by our Elk Valley Water Quality Plan. The water treatment facility built at our Line Creek Operations is now in the process of being commissioned and is expected to be operating at design capacity in early 2016. Markets Steelmaking coal prices declined further during the quarter. Although Chinese imports have declined substantially compared to the prior year, demand in the rest of the world continues to be strong for our products. However, given oversupply in the market, we do not expect a substantial recovery in price until additional supply cuts occur or demand increases. Steelmaking coal prices for the fourth quarter of 2015 have been agreed with the majority of our quarterly priced customers based on US$89 per tonne for the highest quality products. This is consistent with prices reportedly achieved by our competitors. Additional sales priced on a spot basis will reflect market conditions when sales are concluded. Operations Each of the mines were shut down for three weeks during the quarter with shipments to customers fulfilled from existing inventories where required. Line Creek recovered quickly and efficiently from the landslide event they experienced in early July and by the end of the quarter had made up the vast majority of the production lost while down for repairs to the critical infrastructure including the site's main access road and raw steelmaking coal conveyance system. In addition, the business unit's processing yields remained higher than budget and site costs were lower than in the comparative period. Our cost reduction initiatives continue to produce significant results and remain focused on improvements in equipment and labour productivity, reduced use of contractors, reduced consumable usage and limiting the use of higher cost equipment. However, a number of factors have partially offset the strong performance of our cost reduction program. These included the effects of the strengthening U.S. dollar on some inputs and higher electricity costs. In the third quarter of 2015, we continued to experience the positive effects of lower diesel prices. Combined with reduced usage from a number of our cost reduction initiatives and slightly shorter haul distances, diesel costs per tonne produced have decreased by 38% compared to the third quarter of 2014. Cost of Sales Site cost of sales in the third quarter of 2015, before depreciation and inventory write-downs, was $45 per tonne, $5 per tonne or 10% lower than a year ago. Our total cost of sales for the quarter also included a $10 per tonne charge for the amortization of capitalized stripping costs and $18 per tonne for other depreciation. In U.S. dollar terms, unit costs have fallen by $20 per tonne from $84 per tonne to $64 per tonne due to reductions in the site costs as shown in the Canadian dollar unit cost table and the change in exchange rates. Outlook Vessel nominations for quarterly contract shipments are determined by customers and final sales and average prices for the quarter will depend on product mix, market direction for spot priced sales, timely arrival of vessels, as well as the performance of the rail transportation network and steelmaking coal-loading facilities. We continue to expect our 2015 steelmaking coal production to be in the range of 25 to 26 million tonnes and now expect unit costs to be in the range of $83 to $86 per tonne (US$64 to US$66 per tonne). In addition, capital expenditures are now expected to total $500 million, including $395 million of capitalized mining. COPPER BUSINESS UNIT Performance Gross profit before depreciation and amortization from our copper business unit decreased by $91 million in the third quarter compared with a year ago (see table below). This was primarily due to lower realized copper prices and inventory write-downs, which was partially offset by lower unit operating costs and the positive effects of the stronger U.S. dollar. Copper production increased by 13% (10,000 tonnes) compared to a year ago, despite reduced production as a result of ground movement at Quebrada Blanca in June and the closure of Duck Pond which ceased operating on June 30, 2015. Copper production at Highland Valley Copper was 10,500 tonnes higher than a year ago primarily due to higher grade and recoveries while our share of production from Antamina increased by 6,500 tonnes as a result of record mill throughput during the quarter. Copper production was also higher at Carmen de Andacollo, although production was lower at Quebrada Blanca after processing facilities were temporarily shut down due to unanticipated ground movement in late June. Capital expenditures totaled $69 million, including $37 million for sustaining capital and $25 million for new mine development, of which $21 million was for the Quebrada Blanca Phase 2 project. Capitalized stripping costs were $51 million in the third quarter, lower than the $55 million a year ago. Markets LME copper prices averaged US$2.39 per pound in the third quarter of 2015, down 13% over the prior period. Copper prices remained volatile trading to the lowest levels since 2009. Total reported exchange stocks rose 51,872 tonnes during the quarter to 0.5 million tonnes. Total reported global copper stocks are now estimated to be 8.3 days of global consumption, below the estimated 25 year average of 28 days of global consumption. Operational issues at copper mines continue to impact current and future mine production. As a result of these supply disruptions and price related mine suspensions, large copper surpluses originally forecast for 2015 and 2016 have moved closer to balance despite weaker demand growth. Market fundamentals remain positive over the medium to long-term with supply constrained by lower grades, ongoing operational difficulties and project delays or deferrals due to the current low prices. Operations Highland Valley Copper Copper production was 40,200 tonnes in the third quarter or 35% higher than a year ago, due to higher copper grades and higher recoveries. Mill throughput was lower than a year ago due to harder ore in the current phase of the Valley pit. Molybdenum production declined to 0.7 million pounds from 1.6 million pounds a year ago primarily due to lower grade, partially offset by higher recovery. Operating costs increased $18 million or 16% compared to the same period a year ago as a result of higher sales. Unit costs declined significantly compared to a year ago due to higher sales and substantial progress on cost savings programs. As we continue to mine the higher grade but harder ore in the current phase of the Valley pit, throughput is expected to remain similar for the remainder of 2015. Grades are expected to be lower in the final quarter compared to the previous quarter, but will remain above reserve grade. The crusher relocation project for the Valley pit was successfully completed in the third quarter for a total cost of $56 million, well below the budget of $69 million. This project provides access to over 30 million tonnes of reserves as part of our current life of mine plan. Antamina Copper production in the third quarter increased by 36% compared with a year ago primarily as a result of higher mill throughput. The mix of mill feed in the quarter was 57% copper-only ore and 43% copper-zinc ore compared to 63% and 37%, respectively, in the same period a year ago. Our share of zinc production of 16,300 tonnes in the third quarter decreased by 1% compared with a year ago due to lower grades, partially offset by higher mill throughput and greater copper-zinc ore processed. Antamina achieved mill throughput of 14.3 million tonnes for the quarter, an average of 155,400 tonnes per day, 16% higher than the same period last year. Recent debottlenecking projects focused primarily on the crushing and conveying system have enabled throughputs much higher than the 130,000 tonnes per day design capacity of the original expansion project. Throughput rates going forward will be dependent on ore hardness and the mix of ore feeds to the plant, but are expected to continue above original design capacity rates. Operating costs in the third quarter were 14% higher compared to a year ago due to higher sales. Significant progress has been made in reducing U.S. dollar unit costs, with savings more than offset by foreign currency translation and the effects of the weaker Canadian dollar. On October 7, 2015, we announced that we and a subsidiary had entered into a long-term streaming agreement with a subsidiary of Franco-Nevada Corporation (Franco-Nevada) linked to production at the Antamina mine. Compania Minera Antamina S.A., in which we hold a 22.5% interest and which owns and operates Antamina is not a party to the agreement and operations will not be affected. Franco-Nevada made a payment of US$610 million and will pay 5% of the spot price at the time of delivery for each ounce of silver delivered under the agreement. We will deliver silver to Franco-Nevada equivalent to 22.5% of payable silver sold by CMA, using a silver payability factor of 90%. After 86 million ounces of silver have been delivered under the agreement, the stream will be reduced by one third. Quebrada Blanca Copper production in the third quarter decreased by 46% compared with a year ago due to the precautionary suspension of mining in the area adjacent to the SX/EW plant and a temporary shutdown of the processing facilities. Heap leach ore placed decreased by 37% as a result of the ground movement. Normal operations resumed in August, although mining continues to be restricted and stable operations were achieved for the month of September at better than planned unit costs. We will continue to operate the south side of the EW plant only which has sufficient production capacity for the remainder of the mine life. Production for 2015 is expected to be about 38,000 tonnes of copper cathode. The full impact on the mine life and future operating plans continues to be assessed in conjunction with remedial plans to ensure stability of the mine, plant and associated infrastructure. These plans will be finalized by the end of the year as we complete our engineering assessments, budgeting and further cost reduction processes. Operating costs increased by $32 million or 49% compared with the same period a year ago primarily as a result of inventory write-downs to reflect lower copper prices and the effects of the weaker Canadian dollar. We continue to progress the updating of environmental permits for the existing facilities for the supergene operation. The review and indigenous consultation processes by the relevant regulatory agencies are still in progress as we await approval. All three labour agreements at Quebrada Blanca were successfully negotiated during the quarter, each with a term of two years. Carmen de Andacollo Copper production in the third quarter increased by 9% compared with a year ago primarily as a result of higher copper recovery and higher throughput. In late September, a major earthquake in the region damaged our ship loading facilities at the port of Coquimbo. To date production has not been materially affected, but shipments of concentrate have been temporarily suspended through the port facility while the operator completes damage assessments and repairs. Alternate loading arrangements are being arranged with resumption of shipping anticipated within the next two weeks. There is sufficient storage capacity at the port and mine site through to the end of October. Operating costs decreased by $4 million or 5% compared with a year ago due to lower sales, and partially offset by the effect of the stronger U.S. dollar. U.S. dollar unit costs were similar to the same period a year ago. During the quarter and extending into early October, both Carmen de Andacollo labour agreements were successfully re-negotiated for a four-year term. On July 8th, 2015, our subsidiary Compania Minera Teck Carmen de Andacollo (Carmen de Andacollo) sold an interest in gold reserves and resources from the Carmen de Andacollo mine to RGLD Gold AG (RGLDAG), a wholly owned subsidiary of Royal Gold, Inc. Under the terms of the agreement, RGLDAG is entitled to an amount of gold equal to 100% of the payable gold produced from the Andacollo mine until 900,000 ounces have been delivered, and 50% thereafter. RGLDAG will pay a cash price of 15% of the monthly average gold price at the time of each delivery. Carmen de Andacollo and Royal Gold Chile Limitada, a wholly owned subsidiary of Royal Gold, Inc., terminated an earlier royalty agreement entered into in 2010. Royal Gold Chile Limitada was entitled to a payment based on 75% of payable gold produced from the Andacollo mine until 910,000 ounces had been delivered, and 50% thereafter. Approximately 260,000 ounces of payable gold subject to the royalty agreement were produced through June 30, 2015, the effective date of the termination. Net cash proceeds to us from the transaction were US$162 million. Cost of Sales Unit cash costs of product sold in the third quarter of 2015 as reported in U.S. dollars, before cash margins for by-products, decreased primarily due to higher sales volumes, continued cost reduction efforts and the favourable effects of a stronger U.S. dollar at our Canadian operations. Copper Development Projects Quebrada Blanca Phase 2 During the third quarter of 2015, activities continued to focus on capital optimization and permitting for the Quebrada Blanca Phase 2 project. A decision has been made to move the proposed tailings facility to a location closer to the mine site. The proposed facility is expected to provide sufficient capacity for tailings from ore mined during the first 25 years of the mine life. This decision, as well as other plant and infrastructure optimizations in the current design, is expected to materially reduce initial capital costs for the project. We expect to complete a new cost estimate in the first half of 2016 as engineering on these design changes progresses. The design is expected to have a lower capital intensity as throughput and production rates are not anticipated to be lower. Additional baseline work is required as a result of these changes and we now anticipate submitting an Environmental Impact Assessment to the authorities mid to late 2016. Project Corridor In August we announced an agreement with Goldcorp Inc. to combine the El Morro and Relincho projects, located approximately 40 kilometres apart in the Huasco Province in the Atacama region of Chile, into a single project. Teck and Goldcorp will contribute their respective project interests into a 50/50 joint venture with closing of the transaction anticipated in the fourth quarter. In combination with community consultation, a pre-feasibility study is expected to commence in early 2016 and be completed in approximately 18 months. Other Copper Projects We continue to minimize expenditures on all other copper projects. Targeted studies continue at the Galore Creek, Schaft Creek and Mesaba projects as we further explore ways to enhance the value of these projects. The pre-feasibility study continued to progress at our 50% owned Zafranal copper-gold project located in southern Peru and is now anticipated to be complete at the end of the first quarter in 2016. Outlook We expect full year production for copper in the range of 345 to 350 thousand tonnes. ZINC BUSINESS UNIT Performance Gross profit before depreciation and amortization from our zinc business unit was unchanged year over year. A lower realized zinc price in U.S. dollars and lower contributions from coproducts and by-products were offset by the favourable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, lower royalties, higher sales and lower operating costs. Refined zinc production from our Trail Operations increased by 11% compared to last year due to improved operating efficiencies in the electrolytic plant and to the improved reliability of the new acid plant, leading to higher throughput. The table below summarizes the gross profit change, before depreciation and amortization, in our zinc business unit for the quarter. Markets LME zinc prices averaged US$0.84 per pound in the third quarter of 2015, down 16% over the prior quarter. Zinc prices fell to a low of US$0.71 per pound in the quarter, the lowest level since 2009. Reported zinc exchange stocks rose 111,560 tonnes during the quarter to end at 756,060 tonnes. Total global reported stocks are now estimated at 19 days of global consumption down from the 25 year average of 42 days. Demand for refined zinc in our key North American markets remains weaker again this quarter with our customers facing headwinds from reduced demand and continued imports of low-cost galvanized sheet. Zinc stocks continue to decline in both metal and concentrates year to date. Zinc supply will become further constrained later in 2015 and into 2016 with planned mine closures including the recently announced closures from major suppliers taking effect. Operations Red Dog Zinc grade and recovery was similar to 2014, however, mill throughput was lower than the third quarter of 2014 due to lower throughput rate and unplanned mill downtime resulting in 12% less zinc production. Higher lead grade offset by lower recovery and throughput than in 2014 resulted in 8% less lead production. Zinc sales volumes were similar to the third quarter of 2014. Operating costs in the current quarter increased due to the effects of the stronger U.S. dollar. Capitalized stripping costs were $11 million in the third quarter compared with $9 million a year ago. Trail Zinc production was 11% higher this quarter than in the third quarter of 2014 as a result of improved reliability of the new acid plants and good current efficiency in the zinc cell house. Lead production was 8% lower than a year ago as the annual KIVCET shutdown was advanced from the fourth quarter to the third quarter. Cost of sales increased by 5%, largely related to higher zinc production and sales during the quarter. Pend Oreille Mill throughput was 81% of design capacity of 2,000 tonnes per day during the third quarter due to delays in fully implementing pillar recovery mining. The concentrator is performing as anticipated with recoveries expected to improve as mill feed variability is reduced. Outlook The Pend Oreille mine is forecasted to reach the full production rate of 44,000 tonnes per year of zinc metal at the end of the fourth quarter of 2015 once pillar recovery mining is fully implemented. The 2015 shipping season is expected to be completed on October 22, 2015 following the shipment of 1,048,000 tonnes of zinc concentrate and 216,000 tonnes of lead concentrate compared with 1,025,000 tonnes and 205,000 tonnes, respectively, for the 2014 season. This represents all of Red Dog's concentrates available to be shipped from the operation. Sales volumes of contained zinc are estimated at approximately 200,000 tonnes in the fourth quarter of 2015. ENERGY BUSINESS UNIT Fort Hills Project Construction of the Fort Hills project is progressing substantially in accordance with the project schedule. In the third quarter of 2015 our capital expenditures were $217 million compared with a cash spending estimate of $213 million. Our capital expenditures in 2015 were $664 million to date compared with our cash forecast spending estimate which was $691 million. Our share of Fort Hills cash expenditures in 2015 is estimated at $850 million. Since sanction, the project has achieved and continues to track to key milestones. Engineering activity is progressing well, and is now 94% complete, construction is progressing per plan and is now approximately 43% complete. Equipment and material deliveries are continuing and offsite modular fabrication, site civil works and process facility construction are well underway. Site construction workforce is currently approximately 4,800 and will continue to ramp-up to peak in 2016. The capital cost and schedule outlook have not changed since we announced project sanction in October 2013. We continue to target first oil in the fourth quarter of 2017, with 90% of our planned production capacity of 180,000 barrels per day (bpd) expected within 12 months. Our share of production is expected to be 36,000 bpd (13 million barrels per year) of bitumen. We are continuing to review options to sell diluted bitumen into the North American and overseas markets which may include the use of pipelines from Hardisty or rail to access tidewater ports and U.S. Gulf Coast refineries. Frontier Energy Project The Frontier regulatory application review continues with the provincial and federal regulators. We responded to the regulators' information requests and provided a project update in June 2015. The project update improves the economic and social benefits and overall environmental performance of the project. We expect responses from the regulators on the updated project in the fourth quarter of 2015. The earliest anticipated first oil date for our Frontier Project is now 2026, which reflects additional time required for updates to the project in light of the lease exchange transaction and revisions to the project scope. The regulatory review process is expected to continue through 2015; making late 2016 or early 2017 the earliest date in which a decision is expected. Our expenditures on Frontier are limited to supporting this process. Wintering Hills Wind Power Facility During the third quarter, our share of the power generation from Wintering Hills was 28 GWhs, resulting in 18,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent offsets. Our share of expected power generation in 2015 is 135 GWhs, resulting in approximately 85,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent offsets, although actual generation will depend on weather conditions and other factors. OTHER OPERATING COST AND EXPENSES Other operating expenses, net of other income, were $174 million in the third quarter compared with $41 million a year ago. This includes negative pricing adjustments of $141 million, including adjustments, on copper and zinc of $98 million and $34 million, respectively. We also made additional environmental provisions of $15 million. The table below outlines our outstanding receivable positions, provisionally valued at September 30 and June 30, 2015. Finance expense was $79 million in the third quarter, similar to a year ago. Debt interest expense increased due to the effect of the stronger U.S. dollar, as all our debt and related interest expense is U.S. dollar denominated. We capitalized a total of $59 million in interest in the quarter. Other non-operating expense of $44 million included foreign exchange losses of $35 million on that portion of our debt which is not offset by investments in U.S. dollar denominated foreign subsidiaries and a loss on marketable securities of $13 million. The income and resource recovery for the third quarter was $767 million, or 26% of pre-tax loss. This effective tax rate reflects the effect of impairment charges and is not comparable with our historical and expected future tax rates. Impairment charges of $2,895 million including an impairment of goodwill, which is not tax-deductible, resulted in a tax recovery of $741 million. Before impairment charges, we recorded a tax recovery of $27 million on pre-tax loss of $27 million. This unusual result comes about, in part, as a higher proportion of our earnings have come from lower tax rate jurisdictions or bear lower rates of tax due to the nature of the underlying items. We also evaluate tax assets and liabilities on a quarterly basis based on facts and circumstances, expected future earnings levels, and assessments and resolutions of tax matters and changes in these evaluations can significantly affect our tax rate at lower income levels. Due to available tax pools, we are currently shielded from cash income taxes, but not resource taxes in Canada. We remain subject to cash taxes in foreign jurisdictions. FINANCIAL POSITION AND LIQUIDITY Our cash position increased from $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion in the quarter. Significant outflows included $217 million on Fort Hills project expenditures. Significant inflows included a net $209 million (US$162 million) on our share of the Carmen de Andacollo gold stream transaction. Subsequent to quarter end, we received an additional $789 million (US$610 million) in October from the silver streaming agreement with Franco-Nevada related to our Antamina mine and repaid US$300 million on a note due October 1. Our cash flow in the last quarter of the year will be affected by the seasonality of Red Dog sales and the reduction of inventories. Based on the repayment of US$300 million of notes that were due October 1 and cash received from the silver streaming agreement, as well as current commodity prices and exchange rates, we now expect our year-end cash balance to be approximately $1.8 billion, assuming existing debt levels. We maintain various committed and uncommitted credit facilities for liquidity and for the issuance of letters of credit. All of our bank credit facilities are unsecured and any borrowings rank pari passu with our outstanding public notes. None of our notes or credit facilities are guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries. We maintain two primary revolving committed credit facilities. Our US$3 billion facility matures in July 2020 and has a letter of credit sub-limit of US$1 billion. Any letters of credit issued under this facility would reduce the amount of the facility that can be drawn for cash. Our US$1.2 billion facility matures in June 2017 and can be drawn fully for cash or for letters of credit. Both facilities require us to pay a commitment fee on undrawn amounts and a specified spread above LIBOR on any drawn amounts, which varies with our credit rating, but does not further vary if our ratings from both Moody's and S&P are below Ba1 or BB high, respectively. Drawings under both facilities are available for general corporate purposes. Both facilities were undrawn at September 30, 2015. Borrowing under our primary committed credit facilities is subject to our compliance with the covenants in the agreement and our ability to make certain representations and warranties at the time of the borrowing request. Our credit facilities, but not our public notes, include a financial covenant that requires us to maintain our debt to debt-plus-equity ratio below 50%. Borrowing under the credit facilities is not conditioned on us maintaining any particular credit rating or there being no general developments that could be expected to have a material adverse effect on us. While we have no current intention to incur secured debt, we are restricted under our bank and public note covenants from creating liens on certain assets to secure indebtedness unless those liens also secure our credit facilities and notes. We are restricted from creating liens on major assets. There are a number of exceptions from these negative pledge covenants, including an exception for liens securing debt that does not exceed 10% of consolidated net tangible assets. As at September 30, 2015, our consolidated net tangible assets for the purposes of our credit facilities and public notes totaled approximately $32.3 billion, 10%, of which is approximately $3.2 billion In addition to our two primary revolving committed credit facilities, we also maintain uncommitted bilateral credit facilities with various banks and with Export Development Canada for the issuance of letters of credit, primarily to support our future reclamation obligations. At September 30, 2015 these facilities totaled $1.5 billion and outstanding letters of credit issued thereunder were $1.15 billion. We expect these amounts to increase by approximately $225 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 for an increased reclamation estimate at our Red Dog mine and for water related permitting in the Elk Valley. These facilities are typically renewed on an annual basis. From time to time, at our election, we may reduce the fees paid to banks issuing letters of credit by making short-term deposits of excess cash with those banks. The deposits earn a competitive rate of interest and are generally refundable on demand. At September 30 we had US$400 million of such deposits. Our reclamation obligations are included in \"Other Liabilities and Provisions\" on our balance sheet. Associated letters of credit would not become a liability unless the letter of credit is drawn by the beneficiary, which drawing would be triggered if we did not perform our obligations under the relevant contact or permit. In the event of the drawing, we would be required to reimburse the issuing bank for the amount drawn on the letter of credit. Issued letters of credit do not constitute debt for the purpose of the debt-to-debt plus equity covenant in our bank credit agreements. Since the end of the second quarter, Moody's, S&P and Fitch revised our credit ratings to Ba1, BB and BB+, respectively, in each case with a negative outlook. DBRS currently rates us BBB with a negative outlook. As a consequence of these ratings actions, we are required to deliver an aggregate of US$672 million of letters of credit pursuant to long-term power purchase agreements for the Quebrada Blanca Phase 2 project. We are in discussions with our counterparty regarding deferring the issuance of these letters of credit, which are otherwise required to be issued before the end of October, however, there is no assurance that this deferral will be permitted. The letters of credit would be terminated if and when we regain investment grade ratings. We may also be required to post letters of credit under certain pipeline and storage agreements we entered into in connection with the Fort Hills project. If required, these letters of credit would be in amounts up to approximately $425 million and increasing to approximately $650 million in 2017 prior to the relevant in-service date. Following such in-service date, the letter of credit amount would reduce to up to approximately $450 million. These Fort Hills related letters of credit would also be terminated if and when we regain investment grade ratings. The ratings actions described above do not affect our credit facilities beyond the rate of the commitment fee and cost of borrowing. There are no restrictions on borrowing, or additional covenants, triggered under our credit facilities as a result of the downgrade. Operating Cash Flow Cash flow from operations, before changes in non-cash working capital items, was $302 million in the third quarter compared with $553 million a year ago. Changes in working capital items increased cash by $258 million in the third quarter. The decrease in working capital in the quarter was due to lower inventory and receivables compared to the second quarter. This is a matter of the timing of a number of operating items. Investing Activities Expenditures on property, plant and equipment were $217 million in the third quarter for the Fort Hills oil sands project, $83 million on sustaining capital and $18 million on major enhancement projects. The largest components of sustaining expenditures were $17 million at our Red Dog Operations and $14 million at Highland Valley Copper. Major enhancement expenditures included approximately $7 million at our steelmaking coal operations. Capitalized stripping expenditures were $146 million in the third quarter compared with $145 million a year ago. The majority of this item constitutes the advancement of pits for future production at our steelmaking coal mines. Financing Activities Financing activities in the third quarter consisted of capital lease repayments of $13 million (2014 - $16 million) and debt interest payments of $188 million (2014 - $156 million). We distributed $21 million to minority interests in our operations (2014 - $6 million) and paid dividends of $86 million (2014 - $259 million). We repaid US$300 million on a note on October 1. OUTLOOK We continue to experience challenging markets for our products and prices for some of our products have declined and lower prices may persist for some time. Commodity markets have historically been volatile, prices can change rapidly and customers can alter shipment plans. This can have a substantial effect on our business. Reduced supply of steelmaking coal from U.S. and Canada is offset by weaker demand, particularly in China, and by increased Australian supply, maintaining downward pressure on prices. We are also significantly affected by foreign exchange rates. In the last nine months, the U.S. dollar strengthened by approximately 15% against the Canadian dollar, which has had a positive effect on the profitability of our Canadian operations. It will, to a lesser extent, put upward pressure on the portion of our operating costs and capital spending that is denominated in U.S. dollars. In October 2013, we approved an estimated $2.9 billion (our share) to complete the development of the Fort Hills oil sands project, of which approximately $1.5 billion remains to be spent. We have access to cash and credit lines which are expected to be sufficient to meet our capital commitments and working capital needs over this period. We are taking further steps to manage our capital spending profile and we continuously monitor all aspects of our cost reduction program, our capital spending and key markets as conditions evolve. In addition, we could be subject to labour unrest or other disturbances as a result of delays in or the failure of negotiations of new contracts, which could limit our ability to maintain steelmaking coal or copper production in accordance with our plans. If this were to occur, the potential shortfall in planned production could be material. We continue to monitor market conditions for steelmaking coal and currently expect production rates to match our sales projections for the fourth quarter. Foreign Exchange, Debt Revaluation and Interest Expense The sales of our products are denominated in U.S. dollars, while a significant portion of our expenses are incurred in local currencies, particularly the Canadian dollar and the Chilean peso. Foreign exchange fluctuations can have a significant effect on our operating margins, unless such fluctuations are offset by related changes to commodity prices. Our U.S. dollar denominated debt is subject to revaluation based on changes in the Canadian/U.S. dollar exchange rate. As at September 30, 2015, $6.1 billion of our U.S. dollar denominated debt is designated as a hedge against our foreign operations that have a U.S. dollar functional currency. As a result, any foreign exchange gains or losses arising on that amount of our U.S. dollar debt are recorded in other comprehensive income, with the remainder being charged to profit. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND DERIVATIVES We hold a number of financial instruments and derivatives which are recorded on our balance sheet at fair value with gains and losses in each period included in other comprehensive income and profit for the period as appropriate. The most significant of these instruments are marketable securities, foreign exchange forward sales contracts, metal-related forward contracts and settlements receivable and payable. Some of our gains and losses on metalrelated financial instruments are affected by smelter price participation and are taken into account in determining royalties and other expenses. All are subject to varying rates of taxation depending on their nature and jurisdiction. OUTSTANDING SHARE DATA As at October 21, 2015 there were 566.8 million Class B subordinate voting shares and 9.4 million Class A common shares outstanding. In addition, there were 16.0 million stock options outstanding with exercise prices ranging between $4.15 and $58.80 per share. More information on these instruments and the terms of their conversion is set out in Note 19 of our 2014 audited financial statements. INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Any system of internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. There have been no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2015 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS - IMPAIRMENT TESTING In preparing consolidated financial statements, management makes estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses across all reportable segments. Management makes estimates and judgments that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our estimates and judgments are based on historical experience and other factors we consider to be reasonable, including expectations of future events. Critical accounting estimates and judgments are those that could affect the consolidated financial statements materially, are highly uncertain and where changes are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Impairment testing is an area that requires significant judgment, both in assessing whether certain factors would be considered an indicator of impairment and when an indicator is present, determining the assumptions used in preparing discounted cash models. We consider both internal and external information to determine whether there is an indicator of impairment present and accordingly, when impairment testing is required. When impairment testing is required, discounted cash flow models are used to estimate the recoverable amounts of respective assets. Significant assumptions used in preparing these discounted cash flow models include commodity prices, reserves and resources, operating costs, capital expenditures, discount rates, foreign exchange rates, tax assumptions and inflation rates. These inputs are based on management's best estimates of what an independent market participant would consider appropriate and are reviewed by senior management. Changes in these inputs may alter the results of impairment testing, the amount of impairment charges recorded in the statement of income and the resulting carrying values of assets. In light of current economic conditions we have revised our market participant long-term price expectations for copper, zinc, steelmaking coal and oil and performed a detailed review of impairment indicators across all of our operations and assets. Where required, we have estimated the recoverable amount of our assets on a fair value less costs of disposal basis (FVLCD) and have determined that this was higher than the value in use of these assets. In our copper, zinc, steelmaking coal and energy business units we have identified Cash Generating Units with carrying values that exceed the estimated recoverable amounts. FVLCD was estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology taking into account assumptions likely to be made by market participants. Cash flow projections are based on current life of mine plans and exploration potential. Commodity Prices Commodity price assumptions are based on a number of factors, including forward curves in the near term, and are benchmarked with external sources of information, including information published by our peers and where possible, market transactions, to ensure they are within the range of values used by market participants. Our key commodity price assumptions are based on current prices over the next three years escalating to a real long-term price. For steelmaking coal, copper and zinc, we start with a 2016 price of US$96 per tonne, US$2.50 per pound and US$0.85 per pound for each respective commodity. These prices are gradually escalated over the next three years, reaching a real long-term price in 2020 of US$130 per tonne, US$3.00 per pound and US$1.00 per pound for steelmaking coal, copper and zinc, respectively. For impairment testing of assets within our energy business unit, we have used a long-term West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price of US$75 per barrel and a Western Canadian Select (WCS) differential of US$10.50 per barrel. Reserves and Resources Future mineral production is included in projected cash flows based on mineral reserve and resource estimates and exploration and evaluation work, undertaken by appropriately qualified persons. Operating Costs and Capital Expenditures Operating costs and capital expenditures are based on life of mine plans and internal management forecasts. Cost estimates incorporate management experience and expertise, current operating costs, the nature and location of each operation and the risks associated with each operation. Future capital expenditures are based on management's best estimate of expected future capital requirements, which are generally for the extraction and processing of existing reserves and resources. All committed and anticipated capital expenditures based on future cost estimates have been included in the projected cash flows. Operating cost and capital expenditure assumptions are continuously subject to on-going optimization and review by management. Discount Rates Discount rates used are based on the weighted average cost of capital for a mining industry peer group and are calculated with reference to current market information. Adjustments to the rate are made for any risks that are not reflected in the underlying cash flows. A 5.8% real, 7.9% nominal, post-tax discount rate was used to discount cash flow projections in all of our FVLCD discounted cash flows. Foreign Exchange Rates Foreign exchange rates are benchmarked with external sources of information based on a range used by market participants. The long-term Canadian - U.S. dollar foreign exchange assumption used was 1 U.S. dollar to 1.25 Canadian dollars. Inflation Rates Inflation rates are based on average historical inflation for the location of each operation and long-term government bond yields. Inflation rates are benchmarked with external sources of information and are within a range used by market participants. The inflation rate for all FVLCD calculations is 2%. Turqoise Hill Resources Ltd. (TSE: TRQ) Turquoise Hill Resources (TRQ: TSX, NYSE & NASDAQ) is an international mining company with copper-gold and coal mines in the Asia Pacific region. Principal assets: A 66% interest in Oyu Tolgoi, one of the world's largest copper-gold-silver mines now producing and shipping concentrate to customers in China. A 22.63% interest in established Mongolian coal miner SouthGobi Resources (SGQ: TSX, 1878: HK). Turquoise Hill announces financial results and review of operations for the third quarter of 2015 VANCOUVER, CANADA - Turquoise Hill Resources today announced its financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. All figures are in US dollars unless otherwise stated. . HIGHLIGHTS Oyu Tolgoi achieved a strong safety performance with an All Injury Frequency Rate of 0.31 per 200,000 hours worked for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Oyu Tolgoi recorded revenue of $431.7 million in Q3'15 on sales of 226,000 tonnes of concentrate, a 2.5% increase over Q2'15, reflecting higher sales volumes partially offset by lower copper prices. Turquoise Hill reported income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders of $44.0 million. In Q3'15, a non-cash charge of $76.4 million was recorded within operating expenses for provision against non-current ore stockpile inventory. Turquoise Hill generated operating cash flow before interest and taxes of $171.7 million during Q3'15. Oyu Tolgoi's Q3'15 mine production was at record levels while concentrate produced and contained copper were on par with Q2'15 even considering the planned concentrator shutdown in July 2015. During Q3'15, mined production increased 8.5% over Q2'15 due to shorter hauling routes and ongoing productivity initiatives. Copper in concentrates for Q3'15 increased 1.3% due to higher head grades while gold in concentrates decreased 48.3% over Q2'15 due to slower than anticipated access to gold-rich ore. Increased copper and gold production is expected in Q4'15 compared to Q3'15 as higher-grade ore is accessed in the open pit. Turquoise Hill continues to expect Oyu Tolgoi to produce 175,000 to 195,000 tonnes of copper and 600,000 to 700,000 ounces of gold in concentrates in 2015. In August 2015, Oyu Tolgoi filed revised schedules for the 2015 Oyu Tolgoi Feasibility Study with the Mongolian Minerals Council. Underground pre-start activities are underway in parallel with an update to the feasibility study capital estimate, which is expected to be completed in Q1'16. Turquoise Hill continues to expect signing of project financing by the end of 2015 and the decision for underground construction in early Q2'16. Capital expenditure for 2015 is now expected to be approximately $120 million, of which approximately $115 million relates to sustaining capital, due to operational efficiencies, changes to the mine plan during the year and capital optimization. Operating cash costs for 2015 are now expected to be approximately $900 million reflecting operational improvements throughout the year and excluding one-time costs related to the May 2015 underground agreement as well as pre-start costs for underground development. Sales contracts have been signed for more than 80% of Oyu Tolgoi's expected 2016 concentrate production. In September 2015, Oyu Tolgoi surpassed 1.5 million tonnes of concentrate shipped. Turquoise Hill's cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2015 were $1.3 billion. FINANCIAL RESULTS In Q3'15, the Company recorded net income attributable to owners of Turquoise Hill of $21.2 million or $0.01 per share compared with net loss of $94.0 million or ($0.05) per share in Q3'14, an increase of $115.2 million. The increase is mainly attributable to a $227.3 million non-cash impairment charge recorded in Q3'14 on reclassification of SouthGobi to assets held for sale. Operating cash flows before interest and taxes in Q3'15 were $171.7 million compared with $256.3 million in Q3'14, reflecting continued production and delivery cost improvements and effective working capital management, offset by the impact of lower commodity prices on sales revenue. Additions to property, plant and equipment, excluding adjustments relating to asset retirement obligations ($9.7 million), were $31.1 million in Q3'15 all of which related to sustaining capital activities including the tailing storage facility. Turquoise Hill's cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2015 were $1.3 billion. OYU TOLGOI The Oyu Tolgoi mine is approximately 550 kilometres south of Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia's capital city, and 80 kilometres north of the Mongolia-China border. Mineralization on the property consists of porphyry-style copper, gold, silver and molybdenum contained in a linear structural trend (the Oyu Tolgoi Trend) that has a strike length extending over 26 kilometres. Mineral resources have been identified in a series of deposits throughout this trend. They include, from south to north, the Heruga Deposit, the Southern Oyu deposits (Southwest Oyu, South Oyu, Wedge and Central Oyu) and the Hugo Dummett deposits (Hugo South, Hugo North and Hugo North Extension). Mining of ore commenced in May 2012 and first concentrate was produced in January 2013. The Oyu Tolgoi mine has initially been developed as an open-pit operation. A copper concentrator plant, with related facilities and necessary infrastructure to support a nominal throughput of 100,000 tonnes of ore per day, has been constructed to process ore mined from the Southern Oyu open pit. Long term development plans for Oyu Tolgoi are based on a 95,000-tonne-per-day underground block-cave mine. In August 2013, development of the underground mine was delayed pending resolution of matters with the Government of Mongolia. On May 18, 2015, Turquoise Hill, the Government of Mongolia and Rio Tinto announced the signing of the Oyu Tolgoi Underground Mine Development and Financing Plan, which addressed key outstanding shareholder matters and set out an agreed basis for the funding of the project. Preparation for underground development Following the filing of revised schedules for the 2015 Oyu Tolgoi Feasibility Study with the Mongolian Minerals Council in August 2015, pre-start activities are underway in parallel with an update to the capital estimate, which is expected to be completed in Q1'16. Pre-start activities include ramp-up of the owners and EPCM team, reestimate activities, detailed engineering and early procurement for equipment and materials required for necessary critical works that are key enablers for recommencement of underground lateral development mining activity. Care and maintenance activities have continued for Shaft #1, facilities and mobile equipment. Turquoise Hill expects the decision for underground construction in early Q2'16. The Company continues to expect signing of project financing by the end of 2015. In September 2015, the Government of Mongolia signed the request of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) for host country approval (HCA) with respect to guarantees to be issued by MIGA in connection with the Oyu Tolgoi project financing. The signing of the HCA was a significant milestone in the project financing timeline. In October 2015, the project financing information circular was provided to the banking syndicate allowing for each institution's respective internal consideration and approval. Prior to the suspension in August 2013, underground lateral development at Hugo North had advanced approximately 16 kilometres off Shaft #1. Sinking of Shaft #2, the primary operations access and initial production hoisting shaft, had reached a depth of 1,168 metres below surface, 91% of its final depth of 1,284 metres. The 96 metre-high Shaft #2 concrete headframe has been constructed. Sinking of Shaft #5, a dedicated exhaust ventilation shaft, had reached a depth of 208 metres, 17% of its final depth of 1,174 metres. Surface facilities, including offices, mine dry, and workshop, are in place to support initial pre-production development and construction. Q3'15 performance Safety continues to be a major focus throughout Oyu Tolgoi's operations and the mine's management is committed to reducing risk and injury. Oyu Tolgoi achieved a solid safety performance with an All Injury Frequency Rate of 0.31 per 200,000 hours worked for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Revenue in Q3'15 increased 2.5% over Q2'15. Higher revenues reflect higher volumes of copper-gold concentrate sales, partially offset by a fall in copper prices. The Q3'15 mix of revenue by metals is the result of inventory with higher contained copper and gold drawn down during the quarter from concentrate produced in Q2'15. Gross margin at 41.6% for the quarter reduced from 46.4% in Q2'15 due to the effect of lower copper prices. Production and delivery costs include primarily the cash costs in inventory sold as well as allocated mine administration costs. Depreciation and depletion includes the depreciation and depletion in inventory sold as well as any depreciation of assets used in the selling and delivery process, including the depreciation of capitalized production phase stripping costs. A non-cash charge of $76.4 million was recorded in Q3'15, within operating expenses, for additional provision against non-current ore stockpiles, following re-estimation of realizable value to reflect lower copper and gold prices and updated assumptions for timing of processing. Total additions capitalized to property, plant and equipment, on an accruals basis, for Q3'15 were $31.1 million (Q3'14: $38.3 million) all attributed to sustaining activities, including the tailings storage facility and deferred stripping. Total additions for Q3'15 include an adjustment of $4.0 million, which reduced the carrying amount of underground evaluation costs capitalized in previous quarters to be in accordance with the Company's accounting policy on the recognition of exploration and evaluation costs. Total cash operating costs at Oyu Tolgoi in Q3'15 were $222.5 million. Following transition to IFRS, the 5% royalty payable to the Government of Mongolia, previously deducted from revenue, is reflected as a cash operating expense, and production phase stripping costs, previously included within cash operating expense, are capitalized and depreciated. During Q3'15, Oyu Tolgoi continued to improve and optimize operations in order to reduce costs across the mine's operation. Oyu Tolgoi's C1 costs in Q3'15 were $0.40 per pound, compared with $0.73 per pound in Q2'15. The decrease was mainly due to a $22.1 million charge in Q2'15 for settlement of amounts not previously paid or provided for in relation to Mongolian Tax assessments, following signature of the underground agreement on May 18, 2015, and a net reduction in inventory (excluding non-cash write-down) as sales volumes exceeded production. Oyu Tolgoi's open-pit mine has a high-grade zone containing a large proportion of gold in addition to copper; Turquoise Hill anticipates quarterly fluctuation of C1 costs as the quantity of gold in concentrates sold varies after ore from this zone is fed through the mill. All-in sustaining costs in Q3'15 were $1.52 per pound, compared with $1.26 per pound in Q2'15. The increase was mainly due to a non-cash charge for additional provision against non-current ore stockpile partially offset by royalty expenses returning to regular operational levels following the Q2'15 adjustment upon signing of the underground agreement. Oyu Tolgoi's Q3'15 mine production was at record levels while concentrate produced and contained copper was on par with Q2'15 even considering the planned concentrator shutdown in July. During Q3'15, mined production increased 8.5% over Q2'15 due to shorter hauling routes and ongoing productivity initiatives. Copper in concentrates for Q3'15 increased 1.3% due to higher head grades. Gold in concentrates for the quarter decreased 48.3% over Q2'15 due to slower than anticipated access to gold-rich ore. Funding of Oyu Tolgoi by Turquoise Hill In accordance with the ARSHA dated June 8, 2011, Turquoise Hill has funded Oyu Tolgoi's cash requirements beyond internally generated cash flows by a combination of equity investment and shareholder debt. For amounts funded by debt, Oyu Tolgoi must repay such amounts, including accrued interest, before it can pay common share dividends. At September 30, 2015, the aggregate outstanding balance of shareholder loans extended by subsidiaries of the Company to Oyu Tolgoi was $6.8 billion, including accrued interest of $1.4 billion. These loans bear interest at an effective annual rate of LIBOR plus 6.5%. In Q3'15, Oyu Tolgoi repaid a total amount of $180.0 million with respect to these loans, including accrued interest of $57.9 million. In accordance with the ARSHA, a subsidiary of the Company has funded the common share investments in Oyu Tolgoi on behalf of Erdenes. These funded amounts earn interest at an effective annual rate of LIBOR plus 6.5% and are repayable, by Erdenes to a subsidiary of the Company, via a pledge over Erdenes' share of Oyu Tolgoi common share dividends. Erdenes also has the right to reduce the outstanding balance by making cash payments at any time. As at September 30, 2015, the cumulative amount of such funding was $751.1 million, representing approximately 34% of invested common share equity; unrecognized interest on the funding amounted to $214.9 million. Operational outlook Increased copper and gold production is expected in Q4'15 when compared to Q3'15 as higher-grade ore is anticipated to be accessed in the open pit. Turquoise Hill continues to expect Oyu Tolgoi to produce 175,000 to 195,000 tonnes of copper and 600,000 to 700,000 ounces of gold in concentrates in 2015. The Company expects copper production to be at the top of the range while gold production is expected to be in the middle of the range. Capital expenditure for 2015 is now expected to be approximately $120 million, of which approximately $115 million relates to sustaining capital. The Company previously expected capital expenditure of approximately $230 million, of which approximately $185 million related to sustaining capital. The reduction is the result of operational efficiencies, changes to the mine plan during the year and capital optimization. Operating cash costs for 2015 are now expected to be approximately $900 million. The Company previously expected operating cash costs of approximately $1 billion. The reduction reflects changes from operational improvements throughout the year and excludes one-time costs related to the May 2015 underground agreement as well as pre-start costs for underground development. Sales contracts have been signed for more than 80% of Oyu Tolgoi's expected 2016 concentrate production. Q3'15 exploration Oyu Tolgoi's exploration strategy is focused on developing a project pipeline prioritized in areas that can impact the current development of the Oyu Tolgoi orebodies, seeking low-cost development options; in particular looking for shallower targets. Historical datasets are added to and reinterpreted to enable future discovery. SOUTHGOBI On April 23, 2015, the Company completed sale of 48.7 million shares in SouthGobi to Novel Sunrise Investments Limited (NSI) at a price of C$0.35 per common share payable in cash, and on June 3, 2015 a further 1.7 million shares were sold to NSI at a price of C$0.35 per share. Half of the aggregate cash proceeds, representing C$8.5 million in total, were received at closing; the balance of approximately C$8.5 million was received on August 4, 2015. At September 30, 2015, Turquoise Hill owned 52.4 million SouthGobi common shares, representing approximately 21.3% of the issued and outstanding SouthGobi shares at that date. The carrying value of this interest at September 30, 2015 was $14.6 million based on the quoted share price. At September 30, 2015, SouthGobi is classified as an investment in associate within assets held for sale in the Company's financial statements. OTHER EXPLORATION Desk top studies, data compilation and detailed satellite imagery interpretation are in progress for an orbit Area approximately surrounding Oyu Tolgoi. An induced polarization and magnetotellurics survey on Turquoise Hill's Teregt licence (bordering the south of the Oyu Tolgoi licences) was conducted. The results have been analyzed and the interpretation downgraded the previous induced polarization targets. Additional soil and rock geochemical sampling has been done to test for shallow exploration targets. A service agreement is in place with Rio Tinto Holdings (Exploration), under which they provide exploration services to the Company. This agreement benefits Turquoise Hill by allowing access to Rio Tinto's global expertise, knowledge base and skills. CORPORATE ACTIVITIES Management change In September 2015, Turquoise Hill announced the resignation of Stewart Beckman, Senior Vice President, Operations and Technical Development, effective October 1, 2015 due to Mr. Beckman having accepted a new position within Rio Tinto. The Company is conducting a search for Mr. Beckman's replacement, which will be announced in due course. Mr. Beckman will provide support in the interim to ensure a smooth transition. NON-GAAP MEASURES The Company's financial results are prepared in accordance with IFRS. In addition, the Company presents and refers to the following measures (non-GAAP measures) which are not defined in IFRS. A description and calculation of these measures is given below, and may differ in some aspects from equivalent measures provided by other issuers. Cash operating costs This measure comprises Oyu Tolgoi cash operating costs, and is presented in order to provide investors and other stakeholders in the Company with a greater understanding of performance and operations at Oyu Tolgoi. The measure of cash operating costs excludes: depreciation and depletion; exploration and evaluation; charges for asset write-down (including write-down of materials and supplies inventory), and includes management services payments to Rio Tinto, and management services payments to Turquoise Hill which are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements of the Company. C1 cash costs C1 cash costs is a metric representing the cash cost per unit of extracting and processing the Company's principal metal product to a condition in which it may be delivered to customers, net of by-product credits. It is provided in order to support peer group comparability and to provide investors and other stakeholders' useful information about the underlying cash costs of Oyu Tolgoi and the impact of by-product credits on the operations' cost structure. C1 cash costs are relevant to understanding the Company's operating profitability and ability to generate cash flow. When calculating costs associated with producing a pound of copper, the Company includes gold and silver revenue credits as the production cost is reduced as a result of selling these by-products.Turquoise Hill's principal metal product is copper, and C1 cash costs are reported for Oyu Tolgoi only. All-in sustaining costs All-in sustaining costs (AISC) is an extended cash based cost metric, providing further information on the aggregate cash, capital and overhead outlay per unit, and is intended to reflect the costs of producing the Company's principal metal product over the life-cycle of its operations. The measure seeks to reflect the full cost of copper production from current operations and as a result development project capital is not included. AISC allows Turquoise Hill to assess the ability of Oyu Tolgoi to support sustaining capital expenditures for future production from the generation of operating cash flows. QUALIFIED PERSON Disclosure of a scientific or technical nature in this MD&A in respect of the Oyu Tolgoi mine was prepared under the supervision of Bernard Peters (responsibility for overall preparation and mineral reserves), B. Eng. (Mining), FAusIMM (201743), employed by OreWin as Technical Director - Mining and Kendall Cole-Rae (responsibility for mineral resources, geology and exploration), B.Sc. (Geology), SME (4138633), employed by Rio Tinto as Chief Adviser, Geology and Resource Estimation.

On Nov. 6, 2015, the company entered into a purchase agreement to sell 100 per cent of its wholly owned subsidiary, Global Fluids International SA (GFI) to SICPA Finance SA, a subsidiary of SICPA, each a privately owned company based in Switzerland, in exchange for cash and postclosing earn-out payments and certain additional payments as further described below. The completion of the transactions contemplated by the purchase agreement is subject to the prior satisfaction of a number of conditions, including the approval of the sale of GFI by the company's shareholders, which approval will be sought at a special meeting of shareholders that has been scheduled for Dec. 18, 2015, and the final approval of the TSX Venture Exchange. However, notwithstanding these conditions, in accordance with international financial reporting standards, the financial statements and MD&A are presented on an adjusted basis to include discontinued operations. Bruce Rowlands, chairman and chief executive officer of the company, stated: \"Our third quarter results are in line with our expectations as we head towards the special meeting of shareholders on Dec. 18, 2015, for the approval of the sale of GFI. The transaction builds on the foundation constructed by Eurocontrol over the past 10 years, and the long-term supply and support agreement to be entered into by Xenemetrix and GFI is expected to provide Eurocontrol with the resources necessary to grow the businesses of its remaining subsidiaries and also allow the company to continue to have significant exposure to the fuel marking market, where we began, through guaranteed minimum earn-out payments.\" Key financial highlights for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2015, including discontinued operations: - Adjusted consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, including discontinued operations, increased by $299,634 or 74 per cent to $702,652. - Adjusted consolidated revenues, including discontinued operations, increased by 25 per cent to $5,658,885 as compared with $4,502,508 in the prior year. This increase is mainly due to increased sales of fuel marker plus the impact of the depreciation of the Canadian dollars versus the U.S. currency. - Adjusted cash flow from operating activities, including discontinued operations, increased to $300,367 from $40,892 in the prior year. - Adjusted cash flow from investing activities, including discontinued operations, increased to $219,108 from negative $38,753 in the prior year. - Investment in R&D (research and development) increased by 128 per cent to $1,076,330 toward developing EDXRF technology and automated 2-D and 3-D image processing technologies for the semiconductor and related microelectronics industries.  Strategic positioning The company has been focused on implementing a strategic plan designed to increase the company's value and create opportunities for growth. This strategic plan involves completing the transactions contemplated by the purchase agreement, which are intended to: result in a reorganization of the company's operations by narrowing the numbers of divisions in which it operates and allow the company to focus its resources and capital on its remaining businesses and pursue higher growth strategies; strengthen the company's financial position to execute these strategies; and enhance shareholder value by monetizing assets. Further details are included below under discontinued operations. Areas of focus going forward Upon closing of the sale transaction, the company's remaining operations will be through its two remaining wholly owned subsidiaries, Xenemetrix Ltd. and XwinSys Technology Development Ltd. The company intends to focus on growing Xenemetrix's existing business through Xenemetrix's continuing support of GFI's business, on an exclusive basis, in the field of oil and gas marking and monitoring, and through its continuing activities relating to the design, development, production and marketing of ED-XRF systems in the marine sector, and in other potential markets. In addition, the company plans to continue its development of its current XwinSys business, dedicated to the design, manufacture and marketing of novel solutions based on ED-XRF combined with automated 3-D vision for the semiconductor and related industries. This strategy is intended to achieve increased sales in Xenemetrix's current markets and generate new sales opportunities for both Xenemetrix and XwinSys, all with a view to producing strong free cash flows and returns on capital, with moderate levels of sustained capital investment. In particular, going forward, Eurocontrol intends to focus its business growth efforts in the following areas: material analysis on mobile platforms; monitoring solutions for marine vessels and geological mapping; ED-XRF agricultural applications in precision farming; and ED-XRF/2-D/3-D semiconductor and related microelectronics industry applications. Management of the company believes that there will be increased demand for ED-XRF technology, and automated 2-D and 3-D image-processing technologies in these areas, and, as a result, new opportunities for the company to capitalize on this demand. The proceeds of the disposition of GFI are expected to be used in connection with the above-mentioned business objectives, for pursuing and developing new opportunities for growth within the authentication and certification markets, and for other general corporate purposes. Discontinued operations On Nov. 6, 2015, the company entered into the purchase agreement, pursuant to which the company agreed to sell 100 per cent of its wholly owned subsidiary, GFI, to SICPA in exchange for cash and postclosing earn-out and additional payments. As a key part of the transaction, the company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Xenemetrix, has agreed to enter into a strategic exclusive long-term supply, maintenance and support agreement, pursuant to which Xenemetrix will continue to supply to GFI, Xenemetrix's products and services currently used by GFI in its business, in each case, on an exclusive basis within the oil and gas marking and monitoring field of GFI's current operations. The consideration payable to the company for the sale of GFI is as follows: - Cash consideration payable to the company by SICPA on closing of $16-million (less the $250,000 deposit received by the company and $286,000 in transaction payments, and assuming that, on closing, GFI has positive working capital of $1-million) subject to a working capital adjustment; - Postclosing earn-out payments equal to 5 per cent of the net revenues earned by GFI from contracts entered into by it following the execution of the purchase agreement and during the period ending six years from the closing of the transaction, with a minimum guaranteed of $1.5-million per year for the six-year earn-out period (total payment of at least $9-million); - Additional postclosing payments equal to 5 per cent of the net revenues earned by GFI from contracts signed during the fourth through sixth years following closing paid until the third anniversary of such contracts; - The settlement of intercompany loan amounts owing by Eurocontrol to GFI. The transaction is expected to close between Dec. 18, 2015, and Jan. 4, 2016. In accordance with international financial reporting standards, assets and liabilities related to GFI have been classified as held for sale, and are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell in the consolidated statements of financial position. The operating results for the three- and nine-month periods ended Sept. 30, 2015, and 2014 related to GFI have been presented separately as the loss from discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss). Outlook With the anticipated sale of GFI to SICPA, the company has identified a number of acquisition opportunities that it plans to perform due diligence on. Additionally, investments in R&D programs within Xenemetrix and Xwinsys, the company's two remaining wholly owned subsidiaries, will be a priority. The growth of Eurocontrol through acquisitions and integration of complementary businesses is an important component of the company's business strategy. Eurocontrol continues to seek opportunities to acquire or invest in businesses, products and technologies that are complementary and would provide for expansion in the areas of authentication, verification and certification.

(TSX:AGU) (NYSE:AGU) announced today 2015 third quarter net earnings from continuing operations of $99-million ($0.72 diluted earnings per share), compared to $91-million ($0.63 diluted earnings per share) in the third quarter of 2014. The increased net earnings are due to higher sales volumes of Wholesale nutrients combined with lower production costs in the Wholesale business unit, while Retail's earnings were similar to the prior year, despite weaker market conditions. Highlights: Third quarter adjusted net earnings of $97-million or $0.71 per share and $5.73 per share year to date in 2015 on the same basis (see page 2 for adjusted net earnings reconciliation)1. Wholesale's results were boosted by nitrogen and potash performance, which saw higher volumes and lower costs, leading to an improvement in gross profit, despite lower nutrient prices. Agrium achieved 94 percent ammonia capacity utilization in the third quarter, exceeding the 90 percent target rate. The Canpotex proving run is well underway at our Vanscoy potash facility and is progressing as expected. Retail EBITDA2 in the U.S. and Australia were higher than the same quarter last year reflecting Operational Excellence initiatives. Total Retail EBITDA of $129-million for the quarter was in line with the prior year, despite the impact of drought conditions in the Canadian business. Agrium has repurchased 5.6 million shares since the beginning of April under its current Normal Course Issuer Bid. 2015 annual guidance range has been narrowed to $7.10 to $7.40 diluted earnings per share (see page 3 for further details). \"Agrium's performance this quarter is another demonstration of the resilience of our business model. We focused on what we can control, improving our on-stream Wholesale performance and optimizing our distribution network and effectively managing costs in Retail, all of which helped drive a 9 percent increase in earnings over the same period last year despite prevailing market headwinds,\" commented Chuck Magro, Agrium's President and CEO. \"We see strong crop input demand during the fall application season which is now in full swing and we are confident that our strategy and business structure can continue to deliver value to all our shareholders,\" added Mr. Magro. Forecasted annual effective tax rate of 27.5 percent used for adjusted net earnings and per share calculations. These are non-IFRS measures which represent net earnings adjusted for certain income (expenses) that are considered to be non-operational in nature. We believe these measures provide meaningful comparison to the earnings of other companies by eliminating share-based payments expense (recovery), gains (losses) on foreign exchange, gains (losses) on non-qualifying derivative hedges and significant non-operating, non-recurring items. These should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS and may not be directly comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Earnings (loss) from continuing operations before finance costs, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. This is a non-IFRS measure. Refer to section \"Additional IFRS and Non-IFRS Financial Measures\" in the Management's Discussion and Analysis. MARKET OUTLOOK For the third consecutive year, favorable growing conditions have contributed to above-trend global grain yields. Even in geographies which faced challenging conditions early in the growing season, such as parts of the U.S. Corn Belt and Western Canada, yield prospects have come in stronger than anticipated. Despite historically high production, the outlook for grains is more positive than it was a year ago and as of the end of October 2015, cash corn prices were more than 10 percent above 2014 levels, although oilseed prices are lower year-over-year. Excluding China, the global grain stocks to use ratio is projected to decline to the lowest level since 2012/13 and the U.S. corn supply/demand balance is projected to tighten. As a result of projected lower 2015/16 U.S. corn ending stocks, analysts project that U.S. corn area will increase in 2016. We expect normal North American crop nutrient application rates in the 2015/16 fertilizer year and expect that fall demand in 2015 will improve relative to 2014 levels as harvest progress is significantly ahead of last year, supporting a wider application window than the short 2014 season. In addition, we expect the overall planted acreage and crop mix to support increased crop nutrient demand. The devaluation of most non-U.S. currencies over the past year has negatively impacted crop input demand and U.S. dollar prices. While growers in most market driven non-U.S. regions have realized a net benefit from lower local currency values due to improved local currency crop prices, crop nutrient prices in local currencies have increased significantly in some cases, which has been negative for demand. Currency devaluations have directly impacted crop nutrient demand and prices in Brazil and India. In Brazil, higher local prices, combined with lending constraints have negatively impacted import demand, however, downstream inventories have been drawn down to meet farm-level demand. In India, the devaluation of the rupee has pressured phosphate prices in order to be economical under the subsidy regime, while Indian buyers have delayed execution on some contracted potash volumes. Globally, the downstream distribution network has been drawing on nutrient inventories to meet grower demand and purchasing on a just-in-time basis, which has led to relatively slow demand for all products. This has been the case in the U.S. urea market, as offshore imports of urea are estimated to be down 19 percent through the end of October 2015. The urea market has also been under pressure due to the combination of the devaluation of the Chinese yuan and lower anthracite coal prices, which have lowered the marginal cost of production. Chinese production levels in September in 2015 declined by 6 percent from August levels as a result of these market pressures and are expected to drop through the remainder of the year. Similarly for potash, strong shipments of potash in 2014 and the first half of 2015 allowed downstream inventories to increase. Buyers have been drawing upon these inventories in the second half of 2015, and prices have declined as spot sales volumes have declined. We expect pent-up demand to emerge late as fall applications occur and downstream inventories are drawn down. Similar to nitrogen and potash, phosphate demand has been slow in recent months, which has led to a reduction in phosphate production by some major producers. UPDATED ANNUAL 2015 GUIDANCE Based on our Market Outlook, Agrium expects to achieve annual diluted earnings per share of $7.10 to $7.40 in 2015 compared to our previous estimate of $7.00 to $7.50 per share. We have narrowed the guidance range but maintained a range width encompassing approximately $60-million of EBITDA variability to reflect the risk and opportunity associated with weather conditions and fall season length. We are assuming a normal fall season, recognizing there is always a risk that an early onset of inclement weather could bring an early close to the season. We have lowered the high-end and narrowed our anticipated Retail EBITDA range to $1.00-billion to $1.03-billion because of the impact of drought and lower crop prices on our Canadian operations in 2015. Our annual nitrogen production target remains unchanged. We narrowed our potash production range to 1.95 million tonnes to 2.05 million tonnes for 2015. We have updated the range for our annual effective tax rate for 2015 to 27 percent to 28 percent to reflect the anticipated geographic split of our global income. Our estimates of the Canada and U.S. foreign exchange rates and NYMEX for 2015 have been narrowed from our previous estimates based on current market conditions. This guidance and updated additional measures and related assumptions are summarized in the table below. Guidance excludes the impact of share-based payments expense (recovery), gains (losses) on foreign exchange and non-qualifying derivative hedges and significant non-operating, non-recurring items.

In respect of Forward-Looking Statements, please refer to the section titled \"Forward-Looking Statements\" section of this MD&A. 2015 Third Quarter Operating Results CONSOLIDATED NET EARNINGS Agrium's 2015 third quarter net earnings from continuing operations were $99-million or $0.72 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations compared to net earnings from continuing operations of $91-million or $0.63 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the same quarter of 2014. Wholesale's sales volumes increased for all three crop nutrients for the third quarter and for nitrogen and phosphate for the first nine months of 2015 primarily as a result of higher operating rates. Realized selling prices for the third quarter decreased as a result of weaker market conditions but overall our average selling price increased for the first nine months of 2015. Product purchased for resale contributed to the decrease in sales as Agrium exited portions of this business. Wholesale's gross profit significantly increased due to lower natural gas input costs, manufacturing cost efficiencies and as a result of higher nitrogen, potash and phosphate volumes produced for the third quarter and first nine months of 2015 compared to the same periods last year. Retail's sales and gross profit decreased for the third quarter and first nine months of 2015 compared to the same periods last year primarily due to unfavorable weather conditions and competitive pricing pressure as a result of lower crop prices which impacted most of our product lines' sales and margins. Expenses General and administrative expense decreased by $9-million (13 percent) for the third quarter and $27-million (12 percent) for the first nine months of 2015 compared to the same periods last year as a result of reduced payroll and office expense costs as we continue to realize reductions related to our Operational Excellence program. Share-based Payments We had a share-based payment recovery of $15-million this quarter compared to a share-based payment expense of $10-million for the third quarter last year due primarily to the decrease in our share price. As a result of our higher average share price for the first nine months of 2015, our share-based payments expense increased by $11-million compared to the same period last year. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased for the third quarter and first nine months of 2015 due to the change in our method of depreciation from the straight-line basis to the units-of-production basis for our Vanscoy potash facility mining and milling assets at the beginning of 2015 and our reassessment of the useful lives of our property, plant and equipment in our Retail business unit in the fourth quarter of 2014 to reflect our expectations on the estimated future economic benefits of our property, plant and equipment. In the first nine months of 2015, other expenses decreased by $8-million due to the following: Gains of $33-million were recognized on natural gas derivatives in the first nine months of 2014 and were recorded directly to other expenses. 2015 did not have comparable results, as starting January 1, 2015, we began to designate all of our natural gas derivatives as qualifying hedges for accounting purposes and the related gains or losses are recorded as part of cost of product sold when we sell the related product while unrealized gains or losses are recorded in equity. We completed the sale of our Niota and Meredosia storage and distribution facilities in the first quarter of 2015 resulting in a gain on sale of purchase for resale assets of $38-million. Effective Tax Rate The effective tax rate on continuing operations of 27 percent for the third quarter is higher than the tax rate of 18 percent in the comparative quarter in 2014 (excluding the effect of the recognition of a previously unrecognized tax benefit of $29-million) because of higher earnings in higher taxed jurisdictions. The effective tax rate of 29 percent for the first nine months of 2015 is higher than the rate of 27 percent for the same period last year (excluding the effect of the recognition of a previously unrecognized tax benefit) due to the increase in the Alberta provincial statutory tax rate. BUSINESS SEGMENT PERFORMANCE Retail sales and gross profit during the quarter were lower than the same period last year due to generally lower crop input prices, weaker non-U.S. currency exchange rates and dry weather conditions in our international and Canadian operations. Regionally, the U.S. EBITDA contribution was up approximately 4 percent over the same period last year. Australia reported a 40 percent increase in EBITDA, due mostly to a focused effort in reducing overall operating costs. Canada and South America EBITDA declined as poor growing conditions hampered demand for all crop inputs. Retail selling expenses as a percentage of sales were marginally higher this quarter due to lower total sales. However, total selling expenses were down $33-million compared to the same period last year as a result of cost reductions primarily in our Canadian and Australian Retail operations. Total crop nutrient sales were 10 percent lower compared to the same period last year due to a reduction in both average crop nutrient selling prices as well as lower sales volumes. Total crop nutrient volumes were 4 percent lower this quarter across our Retail operations compared to the same period last year. Virtually all of the reduction was due to lower demand in our International Retail, due to dry conditions and lower planted wheat acreage. Despite lower corn and total seeded acreage this year in North America, sales tonnes in the region were relatively flat compared to the third quarter of 2014. Crop nutrient margins on a per tonne basis were lower across all regions. Margins from our international Retail declined by 28 percent over the same period last year. North American operations were 15 percent lower as a result of declining crop nutrient prices. Crop protection products Total crop protection sales were down 8 percent year-over-year with most of the reduction due to a combination of drought conditions impacting sales within our Canadian operations, lower demand for insecticides in the U.S. and lower prices for glyphosate products. International crop protection sales also experienced a decline related to dry conditions in those regions. Crop protection margins as a percentage of sales increased year-over-year, largely due to timing of rebates and new programs from suppliers in the U.S. market. Additionally, proprietary crop protection margins as a percentage of sales increased by 5 percent over the same period last year with the most significant increases in Canada and Australia. Seed Seed sales were up 11 percent this quarter compared to the same period last year. The increase was due primarily to excessive moisture conditions in the Eastern U.S. during June, which pushed corn and soybean seeding into July of this year. The excessive moisture also prevented a significant amount of corn and soybean acreage in the region from being planted and much of this area was seeded with wheat, rye grass and other grass seed instead. Seed sales and margins were negatively impacted by competitive pressures across the seed industry, as well as lower sales volumes in Canada. Seed margins as a percentage of sales were 43 percent this quarter compared to 50 percent in 2014. Increased sales volumes of wheat, rye grass and other grass seed, which are lower margin products, were a key contributor to the lower margins. Merchandise Merchandise sales decreased compared to the same period last year as a result of lower fuel prices and demand in Canada and lower animal health sales in Australia. Gross margin as a percentage of sales was higher this quarter due to a decrease in lower margin Canadian fuel sales and our ability to maintain a better cost position in the Australian business, which consistently has higher margin products. Services and other Sales for services and other was down 21 percent this quarter, due mainly to the closure of our livestock export business in Australia. Application and other services sales, gross profit and gross margins were all higher in North America compared to the same period last year. Wholesale sales this quarter were lower than the same period last year due to our decision to sell several non-core, lower-return purchase for resale facilities in 2015 related to our on-going asset portfolio review. Excluding this factor, Wholesale had higher product sales volumes this quarter largely offset by lower selling prices for all three crop nutrients. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $55-million over the prior year, as a result of higher utilization rates from our nitrogen and potash segments resulting in higher sales volumes and lower production costs per tonne. Nitrogen Nitrogen gross profit increased by 69 percent over the same period last year, with results being driven by higher volumes and a significant reduction in cost of product sold due to improved capacity utilization rates and lower natural gas costs in the current period. Sales volumes increased by 3 percent over the same period last year, driven by stronger urea and ammonia sales. This increase was due to higher on-stream time at our production facilities and product availability compared to the same period last year. Cost of product sold per tonne was 35 percent lower than the same period last year. Operational improvements and higher on-stream time compared to the same period in the prior year decreased fixed costs per tonne, while lower natural gas costs reduced variable costs. The weaker Canadian dollar also reduced operating costs at our Canadian plants. Nitrogen margin per tonne was $171 per tonne, a 63 percent improvement over the same period last year, despite an 11 percent reduction in average selling prices. Potash Potash gross profit this quarter was $40-million higher than the same period last year, due to the turnaround to tie-in the Vanscoy capacity expansion that started in the third quarter of 2014 leading to lower sales and margin in the prior year. Sales volumes were 53 percent higher compared to the same period in the prior year. Production volumes this quarter were 560,000 tonnes. Realized sales prices were lower than the same period last year due to competitive pricing pressure in both domestic and international markets. Cost of product sold was reduced as a result of cost efficiencies associated with the continuing ramp-up of the Vanscoy expansion, as well as weakening of the Canadian dollar. As a result, cash cost of product manufactured continues to improve and is $89 per tonne in the current quarter compared to $110 per tonne in the second quarter of 2015. Phosphate Phosphate gross profit was unchanged from the prior year. Sales volumes were slightly higher than last year, while reduced selling prices were largely offset by lower cost of production. As a result, phosphate margins were only 2 percent lower than the same quarter last year. Wholesale Other Gross profit for Wholesale's Other product category decreased this quarter primarily due to lower sales volumes and gross profit for the product purchased for resale business, as these operations were significantly scaled back earlier in 2015 as part of our portfolio review. ESN(r) gross profit increased this quarter due to slightly higher sales volumes and lower cost of product sold, which was partly offset by lower selling prices. Wholesale Earnings from Equity Investees Agrium's share of earnings from equity investees saw a loss of $10-million during the quarter. MOPCO experienced gas curtailments throughout the quarter which restricted nitrogen production. Profertil's sales volumes and costs were impacted by an extended outage during the current quarter. Other EBITDA for our Other non-operating business unit for the third quarter of 2015 had a net expense of $44-million, compared to a net expense of $40-million for the third quarter of 2014. The variance was due to the following: A $12-million higher gross profit elimination expense as a result of higher inter-segment inventory held at the end of the third quarter of 2015; A $22-million increase in other expenses primarily due to higher provisions for environmental remediation and asset retirement obligations and an interest recovery received in 2014; and A $15-million share-based payment recovery for the third quarter of 2015 compared to a $10-million share-based payment expense for the same period last year due to a decrease in Agrium's share price in 2015. Summary of Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Below is a summary of our cash provided by or used in operating, investing, and financing activities as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows: Our investing capital expenditures decreased in the first nine months of 2015 compared to the first nine months of 2014 due to the completion of the tie-in of our Vanscoy potash facility expansion in the fourth quarter of 2014, partially offset by expenditures relating to the Borger nitrogen expansion project. Our sustaining capital expenditures decreased in the first nine months of 2015 as we had less turnarounds compared to the same period last year. We expect Agrium's capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of 2015 to approximate $200--million to $300-million in 2015. We anticipate that we will be able to finance the announced projects through a combination of cash provided from operating activities and existing credit facilities. Short-term Debt Our short-term debt of $1.8-billion at September 30, 2015 is outlined in note 5 of our Summarized Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our short-term debt increased by $1.1-billion during the three months ended September 30, 2015, which in turn contributed to a decrease in our unutilized short-term financing capacity to $1.1-billion at September 30, 2015. Capital Management Our revolving credit facilities require that we maintain specific interest coverage and debt-to-capital ratios, as well as other non-financial covenants as defined in our credit agreements. We were in compliance with all covenants at September 30, 2015. NORMAL COURSE ISSUER BID In January 2015, the Toronto Stock Exchange (\"TSX\") accepted Agrium's notice of intention to make a normal course issuer bid (\"NCIB\") whereby Agrium may purchase up to 7,185,866 common shares on the TSX and New York Stock Exchange during the period from January 26, 2015 to January 25, 2016.

Eurocontrol Technics Group Inc. (TSX VENTURE:EUO) (\"Eurocontrol\" or the \"Company\"), a Canadian public company specializing in the acquisition, development and commercialization of innovative energy security, authentication, verification and certification technologies, announces that it has filed its financial statements and Management's Discussion and Analysis (\"MD&A\") for its third quarter ending September 30, 2015. On November 6, 2015, the Company entered into a purchase agreement (the \"Purchase Agreement\") to sell 100% of its wholly owned subsidiary, Global Fluids International S.A. (\"GFI\") to SICPA Finance SA (\"SICPA\"), a subsidiary of SICPA SA, each a privately owned company based in Switzerland, in exchange for cash and post-closing earn-out payments and certain additional payments as further described below. The completion of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement is subject to the prior satisfaction of a number of conditions, including the approval of the sale of GFI by the Company's shareholders, which approval will be sought at a special meeting of shareholders that has been scheduled for December 18, 2015, and the final approval of the TSX Venture Exchange. However, notwithstanding these conditions, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\"), the financial statements and MD&A are presented on an adjusted basis to include discontinued operations. For a reconciliation of discontinued operations, readers should refer to \"Adjusted Revenue and Profit from Continuing Operations\" and the \"Reconciliation of IFRS to Adjusted Results\" as presented below and in the MD&A. Bruce Rowlands, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company stated: \"Our third quarter results are in line with our expectations as we head towards the special meeting of shareholders on December 18, 2015 for the approval of the sale of GFI. The transaction builds on the foundation constructed by Eurocontrol over the past 10 years, and the long term supply and support agreement to be entered into by Xenemetrix and GFI is expected to provide Eurocontrol with the resources necessary to grow the businesses of its remaining subsidiaries and also allow the Company to continue to have significant exposure to the fuel marking market, where we began, through guaranteed minimum earn-out payments.\" Key Financial Highlights for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, including discontinued operations  Strategic Positioning The Company has been focused on implementing a strategic plan designed to increase the Company's value and create opportunities for growth. This strategic plan involves completing the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, which are intended to: (1) result in a reorganization of the Company's operations by narrowing the numbers of divisions in which it operates and allow the Company to focus its resources and capital on its remaining businesses and pursue higher growth strategies; (2) strengthen the Company's financial position to execute these strategies; and (3) enhance shareholder value by monetizing assets. Further details are included below under Discontinued Operations. Areas of Focus Going Forward Upon closing of the sale transaction, the Company's remaining operations will be through its two remaining wholly-owned subsidiaries Xenemetrix Ltd. (\"Xenemetrix\") and XwinSys Technology Development Ltd. (\"XwinSys\"). The Company intends to focus on growing Xenemetrix's existing business through Xenemetrix's ongoing support of GFI's business, on an exclusive basis, in the field of oil and gas marking and monitoring, and through its ongoing activities relating to the design, development, production and marketing of ED-XRF systems in the marine sector and in other potential markets. In addition, the Company plans to continue its development of its current XwinSys business, dedicated to the design, manufacture and marketing of novel solutions based on ED-XRF combined with automated 3D Vision for the semiconductor and related industries. This strategy is intended to achieve increased sales in Xenemetrix's current markets and generate new sales opportunities for both Xenemetrix and XwinSys, all with a view to producing strong free cash flows and returns on capital, with moderate levels of sustained capital investment. In particular, going forward, Eurocontrol intends to focus its business growth efforts in the following areas: (1) material analysis on mobile platforms; (2) monitoring solutions for marine vessels and geological mapping; (3) ED-XRF agricultural applications in precision farming; and (4) ED-XRF/2D-3D Semiconductor and related microelectronics industry applications.

Developed by former members of the Waterloo Autonomous Vehicles Laboratory, or WAVELab, the lightweight device attaches to a drone and makes filming complex, breathtaking aerial shots dramatically easier by allowing the camera to lock onto the subject. Earlier this year, the startup behind the product, Waterloo-based Vertical (formerly known as Perceptiv Labs), received funding from the prestigious Y Combinator incubator in Mountain View, Calif. Potential Hollywood clients like Pictorvision, a camera systems supplier whose credits include movies like \"Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation\" and 'Ant-Man,\" have already expressed interest. \"Everyone wants to get those smooth, beautiful shots,\" says Vertical CEO and WAVELab grad Neil Mathew, \"and here's a piece of software that let's anyone do that in a minute.\" It's another win for the WAVELab, a University of Waterloo research facility established six years ago to help push the boundaries in one of the coolest and most closely watched areas of technology today - unmanned transportation. Much of the glamour has been showered on initiatives like Google's self-driving car. Military drones are attracting media attention, too. But the WAVELab's 11 researchers have been busily working in the background, diving into projects as diverse as space sample-collecting robots for NASA, using drones for civilian applications like delivering parcels, and operating autonomous vehicles at high speed. \"What we're doing in all of them is figuring out how the robots will move, detect what's around them, and perform a particular task or move through the environment,\" says Steven Waslander, director of the lab and a mechanical and mechatronics engineering professor at the university. \"It's a wonderful time to be in this space.\" Waslander, an Ottawa native, launched the lab in 2009, soon after joining Waterloo's engineering faculty from Stanford University, where he did post-doctoral work related to autonomous vehicles. With the founding of Waterloo-based Aeryon Labs in 2007 by three UW students, he notes, the uses for autonomous drones began growing rapidly. The WAVELab continues to work closely with Waterloo Region's leading robotics firms, including Aeryon, Clearpath Robotics, and Nuvation Engineering, which provides electronic design and product development services to a variety of clients. Today, WAVELab devotes about two-thirds of its research to aerial autonomous vehicles and the remainder to unmanned ground vehicles. In the air, one of its main areas of focus is something called SLAM - simultaneous localization and mapping - which involves using sensor data on a drone to determine where objects are in the environment and the vehicle's position relative to them. The lab is developing navigational systems that use multiple, non-overlapping cameras mounted on the drone. Another big challenge for autonomous drones, and the second key focus for the lab, is flying them safely in the wind, says Waslander. Researchers test advanced control systems in a wind tunnel to improve navigation in windy conditions. For research into autonomous driving, WAVELab teamed up with Nuvation to build a one-fifth-scale self-driving car and is testing it at speeds of up to 100 km/h in an effort to develop technology that maximizes control and manoeuvrability. The team is also experimenting with \"platooning,\" or driving groups of vehicles, to reduce aerodynamic drag and improve fuel efficiency. \"A lot of big companies are doing amazing work on individual vehicle autonomy,\" says Waslander, \"so we thought we'd try to leapfrog ahead.\" Innovation in autonomous ground vehicle technology is taking two distinct paths, says Waslander. In one camp are the developers of advanced driver assistance systems for conventional cars, including adaptive cruise control, automatic parking and emergency braking, and sensors that detect lane markings and the distance to the vehicle in front. Almost every major automaker has products in this area, he notes, and it's so effective it can virtually eliminate accidents below 30 km/h. The opposing school of thought, represented by major players like Google, argues that the car must be completely rethought to make it truly autonomous. Instead of a steering wheel in the Google car's current design, for example, there is simply a red, on-off button, and the passenger tells the car where to go using a voice command. Waslander says he has come around to this way of thinking over the past year - although WAVELab doesn't do any work with Google. Still, he predicts it will take at least another 20 years to achieve a totally autonomous car. On the other hand, amazing applications for aerial autonomous vehicles are already here or just around the corner, says Waslander. In so-called precision agriculture, aerial drones with special cameras can take detailed photos and multi-spectral images of crops to determine plant health and moisture levels. And in the not-too-distant future, robots and self-driving tractors will be able to deliver exactly the right amount of water and fertilizer to every section of a field to optimize growing times. Drones are also taking over tedious or dangerous infrastructure and industrial inspection tasks. They're breaking new ground in cinematography, and are already being used in some cases to deliver supplies or packages. But the day when drones take over all Amazon deliveries, notes Waslander, is still quite a way off. Autonomous vehicles are no longer a novelty, says Barrie Kirk, executive director of the Canadian Automated Vehicles Centre of Excellence in Kanata, Ont. In the coming years, he predicts, the technology will affect a multitude of public- and private-sector activities, from the auto, resource and taxi industries, to health care, policing and transit. Like any other major technological shift, there will be winners and losers. But development is forging ahead, and Canada is lagging behind, says Kirk. He notes that the United Kingdom included 100 million pounds in its budget for 2015-16 for the development and testing of autonomous vehicles, and a U.K. parliamentary committee called for the appointment of a minister of driverless cars to co-ordinate the work across all governments. \"The work being conducted by the WAVELab is an important step in developing a Canadian AV ecosystem,\" Kirk says. \"But it needs to be complemented by a greater involvement by many other stakeholders: governments, other universities, the private sector and industry associations.\" Until that happens, though, Waslander and his team are punching above their weight when it comes to autonomous vehicle innovation. \"You really need to bring your A game when working at the WAVELab,\" says Mathew. \"We regularly go through a rapid iterative process of testing, refining and incrementally improving our algorithms, and the lab has always attracted the smartest and most curious people I've ever worked with.\" In the brave new world of autonomous vehicle research, it seems, only self-starters need apply."}, {"title": "Farmers Edge (tm) Improves Local Agronomic Economies with Key New Partnerships", "article": "Signals increasing role Advanced Technology plays in Agricultural Supply Chains WINNIPEG, Nov. 24, 2015 /CNW/ - Today, Farmers Edge, a global leader in precision agriculture and independent data management solutions, announced it is expanding its local partnerships throughout the agriculture supply chain.

SOURCE Farmers Edge Precision Consulting Inc."}, {"title": "Drones play growing role for cost-conscious explorers", "article": "In the face of one of the biggest downturns in the industry, cash-strapped miners and explorers are turning to unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), or drone, technology as one way to help drive down costs, boost productivity and harness safety at their sites. Mounted with high-definition cameras, these flying androids can create an elevation model of a pit or stockpile at a fraction of the time and cost it would take for a surveyor to complete the same task with handheld GPS. Alternatively, they can fly into uncharted wilderness and return in 45 minutes with over 10 sq. km. of imagery data that the geologist can use to zero in on their next new deposit. For Isaac Fage, president of GroundTruth Exploration -- a service provider of drone technology based in Dawson City, Yukon -- the applications for these new millennial \"birds\" are really just starting to take off. \"The technology is advancing very quickly,\" he says during an interview with Mining Trends & Developments. \"One year in drone time is like 10 years of normal time, and new applications are popping up all the time. Who knows where it'll go but it's fun to think about the possibilities.\" According to a new report from Markets and Research, the global UAV market is expected to reach US$5.6 billion by 2020, with a compound annual growth rate at a whopping 32.2%. Among all of its commercial applications -- some ranging from law enforcement, surveying and retail uses -- precision agriculture is expected to grow the highest with a forecasted rate of 42.5%. Loosening government regulations on its commercial applications in major countries such as the United States is also fostering the acceleration, says the report. Meanwhile in Canada, drones are permitted to fly under a 400-ft. ceiling as long as it remains a safe distance away from airports, buildings, people or animals and fits within certain weight restrictions. Permitting becomes more difficult the larger, and heavier the drone becomes -- which is is partly why geophysical surveys, such as Lidar, electromagnetic and magnetics, have yet to go automated. Fage says that his company focuses on using the drones to collect high-resolution image data, which he explains isn't rocket science, yet is far more accurate and efficient than what's obtained from traditional sources such as orbiting satellites. \"It's kind of like standard aerial photography but the detail is so much greater,\" he explains. \"The drone flies along parallel flight lines and collects overlapping photos, and from that you can build this really amazing looking, three-dimensional mosaic where a thousand photos essentially becomes one.\" He explains that each pixel has a three dimensional coordinate, with an accuracy ranging down to a 3 cm horizontal and 5 cm vertical. And after some processing, the data can be transformed into a variety of datasets including geo-referenced two-dimensional orthomosaics along with three dimensional digital elevation models and contour sets. \"For a mission that's a few square kilometres the final data would be 5 to 10 gigabytes in size,\" he says. \"But we can distill that down into more of a user friendly way for people wanting to use it as a base map or integrate it with a normal GIS program without comprising the quality or detail.\" Arming GroundTruth's fleet is Senseflys \"Ebee\" model drone -- a slick-looking, bird-shaped craft made mostly of a durable foam, boasting a 80 cm wingspan and weighing in at a mere 1.5 lbs. On the ground, Fage uploads a designated flight path, or \"mission,\" to the drone's onboard autopilot, instructing the android where it has to go to collect a photo with its 18.2-megapixel Sony camera. It takes three shakes to activate the drone's electric motor, he says, and within moments the craft can be cruising at speeds up to 90 km per hour, making minor adjustments to compensate for any sudden gusts just to stay on course. And should there be any last minute changes to the flight plan, Fage says that the data can be relayed to the drone via a radio transmission link it has onboard. \"Ground control isn't necessary, they run autonomously, and that's the really cool part of these machines,\" he says. \"They know where they need to go to get an image, and they'll make dozens of adjustments just to get there even if it's gusting up to 45 km per hour.\" Drones are also becoming increasingly popular in the mining space, with big name miners such as Barrick Gold (TSX: ABX; NYSE: ABX), Teck Resources (TSX: TCK.B; NYSE: TCK), and Fortescue Metals Group (ASX: FMG) jumping on board with the technology. Anaconda Mining (TSX: ANX; US-OTC: ANXGF) also settled on purchasing a $30,000 drone from SmartPlanes for its Pine Cove gold mine, 6 km northeast of the town of Baie Verte in north-central Newfoundland, and so far the investment has more than paid for itself. \"Every month we need to survey the open-pit and a number of our stockpiles so we had surveyors walking around collecting thousands of GPS points,\" Gordana Slepcev, manager of technical services for Anaconda, says during an interview. \"It used to take two days and as you can imagine it was quite costly for us, but with the drone we can complete the survey in a half-hour at a fraction of the cost.\" She says another big value-add is having the drone monitor and calculate the volume of its tailings pond facility, and assist with exploration across its land package. But the biggest savings for the company has been slashing the risks and improving the safety of their employees as they operate within the mine site. \"What people don't talk about enough is how this technology is improving the safety of workers in the industry,\" she says. \"The drones eliminate the need for people to be in places that are hazardous, such as around tailings or high-walls, and that in itself is excellent.\" -- This article appeared in the November 2015 issue of Mining Trends & Developments magazine."}, {"title": "Greencastle Subsidary Deveron Acquires Unmanned Aerial Systems (Drone) Company", "article": "Sydney - Wednesday - November 18: (RWE) - Greencastle Resources Ltd [TSX VENTURE:VGN], is pleased to report that the company's 65.8% owned subsidiary Deveron Resources Ltd [TSX VENTURE:DVR] has executed a binding Letter Agreement outlining the terms and conditions upon which Deveron will acquire 2487473 Ontario Inc operating as Eagle Scout Imaging.

At a major construction site, a squad of flying robots hoists and lays bricks with military precision, pausing only for battery swaps or a recharge. And at Amazon, Walmart, and the Vaughan-based Drone Delivery Canada -- tests are afoot to transform the delivery of small packages using robots in the sky. The common thread is the ubiquitous unmanned aerial vehicle, or \"drone.\" And the above scenarios, more likely than not, will be realized in the not-so-distant future. The Vaughan company exists (though it's not delivering yet), demonstrations of intelligent swarm assembly (using foam \"bricks\") have been carried out -- and a 42-metre wingspan Aquila prototype has been built. \"They're really now becoming new tools in a company's toolbox,\" says Michael Cohen, president of Toronto-based Industrial Skyworks, or ISW. It's one of many firms globally that see massive opportunities in the use of unmanned aerial technology. Flying high-end quadcopters manufactured by Waterloo-based Aeryon Labs (which just secured $60 million in venture capital financing), ISW does everything from inspections of building envelopes through to work in the electrical, telecommunications, and oil and gas sectors. Multiple types of high-resolution sensors can be taken aloft depending on the task at hand. \"If one needs to look at a hard-to-reach place like the top of a telecommunications tower to understand how much rust is on equipment, drones are now able to get this information and we're able to present it in a valuable way,\" says Cohen, who is also an airline-rated captain. One of ISW's core businesses is thermal inspections of massive roofs on industrial buildings. The work is carried out at night, and -- until ISW came along -- had been done by people carrying handheld thermographic cameras. Using a drone is safer and faster. And -- potentially -- better at many, many things. \"We'll see them in everything from deliveries to construction sites to all sorts of other applications,\" predicts Cohen. Such as precision agriculture -- where unmanned aerial systems gather ultra-precise data while flying over farms. \"A very simple way of thinking of it is optimizing inputs to increase outputs,\" says Pat Lohman, VP of Partnerships with North Carolina-based PrecisionHawk. Their fixed-wing aircraft was designed by U of T aerospace PhD Ernie Earon to carry a variety of swappable sensors. The device is hand-launched and flies a programmed circuit over the fields (though it must -- except with special permits -- remain within sight of an operator on the ground). After it lands, the data is processed and can be presented as an easy to interpret, colour-coded map. Do parts of the crop require less nitrogen? More? Are there areas where, in fact, no fertilizer whatsoever is required? A drone can capture that data -- and other crop parameters -- faster and at lower cost than ever before. \"So to be able to fly over a field . . . to see where bad areas are and good areas are -- a prescription can be created to match that map,\" explains Lohman. That prescription can then be meshed with the brains of the tractor doing the actual spraying. The result? Reduced costs and increased yields. \"Historically, it (nitrogen application) was full blast over the entire field,\" says Lohman. \"But if you save five or 10 per cent and you can actually get better results, there's a lot of cost savings there on input.\" PrecisionHawk both sells its $18,000 (U.S.) UAVs directly to farming operations, and also operates as a service provider. In December of 2013, when Amazon's Jeff Bezos announced his company's intention to start testing drones for delivery, many accused him of hype. The devices would be at risk of crashing into trees, power lines, buildings. But it was not hype. In early November, there were 19 openings on Amazon Prime Air's company's job page -- everything from carbon fibre technicians to research scientists. In late October, there was news Walmart Inc. had been testing small unmanned aerial systems indoors for months -- and had applied to the FAA for permission to take those tests outside. Reuters reported the application seeks to test drones in \"deliveries to customers at Walmart facilities, as well as to consumer homes.\" According to the Reuters report, Walmart plans to use drones manufactured by China's DJI -- a company that has continuously advanced drone technology while simultaneously reducing price. Last year, the company recorded $500 million (U.S.) in sales. This year, it is set to surpass $1 billion. So stable is the platform that many small entrepreneurs have launched businesses with DJI products. Gateway Data Systems Inc. started with a sub-$2,000 device and accessories. The Etobicoke-based company monitors construction sites and provides high-resolution, date-stamped video progress reports. \"It holds people accountable to their project timeline,\" says president and CEO Mike Smith. \"Boots on the ground is fine, but to get an actual overview of an entire project you really need a bird's eye view.\" Smith, an IT specialist, has plans to take his company far beyond progress reports and into the realm of security surveillance. He says he's already exploring partnerships with academic institutes, hoping to push the artificial intelligence of these flying robots. He envisions drones triggered by motion sensors autonomously capturing video evidence of construction site theft -- even potentially following suspects. \"How do we push that platform -- and see how far we can take it?\" asks Smith. \"How much more can we make it do -- and how fast?\" If the progress of the past few years is indicative of the future -- the sky's the limit."}, {"title": "Regulatory Risk Lingers for Thorn, Says Credit Suisse -- Market Talk", "article": "2315 GMT [Dow Jones] Credit Suisse remains wary of the regulatory risk surrounding consumer-leasing and financial-services provider Thorn Group (TGA.AU), despite an attractive valuation and decent 1H result.

(\"Glacier\" or the \"Company\") (TSX:GVC) reported cash flow, earnings and revenue for the period ended September 30, 2015. Summary Results The following results are presented on an adjusted basis(1) to include the Company's share of its joint venture operations on a proportionate basis, because this is the basis on which management bases its operating decisions and performance. For a reconciliation to results in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), refer to the \"Reconciliation of IFRS to Adjusted Results\" as presented below and in Management's Discussion & Analysis (MD&A).  Revenue and profitability for Glacier Media Inc. (\"Glacier\" or the \"Company\") continued to be impacted by weaker energy and commodity markets in Western Canada and community media. Adjusted consolidated EBITDA(1) was $5.6 million for the period ended September 30, 2015 compared to $7.4 million for the same period last year, a decline of 24.8%. The Company generated improved performance as the quarter progressed. September was the best month to date in 2015 for the Company with EBITDA from operating divisions being slightly better than the same month last year when commodity markets were stronger. ERIS, Inceptus, BIV Media Group and FarmMedia all generated both revenue and EBITDA gains compared to last year. The declines in revenue were largely due to community media print advertising revenue declines and the impact of low oil prices on the Company's energy information division, JuneWarren-Nickle's. Approximately 30% of the $6.2 million revenue decline for the quarter was the result of planned closure and restructuring of newspaper and printing operations. These restructurings resulted in stronger and more efficient operations and improved profitability. The declines in community media and energy were partially mitigated by strong growth in a number of business information divisions as indicated during the quarter. A wide variety of sales initiatives have resulted in the improved business information revenue performance. Glacier FarmMedia, for example, had a strong quarter, hosting two successful outdoor farm demonstration shows and growing both revenues and EBITDA significantly over last year. Business information EBITDA has held up relatively well given the market conditions.  Transformation Strategy To address the challenges facing some of the businesses, the Company is implementing a strategy to transform its business and focus efforts on a narrower spectrum of operating sectors in order to deploy resources and capital in areas where long-term growth opportunities can best be realized, and Glacier has a strong competitive position. Glacier's core focus is to operate as an information & marketing solutions company pursuing growth in sectors where the provision of essential information & related services provides high customer utility & value. The related \"go to market\" strategy is being pursued through two operational segments:  Sector Focus As part of this transformational strategy, the decision was made to focus efforts on the provision of information and marketing solutions in the following sectors:  12 Nov 2015 20:17 ET Press Release: Glacier Reports Third Quarter -2-  Operational Overview Initiatives are being pursued to develop the Company's operations through its Evolve, Enrich and Extend strategy. New management and staff are being hired to expand Glacier's expertise in the information areas and opportunities it is pursuing. A variety of core products will continue to be re-developed and new products launched to address evolving market needs and opportunities. Key operating highlights in the quarter included:  Financial Position On an adjusted basis, including the Company's share of the joint venture interests, Glacier's consolidated debt net of cash outstanding before deferred financing charges was 2.4x trailing 12-months EBITDA as at September 30, 2015. As at September 30, 2015, senior debt was $67.9 million. Management is seeking to reduce senior debt levels to less than $50 million in the near term, such that ongoing debt can be supported by the business information operations, and the community media operations can provide free cash flow for investment purposes, further debt reduction and financial flexibility. Over the last two years, the Company has sold $49 million of real estate assets and non-core trade publications. Additional dispositions of real estate and non-core operating assets are currently being pursued. Reconciliation of IFRS to Adjusted Results The following table is a reconciliation of the IFRS results to the adjusted results (which include the Company's proportionate share of its joint venture operations). Refer to the MD&A for further discussion and analysis of these results:  12 Nov 2015 20:17 ET Press Release: Glacier Reports Third Quarter -3- The qualitative discussion of the third quarter 2015 results in this President's Message is relevant and applicable for the adjusted results and the IFRS results. Outlook The outlook for the Company remains varied. Depressed energy and agricultural commodity prices continue to weigh on the Western Canadian economy and the operations of the Company. Glacier's energy information business and community media operations, particularly in the Prairies, continue to face strong headwinds. The community media operations continue to operate in a mature industry as dollars continue to shift from print to digital. Offsetting these challenges are a number of growth and business improvement opportunities that the Company is pursuing. The overall improved performance in September reflected a number of these factors:  Assuming market conditions do not worsen further, these factors and others should result in better relative operating performance. Even with the mixed outlook, the Company continues to take care to make sure it invests in and focuses on transforming its products and services to ensure that it continues to offer high value to customers in its various markets and continues to improve its long-term business strength. Further, operational and capital investments will continue to be made to support areas that are experiencing strong growth and have large opportunities. Importantly, the Company has made substantial progress towards its objectives of both strengthening its financial position and narrowing its spectrum of operating sectors in order to redeploy capital and resources to higher-growth and higher-value products and services. Once leverage is reduced to lower operating levels, management will seek an ongoing balance of maintaining debt at those levels and delivering increased value to shareholders through operations, strategic acquisitions and share buy-backs. Shares in Glacier are traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol GVC. About the Company: Glacier Media Inc. is an information communications company focused on the provision of primary and essential information and related services through print, electronic and online media. Glacier is pursuing this strategy through its core businesses: the community media and business information markets. Financial Measures To supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), Glacier uses certain non-IFRS measures that may be different from the performance measures used by other companies. These non-IFRS measures include cash flow from operations (before changes in non-cash operating accounts and non-recurring items), net income attributable to common shareholders before non-recurring items, net income from continuing operation attributable to common shareholders before non-recurring items, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and all 'adjusted' measures which are not alternatives to IFRS financial measures. Management focuses on operating cash flow per share as the primary measure of operating profitability, free cash flow and value. EBITDA per share is also an important measure as the Company has low ongoing capital expenditures and depreciation and amortization largely relates to acquisition goodwill and copyrights and does not represent a corresponding sustaining capital expense. These non-IFRS measures do not have any standardized meanings prescribed by IFRS and accordingly they are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. The adjusted consolidated financial results have been adjusted to include the Company's share of revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities from its joint venture operations on a proportionate accounting basis as this is the basis on which management bases its operating decisions and performance evaluation. IFRS does not allow for the inclusion of the joint ventures on a proportionate basis. These results include additional non-IFRS measures such as EBITDA, cash flow from operations and net income attributable to common shareholders before non-recurring items. The adjusted results are not generally accepted measures of financial performance under IFRS. The Company's method of calculating these financial performance measures may differ from other companies and accordingly, they may not be comparable to measures used by other companies. Refer to the MD&A for a reconciliation of these non-IFRS measures and adjusted results.

Glacier's core focus is to operate as an information and marketing solutions company pursuing growth in sectors where the provision of essential information and of related services provides high customer utility and value. The related go-to-market strategy is being pursued through two operational segments: - Content and marketing solutions (evolution of media business); - Data, analytics and intelligence. Sector focus As part of this transformational strategy, the decision was made to focus efforts on the provision of information and marketing solutions in the following sectors: - Agriculture: The company has a strong national presence in the agriculture information sector. The company's agriculture publications, websites, weather models and networks, databases, and trade shows are the leading sources of information for Canadian farmers, ranchers, agribusinesses and those involved in the Canadian agriculture industry. The agriculture industry is experiencing rapid change and innovation with new technologies and methods, such as precision farming, an open grain marketing system and other trends increasing the need for and value of information. The company is well positioned to capitalize on these trends. - Energy: The energy sector is a truly global industry with strong long-term needs for information. While the industry is currently suffering from a cyclical downturn, opportunities exist as operations continue and businesses look to reduce costs and increase efficiencies. The company has strong brands, such as the Daily Oil Bulletin, that have served the Canadian oil patch for decades. Given the pure scale of this sector, many information product growth opportunities exist that the company will be able to capitalize on. - Mining: Like energy, mining is a global sector with strong long-term needs for information, in which Canada is a major player and Glacier has strong brands and market positions. The company has been investing in its mining information products and is well positioned for when the current cyclical downturn reverses. - Environmental risk and compliance: ERIS, Glacier's environmental risk information business, is the main provider in Canada of phase 1 environmental information and recently launched into the United States, where it is the main competitor to the largest operator in the American market. Phase 1 environmental information is used by buyers and sellers of commercial real estate and financial lenders in evaluating mortgage lending risk, amongst other things. A variety of other growth opportunities exist in environmental risk and compliance information. - Real estate: The REW website, the company's real estate listing portal in the Lower Mainland in British Columbia, now has 98 per cent of the residential listings in Vancouver and recently launched into the Greater Victoria market. REW has a significant growth opportunity as a platform for residential and other real estate information and marketing. - Mutual funds: Fundata is the market leader of mutual fund listings information in Canada and is expanding through analytics and other products and areas. It provides Glacier with steady and growing cash flow, and offsets some of the cyclical risk of natural resources cash flows. - Community media: The community media business is a mature industry but generates significant cash flow for the company. The products continue to provide value for advertisers, and opportunities exist to leverage the local brands, marketing reach and customer relationships to generate new revenues. Efforts will be made to restructure community media assets to create greater direct value and operating simplicity for Glacier. Operational overview Initiatives are being pursued to develop the company's operations through its evolve, enrich and extend strategy. New management and staff are being hired to expand Glacier's expertise in the information areas and opportunities it is pursuing. A variety of core products will continue to be redeveloped and new products launched to address evolving market needs and opportunities. Key operating highlights in the quarter included: - Glacier FarmMedia had a better quarter with year-on-year increases in revenues and EBITDA. Low commodity prices continue to create a difficult environment, but many segments of the division experienced growth. FarmMedia hosted Canada's Outdoor Farm Show from Sept. 15 to 17 in Woodstock, Ont. This year's show was very successful with record attendance and sold-out exhibitor space. The show came two months after the successful launch of Ag In Motion, the first outdoor farm demonstration show in Western Canada. The inaugural show generated revenues in excess of $1-million and received positive reviews in the press and from attendees and exhibitors. - On Sept. 30, the company acquired an additional 34 per cent of Weather INnovations Consulting (WIN) bringing its stake to 85 per cent. The remaining 15 per cent of WIN continues to be held by management. WIN operates the largest weather network in Canada and provides decision support to growers and agribusinesses based on localized weather and associated modelling. For Glacier, weather and remote sensing have applications beyond agriculture in areas such as water security, the environment, and oil and gas. - Glacier's energy information group, JuneWarren-Nickle's, continues to be adversely impacted by the difficult oil and gas environment in Western Canada. The negative market conditions substantially impacted all of JWN's products in the quarter with revenues off more than 25 per cent from the same month last year. Substantial efforts are being made to ensure the group's products offer their customers necessary value in challenging times and remain an important part of running their businesses. JWN continues to pursue new revenue initiatives, such as the launch this year of the enhanced Canoils database module that provides enhanced information on the assets owned by energy companies. This information will be helpful as companies target asset acquisitions in distressed market conditions, as well as other purposes. - ERIS continues to execute on its North American expansion plan. Growth in the United States continues to be very robust with increases coming from increased orders from existing customers and the onboarding of many new customers. - REW, the company's on-line real estate portal, continued to grow rapidly with increased traffic and features. The site grew to a visit level of almost one million visitors and 10 million page views per month. Revenues for the site continue to scale. During the quarter, the website's reach expanded from the Lower Mainland of British Columbia to include Greater Victoria. - A number of the company's community media operations saw substantial reductions in revenues and EBITDA. In particular, operations in Alberta and Saskatchewan experienced significant declines driven by a combination of the maturing nature of print advertising and continued weak commodity prices. Declines in national revenues continued to be the most substantial with local advertising performing relatively better. - The restructuring of Glacier's community media operations in the Lower Mainland of B.C. (LMP) continued in the quarter. Operational efficiencies from a reduction in the number of editions being published resulted in lower operating costs. Further, the changes have resulted in improved products for both readers and advertisers as more substantial editions are published. Even with the reduction in editions, the bulk of the sales staff was retained to aggressively pursue new revenue sources and streams. Financial position On an adjusted basis, including the company's share of the joint venture interests, Glacier's consolidated debt net of cash outstanding before deferred financing charges was 2.4 times trailing 12-month EBITDA as at Sept. 30, 2015. As at Sept. 30, 2015, senior debt was $67.9-million. Management is seeking to reduce senior debt levels to less than $50-million in the near term, such that continuing debt can be supported by the business information operations, and the community media operations can provide free cash flow for investment purposes, further debt reduction and financial flexibility. Over the last two years, the company has sold $49-million of real estate assets and non-core trade publications. Additional dispositions of real estate and non-core operating assets are currently being pursued. The qualitative discussion of the third quarter 2015 results in this president's message is relevant and applicable for the adjusted results and the IFRS results. Outlook The outlook for the company remains varied. Depressed energy and agricultural commodity prices continue to weigh on the Western Canadian economy and the operations of the company. Glacier's energy information business and community media operations, particularly in the Prairies, continue to face strong headwinds. The community media operations continue to operate in a mature industry as dollars continue to shift from print to digital. Offsetting these challenges are a number of growth and business improvement opportunities that the company is pursuing. The overall improved performance in September reflected a number of these factors: - Many of the company's divisions such as ERIS, Fundata and REW offer strong growth opportunities. Recent growth is being reflected in operating results. - The substantial restructuring efforts that have been undertaken and continue in the community media business are starting to result in a material impact on profitability. - A slight improvement in the conditions is being faced by the agriculture industry. Assuming market conditions do not worsen further, these factors and others should result in better relative operating performance. Even with the mixed outlook, the company continues to take care to make sure it invests in and focuses on transforming its products and services to ensure that it continues to offer high value to customers in its various markets and continues to improve its long-term business strength. Further, operational and capital investments will continue to be made to support areas that are experiencing strong growth and have large opportunities. Importantly, the company has made substantial progress toward its objectives of both strengthening its financial position and narrowing its spectrum of operating sectors to redeploy capital and resources to higher-growth and higher-value products and services. Once leverage is reduced to lower operating levels, management will seek a continuing balance of maintaining debt at those levels and delivering increased value to shareholders through operations, acquisitions and share buybacks.

All currency amounts are expressed in U.S. dollars. Novariant Inc. merger On Oct. 15, 2015, AgJunction completed a merger with Novariant, initially announced on March 16, 2015. Details of the transaction, including unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements up to June 30, 2015, are contained within AgJunction's management information circular dated Aug. 28, 2015, filed on SEDAR on Sept. 3, 2015. The merger was completed subsequent to the close of AgJunction's third quarter, and therefore the financial results in this third quarter financial report contain only the operations of AgJunction and do not include third quarter results from Novariant. With the completion of the merger, AgJunction gains a pre-eminent position in automated steering and machine control technologies, differentiated by its broad intellectual property portfolio, which includes more than 140 patents, and its ability to deliver application-specific solutions to precision agriculture customers worldwide. As global machine manufacturers increasingly target the integration of autosteer technologies at the factory level, the merged entity can provide increased support and a wider offering of advanced machine automation to current and future OEM and VAR customers. With 182 employees worldwide, AgJunction's vision is to be the world's leading OEM and VAR supplier for automated steering and machine control technology for precision agriculture. Third quarter financial review For the three months ended Sept. 30, 2015, the company reported revenue of $7.6-million, a 21-per-cent decrease from $9.6-million in the third quarter of 2014. Lower revenue for the quarter is related to continuing softness in the aftermarket agricultural retail space and lower food commodity prices, delaying customer investment and purchasing decisions. These conditions resulted in a drop in the Air ($300,000) and Outback ($800,000) business units. The agronomy services business, which had sales of $600,000 in Q3 2014, was sold April 1, 2015. In the United States, net farm income has been declining since 2013, and according to the September, 2015, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) report, is forecasted to be down 36 per cent from 2014 results. Lower crop and livestock receipts are the main drivers. The 2015 forecast for net farm income is the lowest since 2006 (since 2002 in inflation-adjusted terms) and a drop of nearly 53 per cent from the record high of $123.7-billion in 2013. \"This industry forecast for 2015 remains challenging for all companies in the agriculture space. Fortunately, both AgJunction and Novariant began preparing for 2015 over two years ago. Our primary drivers for the remainder of this year are to stay focused on delighting the customers we have and help them be as successful as they can be,\" said Dave Vaughn, AgJunction's chief executive officer. \"Moreover, we are ensuring we have sufficient engineering resources in place to support new customers who are redesigning their product lines for the next upturn, and implement the synergies and efficiencies presented to us by the merger as quickly as possible.\" On April 1, 2015, AgJunction divested its agronomy services operations to focus all of its resources on delivering the most accurate, innovative and reliable steering solutions. United States and Canadian combined revenues were down by 38 per cent from the third quarter of 2014, driven largely by the soft U.S. retail aftermarket. European revenues increased 26 per cent due to increased demand from OEM customers. Sales to other markets, including South America and Asia, declined 22 per cent. Consolidated Q3 2015 gross margin was $3.3-million, or 44 per cent of revenue, versus $3.9-million, or 41 per cent of revenue, in Q3 2014. The difference in gross margin percentages was primarily due to differing product sales mix. Total operating expenses were reduced year over year by 15 per cent to $4.1-million, from $4.8-million in the third quarter of 2014. Research and development expenditures of $1.4-million declined by $500,000, or 23 per cent, compared to $1.9-million during the third quarter of 2014. The decline was primarily due to the sale of the agronomy services business, and a greater portion of research and development expenditures being spent on capitalized engineering projects. Sales and marketing expenses of $900,000 declined by $600,000, or 38 per cent, compared with $1.5-million during the third quarter of 2014, due to several cost saving initiatives and efficiencies realized through restructuring. General and administrative expenses were $1.7-million for the quarter, increasing from $1.5-million, or 21 per cent, in 2014. Novariant merger-transaction-related costs of $200,000 were incurred in the third quarter of 2015. For the third quarter ended Sept. 30, 2015, the company reported a net loss of $790,000, or one cent per share (basic and diluted), compared with a net loss of $816,000, or one cent per share (basic and diluted), in the third quarter of 2014. Nine-month financial review For the nine-month period ended Sept. 30, 2015, AgJunction reported revenues of $27.4-million representing a 21-per-cent decrease from $34.8-million for the same period in 2014. Gross margin for the first nine months of 2015 was $12.1-million, or 44 per cent, versus $16.3-million, or 47 per cent, in the comparable period. Operating expenses declined $3.5-million, or 21 per cent, on a year-over-year basis primarily due to decreases in engineering headcount, of which $500,000 is due to the sale of the agronomy services business, decreases in project spending, and an increase in capitalized research and development. For the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2015, the company generated net income from continuing operations of $700,000, or one cent per share, (basic and diluted), compared with a net loss from continuing operations of $100,000, or nil per share, the first nine months of 2014. At the end of the third quarter of 2015, the company held cash of $11.9-million compared with $11.2-million at the end of 2014. Working capital was $25.0-million, up from $22.4-million at Dec. 31, 2014. At Sept. 30, 2015, AgJunction had 72,322,063 common shares outstanding.

(TSX:AGU) (NYSE:AGU) announced today 2015 third quarter net earnings from continuing operations of $99-million compared to $91-million in the third quarter of 2014. The increased net earnings are due to higher sales volumes of Wholesale nutrients combined with lower production costs in the Wholesale business unit, while Retail's earnings were similar to the prior year, despite weaker market conditions. Highlights: Third quarter adjusted net earnings of $97-million or $0.71 per share and $5.73 per share year to date in 2015 on the same basis. Wholesale's results were boosted by nitrogen and potash performance, which saw higher volumes and lower costs, leading to an improvement in gross profit, despite lower nutrient prices. Agrium achieved 94 percent ammonia capacity utilization in the third quarter, exceeding the 90 percent target rate. The Canpotex proving run is well underway at our Vanscoy potash facility and is progressing as expected. Retail EBITDA2 in the U.S. and Australia were higher than the same quarter last year reflecting Operational Excellence initiatives. Total Retail EBITDA of $129-million for the quarter was in line with the prior year, despite the impact of drought conditions in the Canadian business. Agrium has repurchased 5.6 million shares since the beginning of April under its current Normal Course Issuer Bid. 2015 annual guidance range has been narrowed to $7.10 to $7.40 diluted earnings per share. 'Agrium's performance this quarter is another demonstration of the resilience of our business model. We focused on what we can control, improving our on-stream Wholesale performance and optimizing our distribution network and effectively managing costs in Retail, all of which helped drive a 9 percent increase in earnings over the same period last year despite prevailing market headwinds,' commented Chuck Magro, Agrium's President and CEO. 'We see strong crop input demand during the fall application season which is now in full swing and we are confident that our strategy and business structure can continue to deliver value to all our shareholders,' added Mr. Magro. MARKET OUTLOOK For the third consecutive year, favorable growing conditions have contributed to above-trend global grain yields. Even in geographies which faced challenging conditions early in the growing season, such as parts of the U.S. Corn Belt and Western Canada, yield prospects have come in stronger than anticipated. Despite historically high production, the outlook for grains is more positive than it was a year ago and as of the end of October 2015, cash corn prices were more than 10 percent above 2014 levels, although oilseed prices are lower year-over-year. Excluding China, the global grain stocks to use ratio is projected to decline to the lowest level since 2012/13 and the U.S. corn supply/demand balance is projected to tighten. As a result of projected lower 2015/16 U.S. corn ending stocks, analysts project that U.S. corn area will increase in 2016. We expect normal North American crop nutrient application rates in the 2015/16 fertilizer year and expect that fall demand in 2015 will improve relative to 2014 levels as harvest progress is significantly ahead of last year, supporting a wider application window than the short 2014 season. In addition, we expect the overall planted acreage and crop mix to support increased crop nutrient demand. The devaluation of most non-U.S. currencies over the past year has negatively impacted crop input demand and U.S. dollar prices. While growers in most market driven non-U.S. regions have realized a net benefit from lower local currency values due to improved local currency crop prices, crop nutrient prices in local currencies have increased significantly in some cases, which has been negative for demand. Currency devaluations have directly impacted crop nutrient demand and prices in Brazil and India. In Brazil, higher local prices, combined with lending constraints have negatively impacted import demand, however, downstream inventories have been drawn down to meet farm-level demand. In India, the devaluation of the rupee has pressured phosphate prices in order to be economical under the subsidy regime, while Indian buyers have delayed execution on some contracted potash volumes. Globally, the downstream distribution network has been drawing on nutrient inventories to meet grower demand and purchasing on a just-in-time basis, which has led to relatively slow demand for all products. This has been the case in the U.S. urea market, as offshore imports of urea are estimated to be down 19 percent through the end of October 2015. The urea market has also been under pressure due to the combination of the devaluation of the Chinese yuan and lower anthracite coal prices, which have lowered the marginal cost of production. Chinese production levels in September in 2015 declined by 6 percent from August levels as a result of these market pressures and are expected to drop through the remainder of the year. Similarly for potash, strong shipments of potash in 2014 and the first half of 2015 allowed downstream inventories to increase. Buyers have been drawing upon these inventories in the second half of 2015, and prices have declined as spot sales volumes have declined. We expect pent-up demand to emerge late as fall applications occur and downstream inventories are drawn down. Similar to nitrogen and potash, phosphate demand has been slow in recent months, which has led to a reduction in phosphate production by some major producers. UPDATED ANNUAL 2015 GUIDANCE Based on our Market Outlook, Agrium expects to achieve annual diluted earnings per share of $7.10 to $7.40 in 2015 compared to our previous estimate of $7.00 to $7.50 per share. We have narrowed the guidance range but maintained a range width encompassing approximately $60-million of EBITDA variability to reflect the risk and opportunity associated with weather conditions and fall season length. We are assuming a normal fall season, recognizing there is always a risk that an early onset of inclement weather could bring an early close to the season. We have lowered the high-end and narrowed our anticipated Retail EBITDA range to $1.00-billion to $1.03-billion because of the impact of drought and lower crop prices on our Canadian operations in 2015. Our annual nitrogen production target remains unchanged. We narrowed our potash production range to 1.95 million tonnes to 2.05 million tonnes for 2015. We have updated the range for our annual effective tax rate for 2015 to 27 percent to 28 percent to reflect the anticipated geographic split of our global income. Our estimates of the Canada and U.S. foreign exchange rates and NYMEX for 2015 have been narrowed from our previous estimates based on current market conditions.

These non-IFRS financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. Please refer to the section entitled 'Additional IFRS and Non-IFRS Financial Measures' of this MD&A for further details, including a reconciliation of such measures to their most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with IFRS. The following interim MD&A is as of November 4, 2015 and should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Interim Financial Statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 (the 'Consolidated Financial Statements'), and the annual MD&A and financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014 included in our 2014 Annual Report to Shareholders. The Board of Directors carries out its responsibility for review of this disclosure principally through its Audit Committee, comprised exclusively of independent directors. The Audit Committee reviews, and prior to publication, approves this disclosure, pursuant to the authority delegated to it by the Board of Directors.

In respect of Forward-Looking Statements, please refer to the section titled 'Forward-Looking Statements' section of this MD&A. 2015 Third Quarter Operating Results CONSOLIDATED NET EARNINGS Agrium's 2015 third quarter net earnings from continuing operations were $99-million or $0.72 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations compared to net earnings from continuing operations of $91-million or $0.63 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the same quarter of 2014. Wholesale's sales volumes increased for all three crop nutrients for the third quarter and for nitrogen and phosphate for the first nine months of 2015 primarily as a result of higher operating rates. Realized selling prices for the third quarter decreased as a result of weaker market conditions but overall our average selling price increased for the first nine months of 2015. Product purchased for resale contributed to the decrease in sales as Agrium exited portions of this business. Wholesale's gross profit significantly increased due to lower natural gas input costs, manufacturing cost efficiencies and as a result of higher nitrogen, potash and phosphate volumes produced for the third quarter and first nine months of 2015 compared to the same periods last year. Retail's sales and gross profit decreased for the third quarter and first nine months of 2015 compared to the same periods last year primarily due to unfavorable weather conditions and competitive pricing pressure as a result of lower crop prices which impacted most of our product lines' sales and margins. Expenses General and administrative expense decreased by $9-million (13 percent) for the third quarter and $27-million (12 percent) for the first nine months of 2015 compared to the same periods last year as a result of reduced payroll and office expense costs as we continue to realize reductions related to our Operational Excellence program. Share-based Payments We had a share-based payment recovery of $15-million this quarter compared to a share-based payment expense of $10-million for the third quarter last year due primarily to the decrease in our share price. As a result of our higher average share price for the first nine months of 2015, our share-based payments expense increased by $11-million compared to the same period last year. Gains of $33-million were recognized on natural gas derivatives in the first nine months of 2014 and were recorded directly to other expenses. 2015 did not have comparable results, as starting January 1, 2015, we began to designate all of our natural gas derivatives as qualifying hedges for accounting purposes and the related gains or losses are recorded as part of cost of product sold when we sell the related product while unrealized gains or losses are recorded in equity. We completed the sale of our Niota and Meredosia storage and distribution facilities in the first quarter of 2015 resulting in a gain on sale of purchase for resale assets of $38-million. Effective Tax Rate The effective tax rate on continuing operations of 27 percent for the third quarter is higher than the tax rate of 18 percent in the comparative quarter in 2014 (excluding the effect of the recognition of a previously unrecognized tax benefit of $29-million) because of higher earnings in higher taxed jurisdictions. The effective tax rate of 29 percent for the first nine months of 2015 is higher than the rate of 27 percent for the same period last year (excluding the effect of the recognition of a previously unrecognized tax benefit) due to the increase in the Alberta provincial statutory tax rate. Retail sales and gross profit during the quarter were lower than the same period last year due to generally lower crop input prices, weaker non-U.S. currency exchange rates and dry weather conditions in our international and Canadian operations. Regionally, the U.S. EBITDA contribution was up approximately 4 percent over the same period last year. Australia reported a 40 percent increase in EBITDA, due mostly to a focused effort in reducing overall operating costs. Canada and South America EBITDA declined as poor growing conditions hampered demand for all crop inputs. Retail selling expenses as a percentage of sales were marginally higher this quarter due to lower total sales. However, total selling expenses were down $33-million compared to the same period last year as a result of cost reductions primarily in our Canadian and Australian Retail operations. Total crop nutrient sales were 10 percent lower compared to the same period last year due to a reduction in both average crop nutrient selling prices as well as lower sales volumes. Total crop nutrient volumes were 4 percent lower this quarter across our Retail operations compared to the same period last year. Virtually all of the reduction was due to lower demand in our International Retail, due to dry conditions and lower planted wheat acreage. Despite lower corn and total seeded acreage this year in North America, sales tonnes in the region were relatively flat compared to the third quarter of 2014. Crop nutrient margins on a per tonne basis were lower across all regions. Margins from our international Retail declined by 28 percent over the same period last year. North American operations were 15 percent lower as a result of declining crop nutrient prices. Crop protection products Total crop protection sales were down 8 percent year-over-year with most of the reduction due to a combination of drought conditions impacting sales within our Canadian operations, lower demand for insecticides in the U.S. and lower prices for glyphosate products. International crop protection sales also experienced a decline related to dry conditions in those regions. Crop protection margins as a percentage of sales increased year-over-year, largely due to timing of rebates and new programs from suppliers in the U.S. market. Additionally, proprietary crop protection margins as a percentage of sales increased by 5 percent over the same period last year with the most significant increases in Canada and Australia. Seed Seed sales were up 11 percent this quarter compared to the same period last year. The increase was due primarily to excessive moisture conditions in the Eastern U.S. during June, which pushed corn and soybean seeding into July of this year. The excessive moisture also prevented a significant amount of corn and soybean acreage in the region from being planted and much of this area was seeded with wheat, rye grass and other grass seed instead. Seed sales and margins were negatively impacted by competitive pressures across the seed industry, as well as lower sales volumes in Canada. Seed margins as a percentage of sales were 43 percent this quarter compared to 50 percent in 2014. Increased sales volumes of wheat, rye grass and other grass seed, which are lower margin products, were a key contributor to the lower margins. Merchandise Merchandise sales decreased compared to the same period last year as a result of lower fuel prices and demand in Canada and lower animal health sales in Australia. Gross margin as a percentage of sales was higher this quarter due to a decrease in lower margin Canadian fuel sales and our ability to maintain a better cost position in the Australian business, which consistently has higher margin products. Services and other Sales for services and other was down 21 percent this quarter, due mainly to the closure of our livestock export business in Australia. Application and other services sales, gross profit and gross margins were all higher in North America compared to the same period last year. NORMAL COURSE ISSUER BID In January 2015, the Toronto Stock Exchange ('TSX') accepted Agrium's notice of intention to make a normal course issuer bid ('NCIB') whereby Agrium may purchase up to 7,185,866 common shares on the TSX and New York Stock Exchange during the period from January 26, 2015 to January 25, 2016. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we purchased 5,574,331 shares at an average share price of $100.25 for total consideration of $559-million. Shareholders can obtain a free copy of the NCIB notice submitted to the TSX from Agrium upon request. OUTSTANDING SHARE DATA Agrium had 138,169,000 outstanding shares at October 31, 2015. At that date, under our stock option plans, shares expected to be issued for options outstanding were negligible. The agricultural products business is seasonal in nature. Consequently, comparisons made on a year-over-year basis are more appropriate than quarter-over-quarter comparisons. Crop input sales are primarily concentrated in the spring and fall crop input application seasons. Crop nutrient inventories are normally accumulated leading up to each application season. Our cash collections from accounts receivables generally occur after the application season is complete and our customer prepayments are mostly concentrated in December and January. ADDITIONAL IFRS AND NON-IFRS FINANCIAL MEASURES Certain financial measures in this MD&A are not prescribed by IFRS. We consider these financial measures discussed herein to provide useful information to both management and investors in measuring our financial performance and financial condition. In general, an additional IFRS financial measure is a measure relevant to understanding a company's financial performance that is not a minimum financial statement measure mandated by IFRS. A non-IFRS financial measure generally either excludes or includes amounts not excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS. Non-IFRS financial measures are not recognized measures under IFRS and our method of calculation may not be directly comparable to that of other companies. These non-IFRS measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS.

(TSX:AGU) (NYSE:AGU) announced today 2015 third quarter net earnings from continuing operations of $99-million ($0.72 diluted earnings per share), compared to $91-million ($0.63 diluted earnings per share) in the third quarter of 2014. The increased net earnings are due to higher sales volumes of Wholesale nutrients combined with lower production costs in the Wholesale business unit, while Retail's earnings were similar to the prior year, despite weaker market conditions. Highlights:  \"Agrium's performance this quarter is another demonstration of the resilience of our business model. We focused on what we can control, improving our on-stream Wholesale performance and optimizing our distribution network and effectively managing costs in Retail, all of which helped drive a 9 percent increase in earnings over the same period last year despite prevailing market headwinds,\" commented Chuck Magro, Agrium's President and CEO. \"We see strong crop input demand during the fall application season which is now in full swing and we are confident that our strategy and business structure can continue to deliver value to all our shareholders,\" added Mr. Magro.  MARKET OUTLOOK For the third consecutive year, favorable growing conditions have contributed to above-trend global grain yields. Even in geographies which faced challenging conditions early in the growing season, such as parts of the U.S. Corn Belt and Western Canada, yield prospects have come in stronger than anticipated. Despite historically high production, the outlook for grains is more positive than it was a year ago and as of the end of October 2015, cash corn prices were more than 10 percent above 2014 levels, although oilseed prices are lower year-over-year. Excluding China, the global grain stocks to use ratio is projected to decline to the lowest level since 2012/13 and the U.S. corn supply/demand balance is projected to tighten. As a result of projected lower 2015/16 U.S. corn ending stocks, analysts project that U.S. corn area will increase in 2016. We expect normal North American crop nutrient application rates in the 2015/16 fertilizer year and expect that fall demand in 2015 will improve relative to 2014 levels as harvest progress is significantly ahead of last year, supporting a wider application window than the short 2014 season. In addition, we expect the overall planted acreage and crop mix to support increased crop nutrient demand. The devaluation of most non-U.S. currencies over the past year has negatively impacted crop input demand and U.S. dollar prices. While growers in most market driven non-U.S. regions have realized a net benefit from lower local currency values due to improved local currency crop prices, crop nutrient prices in local currencies have increased significantly in some cases, which has been negative for demand. Currency devaluations have directly impacted crop nutrient demand and prices in Brazil and India. In Brazil, higher local prices, combined with lending constraints have negatively impacted import demand, however, downstream inventories have been drawn down to meet farm-level demand. In India, the devaluation of the rupee has pressured phosphate prices in order to be economical under the subsidy regime, while Indian buyers have delayed execution on some contracted potash volumes. Globally, the downstream distribution network has been drawing on nutrient inventories to meet grower demand and purchasing on a just-in-time basis, which has led to relatively slow demand for all products. This has been the case in the U.S. urea market, as offshore imports of urea are estimated to be down 19 percent through the end of October 2015. The urea market has also been under pressure due to the combination of the devaluation of the Chinese yuan and lower anthracite coal prices, which have lowered the marginal cost of production. Chinese production levels in September in 2015 declined by 6 percent from August levels as a result of these market pressures and are expected to drop through the remainder of the year. Similarly for potash, strong shipments of potash in 2014 and the first half of 2015 allowed downstream inventories to increase. Buyers have been drawing upon these inventories in the second half of 2015, and prices have declined as spot sales volumes have declined. We expect pent-up demand to emerge late as fall applications occur and downstream inventories are drawn down. Similar to nitrogen and potash, phosphate demand has been slow in recent months, which has led to a reduction in phosphate production by some major producers. UPDATED ANNUAL 2015 GUIDANCE 5 Nov 2015 07:30 ET Press Release: Agrium Reports Solid Third Quarter -2- Based on our Market Outlook, Agrium expects to achieve annual diluted earnings per share of $7.10 to $7.40 in 2015 compared to our previous estimate of $7.00 to $7.50 per share. We have narrowed the guidance range but maintained a range width encompassing approximately $60-million of EBITDA variability to reflect the risk and opportunity associated with weather conditions and fall season length. We are assuming a normal fall season, recognizing there is always a risk that an early onset of inclement weather could bring an early close to the season. We have lowered the high-end and narrowed our anticipated Retail EBITDA range to $1.00-billion to $1.03-billion because of the impact of drought and lower crop prices on our Canadian operations in 2015. Our annual nitrogen production target remains unchanged. We narrowed our potash production range to 1.95 million tonnes to 2.05 million tonnes for 2015. We have updated the range for our annual effective tax rate for 2015 to 27 percent to 28 percent to reflect the anticipated geographic split of our global income. Our estimates of the Canada and U.S. foreign exchange rates and NYMEX for 2015 have been narrowed from our previous estimates based on current market conditions. This guidance and updated additional measures and related assumptions are summarized in the table below. Guidance excludes the impact of share-based payments expense (recovery), gains (losses) on foreign exchange and non-qualifying derivative hedges and significant non-operating, non-recurring items. 2015 ANNUAL GUIDANCE RANGE AND ASSUMPTIONS  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS November 4, 2015 Unless otherwise noted, all financial information in this Management's Discussion and Analysis (\"MD&A\") is prepared using accounting policies in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\") and is presented in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 - Interim Financial Reporting.
