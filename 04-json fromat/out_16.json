He said using precision agriculture and controlled traffic could allow growers to plant new crop near, but not on, the old crop row. \"This is good in allowing the new crop more access to moisture,\" he said. \"The improvement in soil structure and water holding capacity is really important. \"We've had some really good results, where you can get water infiltration to 1 metre in just 18 hours, compared to other soils where it can pool on the surface due to poor soil structure.\" At present, Mr Larocque said he operated on relatively wide-row spacings, about 30 centimetres, to allow inter-row cropping and fertiliser application. Other modern initiatives on Mr Larocque's farm in Alberta include the use of GreenSeeker technology for mapping and nitrogen management purposes. He said he is using a side-banded nitrogen strategy in-crop. The advantage of this compared to conventional top-dressing is that it cuts down on losses to volatilisation. Mr Larocque places particular emphasis on soil temperatures in terms of crop yields He said temperature had double the effect on yield than moisture."}, {"title": "Press Release: AgJunction Q4 2013 Conference Call Notice", "article": "AgJunction Q4 2013 Conference Call Notice Canada NewsWire HIAWATHA, KS, Feb. 26, 2014 HIAWATHA, KS, Feb. 26, 2014 /CNW/ - (TSX: AJX)--AgJunction Inc. will release financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2013 prior to the open of trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Wednesday March 19, 2014.

That's why squeezing every last bit of yield from fields is even more important. Two farmers and two industry specialists shared their views concerning precision agriculture at the Southwest Agriculture Conference in Ridgetown in January. Darryl Lacey with Delta Power Equipment's technology and innovation group said there's far more to precision agriculture than driving straight. A far more important consideration is the ability to avoid overlaps. With corn, for example, farmers can lose more than $200 for each overlap acre. In a square or rectangular field, overlap area typically add up to four to six per cent of the field. \"Using automatic row shutoffs is one of the most critical things we can do and it's one of the quickest payoffs... it's the lowest hanging fruit in precision farming,\" Lacey said. \"Do 60,000 nubbins equal 30,000 cobs? The answer is no.\" Rick Willemse near Parkhill and Chris Boersma at Ridgetown have been investing in precision agricultural technology for years; Willemse since the 1980s. Boersma said his family has worked with the agronomists at Thompsons Limited since the 1990s to optimize their overall soil nutrient levels. Now he's applying variable rate technologies in an effort to get the biggest payback on each and every acre. \"Once you get all the equipment, the row shutoffs, the auto steer and the controller you can do a lot off different things,\" he said. Boersma's decisions are based on mapping various parameters, such yields and caton-exchange capacity, together his family's own experience with their fields. That's led to variable rate nitrogen application and even variable seeding with corn. \"We can adjust our inputs to mitigate some of what there -things like the sand knolls are hard clay,\" he said. Mike Wilson, advanced agronomy solutions specialist with Thompsons, said yield monitor data is the most important consideration. However, there are other tools including aerial imagery that evaluate plant health and soil maps that allow farmers to create management zones within their fields. The idea is to identify the limiting factors or factors in fields. For instance, some parts of the field may be deficient in a particular nutrient. \"Once you create your zones, you can dive into the actual numbers within those zones,\" Wilson said. With enough data and proper analysis, zones of profitability can be established. In some areas, backing off on the amount of fertilizer applied can result a higher return on the investment, Wilson said. In other areas it can pay to push harder. Check strips can than confirm whether or not the right decisions were made. Boersma said his global positioning satellite (GPS) system with its two to three-inch accuracy is good enough. Willemse employs the ultimate in agricultural GPS, RTK -real time kinematic -satellite navigation. It's accurate within a half inch. In wheat, it allows him to follow his tracks when applying fungicides, herbicide and nitrogen. Willemse agreed with the Lacey's views on the importance of reducing overlap said with his highly automated system it's important to take time for the initial setup before starting a new job. That's a matter of entering the parameters detailing your equipment and inputs. The rate of liquid fertilizer is automatically set through a flow meter, eliminating the need to manually calculate the desired rate with trial run. Since he has been using his larger 24-row planter, Willemse said been able to reduce his ground speed but still cover a lot of ground. Traveling at about 3.8 miles per hour, the seed is delivered with less jostling and bounce for better placement. \"I can fine tune the planting speed to get that (quality of placement) up to 100 per cent. Sometimes that's a matter of a tenth of a mile per hour,\" Willemse said. \"I've seen the results. They're good. I've been trying to get a picket fence stand for 30 years and now I can.\" Willemse doesn't employ an automated turnaround feature but the auto steer guides his equipment through the field. He said spends much of his time in the cab watching the monitor and making fine adjustments. He said his Trimble controller works with multiple pieces of equipment -planter, no-till drill, fertilizer spreader, self-propelled sprayer and combine."}, {"title": "The stage can be set for an agricultural comeback", "article": "Something I enjoy in the winter, apart from feeding the wood stove, is attending farm meetings. In good times and bad, Ontario's agricultural organizations -serving 50,000 farms and over 200 commodities -provide a valuable forum for all involved to advocate, and kick around ideas and information. MPP's Report Like the rest of the world, farmers are technology consumers -something that has been documented over the 10,000-year history of agriculture. Our 200-year tradition of farm meetings does not take away from the fact farmers embrace technology, including information technology - using the phone portion of the smart phone far less than using it to browse the web and tap into social media. Close to half the farms in Ontario rely on the Internet for business. In contrast to days gone by, intensive agriculture, precision farming, biotech enhanced production, robotics, drones and automation obviously play a much larger role in today's agri-business. Agriculture and agri-food are now facing a tremendous opportunity and a tremendous challenge -the world's population has exploded to seven billion. When my family started farming in Norfolk in 1796, it was one billion. Feeding the growing billions, requires a tremendous acceleration of knowledge and technology to produce more food, feed, fibre and fuel, while trying to use less input of energy, water, chemical and acreage. One thing technology can't produce is more land. An economic impact analysis for the Alliance of Ontario Food Processors pegged food and beverage as a $39-billion sector, with over 120,000 direct jobs and close to $7 billion in exports. As worldwide demand grows, so will the demand for farm labour, particularly skilled labour, agronomists, feed nutritionists . . . Another study commissioned by the Ontario Agricultural College found a huge gap in the supply of agri-food graduates. They have three job openings for every OAC graduate. For the sake of Ontario's agri-food future, we need people who have a background in science, mechanics and computers as well as animal husbandry and crop production. Those involved know that farming and food business can be a tough way to make a living. Farming and finding a market is always difficult. We need to ensure confidence that farming still has the potential for a rewarding and profitable career. Another study, by management consultants McKinsey and Company, anticipates by 2025, the world's emerging economies will develop middle classes able to spend $30 trillion annually in global markets -markets for the kind of things we grow, feed, mine and manufacture. McKinsey and Company call this \"the biggest growth opportunity in the history of capitalism\". Kellogg's, Bick's and Heinz capitalized on Ontario's potential and established successful industries. A variety of factors -globalization, high electricity prices and the cost of doing business here -drove them away. We need to create an environment to lure these types of industries back. We can be the breadbasket for the globe, and ignite a comeback in our farm and rural areas. But to do this, we must get our economic and political fundamentals in order. Developing our agricultural and natural resources cannot be an afterthought. Indifference is a killer. Production advances are many, but it still takes a seed to grow a plant and feed to raise livestock. Beyond that, we need policy for bold, confident action to capitalize on the projected boom in agriculture."}, {"title": "(PR) Connectivity between Equipment and Data Platforms Creates Efficiency for Farmers.", "article": "CALGARY, Feb. 18, 2014 /PRNewswire/ - Agri-Trend Data Corp and John Deere are creating connectivity conduits between MyJohnDeere and The AGRI-DATA(R) Solution.

And Denys, the vice-president of sales and marketing for Pain Court-based Pride Seeds, says that extra corn will be needed. It will be used to help feed the world's population, which by 2050 is forecast to reach nine billion people. Speaking at the Chatham-Kent Farm Show in Chatham on Jan. 29, Denys said new technologies are being developed to help farmers achieve those yields, and most of them are already in place. Corn yields are being boosted with the help of better fertility, new seed treatments, better seed quality, better mechanical devices, and by better use of all of the information being gleaned from GPS and other computer-driven devices. Among the most exciting is something called prescription farming. It allows farmers to maximize productivity by combining all of the data collected by their GPS and GIS monitors and applying that information to certain \"management zones\" within the field that are predetermined by fertility and other variables. Farmers can select the seed that will be the most responsive for each particular zone, and that seed can be accurately planted by using computer-engaged equipment. Such precision helps promote a uniform growth of a corn or soybean crop, and such uniformity, said Denys, usually leads to higher yields. \"The emphasis on precision farming will help make parts of your farm that aren't traditionally as productive more responsive to the potential for greater yields,\" he said. \"I think 300 bushels to the acre will become the reality for Ontario corn farmers through the use of this and other new technologies,\" Denys added. \"We're getting there, there's no doubt about it.\" He said Ontario agriculture has experienced enormous yield increases in recent decades because farmers have been willing to embrace new technologies. He noted that in the U.S., records show the average corn yield in 1900 was 20 bushels to the acre, but through the use of new hybrid seeds introduced in the 1930s and 40s, that national average was increased to 60 bushels by 1960. And average yields were increased to 160 bushels to the acre by 2000, partly because of the advent of new biotechnologies in the 1990s. Denys, who is past president of the Canadian Seed Trade Association, said seed companies like Pride and others are taking advantage of agriculture's information revolution to better streamline their own operations and to deliver improved seed products within a shorter frame of time. As an example, he pointed to DiHaploid breeding programs, which reduce the time needed to develop a new seed by a decade. Under a conventional breeding program, if the first cycle was launched in 2001, the fourth cycle would be completed by 2024. But the DiHaploid program is able to complete five cycles within 13 years. Denys said such progress in the technology used by the seed companies means farmers have access to new and better seeds within a shorter time, but it also means that the seed companies can boost their return on investment. \"For the companies, the challenge is to bring new products in as quickly as possible by compressing the product development period, and DiHaploid breeding and other management tools help those companies achieve that goal.\" Denys said the use of such technology -by farmers and by agri-business -means that agriculture has become one of the most exciting sectors of the Canadian economy. \"There has been an unprecedented investment in agriculture over the past few years and that's because of the need to feed the planet's growing population, because of low interest rates, because people are seeking a great investment opportunity, and because of the intense drive that exists to increase yields and productivity,\" he said."}, {"title": "(PR) The National Optics Institute (INO) selects ING Robotic Aviation's Responder Aircraft for Scientific Research", "article": "OTTAWA, Feb. 10, 2014 /PRNewswire/ - The National Optics Institute (INO) has purchased ING Robotic Aviation's Responder rotary wing robotic aircraft system, which includes the aircraft as well as a Ground Control System (GCS) and ancillary equipment, for an advanced sensor integration project.

The 28-year-old worked in public relations and communications after university, but didn't enjoy the work. \"I'd sit at my desk and stare out the window, longing to be outside,\" he says. Then his sister married a third-generation farmer and moved to Brandon, Man. \"They offered me a job on their farm, so I packed up and headed west.\" Two years later, Vajdik graduated from the agribusiness program at Manitoba's Assiniboine College where he learned about agronomy, computer applications, risk management, communications, customer service, sales and marketing and business management. His days are now spent helping his brother-in-law manage Lost Island Farms, an 1,821-hectare grain operation along the Assiniboine River. He's involved in every part of the business, from determining which crops to grow, to monitoring for pests, harvesting, hauling grain and daily equipment maintenance. Vajdik enjoys the challenges that go along with farming, he says. \"The environment is always changing, whether it's insect pressures, consumption trends, world markets, the weather or technology.\" The fact that he didn't grow up on a working farm has helped him to bring a new perspective to operations at Lost Island Farms, says Vajdik. \"I don't see things the same way as people that have been on a farm their whole life and I question traditional practices. This can, and does, help bring about change that improves productivity.\" However, young people who choose a career in agriculture are becoming a scarce commodity, says Steve Peddie, president and agricultural talent scout with Calgarybased AgNetwork. The shortage of talent in the sector has reached a crisis level, he says, and it's not only putting pressure on the farm community, but associated businesses such as agri-retailers, research organizations, equipment dealers, grain terminal operators and finance companies. Derrick Turner, president of the Canadian Association of Diploma in Agriculture Programs (CADAP) agrees. Across the country there are as many as three available positions for every graduate, he says. \"There's a lot of potential out there for those with specialized knowledge. We have to make young people aware of the opportunities and get them enrolled in the appropriate programs.\" There's a misconception that completing a two-year agriculture diploma program means you'll be limited to working on a farm, adds Turner. But that's just scratching the surface, he says, citing the president of Cargill Canada who is a graduate of the agribusiness program at Assiniboine College. \"He worked his way from giving advice to producers in the field to becoming country president for a multinational organization. Another graduate is involved in international marketing and travels the world.\" An additional issue in attracting young people to the sector is outdated stereotypes, notes Peddie. \"Gone are the pitchforks and coveralls of yesteryear. Today, agriculture is a sophisticated, cutting edge, big-business sector where exciting advances in science and technology are taking place.\" Research and development are bringing forward new seed varieties, pest management tools and livestock techniques, he says. \"Many people don't realize how much high technology is involved in farming,\" adds Vajdik. \"With global positioning and global information systems, we have more information available to make crop decisions and to help determine which practices work best.\" This type of precision agriculture requires equipment that is large and expensive, says Turner. \"Operators need a knowledge of computers, application software and the data that is being collected. Equipment dealers need people who can teach farmers how to use the technology and make decisions based on that data.\" While Vajdik finds a great deal of beauty and peace in working in the outdoors and satisfaction in knowing that he's helping to feed the planet, he says the new equipment and technology add to the allure of his occupation. \"A $100,000 car may seem fancy to some, but you haven't seen anything until you've been in one of these half-million dollar machines.\""}, {"title": "Canadian guest here for grower updates", "article": "A CANADIAN cropping adviser will headline next month's Grains Research and Development Corporation grower updates.

Vajdik worked in public relations and communications after university but didn't enjoy the work. \"I'd sit at my desk and stare out the window, longing to be outside,\" he said. Then his sister married a third-generation farmer and moved to Brandon, Man. \"They offered me a job on their farm, so I packed up and headed west.\" Two years later, Vajdik graduated from the agribusiness program at Manitoba's Assiniboine College, where he learned about agronomy, computer applications, risk management, communications, customer service, sales and marketing. and business management. His days are now spent helping his brother-in-law manage Lost Island Farms, an 1,821-hectare grain operation along the Assiniboine River. He's involved in every part of the business, from determining which crops to grow, to monitoring for pests, harvesting, hauling grain and daily equipment maintenance. Vajdik enjoys the challenges that go along with farming, he said. \"The environment is always changing, whether it's insect pressures, consumption trends, world markets, the weather or technology.\" The fact that he didn't grow up on a working farm has helped him to bring a new perspective to operations at Lost Island Farms, Vajdik said. \"I don't see things the same way as people that have been on a farm their whole life and I question traditional practices. This can, and does, help bring about change that improves productivity.\" However, young people who choose a career in agriculture are becoming a scarce commodity, said Steve Peddie, president and agricultural talent scout with Calgarybased AgNetwork. The shortage of talent has reached a crisis level, he said, and it's not only putting pressure on the farming community, but associated businesses such as agri-retailers, research organizations, equipment dealers, grain terminal operators and finance companies. Derrick Turner, president of the Canadian Association of Diploma in Agriculture Programs, agrees. Across the country there are as many as three available positions for every graduate, he said. \"There's a lot of potential out there for those with specialized knowledge. We have to make young people aware of the opportunities and get them enrolled in the appropriate programs.\" There's a misconception that completing an agriculture diploma program means you'll be limited to working on a farm, Turner added. But that's just scratching the surface, he said, citing the president of Cargill Canada, who is a graduate of the agribusiness program at Assiniboine College. \"He worked his way from giving advice to producers in the field to becoming country president for a multinational organization. Another graduate is involved in international marketing and travels the world.\" An additional issue in attracting young people to the sector is outdated stereotypes, Peddie noted. \"Gone are the pitchforks and coveralls of yesteryear. Today, agriculture is a sophisticated, cutting-edge, big-business sector where exciting advances in science and technology are taking place.\" Research and development are bringing forward new seed varieties, pest management tools and livestock techniques, he said. \"Many people don't realize how much high-technology is involved in farming,\" Vajdik added. \"With global positioning and global information systems, we have more information available to make crop decisions and to help determine which practices work best.\" This type of precision agriculture requires equipment that is large and expensive, Turner said. \"Operators need a knowledge of computers, application software and the data that is being collected. Equipment dealers need people who can teach farmers how to use the technology.\" Vajdik said he gets satisfaction knowing that he's helping to feed the planet, but the new equipment and technology add to the allure of his occupation."}, {"title": "CANADIAN CLIMATE SERVICES", "article": "Under the actual context of climate and environ- mental changes, national climate information providers are presently updating their approach to deliver targeted and applied services to their cli- ents.

CLIMATE AND SOCIETY. \"Society has always had to deal with climate variability, including extreme weather. But the combined effects of climate change, population increase, urbanization, and environmental degradation present new and greater challenges,\" said Michel Jarraud, the WMO Secretary-General. Disasters linked to a weather- climate change continuum represent those which most affect human life, goods, and ecosystems across the world. To make a decision about and adapt to weather- climate impacts and to mitigate climate risks, the national hydrologic and weather services must provide to the public accessible and useful weather- climate information. Generally the public views such information within a binary framework (e.g., Is it going to rain? yes or no; Was this summer a result of climate change? yes or no), whereas industrial sectors (i.e., agriculture, transportation, infrastructure, among others) need more specific and complex weather-climate information. An integrated mul- tisectorial approach to address the issues associated to weather-climate information within the society requires citizens and institutions who understand that weather and climate (rain, drought, snow, heat wave) affect everyone (health, private enterprise and public service delivery, state of infrastructure) and the environment (ecosystems). Comprehensible informa- tion on weather and climate in general and sector- sensitive risk evaluation, as well as adaptation mea- sures, remains critical in this regard. Thus, beyond the generation of the classical weather-climate data, substantial education, communication tools, and expertise must be developed with a cross-sector and regionally integrated approach in order to respond to society's evolving needs in climate services. The latter appears to be a permanent dialogue and synergy between concerned professional staff (meteorologists, climatologists, environmental managers, and policy makers) and public- and private-sector-based users. This integrative and multidisciplinary vision consti- tutes the backbone of the Canadian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society 2012 \"climate services\" colloquium, held in spring 2012. This article sum- marizes the key issues and the consensus achieved during the meeting. CLIMATE SERVICES BACKGROUND. Increasing needs in terms of information and services characterize the current situation in the field of climate services (Vaughan 2011). Several factors such as the passage into an information economy and/ or the general perception of climate change drive the high demand (Cote and Pietroniro 2012). The first factor is linked to the increasing need for the delivery of information in a timely manner for decision making. The second is related to an increase in the frequency and the intensity of extreme weather events as well as the changes to Earth's climate (Pachauri and Reisinger 2007). The impact of these events over the last several decades has led to global efforts to reduce the vulnerabilities and to develop adaptation actions to climate variability and change. The growth of cities as well as that of rural areas has contributed to an increase in the number of marginalized and vulnerable populations facing hydroclimatic hazards. According to the literature, these types of hazards constitute almost 90% of all natural disasters. The significant societal impacts of hydroclimatic hazards led the WMO to organize a worldwide conference on climate services in June 2009 in Geneva, Switzerland. This international conference resulted in the organization of the first International Conference on Climate Services (Vaughan 2011).The vision of the GFSC is \"to enable society to manage better the risks and opportunities arising from climate variability and change, especially as they concern those who are most vulnerable to climate-related hazards.\" (Lucio 2012, p. 5) In October 2012, the WMO took steps to address issues surrounding climate variability and change through the adoption of an implementation plan and governance structure. Beyond the WMO, other insti- tutions have conducted discussions on the topic with a view to meet the new challenges related to the growing needs of society in climate services. The International Research Institute for Climate and Society (IRI) along with several partners organized the first International Conference on Climate Services (ICCS) (Vaughan 2011). In September 2012 a follow-up conference was held in Brussels, Belgium. One of the key outcomes of the first ICCS was the creation of a climate service partnership (CSP). The latter conference aimed to con- nect various global actions on climate services in order to provide a forum in which the actors developing climate services share documents, experiences, and compare lessons learned. The urgency to develop approaches to address climate services is felt globally, at both regional and national levels. In Europe this renewal is ref lected in initiatives at the state level. France and the United Kingdom are examples of nations that have launched initiatives in this direction: the Drias Future Climate project (Dandin et al. 2012; Lemond 2010) and the climate adaptation plan and service reforms in the Met Office (Buontempo 2012), respectively. In Africa, new initiatives like the ClimDev-Africa (UNECA 2011 and references therein) program have brought support to continental climate services that extend beyond that of national meteorological services. The priorities of ClimDev-Africa include capacity building of national institutions and de- veloping pilot projects oriented toward sector-based applications, such as in agriculture. The African Center of Meteorological Application for Develop- ment (ACMAD), representing the WMO in Africa, recommended the establishment of regional climate centers (RCC). Climate services reforms were also initiated in the United States and Canada. Both countries acknowledge the synergy between climate and water services. In the United States, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has developed a vision (Solomon et al. 2009) based on three questions: What needs to be done? How will it need to be done? What are the requirements? In the Canadian context, the renewal of climate services is considered in the framework of the Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC)'s signature project, which focuses on water and climate services (WCS) (Cote and Pietroniro 2012). The main objective of the WCS project is the production and delivery of essential water and climatic information, and climate predictions to decision makers. This project defines the composition of the WCS, including the devel- opment of a national, coordinated approach to the delivery of climate, impact-based weather and hy- drological predictions and projections over a range of time scales, that is, hourly, daily, seasonal, and yearly. MEETING OVERVIEW. The first Canadian Colloquium on Climate Services was entitled \"Climate Services for Vulnerable Societies\" and was organized within the 46th Annual CMOS Congress. The meeting was intended to be an interdisciplinary dialogue between different actors in the sector of climate services. It was also an opportunity for climate service users and providers as well as professionals working in the weather and climate sectors to exchange ideas. The meeting was preceded by a plenary session chaired by the Honorable David Grimes, president of WMO and assistant deputy minister of MSC, who presented the perspectives of meteorological and hydrological services in a Canadian context and, thereafter, highlighted Canada's international commitments, including support for the WMO and its GFCS. According to Grimes, science and technology are the key elements to cope with the climate challenges facing vulnerable societies. The colloquium on climate services included the following four sessions: 1) climate services: what is the current state of the affairs?; 2) users as the core of climate services; 3) service providers; and 4) posters. In addition to Canadian representatives from several institutions (federal, provincial, and regional organizations as well as climate services providers), conference participants working in climate services came from as far as Africa and the United Kingdom. KEY MESSAGES AND OUTCOMES OF THE COLLOQUIUM. The set of presentations, discussions, and exchanges allowed for the generation of several key messages. Climate services vision. According to the participants of the workshop, climate services should be based on appropriate communication between actors. Raw data must continue to be collected, analyzed, and transformed into products and services, through the modeling and information management system as retained in the GFCS structure. Despite the top- to-bottom structure of climate-related institutions (international to national and national to local), an increased role must be conferred upon regional actors in horizontal dialogue with one another in order to identify the needs of vulnerable populations and sectors and to develop products and services to address these needs. In fact, a regional framework should be aligned with users' needs. Climate information relevant to users' needs. The participants underlined the necessity to suppress the virtual wall between weather and climate: The latter should be considered as a continuum. Relevant infor- mation provided to users must correspond to their needs in terms of spatial and temporal resolutions. Furthermore, this information should be accessible, understandable, and relevant. To ensure efficiency, it is vital that climate information is regularly updated and covers sectoral needs. Finally, service providers as well as the public and media should be prepared to receive new products and services as a result of the renewal of climate services. Social and economic situations should be taken into account in order to ensure that the data are understood. Partnership and multisector approach. Providing various climate services remains a challenge in a world characterized by the information economy and rapid decision making. Strong and reliable partner- ships could contribute to the efficiency of climate services, especially on a regional scale. In fact, in terms of economic and social realities, regions are relatively homogenous entities. The synergy between actors involved in climate services can be expressed by the following actions: regional discussion tables or a conference board, providing interdisciplinary dialogue during periodic (e.g., a 2-yr basis) workshops focused on capacity building. A cross-sector-based approach between water and climate services met the approval of the participants. The synergy between these two close fields regarding the links between the hydrologic cycle and atmospheric processes remains interesting in a general context of budget reduction. In fact, available financial resources could be optimized, and the public could benefit by a better characterization of the links between water resources and the weather- climate continuum. On the other hand, public and private sectors could collaborate to lead and improve some weather- climate products. For example, Environment Canada uses Pelmorex Media Inc., a Canadian broadcast group, to broadcast weather warning information. But there is no collaboration between the two institutions in terms of information production despite the great experience of Pelmorex in public weather-climate reporting. Therefore, the adaptation to climate variability and change constitutes a significant opportunity to the private sector as reported by SNC-Lavalin Inc. during the colloquium. Society, climate, communication, and tools. Society remains exposed to various hydroclimatic risks. To reduce the vulnerability of particular populations and to limit the negative impacts of climate variability and change on these communities, it is vital that data circulate. New communication approaches on how to broadcast weather-climate continuum data and information with the associated uncertainty toward industries and the general public allow for more efficient climate services. Early warning systems and sector-based decision tools will protect people and goods, manage hydroclimatic risks, and seize opportunities linked to climate change. Furthermore, steps should be taken to increase the efficiency of climate services in using new media technologies such as smartphones, GIS, and web-based applications. CONCLUDING REMARKS. At this colloquium stakeholders, from providers to users of the climate services domain, recognized the need to adjust their practices and procedures in order to offer current products and services that meet the needs of a changing society. This awareness for change opens the way to capture new opportunities related to climate risk management and vulnerability reduction in a collab- orative, multidisciplinary, and interdisciplinary way, and according to spatial and temporal scales. Important issues regarding the effectiveness and the development of climate services came from this colloquium, including determining the nature of useful climate information, establishing efficient partnerships, and taking into account scientific and technological advancements in the development of products and services important in addressing climate change. Faced with climate services issues, participants suggested increasing efforts in the prevention of impacts inherent to climate variability and extremes. This horizon may be reached by a relevant, useful, and timely process of generating weather-climate information. The latter must be a consensus between involved organizations, particularly at the regional level."}, {"title": "CANADIAN CLIMATE SERVICES", "article": "Under the actual context of climate and environ- mental changes, national climate information providers are presently updating their approach to deliver targeted and applied services to their cli- ents.

Materials and tech were the only sector winners today, while energy and financials were weak. Dow Industrials finish in red despite almost 60 upside points produced together by Visa and 3M. DJIA slips 9.31 to 15875.26, and Nasdaq Comp loses 5.84 to 4023.68. S&P 500 ends 5.54 lower at 1781.00. (john.shipman@wsj.com) 15:59 EST - FBR is pleased to see Microsoft (MSFT) taking its time in deciding on a new CEO, after the company indicated the search is expected to be completed early next year. FBR still thinks Ford's (F) Alan Mulally \"is the clear favorite to lead Microsoft back to being known not just as a technological stalwart but as an innovator and major player in key secular areas,\" like software as a service, cloud and mobile. While MSFT doesn't have the \"dire financial state\" Mulally had to handle at Ford, \"we still deem the headwinds that Microsoft's bread-and-butter Windows and Office franchises face in the PC market as a Kilimanjaro-like challenge to overcome,\" FBR says. Shares off 0.9% at $36.55. (john.shipman@wsj.com) 15:31 EST - Today's analyst meeting by AGCO isn't sitting well with investors as the ag-equipment maker's stock is down 5%. Janney is \"somewhat less bullish\" on 2014 prospects and calls the event a \"good news/bad news affair.\" While EPS guidance \"was roughly in-line with the Street, management's tone on the near-term demand outlook was more bearish than it's been in some time.\" That overshadows the $500M addition to stock-buyback efforts, which AGCO said should take 18 months to spend, notes the investment bank. It adds AGCO is using some $800M of repatriated foreign earnings for the repurchases, taking advantage of overseas tax credits. Competitor CNH is down 3%, though Deere (DE) is holding up much better with a 0.5% decline. (kevin.kingsbury@wsj.com) 14:57 EST - \"We believe that 2014 will see growth in spending on high-ticket discretionary items by affluent consumers, whose confidence is likely boosted by rising global equity markets, rebounding housing prices, and a historically low interest rate environment,\" Wedbush says. That should benefit categories like luxury goods, recreational vehicles, home improvement and furnishings, high fashion and mattress companies, firm says. Meanwhile, \"value-priced product\" retailers and manufacturers \"likely to be under pressure as lower-income demographic remains challenged.\" That could hurt dollar stores, discount retailers and do-it-yourself auto, Wedbush says. (john.shipman@wsj.com) 13:57 EST - \"The mega cycle for the oil services industry will carry on in 2014,\" Barclays predicts, and declares that the reason to own oil services stocks \"remains clear.\" The firm actually cites a few reasons: \"the world is increasingly short energy, hydrocarbon prices are at attractive levels for investment and are likely to rise further, capex on energy investments is growing for a fifth consecutive year and, as the bottleneck, the oil services companies are likely to capture the lion's share of the economic benefit of this unfolding trend.\" Top pick remains Schlumberger (SLB) and then Halliburton (HAL). (john.shipman@wsj.com) 13:13 EST - Looks the Fed's promise of near-zero rates for a long time is sinking in with bond investors. A $32B sale of 2-year notes, tied closely to rate expectations given its short maturity, saw strong bidding this afternoon. Bids submitted could cover the offering amount 3.77 times over-- matching the highest since November 2012. Appetite was solid across dealers, direct and indirect buyers, who were happy to take a 0.345% yield on the notes. Treasurys tick up after the auction, with 10-year notes now 7/32 higher, yielding 2.85%. (cynthia.lin@wsj.com; @cynthialin_dj) 12:36 EST - Treasurys are drifting upward as investors shift away from US stocks. But gains should be capped here as investors want to stay evenly positioned ahead of the FOMC statement Wednesday. The decision poses risks to bond bulls and bears alike given the coin-flip odds assigned to a December taper. JPMorgan's weekly client survey reflects such balanced positioning, with long and short active accounts being dead even at 17% each while neutral stances dominate at 66%. (cynthia.lin@wsj.com; @cynthialin_dj) 12:04 EST - Chicken purveyor Sanderson Farms (SAFM) sold a record three-billion pounds of dressed poultry in fiscal 2013, but executives warn today on skimpier per-pound prices in recent months. SAFM got $1.80/lb for boneless chicken in August, COO Lampkin Butts says on conference call discussing earnings, but that fell to $1.40 in October, while the price of wings dropped about 40c. Overall, market prices for poultry products \"came down significantly from peaks earlier in the year,\" company says. SAFM's net income surged about five times to $45M in F4Q, though shares slide 3.9% to $68.00. (jacob.bunge@wsj.com; @jacobbunge) 11:34 EST - US stocks looking a little pasty after yesterday's snap-back rally, the S&P 500 currently giving back most of its Monday advance. Hard to figure it's concerns about the Fed announcing a tapering of asset purchases since most opinions seem to think the Fed won't pull the trigger until early next year, and today's CPI data support that notion. Health-care, energy and telecom sectors getting hit hardest. Buybacks and dividend hikes from Boeing and 3M help moderate the Dow's pullback vs the other indexes. DJIA down 42, near session low. Nasdaq falls 17, S&P 500 down 9.

The University of North Dakota's unmanned aircraft degree program, the nation's first, exploded from five students in 2009 to 120 students last year. Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University and Kansas State University have since added similar programs. Dozens of other schools offer some courses in what's known as UAS - unmanned aircraft systems - which range from drones as big as small planes to two-foot-wide mini-helicopters. Drones are best known for their use by the U.S. military, but other markets beckon. Amazon made a splash earlier this month by unveiling an embryonic effort that might someday deliver packages by drone, though the company acknowledged practical use is years away. Among those banking on a boom is Andrew Regenhard, an aviation student at the University of North Dakota and self-proclaimed video-game junkie. Instead of tapping his fingers on a controller, he is learning to fly the plane and use onboard equipment that includes a camera with a zoom lens. \"Some people argue that nothing is going to be like flying an actual airplane. Granted, looking down and seeing you're 5,000 feet above the ground is pretty exciting, but I've always been addicted to video games, and this is awesome,\" Regenhard said. The skills needed to fly larger unmanned planes are not unlike those required to fly modern aircraft with computer-based flight controls, professors say. The toughest part of unmanned flying comes with doing it from the ground: You can't feel what's going on. Most of the potential civilian drone market is in precision agriculture. Unmanned aircraft are already used for seeding and spraying in Japan. Drones may be used someday to detect disease in crops, depending on the development of sensors. The potential applications for other unmanned aircraft are endless, said Michael Toscano, president and CEO of the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International. The Boeing ScanEagle, which can fly for 20 hours on a couple of gallons of fuel, was originally developed to help commercial fishermen find and track schools of tuna. The Navy has used the plane to watch pirates. The Federal Aviation Administration projects some 7,500 commercial drones could be aloft within five years of getting widespread access to American airspace. An industry commissioned study last spring predicted more than 70,000 jobs would develop in the first three years after Congress loosens restrictions on U.S. skies. But concerns about security, privacy and whether drones will be able to detect and avoid other aircraft could push the grand opening beyond a 2015 deadline set by Congress.

Harwood graduated from Strathmore High School in 1993 and attended Olds College from 1999-2001, studying Ag-Business with Small Business and Entrepreneurship as his major. \"From there I eventually ended up managing a couple different farm business companies before getting into precision agriculture maintaining of mostly GPS applications,\" said Councillor Harwood. \"For the last 3 years I have been the territory manager for AgJunction in Alberta and B.C.\" Harwood got into politics, mostly because he wanted to understand and get more involved with the community. \"I could never understand why more people don't get involved, why they don't help with the process and I felt I could help fill that gap,\" said Councillor Harwood. \"You can't please everyone all the time but I am trying to represent the community and help then with the process any way I can.\" This will be Councillor Harwood first crack at politics. \"Although my experience is limited I feel I can learn and educate myself and others to be in the process and become effective to make a difference for our community,\" said Councillor Harwood.

Three years ago, the family planted its first crop of maize. Mr Torkelson would not describe himself as a \"proponent\" of climate change, but he has noticed more \"unpredictable\" weather patterns in recent years. The reason he now plants maize on 1,500 of his family's 6,000 acres is because \"good yields, high prices make corn very appealing\" and because seed companies such as Monsanto and DuPont Pioneer have bred corn that can mature during southern Canada's short growing season. But climatologists say it is clear that Mr Torkelson's new planting regime is partly driven by the effects of global climate change. Rises in global temperatures have changed where crops can be successfully grown around the world, including the expansion of the US corn belt northward into Canada. Extreme weather caused by climate change has led to roughly 40m tonnes in global grain losses and $1bn in losses in Asian rice production annually, according to the World Bank. It creates price volatility, according to Juergen Voegele, director of agriculture and environmental services for the World Bank. \"Climate change is already here and it is having an impact. We see this globally,\" he says. \"We see shifting production patterns and we see that every year the frequency of extreme weather events is increasing.\" The North American drought of 2012, by some estimates the worst since the 1930s, is an example of the havoc that climate change has wrought, driving maize prices to near-record highs and crippling production in the US heartland. Last month, a freak blizzard in South Dakota killed tens of thousands of livestock. \"In the 1950s and 1960s, there were fewer [extreme weather events], but in the past two decades, there has been an increased frequency of these,\" says Mr Voegele. Flooding and earthquakes tend to grab headlines, says Marc Sadler, an agricultural commodity expert for the World Bank. But climate change works in more insidious ways too. \"You do not need very big changes in precipitation or temperature to have quite a big impact in agriculture,\" he says. The domains of some pests have also expanded. Mr Sadler points to la roya fungus, also known as coffee rust, which destroyed between 25 and 30 per cent of coffee trees in some Central American countries this year. \"What drove that was a slightly longer rainy period, and a slightly warmer temperature at the same time, which created humidity in which la roya ... spread rapidly,\" Mr Sadler says. \"If you'd asked a farmer at that time if they noticed an extreme event, no one would have said 'yes'.\" David Hightower, who runs a commodity research firm, says the effect of erratic weather is felt more keenly than before, because of higher prices and higher production. \"A 10 per cent loss of production in the 1990s was a lot smaller deal than a 10 per cent loss today,\" he says. Last year's drought hit the US corn crop badly. Yield was 16 per cent down on 2011 and the harvest was 24 per cent below forecasts. Mark Rosegrant, director of the environment and production technology division at the International Food Policy Research Institute, says that, while the science is still developing, it is obvious that temperatures have increased over the past century and there is evidence of more, longer and more severe droughts. \"You can't say one-to-one that climate change caused those droughts, but the probability of those extreme droughts has certainly increased because of climate change,\" he says. The long-term effects are only going to become apparent in the next decade, says Mr Rosegrant. The institute forecasts that, if temperatures continue to rise apace, global production of corn, rice and wheat will drop by roughly 15 per cent by 2050, and by 20-30 per cent by 2080 as the effects of higher temperatures are felt. Considering that global yield increases on average by 1 per cent a year, such decreases will make it more difficult for food producers to meet demand if, according to UN estimates, the global population grows to 9bn by 2050. Seed companies are developing seeds that are drought-, heat- or flood-resistant, and seeds with traits that combat weeds and pests that occur in new environments. So-called \"precision agriculture\" - the application of data analytics, advanced GPS and remote sensing to farming - has become all but standard among tractor and seed companies, as they seek to help farmers increase yields efficiently. Systems that allow a tractor to map fields and precisely calibrate its movements to minimise wasted fuel, fertiliser or seed are widely available in the west. Increased productivity, the development of crops that are more resilient and a reduction in the carbon footprint will be crucial to development, says Mr Voegele. \"I think we are just at the beginning of a process to rethink how we take our food production forward,\" he says. \"I think we still have a long way to go.\""}, {"title": "AG Global and BioFert Manufacturing Partner to Develop Next Generation of Natural and Organic Fertilizer Products", "article": " AG Global, one of Canada's largest natural and organic fertilizer manufacturers with products available in retail outlets and distribution centers across North America, has expanded its relationship with BioFert Manufacturing, a manufacturer that produces 100% organic, organic-based, water-soluble and slow-release fertilizers based in British Columbia. \"For more than five years, AG Global principals and BioFert have worked together on distribution and product development in the organic and natural fertilizer industry,\" said Brian Iversen, AG Global CEO. \"We are thrilled to expand on our current relationship that makes the best strategic use of BioFert's unique strengths in product development and precision farming in naturals and organics.

Third quarter Financial Review On September 5, 2012, the Company announced a corporate restructuring to focus exclusively on its agriculture business, subsequently selling its non-agriculture business on January 31, 2013. To increase clarity of results for continuing operations of the agriculture business after divesting the non-agriculture business, and in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), the Company has reported the divested components of its business as \"discontinued operations\" in a separate line item in both the current and prior comparative periods. For the third quarter ended September 30, 2013, the Company reported revenues of $11.4 million, an increase of 9% from $10.5 million in the third quarter of 2012. Strong quarterly results in the OEM and Agronomy Service divisions, up 27% and 41%, respectively, from the comparative period, were partially offset by revenue declines in Outback and Air of 2% and 21%, respectively. European revenue growth increased 133% from the comparable period, driven primarily by OEM sales, while the US and Canada both declined by 7%, from the third quarter of 2012. \"I am pleased to report positive earnings during the third quarter which is typically the slowest period during the year,\" stated Rick Heiniger, President and CEO. \"Our return to profitability is a result of our focused efforts in simplifying and streamlining operations. At the same time we have structured the business to scale efficiently as we begin to turn our focus to sustained growth in our business segments.\" Third quarter gross margin contribution increased to 46% or $5.2 million, compared to 45% and $4.8 million for the third quarter of 2012. Operating expenses, including restructuring costs, improved to $5.2 million in the current quarter versus $6.8 million in the third quarter of 2012, a reduction of 24%. Research and development and sales and marketing expenditures declined by $0.6 million (27%) and $0.7 million (27%), respectively, as the company continues to benefit from the restructuring it initiated in Q3 2012. General and administrative expenses trended up $.1M (12%) compared to the third quarter of 2012. The Company reported a net income from continuing operations of $32 thousand, or $0.00 per share (basic and diluted), compared to a net loss of $1.9 million, or ($0.03) per share (basic and diluted) from continuing operations in the third quarter of 2012. Only a nominal loss from discontinued operations of $29 thousand was recorded for the quarter compared to a loss from discontinued operations of $0.8M in the third quarter of 2012. Comprehensive income for the quarter was $3 thousand, or $0.00 per share (basic and diluted), compared to comprehensive loss of $2.7 million, or ($0.04) per share (basic and diluted), in the third quarter of 2012. For the nine months ended September 30, 2013, AgJunction reported revenues of $44.4 million compared to $45.3 million for the same period in 2012. Gross margin for the first nine months of 2013 was $20.0 million (45%) versus $20.4 million (45%) in the comparable period. Operating expenses, including restructuring costs, have declined $2.5 million on a year-over-year basis primarily due to cost reductions within research and development, sales and marketing and restructuring costs. The Company generated net profit from continuing operations of $2.6 million, or $0.04 per share (basic and diluted) during the first nine months of 2013, compared to a net profit of $0.3 million, or $0.00 per share (basic and diluted), during the same period of 2012.

I was born in Newfoundland in 1959, and I settled in Alberta in 1985. I started my own business in 1988 in Strathmore, Alberta--Colin's Automotive. However, while working fulltime as a mechanic, I felt that I wanted to be able to contribute more to my community; I joined the RCMP as an Auxiliary Constable where I volunteered my time for the next 11 years. In 1991 I bought a large acreage outside Standard where I lived for the next 17 years, raising my two daughters and taking a hand at managing a farm, alongside running my shop, volunteering with the RCMP, and helping out local work experience students from the high school. When the physical demands of the shop became too much (I still try to help out friends and neighbours at my farm whenever I can), I went back to school, and obtained my Realtors' license in 2006 and began a fulltime real estate career in Strathmore and surrounding areas. I know and love this community, and I feel that my close ties within it, as well as my life and work experiences make me a great candidate for councillor for Wheatland County. Jacki Kirk (Division 2) Born and raised in Calgary, I graduated from the University of Calgary with a Bachelor of Education Degree in 1981, and taught Junior High in Calgary from 1981-1999. In 1985 I moved to Gleichen where we purchased our first home. After 15 years, I tired of the long and increasingly busy commute to the city, so, in 1999 I accepted a voluntary severance package from the CBE and purchased a local business, the Gleichen Hotel, which I managed until it sold in 2008. Having supervised the construction of our new home in Gleichen during 2009-10, and employed in 2011 by Statistics Canada as a Team Leader for the Canadian Census, I am currently semi-retired, and, at 56 years old, looking for new challenges. I am honest, reliable, public service oriented, and willing to work long hours representing the residents of Division 2. Thank you for this opportunity to introduce myself. Rex Harwood (Division 2) Raised on a farm north of Strathmore with my folks, 3 brothers and 1 older sister. When I was young we raised pigs, chickens, horses and cattle. As the farm grew the cattle herd and seeded acres increased and the other livestock ventures became nonexistent. My Great Grandfather was on many types of council and boards in Wheatland County for over 30 years. We were brought up on the values of hard work, respect, honesty & integrity. I attended the Ag Business program at Olds College from 1999-2001 and started building my career. Presently I am working as a Territory Manager in Alberta and B.C., for AgJunction, a precision farming product manufacturer. I reside east of Strathmore with my wife and 3 children. My goal is to make sure we are fiscally responsible, be fair, create positive, effective change that can be felt by all residents in the county. Donna Biggar (Division 3) We live in an amazing area. The community is diverse and has a brilliant future. Our lists of strengths include agriculture, industry, small businesses and tourism. But I feel our biggest asset is the people. Growing up in the area, I've had the privilege of living and working alongside these remarkable people. I'm so proud of their hard work, volunteerism and desire for growth. Through my work in agriculture, small business and tourism I've acquired many skills.

Christopher \"potato farmer\" Perry practices the \"art of farming with a whole lot of science behind it.\" That made him a perfect choice as a Speakerhead - someone who speaks at the Beakerhead festival (which is fusing arts, engineering and science for five days through Sunday) in Calgary. Speakerhead continues today on Stephen Avenue Walk with the topics of Your Invention is Ugly and Why That Matters; Flying Robots: Quadrocopters and Unmanned Vehicles; and Changing the World by the Seat of My Pants. The talks are engaging, short (about six minutes each) and hit the Beakerhead aim to be \"a sandbox for human ingenuity.\" The fact Perry spoke after an American astronaut who walked in space, and an astrophysicist, may have been a little intimidating, but he did it with humour and some clear science behind him ...and the crowd hung around. Perry, a fourth generation potato farmer and president of CKP Farms in Chin, Alberta, had as a talk title: \"Why Space and Potato Farming are Like Two Peas in a Pod.\" As a potato farmer - and he was quick to mention he hoped diners on the outdoor restaurant patios that lined the Speakerhead site were enjoying their \"French fries and potato chips\" - he said his farm could be referred to as \"Spudnick\" where data-driven, precision agriculture is practiced to feed the world. Modern technology, he says, has allowed him to take a Google imager to beam into potato fields and turn \"acres into pixels\" that help manage the resources it takes to run a farm. A giant metal pipe in a field with 150 sprinklers can be controlled through technology and allows maps from pictures taken from one week to the next, help determine the right nutrients and resources need for the fields, especially as the weather changes. An onsite data centre allows him to tap into the Alberta supernet, to add science to the art that farmers practice as winter approaches.

(Saskatoon, CA); Petruic, Matthew (Saskatoon, CA); Stuart, Graham (Saskatoon, CA); Wolowski, Evan (Saskatoon, CA), filed on January 21, 2013, was made available online on August 8, 2013, according to news reporting originating from Washington, D.C., by VerticalNews correspondents. Patent application serial number 746105 is assigned to CNH Canada, Ltd. The following quote was obtained by the news editors from the background information supplied by the inventors: \"Modern large acreage seeding implements pneumatically deliver seed, fertilizer, and/or other product to fields. An example is an air cart and an air drill that are pulled together behind a tractor to deliver product. Different seeding styles can be implemented by using different openers on the air drills. Knife, ribbon band, ribbon band sweep, double-shoot, and disk openers can be used for different seeding styles that can open correspondingly different styles of furrows to receive the seed. The air cart pneumatically conveys seed to the air drill for delivery into the furrow(s). Air carts include one or more storage compartments that hold product(s), each of which has an associated metering box. The metering box divides product(s) from the associated storage compartment(s) into equal sections for delivery of equal product volumes. The equally divided product(s) is entrained in an airflow established by a fan and delivered through manifolds and distribution lines that direct the product from the air cart, to the air drill, and to the field being planted with seed.\" In addition to the background information obtained for this patent application, VerticalNews journalists also obtained the inventors' summary information for this patent application: \"The present invention is directed to a particulate material delivery system that allows for variable rate sectional control while delivering particulate material to an agricultural field. The system may be incorporated with air carts and air drills, and that includes a metering system having multiple metering units that are independently controllable. This may allow for individual controlling product delivery rates through metering units so as to independently control the delivery rate(s) to each of multiple secondary distribution headers or manifolds, which may allow for sectional control of product delivery from the air drill. \"According to one aspect of the present invention, a particulate material delivery system is provided that may include an air cart and a planter that are towable behind a tractor. A metering system of the particulate material delivery system receives a product from the air cart and delivers the product to the planter for distribution to the ground, such as an agricultural field. The metering system may include multiple metering units that receive separate portions of the product from the air cart. Multiple prime movers may drive the multiple metering units. A controller is connected to and individually controls the multiple prime movers such that distribution rates of the multiple metering units can be varied independently of each other. The multiple prime movers may be electric motors. \"According to another aspect, each of the multiple metering units may include a metering roller, and a shaft that supports and rotates the metering roller. The electric motors may directly drive ends of the shafts that support the metering roller. \"According to another aspect, each of the multiple metering units may include a metering roller having an external gear at an outer circumferential surface thereof. Each electric motor may directly drive the external gear of a respective metering roller. \"According to another aspect, each of the multiple metering units may include a metering roller having an internal gear at an inner circumferential surface thereof. Each electric motor may directly drive the internal gear of a respective metering roller. \"According to another aspect, an airflow characteristic of an airflow that entrains the product may be controlled based on a delivery rate of at least one of the multiple metering units for pneumatically conveying product from the multiple metering units toward multiple opener units of the drill. The delivery rate of the product to multiple locations of the agricultural field may be individually controlled by controlling the delivery rate of product through each of the multiple metering units and controlling the airflow characteristic. This may allow for providing a particulate material delivery system that provides delivery consistency and control without requiring singulation-type equipment such as row-unit planters, which may provide a relatively simple and cost-effective air-seeder-type particulate material delivery system with a high amount of delivery accuracy. This may allow for delivery rate variability at secondary headers or manifolds of a single drill which allows for site specific precision farming. This may also allow for relatively more application precision by way of variable rate sectional control of a drill as compared to typical drills that each typically allows for delivery rate variability of only the whole drill. \"Other aspects, objects, features, and advantages of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description and accompanying drawings. It should be understood, however, that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating preferred embodiments of the present invention, are given by way of illustration and not of limitation.

All currency amounts are expressed in U.S. dollars. Second Quarter Financial Review On September 5, 2012, the Company announced a corporate restructuring to focus exclusively on its agriculture business, subsequently selling its non-agriculture business on January 31, 2013. To increase clarity of results for continuing operations of the agriculture business after divesting the non-agriculture business, and in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), the Company has reported the divested components of its business as \"discontinued operations\" in a separate line item in both the current and prior comparative periods. For the second quarter ended June 30, 2013, the Company reported revenues of $16.3 million, an increase of 4% from $15.7 million in the second quarter of 2012. Strong quarterly results in the OEM and Air divisions, up 36% and 30%, respectively, from the comparative period, were partially offset by a 20% decline in Outback sales during the period. The company experienced robust revenue growth in the US and Europe compared to the same quarter last year, 26% and 41%, respectively, while Canada and Australia declined by 26% and 58%, respectively, from the second quarter of 2012. \"AgJunction' s financial performance in the second quarter of 2013 is yet more validation of the strategic plans we put into motion during late-2012\" stated Rick Heiniger, President and CEO. \"The efforts put into revamping our product portfolio, streamlining supply chain and distribution activities, and rationalizing the cost structure, have provided the foundation for a profitable business model. During the second quarter we grew revenues, increased gross margins, and net profit from continuing operations improved by $1.0 million\". Second quarter gross margin contribution was 43% or $7.0 million, compared to 43% and $6.7 million for the second quarter of 2012. Operating expenses, including restructuring costs, were $6.1 million in the current quarter versus $6.7 million in the second quarter of 2012, a reduction of 9%. Research and development and sales and marketing expenditures declined by $0.4 million (16%) and $0.3 million (11%), respectively, while general and administrative expenses trended up slightly, largely due to finalizing the closure of our Calgary office. Restructuring costs were $0.07 million during the quarter primarily related to the AgJunction name change. The Company reported a net profit from continuing operations of $1.1 million, or $0.02 per share (basic and diluted), compared to a net loss of $0.2 million, or $0.00 per share (basic and diluted), in the second quarter of 2012. The loss from discontinued operations of $0.9M for the quarter was largely due to severance, rent, and salary expense incurred throughout the period. The Company reported a loss from discontinued operations of $0.5M in the second quarter of 2012. Net and comprehensive income, was $0.2 million, or $0.00 per share (basic and diluted), compared to a net and comprehensive loss of $0.6 million or ($0.01) per share (basic and diluted), in the second quarter of 2012.

According to news reporting originating in Toronto, Canada, by VerticalNews journalists, research stated, \"Photosynthesis is considered the most important physiological function because it constitutes the main biomass entrance for the planet and consequently it permits the continuance of life on earth. Therefore, accurate photosynthesis measurement methods are required to understand many photosynthesis-related phenomena and to characterize new plant varieties.\" The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Ryerson University, \"This project has been carried out to cover those necessities by developing a novel FPGA-based photosynthesis smart sensor. The smart sensor is capable of acquiring and fusing the primary sensor signals to measure temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, CO2, air pressure and air flow. The measurements are used to calculate net photosynthesis in real time and transmit the data via wireless communication to a sink node. Also it is capable of estimating other response variables such as: carbon content, accumulated photosynthesis and photosynthesis first derivative. This permits the estimation of carbon balance and integrative and derivative variables from net photosynthesis in real time due to the FPGA processing capabilities. In addition, the proposed smart sensor is capable of performing signal processing, such as average decimation and Kalman filters, to the primary sensor readings so as to decrease the amount of noise, especially in the CO2 sensor while improving its accuracy. In order to prove the effectiveness of the proposed system, an experiment was carried out to monitor the photosynthetic response of chili pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) as case of study in which photosynthetic activity can successfully be observed during the excitation light periods. Results revealed useful information which can be utilized as new tool for precision agriculture by estimating the aforementioned variables and also the derivative and integrative new indexes.\" According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"These indexes can be utilized to estimate carbon accumulation over the crop cycle and fast derivative photosynthesis changes in relation to the net photosynthesis measurement which can be utilized to detect different stress conditions in the crops, permitting growers to apply a correction strategy with opportunity.\" Our news correspondents report that additional information may be obtained by contacting J.R.

Back in 1972, Theatre Passe Muraille artistic director Paul Thompson headed out into Ontario's Huron County with a group of actors that included his wife, actor Anne Anglin, to research what became The Farm Show. Now, four decades later, give or take a year, Severn Thompson, actor offspring of Paul and Anne and a Shaw and Stratford Festival alumna, has returned to the area around Clinton, Ont., with a new crop of actors to create Beyond the Farm Show for the Blyth Festival. In a way, it's actually Severn's second time around - there's a picture of her, babe in arms, with her parents and the original cast at the front of the published edition of The Farm Show. Beyond the Farm Show, like the original, \"kind of bounces along one way or another and then it stops.\" There is, however, a recurring focus in the collection of scenes and monologues based on interviews with locals on how much farming has changed since the 1970s. \"People aren't so fussy about letting a person into their barns these days,\" explains Marion Day, channelling the jargon-spouting communications director of an egg farm in a very funny scene that opens the show. Before the actors are allowed to even see livestock in the year 2012, they have to sign waivers, don protective suits and dip their boots into antibacterial fluid. From there, Thompson's cast of five transforms into, and introduces us to, farmers who text and monitor stock prices on their smartphones while they ride tractors, one who gives ultrasounds to cows, and multiple proponents of genetically modified food and GPS-enhanced precision farming. There are others who have stayed true to or returned to basics, however, such as organic farmers and a group of Amish sisters who won't even let a visiting actor use a tape recorder. \"Part of the appeal of The Farm Show was you'd had these eccentric people around who don't exist any more,\" says one Mercedes-owning, baby-boomer farmer interviewed for Beyond the Farm Show, who remembers the original show. Naturally, he then goes on to prove himself wrong, as do other colourful characters like a pair of bachelor brothers (Jamie Robinson and Tony Munch) who sing an ode to their tractor collection and a young single woman (Catherine Fitch) who explains why she'd rather raise goats on her own than marry a dairy farmer. Comic moments abound in Beyond the Farm Show, but there are also touching scenes like the birth of a baby cow and a tentative encounter Fitch - playing herself - has with a young Mennonite woman played by Day. (The actor had her first child at the age of 39; the farmer's wife has three children in her early 20s.) Beneath the surface, anger bubbles among the locals about governments who, in their view, strangle rural areas with red tape and regulations that reflect urban values. The Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario has even cracked down on the parties young couples throw to raise money for their weddings. \"We don't have bars; we have buck and does,\" says one young single woman, explaining the ways the AGCO has criminalized a way of life. A farmer of Swiss background, played by Rylan Wilkie, even gets a fantasy sequence where he wrestles a series of government regulators to the ground. Judging by the cheers in the audience, many who live around Blyth, Ont., wish they could do the same. \"Isn't that the truth!,\" a man next to me exclaimed to his wife, an audience comment that I think is worth 100 good reviews. The Farm Show, which toured barns and then internationally, is the most influential work of English-Canadian theatre to emerge from the 1970s - inspiring everything from Michael Ondaatje's 1974 documentary, The Clinton Special, to Michael Healey's hit 1999 play, The Drawer Boy. Indeed, the Blyth Festival was created to continue telling the stories in and around Clinton that The Farm Show started. Hewing so closely to the original's form, however, Beyond the Farm Show misses the opportunity to demonstrate how much technology has changed theatre as it has transformed farming. The collective creation - in which actors absorb stories and people, then channel them through their bodies and voices - is great at painting broadly, less so at making specific points. A town council meeting put on stage here is impenetrable to an outsider, while subjects such as wind turbines demand deeper investigation. Montreal's Porte Parole and Toronto's Crow's Theatre have already taken documentary theatre forward with its play Seeds, about the battle between Monsanto Inc. and Saskatchewan farmer Percy Schmeiser. That high-tech production - touring the country next season - could have as easily been titled Beyond the Farm Show. Thompson's new creation is warm-hearted and entertaining, but doesn't go beyond. Globe and Mail Update"}, {"title": "Smartphones and the daily life of a farmer", "article": "Smartphones are becoming more entrenched in the daily life of a farmer. Having email and web access is certainly a big plus to the devices, but the applications make their effectiveness even stronger. Speaking anecdotally to farmers, a weather app is always the most common, usually followed by something to check the markets. From there, the applications used can be as diverse as the products farmers are producing. For grain and oilseed producers, crop scouting is an important tool for identifying pressures. Through the growing season, a farmer needs to stay on top of weed and insect pressures. When crops come off, it can be a good time to repair drainage problems or review yield-mapping information to try and determine why a particular spot in a field is consistently below average. This is where some new applications can be a big help. Take ScoutDoc as an example. Peter Gredig is the Vice-President of AgNition, the company behind the iPad app that was designed to eliminate the clip-b oard and pen at the same time as improving communication. \"We knew this was a perfect fit for a tablet and we knew we could be on the leading edge of the technology,\" Gredig says. The app was released in early 2012. Among the features of the app is importing a satellite map image, and then making notes on it as you scout. The report can then be printed or emailed. \"An update submitted to Apple and pending approval (as of early March) will include GPS functionality that auto-generates the satellite maps based on the location and even can drop pins where there is an issue that needs attention. Gredig adds, \"If a farmer and agronomist both have the app, communication is seamless and records can be kept years down the road to manage recurring issues. It can have a big impact on the bottom line\" An app available for Apple and Android devices comes from Trimble, whose portfolio includes precision agriculture equipment and software. \"Ultimately, Trimble believes Connected Farm can help a farmer make better decisions about his farm,\" Brian Stark notes. Stark is the Marketing Communications Specialist for Trimble's Agriculture Division. Among the functions of this app is using the phone's built-in GPS to map field boundaries, flag points of interest, take geo-referenced photos, and enter scouting information for pests. There is also the ability to calculate recommended nitrogen rates when using a GreenSeeker handheld crop sensor. Stark says data can then be viewed and analyzed online, if the farmer likes. Not only can the benefits be better record keeping, but it can also increase profitability, according to Stark. \"The app can provide valuable information that farmers can use to make better decisions about their farms, which improves the bottom line.\" The bottom line with any crop scouting app, is the idea that a farmer can have better records over the long-term and have better communication with their crop team (whether that will be an agronomist, custom sprayer, etc.). It may also mean scouting happens more regularly, given the ease. Whichever way you look at it, crop scouting apps can have a big impact on your data bank and as both Gredig and Stark point out -your bottom-line.

Some of you may have been at the junior varsity conference yesterday. I just want to welcome you to the big league at Wells Fargo, certainly far more companies. More importantly, far more senior management here. You're not dealing with IR; you're getting the scoop from the upper echelon of the company. So welcome to the major league. On a serious note, some of you may have not heard the news but the chemical analyst community suffered a loss this past week. Les Ravitz, who is a fantastic analyst at Morgan Stanley for a number of years, unfortunately passed away last week and we sincerely will miss him greatly. He was certainly one of the best competitors out there, very knowledgeable and I was very sorry to hear that news. All right, let's transition to a happier topic. I'm very happy to be hosting Monsanto as actually my first company as part of this conference. As you know, this company provides the seeds and so forth, number one market share and so forth. They've done a phenomenal job on the technology side. With us here today we have Philip Miller, who is head of the government regulatory part of Monsanto. He's an 18 year veteran and he's a proud Gator. Very sad to see Joakim Noah knock out the Brooklyn Nets. Also with us is Manny Cruz; in the IR function, 15 years with the company, graduate of Wash U. And I'm absolutely delighted to be able to introduce Kerry Preete, Executive VP of Global Strategy at Monsanto. Kerry is a lifelong farmer, having grown up on a grain and livestock farm in Northeast Saskatchewan, which is great because he only had to work like three months out of the year because it's too damned cold the rest of the year. So that's actually not that bad of a gig when you think about it. He has a degree from the University of Saskatchewan and he has an MBA from Wash U and he joined Monsanto back in 1985 as a sales rep in Saskatchewan and has worked his way up to the upper parts of the company. Looking forward to Kerry's presentation and then we will have some opportunity for Q&A afterwards. Kerry, take it away. KERRY PREETE, EVP, GLOBAL STRATEGY, MONSANTO COMPANY: Good morning and thanks, Frank, for that introduction. Good to be here. Thanks for the invitation to the conference. As Frank said, my job at Monsanto over the last three years is looking at strategy and a big part of that is growth and growth for the company and where the source of the growth is going to come from. And that's exactly my focus today. Let me set this up by sharing with you how I think about the overall opportunity. First, agriculture is a good place to be, both for the near and the long term as we see it. Very practically, there are macro trends that are happening in the agriculture environment that are driving increased demand for commodities. If we look at this over the next decade, it's going to create opportunity for growth. Bottom line, companies that are positioned with strategies can increase yield can drive sustainable growth and business opportunities. Secondly, Monsanto is uniquely positioned to maximize on this opportunity. Our advantage comes from having a complete business model. It starts with an R&D discovery engine with multiple platforms almost exclusively focused on improving yields. Secondly, we have a leading position in the key global crops. And finally, we have well developed business models that allow us to deliver the innovation we create to farmers and allow us to capture and share the value with our customers. So before I go further, I'd like to highlight that this presentation will include statements concerning future events and financial results and a description of the factors that can cause variants is included in the Safe Harbor language in our most recent 10-K. So let's begin looking at this opportunity in agriculture, starting with corn. If the past informs the future, even with the most conservative assumptions, the annual increase of corn over the next decade of about 500 million bushels a year, creates an incremental cumulative value of almost $200 billion, as we look over the next decade. And if you pay close attention to the previous 10 years, we've actually seen demand growth in corn grow between 700 million and 900 million bushels a year. So the next question that's obvious is geographically, where did the production come from to meet the demand that we saw over the last decade? And the short answer is, it came globally. Of the 9.3 billion total bushels that were demanded in new production, 7.3 billion bushels of these actually came from corn markets outside the United States. And we believe that this trend of where corn production is going to come from will continue over the next five to 10 years. So this is why we're very optimistic and we talk a lot in recent times about the aspect of our global corn business, not just focused on the US exclusively. The second key point I'd highlight for you is that over the last 10 years, the increases in production, 70% of this has come from expanded corn acres and 30% from improving yields. Going forward, we think this is going to look like more the inverse of this, where most of the yield improvement is going to come from yield per acre. While we're still going to be able to add some acres internationally to corn, the big focus will be on yield. And that's why we believe improving yields per acre globally is the key answer for us. If you pair this back with the technology that we have in corn and the ability to multiply our commercial model to every corn geography that matters, we have a flywheel that's going to compound our growth over a long period of time. And if we look at soybeans, the same mega trends are alive and well in this crop as they are in corn. If you look at the fact that animal feed demand drives the corn market, both vegetable oil demand and meal or animal feed for meal drives the oil. Given the expected vegetable oil demand, along with meal demand over the next five years, and if you use a simplifying assumption that all of this demand is going to be met by soybean, given the oil and meal composition of soybean, we would require another 2.5 billion bushels of soybeans over the next five years to meet this demand. And if you put that in perspective, the US today produces about 2.8 billion to 2.9 billion bushels, so this is like adding a whole other US soybean crop to meet the demand over the next five years. Now if you keep in mind practically though that some of that vegetable oil demand is going to be met by sunflower and palm oil, we're still however going to see a huge demand increase for both soybeans as well as canola or oilseed rape in Europe. So fundamentally, what does that mean for our business? Well, we play in the two key crops of soybeans and canola and together, if you look at what our productions are practically, we would say about 1.3 billion of the bushels of the 2.5 billion bushels are going to come from oilseed rape and soybeans. If you focus on soybeans, which is going to be the biggest portion of that demand, there are some 200 million acres of soybeans grown across the Americas. And if you look at that, our biotech footprint today with our great package and soybeans cover about 90% of that 200 million acres already. And if you look forward, we're going to launch several hundred million acre opportunities in the soybean market in the upcoming years. First, we have Intacta, for South America, which I'll talk about later. Second is our Dicamba Roundup Ready 2 Xtend weed control system, which is another 100 billion acre opportunity. And then additionally following those launches, we'll have second and third generation insect control products following the Intacta launch. These technologies will be key contributors to help produce the incremental production that's going to be needed to meet the demand that's going to be out there. So given these mega trends that are existing in agriculture, it's very clear to see the compelling opportunity for companies that can contribute to improving yields. Now let me lay out why we believe that Monsanto is very well positioned to meet this opportunity. It begins as I said previously, with our technology. We have the tools to invent and bring new products to market in terms of weed and insect control, disease resistance management and agronomic solutions that both improve yields and improve efficiency and effectiveness operations for farmers. This innovation really is our biggest competitive advantage. We have the most comprehensive and integrated pipeline in the industry that allows us to create this new incremental value. Secondly, I would say that this technology leadership is excellent, what I think is an underappreciated commercial reach. And it's even more important as we talk about the fact that this demand curve is going to have to be met by producing these crops [fully]. We have the number one or number two seat position in every one of these core crops that matter, in every geography or region. And this, combined with our broad licensing approach that we've taken to our technology, really allows us to bring these technologies to market faster and more broadly than any other company. And so with these advantages, I would suggest to you that we have a long growth path in this business. This would be the most important slide that I have for you today. This is really, in my view, the Monsanto investment case. If you believe in the mega trends that are existing and driving agriculture and then you look at our business strategy, I'd suggest to you that we have growth drivers in the near term and then as we layer on new ways to improve yield, you'll see why I characterize our growth opportunity also as a long-term one. Only five years ago, if I'd have been here on this stage, I would have really focused on those bed of opportunities in the left-hand column, which really focuses on the upgrades that we're bringing in US corn, soybeans and cotton really around insect and week control. Today, that opportunity has significantly expanded as we start rolling out these technologies in more geographies. If you layer on top of that, the next generation technologies that follow this and also leveraging those globally, and then on top of that, we're going to add completely new technology platforms like our integrated farming systems or IFS and our BioDirect platform that we didn't even talk about or didn't even exist literally five years ago. So let me break each of these categories down a bit and show you practically how we are creating value through yields and how that drives growth for us going forward. Given the value of yield on a global scale, you'll see that the biggest blockbuster that we have in hand today is our higher yielding platform in corn. And with our pricing model, the incremental yield that we create, translates into sharing incremental value with the grower. And this relationship that exists, exists across countries and the product mix that we have in countries in our corn business. Growers everywhere, as we've experienced, reward innovation at the same rate. We invest about half of our R&D dollars in innovating for products that yield more. We're then able to turn around and replace our corn lineup to the tune of about 20% a year. And what we do is we replace that turnover with higher yielding genetics and these new products yield significantly more and allow us to price these new products at about 20% to 25% higher than the four to five year old products that they're replacing. To prove this, the chart on the right shows our germplasm across our branded portfolio in key corn growing regions around the world and we represent about a third of the 200 million acres on this footprint. The annual refreshment rate that we've had as a result of lifting our yields and germplasm and thereby allowing us to improve prices, has allowed us to improve prices over the last decade at about 8% CAGR over that period. This pricing effect, combined with the volume growth that's effected, has allowed our corn seed business to grow by about $2.3 billion in top line over this last 10 years. And that's really a good segue then as we start to dive into the US and look at the US corn platform, which is one of our biggest current growth drivers. Let me give you the set of numbers here that show why improving yields does drive our business growth. In the last decade, we tracked the yield data in our trials. And if you look at our US corn portfolio, we've increased the absolute yield across our total corn portfolio by about 20% in the last decade. It outpaces our competitors and the industry average. And it's really this innovation quotient that's allowed the US to be at the top of our global pricing band for corn in the last decade. To compliment the list that we get from this new improved germplasm, are the upgrades of moving to our next generation trait platform. A couple of years ago, we laid out the newest trait platform we have in corn called the reduced refuge family, which increases insect control performance inconvenience for the farmer. And now this platform is totally what we call RIB complete or refuge in a bag, which adds additional convenience for growers. Last year we catalyzed the momentum in this platform by adding about 14 million new acres to it and those acres really allow us a margin step up as well, as we capture some of the value of the insect performance as well as the convenience. So we're at the point this year, as you know, in the US season where the planting is atop everyone's mind. I can tell you we're in a good position and as I look at the drivers here outlined in corn, they're falling right in line with our planning assumptions. Just like in corn, US soybeans is one of the continuing near term drivers for us that we feel very good about. We see the same upgrade trend in soybeans as we move quickly to our Roundup Ready Yield platform. This product platform has had back to back years of extremely strong harvest results and that's showing up with customer's option of this platform right now. And as we talked earlier this year about our order book, I'd call soybeans one of our highlights in that order book and we see it setting up very well for the spring as the growers enter the planting season. Our third major crop in the US is cotton. And as I look at it strategically, cotton fulfills a very important role for us in our portfolio as a natural hedge against our soybean and corn opportunity in acres. In the previous year, you can see that cotton acres have been crowded out by corn and soybeans in the south. As soy and corn commodity prices have increased, the profitability of these crops is somewhat more attractive to farmers than cotton and has resulted in some acre shifts. But as you can see, the relative gross profit per acre of corn, cotton and soybeans are relatively similar and on a gross profit acre, we're relatively indifferent as to which way a grower goes. I think as we look forward in this market, we're going to continue to see acres shift back and forth, but if we look at it practically, one crop's decrease in acres is another crop's increase. Because those are the three crops that fundamentally the grower is going to interchange and we're fairly well hedged against these acre swings going forward. Let's move outside the United States and start talking about geographically the emerging growth markets that we have and we'll start with corn in Brazil. As I mentioned earlier and you've seen a lot written about this, the fact that Brazil is an emerging powerhouse in agriculture. And if you look at our performance in the last four years since we've got Biotechnology approved in corn down there, we've really seen tremendous growth. And I'd argue that this corn growth in Brazil is just in its infancy stage. With some 30 million acres of hybrid corn being produced and grown in Brazil, it makes Brazil corn one of the largest corn growing areas in the world. The corn yield increases that are realized by farmers from our higher yielding genetics as well as the insect and weed control trait packages that we've introduced, farmers are seeing the benefit from this and have rapidly started to adopt these new trait packages on our large footprint. And we've been able to price into that new value that we've created for growers, resulting in this driving growth for our business in this region. As this slide shows, Brazil is really at the leading edge of these upgrades that are happening. Newer products that we have coming like VT PRO MAX and VT PRO 3, are entering the adoption phase. Enhanced yield from these traits in our germplasm upgrade provide significant growth opportunity as we look forward in this corn market in Brazil. If we move to Argentina, it's another strong contributor to our international growth story. It's a market where our corn seed footprint is among the highest in our global business with brand shares in the high 50s and still growing. We are enabling this growth of volume with building additional capacity as we speak. It's a services market. And similar to Brazil, Argentina is in the middle of a biotech upgrade. It's making the upgrade to our VT PRO 3 product, which provides a 20% to 30% margin uplift on our trait packages and like the US and Brazil, we are also upgrading our germplasm on an annual basis with new hybrid introductions. I think the most exciting thing for me to note in this market is that technology that we launched in the US comes to Argentina in less than a year. So the technology lag that used to exist over the last decade is pretty much gone and we're getting trade approvals very quickly and rapidly in this marketplace. If we continue with the theme of emerging global expansion of corn, another market to look at is Eastern Europe. And this is a very prime example where technology in one crop, as this example shows with corn, has influenced the rapid market expansion over less technified, lower profitability crops for the farmer. In the graph, you can see a significant step up in corn acres, driven by an increase in average yields in corn and that ultimately turns into a benefit in income for the farmer. And that's exactly the strategy point that I began with. As the drive for yield occurs, there is a long running opportunity for us and the opportunity in Eastern Europe is drive by increasing acres, growing our brand share and capturing higher prices. A good example of this happening as we speak is in the Ukraine. Not only has the market experienced significant planted acreage expansion in corn, our footprint as increased by more than 50%, giving us significant volume growth in the last couple of years. And on top of that, our net breeding efforts in corn are fast-tracked, given that our US corn germplasm and genetics did very well in this environment in Eastern Europe. So we're building up the organization, we're adding production capacity and developing distribution channels with the eye on growing share in this region. While at the same time, keeping an eye on managing the inherent risk that exists there. So what I'd like to do now is switch from our existing technology platforms and the geographic expansion and talk about a couple of brand new technology platforms that we have coming. And I'm going to start with the technology platforms that are coming in soybeans. So with Roundup Ready 2 Yield, our Intacta product and Roundup Ready Xtend, we're on the verge of seeing the cumulative power of our next generation soybean technologies really drive our financial results in the company. On the 200 million acres of soybeans planted in the Americas, we expect successive platforms of Roundup Ready 2 Yield intact and then the Roundup Ready Xtend to come together as a multibillion dollar growth driver in the next five years. This year, we'll touch about 40 million acres with Roundup Ready 2 Yield in the United States. That means in the next five years, we expect to see significant upgrades that have a practical fit on the other 160 million acres. And so here's how I think about this rollout in layers. First is the strategic licensing deal that we just completed with DuPont. It expands the US opportunity for both Roundup Ready 2 Yield and Roundup Ready Xtend in North America and it really confirms the first phase of this multiyear runway. Then if you shift to the deployment of Intacta in South America, we expect to launch Intacta in Brazil in fiscal year 2014 and then in Argentina in fiscal year 2015. With two consecutive years of what we call our groundbreaker trials yielding more than 4 to 6 bushels over the best yielding Roundup Ready 1 varieties, and then you add on top of that the insect replacement costs and the convenience, Intacta creates approximately $80 an acre of incremental value at the grower level. So if we capture 20% to 30% of this value, it's clearly a $1 billion plus opportunity on the 100 million acres of soybeans that exist in South America. So the logical question is, how quick can we deploy this technology? I would tell you that we expect this technology and this platform to be the fastest ramp of a soybean technology platform that we've ever had. And if you look at it the other way, we will see it following similar adoption rates that we saw other trait technology platforms that we've launched in South America recently, as the example, looking at corn. I'm also then going to switch and talk about another new platform also in groundbreakers this spring, with our first generation FieldScripts, our IFS FieldScripts. Remember, if you look at really what we're about, we're about improving yields for farmers and what we're doing with IFS is just another way to tackle yield. This one focuses on how the grower grows the seed, versus what seed to grow. The idea of precision agriculture, I know many of you know is not new, but what we're doing with IFS isn't the same approach. Here's what makes it different. First, we're doing years and have done years of testing on our seed. So we know how individual seed varieties that are hybrids perform in almost every imaginable soil environment. Secondly, we take that knowledge of the seed and pair it with information about a farmer's fields, ranging from things down to soil types, altitude, moisture and other aspects that make every part of the field unique. Then we can prescribe how the seed should be planted, literally down to a square meter on every single field. In a drought year like we had last season, we knew that if we could differentiate our prescription, we'd have something truly unique and special. The end result was, we realized and the farmers realized who did this for us and tried it on their farms, a 5 to 10 bushel increase. These were some of the best and most practiced farmers in the United States that had this technology on their farm. So a 5 to 10 bushel per acre increase in corn yield is very significant from a profitability for a grower. That really sets up the opportunity, again, for us to share value that we create. So we are set up for a commercial launch of FieldScripts in our DEKALB brand as we come upon the fiscal 2014 season, so we'll be talking to growers about this later this fall after harvest. Let me begin the conclusion of my discussion with really a discussion emphasizing the growth piece with one important slide and this really gives you a comprehensive look at our R&D pipeline. Simply put, if I look at it, no other company in the industry can show this. A lot of claims are made about other company's R&D pipeline, but when it comes down to it, here's why I think ours is unmatched. First, we have the most technology platforms to drive yields, whether it's the plant breeding piece of it, the biotechnology packages we can put together, crop protection, biologicals or integrated farming systems. Second, it's not just about having a number of these technology platforms; it's knowing how and practically having experience of bringing these platforms together to maximize yield on a grower's farm. And we believe we can do this better than others. Finally, we don't rely just on Monsanto innovation. We have more collaboration and more R&D investment partners than most and that allows us to provide farmers the latest technologies faster. And I can tell you, we do not take our technology leadership for granted and we're always looking for ways to accelerate and extend our R&D lead. Let me show you one last example of how we turned the strength of our research and development pipeline into a business advantage that drives growth for our company. Over the last month, we announced back to back to back deals with DuPont, Dow and Bayer. And I think we're at a turning point in the industry and we're moving to an industry that embraces collaboration and we're seeing an unprecedented exchange of technology. With the power and proven products in our R&D pipeline, we want to be at the center of that industry evolution. We really see ourselves as a hub that brings together technology to drive the next wave of innovation, built on our platform. And I think you'll see even more of these types of deals going forward. And that's a good thing. One, it validates our role in the industry as an innovator and it really puts more industry resources around more choices and better products for farmers around the world. So as I wrap up today, I'm going to go back to where I really started in the theme of this and that is the focus on yield. Practically, as I think about how we drive growth in our company and for you as share owners, it comes from our ability to deliver improved yields and productivity on the farm and being able to do that globally. So as I think about how we deliver yield and how we turn it into growth, there are three things I'll leave you with. One, Monsanto is in a growth mode. We've capitalized on momentum with back to back years of significant earnings growth and we have a strong strategy in place that will play out through the course of this year. Secondly, our growth plan is global. We have more growth drivers coming from more geographies than we've ever had during my tenure and that's a good thing. And finally, as a yield company, we're able to deliver on the yield promise for growers with multiple technology platforms in multiple crops. So with all of these, you can see the growth horizon, hopefully, that exists for our company. So thank you Frank for the time and I'd be happy to take any questions. Questions and Answers FRANK MITSCH: Thank you so much Kerry. Kerry, that was obviously a fantastic and a very comprehensive presentation. Frankly, the only thing you didn't mention that I think is germane is that the company doesn't waste shareholders' money. It's run by a Scotsman and as those of you know the stereotype out there, Scotsmen are pretty tight with the bucks, so Monsanto does not waste any of the shareholders' money. So that's another slide that Manny you could put there. The question I get asked a lot is concern about corn pricing. Corn pricing has come off its highs. What are the implications for Monsanto if that were to continue? How do you address that? KERRY PREETE: First of all, as we talked about here, Frank, as we look over the next five to 10 years, our belief is that if you even take a real conservative look at the demand curve, the world is going to have to go hard to keep up with production. Supplies ending stocks in not only corn but soybeans and other grain crops are at historical lows. And also if you move beyond that, I think our pricing model for our technology, we don't price at the high end. We price in a band and we look at this knowing that within a year there's going to be fluctuations. We look at our pricing model today, within a $4 to $6 range and if we look at the future look at demand drivers and the ability for the world to produce, we think that corn will be within that band. FRANK MITSCH: So your product pricing is predicated on corn being a $4 to $6 range so right now obviously it's above that, so if it were to fall down into that range, you would see no change to the way that you're pricing and the revenues you're generating from farmers? KERRY PREETE: That's correct. FRANK MITSCH: Terrific. One of the things that is very exciting about the opportunity at Monsanto is as you talk about the global reach and in Latin America in particular, can you give us a sense of the margin uplift with next generation Intacta products versus what's there? If you could give us a sense there, that would be helpful. KERRY PREETE: If you look at Intacta. Let's start with current technology in Brazil, the Roundup Ready 1 technology. It's somewhere in the $3 to $5 an acre range and if you look at Intacta, we believe now with the second year of large scale farmer trials over about 1,000 farmers actually tried this in Brazil and we're just getting the harvest results back. With the yield increase of 4 to 6 bushels over Roundup Ready 1, the insecticide replacement cost, plus the convenience that this technology provides farmers, we think there's $80 of value at the farm. Our pricing model will be to look at capturing 20% to 30% of that. FRANK MITSCH: How does that $80 correlate to where we are today? KERRY PREETE: If you look at today, a grower in Brazil is making somewhere around 40 bushels times 10, 12, so $400 to $500 an acre of revenue. We'd be adding $80 of revenue on top of that. And again, our pricing model which is operated globally across our platform for the incremental value we create, we are trying to price into those 20% to 30% of that incremental value that we create on the farm. UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: For you to reach your objectives, since the Ukraine and probably Romania are major wheat producers, would this require a shift in wheat acreage to the corn acreage? KERRY PREETE: It's a very good, astute point. That's what's happening. Growers today are switching out of some cereal crops like wheat or barley into corn. As corn becomes more profitable, given the yield improvements that are happening in corn relative to wheat. UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: First of all, thanks for today. The presentation was very comprehensive. Thanks. The question I have is this; that there's other people in the ecosystem like Deere and CF Industries are also focused on this productivity solution and everybody seems to have the same ambition of getting 20%-30% of that uplift that they are helping to create. How do you sustain that and frankly from the farmers' perspective, how do you prove to them that your contribution is worth that 30%? KERRY PREETE: It's a good question. I think the farmers are very astute and with the technologies they have today, everything from yield monitors to doing literally on the farm trials, if we were sitting here with a group of farmers, they would be able to tell you how much yield is coming from what productivity input. They're very astute at that and the technology they have today allows them to do that. And every year, we have to stand in front of a farmer and talk about what we believe our genetics is doing or our trait packages. So, I think that model has been playing out and we've been able to successfully do that. FRANK MITSCH: It's Monsanto that's providing the yield advantage. Don't listen to those other companies. Thank you so much. We're out of time. Appreciate it.

All currency amounts are expressed in U.S. dollars. On September 5, 2012, Hemisphere GPS announced a corporate restructuring to focus exclusively on its agriculture business. The Company plans to change its corporate name to \"AgJunction Inc.\" at its 2013 annual shareholders meeting next week in Scottsdale, AZ, May 15 (subject to shareholder approval). Coinciding with the name change, the Company plans to change its ticker symbol from \"HEM\" to \"AJX\". On January 31, 2013 the Company announced the sale of its non-agriculture business for cash of $14.96M million. As part of the transaction the Company transferred $9.2 million of net assets to the purchaser and incurred $1.1 million in transaction-related costs resulting in gain on the sale of $4.6 million. All manufacturing activities previously conducted in Calgary have been outsourced and the Calgary office will be closed before the end of June 2013. Head office and key functions have been relocated to the Company's Hiawatha, Kansas location which has a lower cost environment and is centrally located in the U.S. corn-belt which represents the Company's largest market. The majority of the restructuring costs were accrued for in the fourth quarter of 2012. Restructuring costs incurred in the first quarter of 2013 were $0.2 million. Total cash costs associated with the restructuring were $0.8M in the first quarter. All restructuring activities are expected to be completed prior to the end of June 2013. \"Our first step in the restructuring process - to become a focused pure-play agricultural company - is complete,\" stated Hemisphere GPS CEO, Rick Heiniger. \"The second phase of our restructuring is underway; simplifying and streamlining operations and the overall business model. To that end, our new management team is hard at work scrutinizing every aspect of the business.\" First Quarter Financial Review To increase clarity of results for continuing operations of the agriculture business after divesting the non-agriculture business, and in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), the Company has reported the divested components of its business as \"discontinued operations\" in a separate line item in both the current and prior comparative periods. For the first quarter ended March 31, 2013, the Company's agricultural business reported revenues of $16.6 million, a decrease of 13% from $19 million in the first quarter of 2012. The decline in revenue is primarily the result of a two-month delay in the North American launch of the Company's new Outback STX Guidance System as wet weather conditions delayed in-field test completion in early 2013. Management estimates that this delay reduced total first quarter sales by approximately $3 million, of which a portion will be realized in the subsequent quarters of 2013. North American revenue declined by 24% from the first quarter of 2012, while non-North American sales grew by 15% due to robust OEM sales. North American sales were 73% of total sales and sales to non-North American customers represented 27%. \"We had a good quarter from the standpoint of OEM and Cloud Services sales, but offset by lower revenue in U.S. Outback sales. We officially announced the availability of the Outback STX yesterday, a replacement for the successful Outback S3. Pre-sales of the STX have been encouraging and I am confident we are meeting the needs of a growing segment of auto-steer customers,\" said Mr. Heiniger. First quarter gross margin contribution was 47% or $7.7 million, compared to 47% and $9.0 million for the first quarter of 2012. Gross margin has generally been trending upward. Operating expenses, prior to restructuring costs, decreased to $6.2 million compared to $6.5 million, prior to acquisition costs, in the first quarter of 2012, with research and development expenditures of $2.3 million unchanged year-over-year. Sales and marketing expenses of $2.3 million, declined by $0.7 million, or 28%, compared to $3 million during the first quarter of 2012, due to lower salary costs partly associated with the corporate restructuring, and more efficient spending at industry tradeshows which are intensive during the first quarter. \"During this period of slow growth in global markets, we are prioritizing the bottom line in 2013 as we maximize efficiencies and streamline operations,\" said Mr. Heiniger. General and administrative expenses were $1.5 million increasing marginally from $1.3 million in 2012. Lower G&A expenses are anticipated following upon completion of the Calgary office before the end of June, 2013. For the first quarter of 2013, the Company reported restructuring costs of $0.2 million related to the closing of the Company's Calgary office and the pending name change to AgJunction. The Company reported net income from continuing operations of $1.5 million, or $0.02 per share (basic and diluted), compared to net income of $2.3 million, or $0.03 per share (basic and diluted), in the first quarter of 2012. Net and comprehensive income, which includes $3.5 million of income from discontinued operations,, was $4.9 million, or $0.07 per share (basic and diluted), compared to income of $1.6 million or $0.02 per share (basic and diluted), in the first quarter of 2012. At March 31, 2013, the Company held cash of $13.6 million compared to $2.6 million on December 31, 2012. Working capital was $21.8 million, and the Company had 69,180,871 common shares outstanding. Restructuring and Business Strategy The Company is in the process of transitioning to market-responsive product development to drive greater innovation and higher returns from the product development process. The restructuring aims to ensure profitable and sustainable growth through a streamlined business which can more effectively capitalize on the expanding market opportunities in agriculture. \"Strategic plans are being approved this month, ready to execute during the remainder of the year. Clearly, our flagship business of guidance, steering, terminals and GNSS represent exciting opportunities ahead. OEM uptake of automatic steering appears to be set for rapid acceleration over the coming years. We believe we can leverage our superior steering experience and capability in tapping that opportunity. The emerging AgJunction Agronomy Systems business provides us with a compelling longer term of highly profitable growth that will add nicely to our flagship growth well into the next decade,\" stated Rick Heiniger.

WITH INPUT CAPITAL CORP. WB II Acquisition Corp. has entered into a letter of intent dated April 12, 2013, with Input Capital Corp. to complete a going public transaction for Input by way of a reverse takeover of WB II, a capital pool company listed on the TSX Venture Exchange. It is currently anticipated that the proposed transaction will be structured as a three-cornered amalgamation, pursuant to which the businesses of WB II and Input would combine to form an entity to be named Input Capital Corp. The resulting issuer will continue to carry out the business of Input as currently constituted. The final structure of the proposed transaction is subject to receipt of tax, corporate and securities law advice for both WB II and Input. Input is the world's first agriculture streaming company. Using its innovative, proprietary agriculture streaming process, Input makes an upfront payment to the owner/operators of grain and oilseed farms in Western Canada in exchange for the purchase of a portion of their future production at a fixed price per tonne for the life of the streaming contract. This long-term working capital enables farmers to unlock the yield potential of their crops by optimizing their inputs and precision farming practices. Input currently has a focus on canola in Western Canada. In conjunction with, or prior to the closing of, the proposed transaction, Input intends to complete a brokered private placement led by GMP Securities LP of common shares or subscription receipts for gross proceeds of up to $100-million. It is contemplated that the securities issued pursuant to the private placement will ultimately be convertible or exchangeable into freely tradeable common shares of the resulting issuer. Immediately prior to the completion of the proposed transaction, it is anticipated that WB II will consolidate its common shares. It is intended that resulting issuer shares will be issued to holders of Input common shares under the proposed transaction on the basis of one postconsolidation resulting issuer share for every one common share of Input, provided that the exchange ratio may change in order to give effect to the deemed value of 9.5 cents per common share of WB II prior to the consolidation. Additionally, and subject to regulatory approval, any outstanding options or warrants of Input will be exchanged for comparable securities of the resulting issuer having the same economic terms (as adjusted). If the proposed transaction is completed, it is anticipated that the board of directors of the resulting issuer will consist of no fewer than three and no more than seven directors, all of whom will be nominated by Input. In addition, if the proposed transaction is completed, it is anticipated that new auditors of the resulting issuer will be appointed. If completed, the proposed transaction will constitute WB II's qualifying transaction (as defined in Policy 2.4 of the TSX Venture Exchange Corporate Finance Manual). A comprehensive press release with further particulars relating to the proposed transaction will follow in accordance with the policies of the exchange. WB II's common shares are currently halted from trading, and the trading of WB II's common shares is expected to remain halted pending completion of the proposed transaction.

Proceeds from the dinner, which was South American-themed this year, go to supporting the Ugali Project and in turn, go to the Canadian Food Grains Bank, an organization that supplies third world countries with food in emergency situations. \"We have a growing project south of Ingersoll. We have land and we grow crops on the land, then sell the crops and send the money to the Canadian Food Grains Bank,\" said Steve Tait, a member of the Ugali Growing Project Committee. Tait said the money raised from the Ugali dinner's ticket sales is how the committee pays for the fertilizer and seeds to put the crops in the ground. The event's guest speaker this year, Bob Thomas, of S.H.A.R.E. Agriculture Foundation, spoke to attendees about micro credits in third world countries. \"Credit, as we know it, is very diffi- cult in most Latin American countries and a lot of other countries because they don't have collateral and they don't have access to credit,\" Thomas said. \"So if they want to expand their business they need a source of credit.\" Thomas said S.H.A.R. E currently has about five micro credit programs going in Brazil. Don Minato, who has been coming to the dinner on and off for about 10 or 15 years, said he enjoys coming out to the community event each year. \"It supports a good cause-The Canadian Food Grains Bank,\" he said. \"It's good food and good company.\""}, {"title": "Decision Support Systems; New Decision Support Systems Study Findings Recently Were Reported by B.A. Aubert and Co-Researchers", "article": "2013 MAR 28 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Agriculture Week -- Data detailed on Decision Support Systems have been presented.

This has accelerated adoption of new technologies used to seed, fertilize and spray a crop and the understanding of advanced agronomy. It has also driven companies like Farmers Edge to create a business with Variable Rate Technology as the core offering. \"Precision agriculture is the future because it provides growers the insight to manage their operations more efficiently,\" says Ryan Schoorlemmer, who recently joined Farmers Edge as a Precision Agronomist to cover the Peace River region of Alberta and British Columbia. \"Farmers know that parts of their farm produce more than others, and that certain parts of fields perform better than other areas of the same field. Variable Rate Technology allows farms to adjust their strategies to optimize efficiency and maximize yield on their farms.\" he says. There are three main components to Variable Rate Technology, which is quickly becoming mainstream in Western Canada. First of all, the variability within a field must be measured through methods such as satellite remote sensed imagery, yield maps, precision soil sampling and analysis, electro-conductivity maps, and other data sources. Secondly, a recommendation of crop input rates for each of the identified zones within the field is required. With over 3.5 million acres of experience creating these recommendations in Western Canada, this is where the strong agronomic expertise of Farmers Edge comes into play. Lastly, seamlessly applying different rates to different areas of a field requires equipment and computer program setup, another service component of Farmers Edge. The software programs, specialty cables and requirements for connecting in-cab monitors with rate controllers and seeding units can be daunting for growers with many things to worry about on their farm. Farmers Edge has a Technical Services group dedicated to getting things setup to run smoothly when needed. \"Without a partner who has the ability to provide reliable services in all three of these areas, farms won't see the level of increased efficiency Var iable Rate Technology can provide\", says Western Prairies Regional Manager and Precision Agronomist, Jay Bruggencate. \"Farmers Edge is that partner for hundreds of farms across the prairies, who continue to work with us because we help them become more efficient with the use of crop inputs on their farm. We are truly very excited to have Ryan join our team to bring this value to farms in the Peace River region where we think Variable Rate Technology and advanced agronomy will provide great value\". Ryan Schoorlemmer, who is based in Grande Prairie, grew up on the family farm near Rycroft and is a graduate of the University of Alberta with a degree in agriculture. He brings over five years of experience in agriculture to Farmers Edge."}, {"title": "Advantage is latest Trimble dealer", "article": "Advantage Farm Equipment Ltd. is pleased to announce it has become an Authorized Dealer of Trimble Precision Agriculture Solutions.

All currency amounts are expressed in U.S. dollars. Corporate restructuring and divestiture On Sept. 5, 2012, Hemisphere GPS announced a corporate restructuring, appointing a new chief executive officer with the objective to return Hemisphere GPS to profitability by focusing on three key priorities: - The core agricultural business; - Streamlining and simplifying the business; - Adopting market-driven innovation. In pursuit of these objectives, all manufacturing activities have been outsourced and the Calgary office will be closed before the end of June, 2013. Head office and key functions have been relocated to the company's Hiawatha, Kan., location, which has a lower-cost environment and is centrally located in the U.S. corn belt, which represents the company's largest market. The company exited its non-agriculture-related business, announcing on Jan. 31, 2013, the sale of the business assets associated with its non-agriculture business assets to the Canadian subsidiary of Beijing UniStrong Science & Technology Co. Ltd. for cash of $14.96-million. As part of the transaction, UniStrong and Hemisphere GPS have formed a strategic alliance and a business relationship covering supply chain management, customer support, non-competition and perpetual technology cross-licensing. The company plans to change its corporate name to \"AgJunction Inc.\" subject to shareholder approval at its 2012 annual shareholders meeting, planned for May 15, 2013. Coinciding with the name change, the company plans to change its ticker symbol from HEM to AJX shortly after the shareholders meeting, subject to shareholder approval of the name change and Toronto Stock Exchange approval. Total restructuring costs recorded in 2012 were $7.4-million, with $6.2-million reported as restructuring costs and $1.2-million included in discontinued operations. The total cash cost of the restructuring recorded in 2012 was $4.0-million (incurred and accrued) and non-cash costs recorded were $3.4-million. All restructuring activities are expected to be completed prior to the end of June, 2013. The company has sufficient capital to complete the restructuring. Subsequent to the end of 2012, in the first quarter of 2013, the company netted cash inflow of approximately $14.3-million from the divestiture of the non-agriculture assets, net of transaction costs, and repaid its outstanding loan to Export Development Canada for approximately $1.1-million. At March 18, 2013, the company held cash of approximately $13.4-million. \"The restructuring is designed around the three principles previously announced,\" stated Hemisphere GPS chief executive officer, Rick Heiniger. \"The changes are expected to produce a profitable foundation on which to build growth. The bulk of the restructuring costs were incurred in 2012 with the balance being incurred through June, 2013. It is our goal to complete the restructuring as quickly as possible to minimize cost and related distraction.\" Fourth-quarter financial review To increase clarity of results for continuing operations of the agriculture business after divesting the non-agriculture business, and in accordance with international financial reporting standards, the company has reported the divested components of its business as \"discontinued operations\" in a separate line item in both the current and prior comparative periods. For the three months ended Dec. 31, 2012, the company's agricultural business reported revenues of $10.2-million, an increase of 12 per cent from $9.1-million in the fourth quarter of 2011. Fourth-quarter gross margin contribution was 40 per cent or $4.0-million, a decrease compared with 48 per cent and $4.3-million for the fourth quarter of 2011. The lower gross margin resulted primarily from select product price discounting initiated to accelerate conversion of inventory to cash which became a priority to support restructuring cash costs, and is not indicative of the typical gross margin of its agriculture business. Operating expenses, prior to restructuring costs, were $6.2-million compared with $5.9-million in the fourth quarter of 2011. For the fourth quarter of 2012, the company reported restructuring costs of $5.7-million and an impairment in its goodwill of $21-million, resulting in a net loss from continuing operations of $29.2-million or 45 cents per share (basic and diluted), compared with a loss from continuing operations of $1.6-million or three cents per share in 2011. After the loss from discontinued operations of $3.6-million in the fourth quarter of 2012 versus $1.0-million in 2011, the company realized a net and comprehensive loss of $32.9-million or 51 cents per share (basic and diluted) in 2012 compared with a loss of $2.5-million or four cents per share (basic and diluted) in 2011. 2012 year-end financial review For the year ended Dec. 31, 2012, revenues were $55.4-million representing an increase of 5 per cent from $52.8-million in 2011. Sales to non-North American customers represented 29 per cent of total revenues during 2012 (2011: 33 per cent), while North American sales were 71 per cent of total revenues in 2012 (2011: 67 per cent). \"Management acknowledges that given the strength of the marketplace, our Agriculture business has underperformed for some time,\" said Mr. Heiniger. \"The new senior management is now in place and will be making improvements through 2013 and beyond. Our business strategy is being assessed and redirected as necessary to deliver shareholder value which we believe is long overdue.\" Gross margins were $24.5-million in the year, down by $900,000 from gross margins of $25.4-million in 2011. Gross margins, as a percentage of revenue, were 44 per cent in 2012 compared with 48 per cent in 2011. Operating expenses before acquisition and restructuring costs were $25.7-million in 2012, up by 14 per cent or $3.2-million from $22.5-million in 2011, reflecting the acquisition of AgJunction on Jan. 31, 2012. The company's investment in research and development for 2012 was $9.7-million compared with $8.2-million in 2011 representing an increase of $1.5-million or 18 per cent. The increase was related to three major product and service introductions during 2012 including the new OutbackMAX, upgrades to eDriveX, and the launch of cloud services for agriculture -- including related R&D staffing, overhead and amortization arising from the AgJunction acquisition. Sales and marketing expenses were $10.5-million in 2012 versus $9.7-million in 2011, an 8-per-cent increase reflecting the AgJunction acquisition. The company reported restructuring costs of $6.2-million in the year, comprising severance costs, lease termination costs, advisory fees and inventory writedowns. The company recognized an impairment in its goodwill of $21.0-million at Dec. 31, 2012. For 2012, the company realized a loss from continuing operations of $29.0-million or 44 cents per share (basic and diluted), compared with net income from continuing operations of $1.8-million or three cents per share (basic and diluted) in 2011. The company recorded a loss from discontinued operations of $5.6-million for the year ended Dec. 31, 2012, and a loss of $3.3-million in the 2011 comparative period. These amounts represent the results of operations of the non-agriculture business assets that were sold on Jan. 31, 2013, and the Calgary location. Including the loss from discontinued operations, the company realized a net and comprehensive loss of $34.6-million or 52 cents per share (basic and diluted) in 2012 compared with a loss of $1.5-million or two cents per share (basic and diluted) in 2011.

The purchase agreement includes the potential for a similar earnout for 2013. Restructuring and business strategy The divestiture of the non-agriculture business was as part of the company's initiative to ensure profitable and sustainable growth. The divestiture eliminates redundancies, reduces costs and achieves operating efficiencies. The result is a streamlined business which can more effectively capitalize on the expanding market opportunities in agriculture. The relocation of company headquarters to Hiawatha, Kan., has placed key functions in the heartland of the North American agricultural industry. An abundant supply of agriculture trained and passionate talent, along with the pro-business climate in the state of Kansas, were two key factors for the site selection. On Feb. 28, 2013, the company announced the composition of its new leadership team centralized primarily in the Hiawatha office. The company is in the process of transitioning to market-responsive product development to drive greater innovation in, and higher returns from, the product development process. Mr. Heiniger explained: \"Our past investment in guidance and auto-steering technologies will provide returns to the company for years to come as they become ever more universal. AgJunction, postrestructuring, represents a pure investment in Precision Agriculture. It's our plan to further innovate into the service backbone of the industry. Timing is important -- and we believe the time is now. With a clean, strong balance sheet and new management physically positioned at the heart of our Ag-focused business, we couldn't be more excited about the future.\" Conference call A conference call and webcast for shareholders, analysts and other members of the investment community has been scheduled for today, Wednesday, March 20, 2013, at 11 a.m. Eastern Time, to discuss the financial results and provide an update on operations.

Peter Frixel introduced Dallas and Alison Bjornson who are collecting information on names for local creeks, streams and water bodies. They will go to you and do an interview and when they have collected enough information plan to put it into a book. Frixel also asked if anyone had a local spot they would like to preserve, to let him know. One person said the whole Notikewin Valley, two other locations mentioned were Lucy's Hill and Sand Lake. Frixel said the intent is to list a number of local treasures and see what can be done to preserve them. Some other things the group is doing is trying to measure the effect of farming, the oil and gas industry and logging on the area, partly by using historic aerial photos. He showed a few photos which illustrated the loss of vegetation in riparian areas as well as a growing number of cutblocks. Judith Weiler spoke about some of the strategic initiatives the organization is looking at and some of the concerns they are investigating to try and measure how those might affect the watershed. Among them: things being put into the landfill which should be recyled, increasing use of fertilizer, growing cattle herd in Canada, loss of forested land to logging and mountain pine beetles which can cause erosion and affect water quality, sand and gravel extraction, Oil and gas industry activities (such as fracking, pipelines, storage tanks, remediation and reclamation not keeping up with exploration and drilling). Not all was negative as she pointed out manure management practices have improved as have rotational grazing practices and offsite watering systems. Also the number of shelter belts is increasing, producers are avoiding riparian areas more and conserving wetlands, there has been an increase in zero till practices and precision farming both of which assist in soil and moisture conservation and lead to reduced input losses. She also spoke about sewage treatment and suggested it should be treated more as a resource, perhaps used for field irrigation with the sludge used as fertilizer (with proper monitoring and precautions) or perhaps disposed of in the landfill. Laura Gloush of the Peace River Museum was the second guest speaker and gave an overview of the history of the river as a means of transportation. She used historic photos, including first-nations who travelled the river by birch-bark canoes. She added even hundreds of years ago, oil seeps were known by the local inhabitants and tar from them used to seal the seams on canoes to make them waterproof. When European settlers began to arrive in the area, they first used canoes and then York boats for transportation as well as scows which had to be pulled through the rapids and other hard patches using human muscle power -people walking along the banks and pulling on ropes attached to the boat. Later, steam powered boats were brought in -and there was a busy boat-yard in Peace river building stern wheeler paddle boats. The boats carried passengers and cargo including animals such as cattle, sheep and horses up and down the river. There was even a boat built in Hines Creek which was transported to the Peace River for use there. During the second world war, the first steel-hulled boat -the Alcan -was used to transport crews and materials upstream to build the Mackenzie Bridge. Although it was powered by a diesel engine it still used a stern paddlewheel to move the boat. The size of boats on the river had decreased as the larger boats became uneconomical to operate and more compact craft were used which could move barges to carry cargo. At the end of her presentation, Gloush mentioned there is a historical review of fish on the Peace River and its tributaries being done. If you have any photos, stories or information about fish caught on the river they are interested and have a form for you to fill out with any information you may have. Some of the information they want is what kind of fish it was, where it was caught, what time of year, whether it was unusual to catch that kind/size of fish where it was caught."}, {"title": "AFN Ag Growth names Giesselman, Moore as directors", "article": "Ag Growth International Inc (TSX:AFN) Shares Issued 12,548,103 Last Close 3/11/2013 $35.23 Tuesday March 12 2013 - News Release Mr. Bill Lambert reports AG GROWTH INTERNATIONAL INC.

South Country Equipment Ltd. southcountry.ca Location Regina Size 215 full-time employees Sector Retail Market South-central Saskatchewan It's a brand new day for agriculture and South Country Equipment Ltd. - a John Deere farm-and-turf equipment retailer with eight locations - is carving out a new role for itself as a solutions provider to today's farmer. South Country Equipment was incorporated in 2003. At that time, it had three locations. \"Over the past 10 years, the farming equipment industry has been keeping pace with the consolidation of a number of farms and that's what we've been doing as well,\" says Cameron Bode, South Country's general manager. \"John Deere is one of the world's most trusted and recognized brands and many dealers are second-, third-, fourth-generation. As we have grown, we have respected that history and culture and have been very purposeful in maintaining and strengthening the relationship with our people, customers and with the community. The key to our success is our 215 highly engaged, trained and empowered people implementing our vision every day. We empower our staff to make decisions and assist our customers. We want local managers to have the flexibility to innovate and adapt.\" The company is just as attentive to its customers and that client focus is shifting the culture to become more solution-focused. This move is in line with one of the biggest developments in agriculture today: precision farming. \"We are trying to develop and provide our farmer customers with solutions to help them get the most from their investment in equipment and technology,\" Mr. Bodes says. \"We do that by helping them manage all the data created by the sensors and monitors on the equipment and import it to the farm management program they are using.\" The other big change is the use of telematics, or remote support. \"A customer can call in with a support issue for a sprayer and our technicians are able to log into the machine from the dealership and diagnose the problem before they go to the location,\" Mr. Bodes says. * For a full list of the 2012 Best Managed Companies winners, please see the box on the upper right side of this page"}, {"title": "What's the next step in precision agriculture?", "article": "Precision agriculture means different things to different people. In Ontario, we have seen adoption of precision technologies, including combine yield monitors, light bars and other sophisticated ways of driving straight, and application mapping. Yield Monitor, GIS, Variable Rate & Other Technologies After a slow start with yield monitors, most of these have been readily adopted. Straight driving technologies have been adopted very quickly. Now we are seeing wider adoption of GIS-enabled auto shut-off systems for ensuring pesticides, seed and other inputs are not overlapped as field equipment crosses paths with previous passes. Less common has been the acceptance of variable rate input technology. There is considerable disagreement on whether the systems are able to adequately identify management zone changes that would justify the change in input levels across a field. However, it is being practiced successfully by some. One important thing that comes from yield monitor technology is the ability to \"visualize\" the fields. , Review of data trends over time allows development of good management zones. This is not just numbers, but a visual picture of what is happening in a field. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles The next step in precision technology may be the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV's) for monitoring ongoing crop production. These can enable us to \"see\" our crops visually, but also in terms of stresses that the human eye cannot see. Near infrared reflectance (NIR) cameras can measure response to stresses. Although imagery is available from aircraft and satellite systems, there are some distinct disadvantages associated with their use, such as cost, timeliness, accuracy, resolution, and flight path. A farmer or agronomist can program a UAV to fly a directed path whenever they want. This allows a crop to be monitored to look for things that might be of interest in the growth of the crop. Advantages of UAV's over plane and satellite include flexibility, lower capital cost, ready learning, and no need to put people in harm's way. These vehicles are capable of high resolution photography, video capture and NIR photography. Then there is a wide range of software choices available to \"build\" maps from the images and video captured. They can operate at various heights from 100 to 2,000 ft, cruise at speeds up to 60 km/hr for 30 to 60 minutes, and operate in winds up to 30 km/hr. They have resolutions of as low as 3.6 cm, but 20 cm is typical. (Figure 1) They can take pictures of from 1 to 60 acres. What is exciting about this technology is that it gives you a view of your crops that is not attainable in any other way, and at various times during the growing season. Ask any \"flying farmer\" how much they see in their crops from the air that is not visible, even in thorough ground scouting. Possible uses of the technology include: * scouting for disease, insect, and weeds, * identifying problems fast, * replant decisions * visual recorded proof of issues * record keeping that specified operations were completed, * scouting deer, racoon and other critter damage, * looking for \"alternate crops\" planted in your crops * delineating management zones, and * identifying field regions susceptible to soil erosion."}, {"title": "WEALTHMAKERS.COM Issues Bullish Research Reports on STKL, TCX, TD, TITN, TNK, TZYM", "article": "Click here to download each report: Click here to LIKE us on Facebook : Click here to FOLLOW us on Twitter : Click here to access WealthMakers technology: Users access these powerful research reports though the PowerTrader Matrix.

Only about 25% of stocks display patterns at any given time and only about 1% of stocks exhibit all the necessary conditions on any given day to make a trade. That means that out of 14,000 stocks, only about 140 trades are high probability trades that our system would generate a research report on and disseminate the information to clients. This process eliminates the noise and only tells you which stocks have multiple strategies lining up at the same time, in the same direction, with no conflicting predictions and the fundamental valuation is in-line with the prediction! Strategies include: EARNINGS - Most stock price histories show random or unpredictable movements around earnings reports. But some repeat the same pattern quarter after quarter, year after year. Earnings predict probability, price move and length of move before and after all US stock earnings reports. FRICTION FACTOR - Friction Factor is based on the relationship between the price of a stock and the volume at which it's bought and sold. Normal and abnormal Friction factor patterns can help you time your buying and selling decisions for maximum earnings potential.

Tranzyme Inc (NASDAQ:TZYM) - About WEALTHMAKERS Wealthmakers Online Predictive Research (WOPR) is a distributed computing system that has hundreds of data feeds (economic, weather, geopolitical, interest rates, energy, equities, currencies, commodities, etc.) feeding into a relational database that searches for patterns and determines how a trading instrument has behaved both before and after specific events have taken place in the past. Only about 25% of stocks display patterns at any given time and only about 1% of stocks exhibit all the necessary conditions on any given day to make a trade. That means that out of 14,000 stocks, only about 140 trades are high probability trades that our system would generate a research report on and disseminate the information to clients. This process eliminates the noise and only tells you which stocks have multiple strategies lining up at the same time, in the same direction, with no conflicting predictions and the fundamental valuation is in-line with the prediction! Strategies include: EARNINGS - Most stock price histories show random or unpredictable movements around earnings reports. But some repeat the same pattern quarter after quarter, year after year. Earnings predict probability, price move and length of move before and after all US stock earnings reports. FRICTION FACTOR - Friction Factor is based on the relationship between the price of a stock and the volume at which it's bought and sold. Normal and abnormal Friction factor patterns can help you time your buying and selling decisions for maximum earnings potential. GATS - The Global Automated Trading System (GATS) combines neural networks and genetic algorithms to reduce investment risks. GATS selects the highest probability trades in stocks, bonds, options, commodities, currencies and private equities, delivering precise, predictive and profitable data. GROUP SECTOR - Certain institutions can exert buying or selling pressure over an entire industry group, pushing prices higher. Group Sector identifies stocks that most closely match their group's movement and generate powerful group consensus trading signals to help you profit from the herd mentality. PATTERN SCANNER - describes the current technical situation in your stock. It displays the technicals, trend conditions and seasonal factors and automatically discovers how that stock has performed in the trading days following the occurrences of the event or combination of events. This technology automatically scans using complex historical queries based on what event is taking place right now in the stock. It then displays the probability, expected return and number of trading days for the expected move. EVENTS - This technology automatically tracks \"Trigger Events\" that positively or negatively affect the value of a stock or its perceived value among analysts ranging from price fluctuations to natural disasters and political shifts. The results reveal patterns that can predict market movements. RegSHO NAKED SHORTS - SEC Regulation SHO mandates that if a clearing agent holds a fail-to-deliver position for 13 consecutive settlement days, it must purchase securities to close out its position, a.k.a. a forced cover. WealthMakers aggregates data from NYSE, AMEX, NASDAQ, OTCBB and PINKSHEETS to track stocks that are about to have forced covers. SEASONALITY - Seasonality analyzes more than 20 years of data to determine if stocks have a long or short seasonal bias, how many trading days the move is expected to last, the probability of that move and the percentage move the stock is expected to make based on the seasonal bias. SQUEEZETRIGGER - Our proprietary database of more than 3,500,000,000 short sale transactions allows us to calculate the exact price at which the total short interest is short in each stock. Squeeze Trigger Alerts let you know exactly when a short squeeze will start and how to trade profitably. VALUATION - A stock's value is a function of its forecasted earnings per share and forecasted earnings growth, as well as profitability, interest and inflation rates. Valuation use these metrics to determine at what price a stock is undervalued or overvalued, so that you can make investment decisions accordingly. INSIDER - Significant stock sales or purchases by company \"insiders\" (officers or directors) can be a predictor of future price movements, up or down. The Insider strategy tracks these actions and correlates them with historical data to give you an investment edge.

We seek Safe Harbor."}, {"title": "Navigating the route to growth", "article": "Whether it's finding a good deal at a store, navigating through a busy airport or through the woods, when there is no Wi-Fi or GPS reception, Chris Goodall and his team have a reliable solution. Trusted Positioning, launched in 2009 from the work done for his PhD at the University of Calgary, along with professor Naser El-Sheimy and fellow PhD graduate Zainab Syed, is similar to GPS and Bluetooth systems, but superior in that it uses micro-electro mechanical systems (MEMS) sensor technology. As Mr. Goodall sets his sights on a mobile platform to integrate with any mobile phone, the company's board has attracted former chief financial officer and chief executive of NovAtel and other high-profile veterans of the sector. Trusted Positioning is in talks with two major mobile phone manufacturers and is charting a new course. Mr. Goodall told Derek Sankey how this technology will revolutionize mobile navigation and location positioning as the company shifts gears. The following is an edited transcript of their conversation. Q How did you translate the success of your sensor navigation and location-positioning technology into a viable business? A We liked what we were doing and wanted to keep it going and get it to the next level to make some money from it. The University of Calgary made millions of dollars licensing our technology, much of which went back into scholarships, but we wanted to do a better job than just licensing software on a website. When we started out, we didn't have a product, but we started selling the actual product in 2011 for machine control, like precision agriculture or any sort of industry where you need land-based machine control and navigation. Q How did the company evolve in the past two years? A In 2012, we really became focused on the mobile phone market and we'll have our official product launches in mid2013 when it will begin to be integrated into phones and you can just buy it over the counter. At the end of the day, our technology is a core technology that can go into a whole bunch of market verticals. We just enable the core technology and our customers can customize it. The same technology used to find a soldier indoors - we were awarded a contract with the Government of Canada for solider-positioning technology - is the same technology we use to find a customer in a store. Our core is not purely to sell to mobiles, it's to do a good job with mobiles and branch out from there with a core software that can work across any platform. Q What changes has that growth meant for your corporate team? A In terms of a corporate reorganization, we promoted people from within. It was just more growth. I wasn't the CEO before - Naser [El-Sheimy] was. It's a brand new technology. Everybody else is focused on Wi-Fi and Bluetooth and GPS for positioning; people haven't really been thinking about sensors. We looked at hiring external CEOs and when the board recommended me, it was a shock. Basically nobody else knows the business like I do or like the other founders do, so it really just made sense. Q What has fuelled the growth of Trusted Positioning? A Sensors have been around before GPS. It's dead reckoning, or navigating to a new location based on your estimated previous location. We use accelerometers, gyroscopes and magnetometers and pressure sensors to do the same thing. When all of your lights go out or you don't have GPS or a surveyed Wi-Fi reception, your location just turns off. We use dead-reckoning technology to track your movements indoors. It's all location-based services. There are all kinds of applications - advertising, e-911, augmented reality indoors, storefront location, fitness and recreation or anywhere that GPS and any other wireless technology does not work. We're bridging all of those gaps with sensors. Now we're partnering with the OEMs (original equipment manufacturers). We are not downplaying our existing customer base, but we're branching out into mobile by integrating with one or two OEMs in 2013. Q Why did you intentionally keep the focus so broad for this technology? A We are definitely going through a shift toward mobile. The difference with our company is we're a core platform company, not a product company like 99% of companies. In a year or two it might be something else - vehicles, UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) or something else. Right now we're developing the core platform that sits between the mobile phone processor and sensors that output a location. The core vision and focus is not to be too focused. We decided internally to keep the focus on making something really well-standardized for a wide variety of application. It's a seamless solution."}, {"title": "NovAtel GNSS Receivers Provide BeiDou Support", "article": "Release date - 16012013 Calgary, Alberta, Canada - NovAtel is pleased to announce support for the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System on its OEM6 family and select OEMStar GNSS receivers.

The sound is lost in the hubbub around him, generated by an intricate network of conveyor belts and slurry troughs that cover a good hectare of ground to a height of several stories. The view is occasionally punctuated by puffs of steam emerging from key stations; there Schech parts some plastic curtains for a peek into one of the heavy metal channels where phosphate rock and sulphuric acid are getting to know one another. \"This is not a cookie factory,\" he comments, referring to the heady mixture of odours that complements the surrounding cacophony. Like any good kitchen though, the smell can change substantially from one day to the next. Sometimes it has a sharp acidic edge to it; later on it might be sweet and mellow. The effect is not entirely unpleasant, but a good whiff serves as a reminder that some dramatic chemical reactions are taking place on an industrial scale. In fact, chemical engineering seldom gets much bigger than this, and Schech--an engineer affectionately known to younger staff members as the mad scientist --is as comfortable wandering through it as he must be in those workboots. \"You're doing a job you enjoy doing,\" he says, accounting for the energy he displays. \"It's also related to having a knowledge of the process.\" That knowledge extends to an awareness of the ultimate purpose of the process. This factory's hustle and bustle announces nothing less momentous than the humble origins of the global food chain. A primary end product is fertilizer, the lowly commodity that has enabled us to tease ever greater crop yields out of soils all over the world, keeping Malthusan pessimists at bay even as we manage to keep seven billion people reasonably well fed. Schech is the senior process engineer at the largest operation maintained by fertilizer giant Agrium Inc., a site covering about 370 hectares along the North Saskatchewan River near the small town of Redwater, about a half hour drive northeast of Edmonton. On any given day, 600 to 700 people occupy the plant, which has a variety of similarly large corporate neighbours in an Alberta industrial epicentre known as the Heartland. Agrium's Redwater site turns out more agricultural nutrients and more types of fertilizer than almost any place in North America. As many as 12,000 rail cars and 24,000 trucks pass through its gates every year, carrying upward of 700,000 tonnes of ammonium phosphates and 1.4 million tonnes of nitrogen-based material. The company sells some of this output directly through its retail operations located in western Canada and across the United States, as well as a large array of retailers used by farmers across the continent. The firm's reach extends further to include retail sites in Australia and Argentina, and wholesale activities throughout Europe. With a market capitalization in excess of $15 billion, Agrium touts itself as the only publicly traded company that crosses the entire agricultural value-chain. For a facility such as Redwater, which contributed more than $1 billion in sales for Agrium in 2011, the ingredient list is fairly simple: natural gas, air, water, sulphur, and phosphate rock. The product list is only slightly longer, including agents like urea, anhydrous ammonia, nitric acid, ammonium nitrate, sulphuric acid, ammonium sulphate, monoammonium phosphate, and phosphoric acid. The huge scale of the enterprise demands constant attention to keep it safe and efficient, which are Schech's top priorities. He has maintained those priorities throughout a career with the company that began in the late 1970s, starting with Sherritt Fertilizers before it became part of Agrium in 1995. He wears the mad scientist moniker with something akin to pride, since the extent of his experience now makes him a valuable asset for the next generation of engineers who look after day-to-day activities. \"Over the years we've come up with some pretty innovative ways of doing things,\" he says. \"There's going to be situations where we can save somebody new quite a bit of time in not having to re-invent the wheel as far as certain things go.\" For example, as phosphates make their way around the system, flow rates are tracked from the electrical current drawn by equipment at particular stages. The figures, displayed on computer screens monitored by several of Schech's colleagues in a tidy command centre, provide an accurate reading of physical movement within the factory line that might otherwise be all but impossible to measure. Nor do Schech's responsibilities stop at the plant gates. \"We can provide things other than fertilizers,\" he says, noting that increasing attention to the retail leads him to consult directly with customers large and small. \"We have a lot more responsibility, including a lot more environmental accountability. It's gotten a lot more sophisticated from that perspective.\" According to Richard Downey, Agrium's Vice-President of Investor and Corporate Relations, this new level of sophistication reflects the sometimes subtle changes that have been shaping agriculture in recent decades. In some ways, little has changed since the Nobel-winning discovery of the Haber-Bosch process 100 years ago, which made it possible to capture nitrogen from air and add it to phosphorus and potassium to form a triple crown of plant nutrients capable of growing more food than the world has ever known. \"There are incremental changes to technology, but the fundamentals of producing these three nutrients has not changed, and is not likely to change,\" he explains. \"There's no structural change in the business that's going to alter production processes or end demand.\" In fact, fertilizer began around the 1960s as a simple processing sideline for Cominco Mining, which was busy making most of its money from the extraction of major metals like zinc and lead. By the 1990s, however, agricultural commodities enjoyed a dramatic surge that eclipsed the company's traditional line of business and led to the founding of Agrium as a separate company. \"Agriculture and food have been that much more important, especially over the last five years, as grain prices and grain demand has really shone,\" says Downey. He adds that those solutions increasingly deal with the specific ways in which nutrients are added to soil, reflecting the fact that it is in no one's best interest to apply too much fertilizer to a field or crop. Excess nitrogen or nitrates can affect water tables, particularly in some agriculturally intensive regions such as central California. Excess phosphate often poses another risk, such as when incorrectly applied manure makes its way into the soil run off, feeding algal blooms on lakes and rivers. While nutrients remain vital to growing a healthy crop, growers have a vested interest in realizing an economic as well as environmental return on their investment in these inputs, which can easily cost them hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. Perhaps not surprisingly, while the use of fertilizer in Canada and the United States climbed steadily in the economic and demographic boom that followed the Second World War, this trend had levelled off by the 1970s. Depending on the specific agricultural circumstances--which admittedly vary widely across the continent--high crop yields were being maintained or even enhanced with the same volume of fertilizer, or in some cases even less. Much of this is due to improvements in the quality of seed varieties and the management of crop inputs. Such insights continue to drive the research end of the seemingly low-tech world of fertilizer. Product formulations offer widely varying proportions of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, suited to widely varying needs of different customers. Agrium spawned its Advanced Technologies business unit in 2007, dedicated to innovations such as coatings to allow fertilizer to promote better plant growth by reacting in the soil at a slower, more controlled rate. Interest in such matters dates back to the 1930s, when the America Potash Institute was founded to explore the burgeoning field of fertilizer science. By 2007 this not-for-profit organization was reinvented as the International Plant Nutrition Institute (IPNI), supported by member companies like Agrium to showcase the science on the best ways of managing nutrients in the soil. This broad mandate revolves around a set of principles known as the 4 Rs--right source, right rate, right time, right place. \"Those four words can describe any nutrient application, whether you're applying a small amount to your home garden, a very large agricultural field in Saskatchewan, a soybean field in the corn belt, or a rice field in Bangladesh or India,\" says Tom Bruulsema, who directs the Northeastern Region of IPNI's North America Program from Guelph. \"Today, both growers and retailers realize that they work in a context of neighbours and stakeholders--people who eat the food we produce, who breathe the air we impact, who drink the water we impact. When we're talking about performance of the cropping system, we want productivity and we need it to be profitable, but we also recognize the need to be keeping environmental impacts within an acceptable range.\" This outlook has led to the even more ambitious use of satellite imaging, aerial photography, and other sensing methodologies in a practice that has been dubbed precision agriculture. As these technologies have advanced, it has become practical for farmers to commission ongoing analyses of their fields, revealing how soil fertility varies from one spot to another, in grids just a few metres across. Fertilizer can subsequently be applied to each spot in amounts and formulations designed for the very best outcome, minimizing costs while maximizing return. \"Precision agriculture is just another means of ending up with source-rate-time-place combinations that suit each part of the field,\" observes Bruulsema. \"Each specific technology can have a place, depending on the farm operation.\" Bringing satellite data to the service of farmers is undoubtedly a leap forward, but to Agrium's Richard Downey, it is yet another example of the incremental nature of progress in this sector. Matching its products to accommodate the use of precision agriculture is just the latest innovation to come the company's way. \"You have an increasing demand for crop inputs in general, based on the demand for grain production,\" he says. \"I don't see that changing. There's a lot of different things that are going on at the farm level, and we help bring that to the farmer. We are the largest ag retailer globally, so we try to bring the best solutions to growers.\" PRECISELY NOURISHED For the significant portion of us who have never set foot on a farm, the business of fertilizing a field might seem straightforward. And to be fair, once upon a time--say 150 years ago--there was little more to it than spreading manure on fields and hoping the nutrients in there could sustain a healthy crop. By the middle of the 20th century, however, the process had become much more sophisticated. Our technological ability to manufacture the three main crop nutrients--nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium --combined with insights into how those nutrients are used by different plant species, transformed fertilization into an entirely different discipline. Synthetic fertilizers can now be formulated with wide-ranging amounts of these nutrients in order to accommodate specific soil or weather conditions. For example, excess phosphorus can build up in soil and remain accessible to future crops, eliminating the need to add more each year, especially when this surplus could wash away and pollute nearby waterways. By testing the soil chemistry first, fertilizer can be applied in specific amounts only where they are needed in the field. Of course, this kind of detailed analysis, conducted over the area of a large farm, can become labour-intensive, expensive, and ultimately impractical. Advanced technology has ushered in a more efficient approach, which extracts equally valuable information from sources like satellite imagery. By applying algorithms that correlate the colour of each year's crop to the levels of nutrients received by those crops, the quality of soil can be mapped overtime, with unprecedented precision. Farmers can subsequently tailor the mixture of those nutrients as they are fertilizing--less phosphorus here, perhaps, more potassium there--to ensure the best result in every corner of the farm. This prospect is one of several opening up an innovative frontier known as 'precision agriculture' which is helping farmers get the best possible yields from their land, and the best possible return on their investment in fertilizer. ---------- Please note: Illustration(s) are not available due to copyright restrictions."}, {"title": "events calendar", "article": "ASABE CONFERENCES AND INTERNATIONAL MEETINGS To receive more information about ASABE conferences and meetings, call ASABE at (800) 371-2723 or e-mail mtgs@asabe.org. 2013 Jan. 28-30 2013 Agricultural Equipment Technology Conference.

Dec 2012"}, {"title": "Finding serial innovators", "article": "It's not easy to develop a breakthrough innovation in an established company and bring it to market successfully - and even more challenging to do so more than once. In their new book Serial Innovators: How Individuals Create and Deliver Breakthrough Innovations in Mature Firms, Ab-bie Griffin, Raymond L. Price and Bruce A. Vojak describe several years of research they have conducted about a type of employee who can do just that. Serial innovators, whom the authors define as people who develop and bring to market at least two successful breakthrough products in an established company, are not all that common. Serial innovators represent anywhere from one in 50 members of an R&D and engineering staff at a smaller organization to one in 200 at a larger organization - and perhaps as few as one in 500 at most Fortune 200 companies. They possess an unusual combination of skills - a track record of technical excellence; a strong focus on solving important problems for customers; a willingness and ability to \"cross the bridge\" from merely inventing a good solution to taking on the organizational politics required to convince others in the company of the value of their innovation. Serial innovators also invest a lot of time in the very front end of innovation, identifying an important problem and understanding it from multiple perspectives. This can be a problem in impatient, results-driven business cultures, because while serial innovators are in this phase, the authors note it may be \"many months ... before they have a concept that is developed sufficiently to enter the firm's formal NPD [new product development] process. During that time, they can appear highly unproductive, as little physical output may be generated.\" More generally, serial innovators can be at odds with the conventional processes in their organizations. The innovations themselves compete with the company's existing products for resources, and, instead of working with management-assigned teams, serial innovators often prefer to enlist simpatico colleagues as volunteers. Serial innovators also like doing their own market research; in particular, they want to spend time with customers and ask a lot of \"why\" questions to understand customers' needs. Griffin, Price and Vojak acknowledge that life in established organizations is not always easy for serial innovators - or for the people who manage them. The book contains some fascinating anecdotes about serial innovators. Chuck House, who developed a number of new products for Hewlett-Packard, was awarded a \"Medal of Defiance\" by Hewlett-Packard's then-president, the authors write, \"as a reminder to all the firm that breaking the rules can be associated with great reward.\" They also tell the story of Adam Gudat at Caterpillar, who started creating GPS navigation systems for farm equipment. Combining that with technologies such as satellite mapping and sensors has yielded \"precision farming\" techniques that let farmers adapt to conditions field by field. Ironically, the authors say some of the serial innovators they interviewed thought that if they were just starting out today, their companies would not hire them.

A live webcast of the call will also be available at the company's website and archived for later review. New agriculture corporate strategy On Sept. 5, 2012, the board of directors of Hemisphere GPS initiated a restructuring mandate with the directive to implement a new profit-focused corporate strategy under the leadership of incoming chief executive officer Rick Heiniger, formerly vice-chairman of the company and founder of the Outback Guidance precision agriculture business. \"The agricultural industry is entering a period of exceptional opportunity. We're in the early stages of transformational adoption of high-definition production practices. We are a data-driven society, and agriculture is no different. Agronomic specialized data-management and cloud information services, combined with a new generation of connected devices and machines, will not only enable emerging technologies, but will simplify existing workflows and deliver productivity gains for the industry,\" stated Hemisphere GPS's new chief executive officer, Rick Heiniger. \"We believe Hemisphere GPS is perfectly positioned. To that end we have launched a new corporate strategy building on our world-class positioning, guidance and steering solutions to provide seamless integration with cloud computing and information services. This integration will break the barriers which have long challenged the mainstream adoption of precision agriculture. We will be wholly focused on the essential core technologies while at the same time assisting the industry in its adoption.\" Under Mr. Heiniger's leadership, the company has implemented a new corporate strategy built on three core principles to achieve profitable growth and market leadership: - Focus exclusively on the agriculture business; - Streamline and simplify operations; - Implement market-driven innovation. Focus on precision agriculture For over a decade, Hemisphere GPS has been a leading solutions provider to the precision agriculture market. In the first nine months of 2012, 81 per cent of company revenue was derived from the agriculture business, most of which comes from the North American market. Past diversification into marine, construction and other industries increased costs, absorbed cash and distracted management focus from its core agriculture business. To focus exclusively on agriculture, the company will: - Exit the non-agriculture-related business. An investment banking firm has been engaged to pursue strategic alternatives for the precision products business. Given the agricultural focus of the company, the board believes that the precision products business can grow more quickly with another organization that is more strategically aligned. - Relocate company headquarters to Hiawatha, Kan., where Hemisphere GPS's agricultural operations are already strategically located, in the heartland of the North American agricultural industry. An abundant supply of agriculture-trained and passionate talent, along with the pro-business climate in the state of Kansas, are two key factors for the site selection. Streamline and simplify operations As part of the company's initiative to ensure profitable and sustainable growth: - All production activities currently conducted in Calgary will be transitioned to Hemisphere GPS's primary outsourced manufacturing partner. - The Calgary office, which currently supports manufacturing, the precision products business and the corporate administration functions, will be closed following the relocation of key functions to Kansas, thereby reducing overhead. - The two-business-unit and supporting structure will be reduced to a single business, thereby eliminating redundancies, reducing costs and achieving operating efficiencies. - The company will rationalize products, engineering projects and geographic markets. - These initiatives will simplify the overall business and are expected to reduce manufacturing costs, improve gross margins and reduce operating overhead. Market-driven innovation The company will adopt a market-responsive-product-development focus with a customer-driven culture. As such: - The marketing function will become a core competency of the company. A seasoned executive has already been hired to lead this initiative as vice-president of marketing. - Increased emphasis will be placed on focused market and customer research driving greater innovation in, and higher returns from, the product development process. Restructuring The restructuring will take place largely over the next 12 months, with the bulk of the costs being recorded in the fourth quarter of 2012. Total work force, including employees and contractors, will be reduced from 273 to about 170. Of the reduction in work force, approximately 40 employees are associated with precision products and approximately 60 are associated with the outsourcing of manufacturing, closure of the Calgary office and streamlining of the organizational structure. The existing agricultural business will not be interrupted during this process. Upon completion, the savings from the overall restructuring are estimated to be approximately $7-million per annum through reduced manufacturing costs, improved gross margins and reduced operating overhead. The cash cost of the restructuring is estimated at $5.5-million to $6.5-million. Non-cash costs of the restructuring are expected to be $4-million to $5-million. The company believes it has sufficient capital to complete the restructuring without the need for additional capital. Third-quarter financial results For the three months ended Sept. 30, 2012, revenue was $14.0-million, compared with revenues of $14.1-million for the same period of 2011. Segmented revenue contribution from the agriculture business segment grew year over year to $10.5-million, up 5 per cent from $10.0-million for the third quarter of 2011, while revenue from the precision products business was $3.5-million compared with $4.1-million in the third quarter of 2011. Consolidated revenue growth was 22 per cent in Canada and 6 per cent in the United States. European sales were down 1 per cent due to Europe's struggling economies, and sales to other international regions, including Australia, Asia and South America, decreased by 25 per cent compared with the third quarter of 2011, primarily due to a single large order in the previous year that wasn't repeated this year. Segmented revenues from the company's core agriculture business increased revenue contribution to 75 per cent of total third-quarter revenues, compared with 71 per cent in the third quarter of 2011. Precision products contributed 25 per cent of total revenue in the third quarter of 2012 compared with 29 per cent in 2011. On Aug. 27, 2012, Hemisphere GPS announced the launch of Outback MAX, its new flagship product for the precision agriculture market. Market and customer reception have been positive and initial sales have been encouraging, building optimism for 2013. Third-quarter gross margin of $6.7-million and 48 per cent was unchanged from the third quarter of 2011. Inclusive of restructuring costs, operating expenses in the third quarter were up by 16 per cent year over year at $9.5-million in the third quarter of 2012 compared with $8.2-million in 2011. The company incurred $500,000 of restructuring costs in the third quarter. Excluding restructuring costs, operating expenses increased by 10 per cent from 2011, primarily due to the addition of Ag Junction operations. Research and development expenses increased by $300,000 or 10 per cent year over year to $3.4-million compared with $3.1-million in 2011. Sales and marketing expenses for the quarter increased by $300,000 or 8 per cent to $3.7-million from $3.4-million in 2011. General and administrative expenses increased by 13 per cent to $2.0-million compared with $1.7-million in 2011, with the increase arising primarily from increased staffing and other administrative costs. Hemisphere GPS incurred a loss of $2.8-million or four cents per share (basic and diluted) in the third quarter of 2012 compared with a loss of $1.6-million or three cents per share (basic and diluted) in the third quarter of 2011. For the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2012, Hemisphere GPS reported revenues of $56.2-million, a 1-per-cent increase from $55.5-million for the same period in 2011. Gross margin for the first nine months of 2012 was 46 per cent compared with 48 per cent in the first nine months of 2011. Operating expenses of $27.4-million for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2012, increased $2.3-million or 9 per cent over the same period of 2011. The acquisition of Ag Junction at the beginning of 2012 added operating costs, including amortization, to the nine-month period. The company reported a loss of $1.8-million in the first nine months of 2012 or negative three cents per share (basic and diluted), compared with a profit of $1.1-million or two cents per share (basic and diluted) in the nine months of 2011, before the deduction of one-time expenses related to strategic initiatives in 2011 of $800,000. At Sept. 30, 2012, the company held cash of $4.3-million, compared with $6.7-million at Dec. 31, 2011.

Conference Call - 11:00 a.m. EST A conference call and webcast for shareholders, analysts and other members of the investment community has been scheduled for today at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time (9:00 a.m. Mountain Time) to discuss the financial results along with the Company's new corporate strategy. All currency amounts are expressed in U.S. dollars. New Agriculture Corporate Strategy On September 5, 2012, the Board of Directors of Hemisphere GPS initiated a restructuring mandate with the directive to implement a new profit-focused corporate strategy under the leadership of incoming CEO Rick Heiniger, formerly Vice Chairman of the Company and founder of the Outback Guidance(r) precision agriculture business. \"The agricultural industry is entering a period of exceptional opportunity. We're in the early stages of transformational adoption of high definition production practices. We are a data driven society, and agriculture is no different. Agronomic specialized data-management and cloud information services, combined with a new generation of connected devices and machines, will not only enable emerging technologies, but will simplify existing workflows and deliver productivity gains for the industry,\" stated Hemisphere GPS' new CEO, Rick Heiniger. \"We believe Hemisphere GPS is perfectly positioned. To that end we have launched a new corporate strategy building on our world-class positioning, guidance and steering solutions to provide seamless integration with cloud computing and information services. This integration will break the barriers which have long challenged the mainstream adoption of precision agriculture. We will be wholly focused on the essential core technologies while at the same time assisting the industry in its adoption.\" Under Mr. Heiniger's leadership, the Company has implemented a new corporate strategy built on three core principles to achieve profitable growth and market leadership: * Focus exclusively on the Agriculture business. * Streamline and simplify operations. * Implement market-driven innovation. Focus on Precision Agriculture For over a decade Hemisphere GPS has been a leading solutions provider to the precision agriculture market. In the first nine months of 2012, 81% of Company revenue was derived from the agriculture business, most of which comes from the North American market. Past diversification into marine, construction and other industries increased costs, absorbed cash and distracted management focus from its core agriculture business. To focus exclusively on agriculture, the Company will: * Exit the non-agriculture-related business. An investment banking firm has been engaged to pursue strategic alternatives for the Precision Products business. Given the agricultural focus of the Company, the Board believes that the Precision Products business can grow more quickly with another organization that is more strategically aligned. * Relocate Company headquarters to Hiawatha, Kansas where Hemisphere GPS's agricultural operations are already strategically located, in the heartland of the North American agricultural industry. An abundant supply of agriculture trained and passionate talent, along with the pro-business climate in the State of Kansas, are two key factors for the site selection. Streamline and Simplify Operations As part of the Company's initiative to ensure profitable and sustainable growth: * All production activities currently conducted in Calgary will be transitioned to Hemisphere GPS' primary outsourced manufacturing partner. * The Calgary office, which currently supports manufacturing, the Precision Products business and the corporate administration functions, will be closed following the relocation of key functions to Kansas, thereby reducing overhead. * The two-business-unit and supporting structure will be reduced to a single business, thereby eliminating redundancies, reducing costs and achieving operating efficiencies. * The Company will rationalize products, engineering projects and geographic markets. These initiatives will simplify the overall business and are expected to reduce manufacturing costs, improve gross margins and reduce operating overhead. Market Driven Innovation The Company will adopt a market responsive product development focus with a customer-driven culture. As such: * The marketing function will become a core competency of the Company. A seasoned executive has already been hired to lead this initiative as Vice President of Marketing. * Increased emphasis will be placed on focused market and customer research driving greater innovation in, and higher returns from, the product development process. Restructuring The restructuring will take place largely over the next 12 months, with the bulk of the costs being recorded in the fourth quarter of 2012. Total workforce, including employees and contractors, will be reduced from 273 to about 170. Of the reduction in workforce, approximately 40 employees are associated with Precision Products, and approximately 60 are associated with the outsourcing of manufacturing, closure of the Calgary office and streamlining of the organizational structure. The existing agricultural business will not be interrupted during this process. Upon completion, the savings from the overall restructuring are estimated to be approximately $7 million per annum through reduced manufacturing costs, improved gross margins and reduced operating overhead. The cash cost of the restructuring is estimated at $5.5 to $6.5 million. Non-cash costs of the restructuring are expected to be $4 to $5 million. The Company believes it has sufficient capital to complete the restructuring without the need for additional capital. Third Quarter Financial Results For the three months ended September 30, 2012, revenue was $14.0 million, compared to revenues of $14.1 million for the same period of 2011. Segmented revenue contribution from the Agriculture business segment grew year-over-year to $10.5 million, up 5% from $10.0 million for the third quarter of 2011while revenue from the Precision Products business was $3.5 million compared to $4.1 million in the third quarter of 2011. Consolidated revenue growth was 22% in Canada and 6% in the United States. European sales were down 1% due to Europe's struggling economies, and sales to other international regions including Australia, Asia and South America decreased by 25% compared to the third quarter of 2011 primarily due to a single large order in the previous year that wasn't repeated this year. Segmented revenues from the Company's core Agriculture business increased revenue contribution to 75% of total third quarter revenues, compared with 71% in the third quarter of 2011. Precision Products contributed 25% of total revenue in the third quarter of 2012 compared to 29% in 2011. Third quarter gross margin of $6.7 million and 48% was unchanged from the third quarter of 2011. Inclusive of restructuring costs, operating expenses in the third quarter were up by 16% year over year at $9.5 million in the third quarter of 2012 compared to $8.2 million in 2011. The company incurred $0.5 million of restructuring costs in the third quarter. Excluding restructuring costs, operating expenses increased by 10% from 2011, primarily due to the addition of Ag Junction operations. Research and Development expenses increased by $0.3 million or 10% year over year to $3.4 million compared to $3.1 million in 2011. Sales and Marketing expenses for the quarter increased by $0.3 million or 8% to $3.7 million from $3.4 million in 2011. General and Administrative expenses increased by 13% to $2.0 million compared to $1.7 million in 2011 with the increase arising primarily from increased staffing and other administrative costs. Hemisphere GPS incurred a loss of $2.8 million, or $(0.04) per share (basic and diluted) in the third quarter of 2012 compared to a loss of $1.6 million, or $(0.03) per share (basic and diluted) in the third quarter of 2011. For the nine months ended September 30, 2012, Hemisphere GPS reported revenues of $56.2 million, a 1% increase from $55.5 million for the same period in 2011. Gross margin for the first nine months of 2012 was 46% compared to 48% in the first nine months of 2011. Operating expenses of $27.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 increased $2.3 million, or 9% over the same period of 2011. The acquisition of AgJunction at the beginning of 2012 added operating costs, including amortization, to the nine-month period. The Company reported a loss of $1.8 million in the first nine months of 2012 or ($0.03) per share (basic and diluted), compared to a profit of $1.1 million, or $0.02 per share (basic and diluted) in the nine months of 2011, before the deduction of one-time expenses related to strategic initiatives in 2011 of $0.8 million. At September 30, 2012, the Company held cash of $4.3 million, compared to $6.7 million at December 31, 2011. Working capital was approximately $25.9 million, debt was $1.3 million and the Company maintains an unused operating line of credit with its bank with a maximum borrowing limit of Cdn $3million. The Company had 66,280,777 common shares outstanding at September 30, 2012. Outlook \"As a result of lower than expected growth in the third quarter, we no longer expect to meet our prior 10% revenue growth target for the year,\" said Mr. Heiniger. \"Due to the restructuring we will not be providing further guidance for 2012, however we are confident that the restructuring will improve profitability of the core agriculture business.\" About Hemisphere GPS The above disclosure contains certain forward-looking statements that involve substantial known and unknown risks and uncertainties.

After careful consideration, he decided not to make a deal with any of the companies that had originally come courting. \"We decided to try and hang on a little bit longer and push the business to become a little bit stronger,\" he says.

Despite this setback, a couple of lucrative opportunities came knocking that set Farmers Edge back on course - but not without some twists and turns. Then it was hit with a surprise. \"We signed the agreement with Viterra and, eight days later, Viterra went up for sale,\" Mr. Barnes says. \"The day the sale was announced, we were like, 'What's going to happen?'\" Mr. Barnes recalls. \"Then it was Agrium and we were like, 'This got even better.'\" The agreement between Viterra and Farmers Edge remained in place, and as Mr. Barnes saw it, the addition of Agrium to the mix brought the potential for future new opportunity internationally. (The Viterra-Glencore deal awaits one last approval from the Chinese government.) Still, Farmers Edge was feeling the pinch financially. \"The revenue that would be coming from Viterra really wasn't going to be coming for a year's time, so we were a little strapped based on that,\" Mr. Barnes says. \"Our biggest issue was, we'd been growing so rapidly that we were going to have to make a decision whether to slow down on growth to heal a bit from the bad year, or try to keep growing the company and going into these different markets.\" That kind of partner meshed well with The Challenge pros' advice to consider a partner that could bring not only money but new clients, technology and other benefits to the business, and Mr. Barnes' own thinking about the advantages of an industry inside player. \"The fit seemed really strong very quickly...We met in May and, by the end of June, we had a deal done,\" he says. Mr. Barnes says Avrio seemed like the right choice because of its strategic focus on agricultural technology and the fact that his new partners already had a deep understanding of his industry. \"Based on what I've learned the last couple years, agriculture is very different from a lot of the other industries that are out there,\" he says. \"There's a cultural piece that goes along with it; you have to understand how people think and how they react... The nice part about Avrio is that we don't have to teach them about those things, they already understand it and, for us, that's been really exciting.\" At the same time the Avrio deal was taking form, Mr. Barnes also decided to give the company's 60 employees an opportunity to invest in Farmers Edge; about 20 took him up on it. Between the employees and the investment from Avrio, which took a 15-per-cent stake in Farmers Edge, the company ended up with \"north of $4-million\" in new capital, he says. Farmers Edge will now be pushing into the U.S. market, Mr. Barnes says. In addition to providing the cash infusion that allowed it to stabilize after a rough year, Mr. Barnes says that Avrio's international connections have opened doors for the company in places such as Russia and South America as well. \"I've been really happy, they've been really good partners coaching me and guiding me along, but not where you feel like you're being pushed around,\" he says. \"For us, it was the first time we'd ever done this sort of thing.

From time to time, we will follow up to see what's happened since the experts weighed in with advice on the challenges they presented. Last year, Wade Barnes, the founder, president and chief executive officer of Farmers Edge, found himself in an enviable position: He had offers from nine different companies wanting to invest in his flourishing agri-business. The Winnipeg-based company uses satellite imagery to pinpoint where and what crops farmers should plant, as well as what fertilizers and crop-protection products to use.

Despite this setback, a couple of lucrative opportunities came knocking that set Farmers Edge back on course - but not without some twists and turns. First, the company signed a long-term deal with Canada's largest grain handler, Regina-based Viterra Inc., to provide Farmers Edge's precision agriculture work and lab services. Then it was hit with a surprise. \"We signed the agreement with Viterra and, eight days later, Viterra went up for sale,\" Mr. Barnes says. Viterra was bought by Swiss commodities trading giant Glencore International PLC; then much of its assets were subsequently acquired by the big fertilizer producer and farm products retailer Agrium Inc. of Calgary. \"The day the sale was announced, we were like, 'What's going to happen?'\" Mr. Barnes recalls. \"Then it was Agrium and we were like, 'This got even better.'\" The agreement between Viterra and Farmers Edge remained in place, and as Mr. Barnes saw it, the addition of Agrium to the mix brought the potential for future new opportunity internationally (the Viterra-Glencore deal awaits one last approval from the Chinese government).

After a speaking engagement at a conference in New York in the spring, Mr. Barnes was approached by Avrio Capital Inc., a Calgary-based venture-capital company that focuses on innovative food and agriculture businesses.

Although most students don't claim they want to be a hydrologist or a soil scientist when they grow up, within the field of agriculture there is an emerging demand for persons with skills in biology, engineering, technology, horticulture, and marketing. \"The agriculture sector has predicted a Canadian skill-set shortage of approximately 50,000 workers in the next few years,\" says Colleen Smith, Executive Director, Ontario Agri-Food Education Inc., (OAFE). \"The situation will worsen further due to the aging labour population in agriculture which highlights a need for more robust succession planning.\" OAFE has embarked on an initiative that will see the creation of a broad spectrum of agricareer documents targeted to high school students and teachers on the topics of precision agriculture, robotics, green energy, bio energy, financial literacy, soil science and more to come on emerging technologies. \"The best time to address the many facets of opportunities within agriculture is with high school students who are focused on their future studies and what careers to pursue,\" says Smith. \"There is a bright future in food and agriculture, but it can go unseen if no one shines a light on it.\" One school in Simcoe County has already recognized the value of providing students further education to assist with aspirations in horticulture, agriculture, and animal sciences. Since 2008, Banting Memorial High School in Alliston has been implementing Specialist High Skills Major (SHSM) programs in Agriculture and Horticulture and Landscaping. \"A Specialist High Skills Major (SHSM) is a bundle of credits, work experiences and certifications that focus on specific sectors of the economy and prepares students for careers in those sectors,\" says Justin van Diepen, IRT Co-operative Education Specialists High Skills Major. \"While courses are designed to suit students' interests, all programs must meet the standard requirements for the Ontario Secondary School Diploma (OSSD).\" In addition to providing students with hands on experience, this program also assists students to earn valuable certifications and/or training in courses such as: Standard First Aid/ CPR, pesticide handling and safety, livestock medicine and tractors and other self-propelled equipment. The Simcoe County District School Board currently offers 37 SHSM programs; however, Banting is the only school offering a program focused on Agriculture. The SHSM Agriculture program at Banting provides students with a mixture of applied credits in several areas, including: horticulture, agriculture, biology, animal science and livestock production. Theresa Watt, the teacher who manages the SHSM Agriculture program at Banting, says the program has been enjoyed by a mixture of students, some who have grown up on family farms and others who have limited experience with animals or farming, but who have a deep interest in science. \"This program provides students with some background and experience with the major livestock commodities while also encouraging our graduates to pursue studies and/or a career in one of the many viable agri-food sectors,\" says Watt.

Invasive hawkweeds are among the most troublesome weeds in the Pacific Northwest. As a genus, the fibrous-rooted, perennial hawkweeds reproduce by seeds and vegetatively by stolons, rhizones and root buds. They have small dandelion-like heads, all but one introduced invasive species having yellow flowers. The Pacific Northwest is susceptible to invasion by these aggressive weeds, and several species of invasive hawkweeds are now being found in Alberta, moving in from the B.C. border. \"Hawkweeds are distinguished largely on a few key characteristics, one being the typical hairs on stems and leaves. It is extremely difficult to identify hawkweeds from one another. If you suspect a hawkweed infestation in your area, it is recommended to contact local government specialists (i. e. ag-fieldmen or range agrologist) for proper identification,\" says Kimmel Producer Cars and Grain Dealer Cars in an Open Market Environment On August 1, 2012, a new era for the grain industry in Western Canada began. For the first time in 69 years, producers in Western Canada have the freedom to market their own wheat and barley for exports and domestic human consumption markets. The open market environment will allow wheat and barley producers to capitalize on market opportunities, as well as facilitate investment for infrastructure/research and development of value-added industries. However, there are concerns with its impact on the transportation system, particularly the access to producer cars. The use of producer cars remains in the Canada Grain Act. The Canadian Grain Commission (CGC) will continue to review and approve applications for producer cars. With respect to producer car allocation, the CGC and major railways work in collaboration. One condition required for the application is that producer car shippers must sell the grain and identify a shipping destination, either a domestic/foreign location or a port terminal. The vast majority of grains shipped by producer cars have been board grains, as the former Canadian Wheat Board's access to port facilities helped compliance with this requirement. The removal of CWB single desk may negatively impact the viability of producer cars. When com-pared to shipping to local grain elevators, producer cars usually represent lower cost and are used mostly by short-l ine railways, inland terminals and certain producer groups. Although only a small proportion of grains (about four per cent) is moved via producer cars, it is a significant issue for producer car shippers. In the new marketing environment, producer car shippers may need to establish partnerships with other industry stakeholders, such as port terminals, to address the issue. One potential solution is the use of grain dealer cars. Grain dealers are companies licensed by the CGC to buy and sell grain. Many grain dealers do not own grain handling facilities in Canada. Grain dealers usually start with a sale to a destination, often export markets, and then try to source grain in Canada. Grain dealers may purchase grains from producers directly, a grain company or a local grain broker. As grain dealers, they have the ability to order railcars to a legitimate railcar loading site. A partnership with grain dealers may allow producer car shippers to have access to railcars at their local railcar loading facilities. In addition, the new open market environment will allow producers and other producer car shippers to sell their grain directly to domestic processors/customers and international buyers. Once a sale destination is established and access to a port facility secured, producer cars can remain as a viable option for grain shipping.

It is also a great venue at which to showcase agricultural innovation and technologies as they relate to emerging agri-business career opportunities to students. Last year, Ontario Agri-Food Education Inc. (OAFE) partnered with COFS to deliver educational tours to high school students. OAFE Teacher Ambassadors toured almost 600 high school students through the show, interacting with industry representatives and giving students a glimpse into the endless opportunities in agriculture. In addition, OAFE presented the third annual OAFE Teacher Recognition Award at the show to Jason Beer, a secondary school teacher from Barrie. Past winners of the Teacher Recognition Award included Diane O'Shea (2010) and Peter Soos (2009). This year, OAFE is once again partnering with COFS to deliver an even bigger and better program for teachers and students. Educational resources on Financial Literacy, Soil Science and BioEnergy have been developed for participating teachers to extend student learning in the classroom and will add to the ones from last year on Robotics, Precision Agriculture and Green Energy. The tours and resources are made possible with generous support from the Ontario Soil and Crop Improvement Association, Farm Credit Canada and the Agricultural Adaptation Council. For the fourth year in a row, Ontario Agri-Food Education Inc. in partnership with Canada's Outdoor Farm Show will again be recognizing an Ontario teacher for their dedication and effort integrating agricultural concepts into classroom curriculum. The 2012 OAFE Teacher Recognition Award will be presented to Elsa Natvik, a Secondary School teacher with the Lambton-Kent District School Board, teaching the Agriculture Specialist High Skills Major (SHSM) program at Ridgetown High School. Elsa's nomination was wholeheartedly supported by parents, students and colleagues who recognized her talent and commitment to engaging her students in meaningful learning experiences, both in the classroom and the community.

The Agriculture SHSM program has broadened student knowledge, improved their skills, and increased awareness of the variety of career opportunities in agriculture. Elsa will receive the Teacher Recognition Award at the Opening Ceremonies of Canada's Outdoor Farm Show on Tuesday, September 11, 2012."}, {"title": "Find incentive for ethical farming", "article": "ETHICAL farming is agriculture's new catchphrase but there are many interpretations of what it actually means. At the Invigorating Agriculture conference on August 2-3, sustainable textile company Continuum Textiles co-founder and Canadian corngrower Stuart Adams said his version was the adoption of agricultural technologies such as precision agriculture, no-till systems, even genetically modified crops. \"In India, if someone who has a cow uses the manure for fertiliser, or burns the manure for methane, is that ethical? Or are farmers using GPS guidance and GM seeds ethical? I think it can be both,\" Mr Adams said. The fourth-generation woolgrower from Kojunup, Western Australia started his career marketing wool to garment stage as Izwool. This lead to i-merino the world's first wool fabric to receive European Union Ecolabel certification. The business has since expanded to other fibres such as organic cotton and recycled synthetics under Continuum Textiles which promotes socially and environmentally responsible production chains to many brands around the world. It even held its own boutique tradeshow in New York late last year. Among Continuum Textiles' clients are Pratibha Syntex in India, which processes organic cotton. In 2000, 475 Indian farmer-suppliers converted to organic and now Pratibha has 10,000 farmers encompassing 50,586 hectares supplying its gins. \"Their yields are less than conventional cotton but there is less risk. They have become very innovative, utilising their resources and being resourceful with what they have,\" Mr Adams said. But he concedes it is difficult to encourage retail companies and consumers to pay more for ethically produced textiles. Four years ago, Mr Adams jumped back into farming, this time at a 280-hectare property at Shawville in Quebec, Canada. He bought a string of dairies and is now growing monocultures of corn. He considered going organic but said there was no agronomic support for this type of farming in Canada and no financial incentive to grow organic. \"There is just no comparison between yields of conventionals and GM hybrids 90 per cent of the corn grown here is GM,\" he said. Under the system, he has been able to delay seed costs (up to $247/ha) of these high-yielding varieties until harvest. Mr Adams seems an unlikely ally for genetically modified crops but believes it is actually more sustainable than conventional varieties which require more chemicals. \"I would rather eat GM food than something that has had 2-4D (broadleaf herbicide) or some insecticides sprayed on it. With GM, none of the beneficial insects are killed,\" he said. He said Australia must separate science from fiction in its GM debate and wants to see a clearer chain of responsibility for the technology. Mr Adams says the face of farming has changed dramatically. \"We spend a lot of money on servicing machinery but not much on educating ourselves,\" he said. \"Driving a combine or tractor is now a hobby whereas educating myself is the main part of my business now.\" He said farmers across the world must run with new technology as it is the only way to make the yield gains needed to feed the exponentially growing population. \"We must approach it (ethical farming) as using all available tools which leaves the environment in a better state and develops a product that customers want,\" he said."}, {"title": "Soil Science; Study Findings from B.A. Delbecq et al Broaden Understanding of Soil Science", "article": "2012 AUG 9 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Agriculture Week -- Investigators publish new report on Soil Science. According to news reporting originating from Mississauga, Canada, by VerticalNews correspondents, research stated, \"Controlled drainage (drainage water management) restricts outflow during periods of the year when equipment operations are not required in the field. This may increase yields as well as reduce the loss of nutrients with negative environmental externalities.\" Our news editors obtained a quote from the research, \"An experiment using controlled drainage was investigated and its impact on corn (Zea mays L.) yields was assessed at the field level in Indiana.

Farming is a challenge, something reiterated to me at recent meetings of the Soil and Crop Association, Haldimand-Norfolk Holstein Club and Haldimand Federation of Agriculture. With the drought, for those who have been fortunate enough to get rain, prices for commodities are at a record high. That translates into higher feed costs, though, for dairy, beef, hogs and poultry. An early-season frost that followed warm weather presents another challenge by killing fruit tree blossoms. Opposition agriculture critic Ernie Hardeman and I are encouraging Ontario Minister of Agriculture Ted McMeekin to be proactive like his American counterpart in dealing with the drought. In the U.S., farmers have been offered quicker processing time on claims and reduced interest rates on emergency loans. For me, the highlights of farm shows and barbecues are seeing friends and getting updates on the challenges and opportunities facing today's farmers. The challenges are many, but farmers are hardy and resourceful. Agriculture is a primary industry, one that cities are dependent on for food, fuel and raw materials. After wheeling my tractor into the X-Change, I checked out information on Prospero, the Robot Farmer. This small piece of machinery can drill and plant seeds in a field or greenhouse. It isn't a lone R2-D2, but made to work in conjunction with many more of its kind. Down the road, fertilizing, weeding and harvesting will be options. Prospero's first cousin, Dorhout, is akin to a rolling water bucket on wheels. It senses moisture levels in greenhouses and applies water where needed. These little pieces of technology won't replace farmers and farm labour, but could assist them. Not all of the technology on display was as breaking edge as the robots. GPS technology has brought farming to a whole new level with precision farming that increases efficiency of input application and harvest through eliminating overlap and cutting fuel usage. It can also bring autopilot into tractors. From the X-Change, I was off to pick up my 1941 Dodge on display at one of the lavender festivals in Norfolk. Lavender has become another niche crop that not only produces an agriculture product, but also agri-tourism, bringing people into the area. One trend that becomes apparent is local farmers are experts at finding value-added opportunities from what they grow on their land. The growing number of wineries, roadside fruit and vegetable stands, food-related festivals, and even a new brewery, are testament to the fact. Diversification is not new. With the slide of the tobacco industry -- which once brought 90 years of prosperity to the sand belt -- innovation is necessary. Diversification is really about survival, it's what farmers must do to survive in this global marketplace and Haldimand-Norfolk farmers are continually out in front. As always, let's hope Mother Nature co-operates! Toby Barrett is MPP for the riding of Haldimand-Norfolk. His column appears regularly in the Reformer."}]
