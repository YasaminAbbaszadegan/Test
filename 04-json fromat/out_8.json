Management commentary \"AgJunction closed 2017 on a strong note, reporting its third consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth in a year that was ahead of our operating plan,\" said Dave Vaughn, president and chief executive officer of AgJunction. \"This was driven by continued strong OEM [original equipment manufacturer] demand in the U.S. [United States], Germany and France, as customers continue to adopt precision agriculture products like ours to drive yield and profit improvements. \"We believe there is also untapped demand for alternative products from a large segment of the market that has been mostly neglected. This forms the basis of our hands-free farm mission. Introduced in January, 2018, hands-free farm makes auto-steering more affordable, easier to use and more accessible for every farmer. \"The first step in the trajectory of the hands-free farm movement is Rebel from Outback Guidance -- the only low-cost, hassle-free auto-steering solution that is made to fit any farm and any farmer. This solution is grounded in our innovative, patented technology portfolio, and is supported by a distribution model that is efficient and transparent. We began shipping orders earlier this month, and early customer feedback has been strong. \"The remainder of 2018 will be focused not only on driving adoption across our suite of products, but also furthering the hands-free farm mission by addressing the needs of the small farmer -- an attractive segment of the market that has been largely neglected.\" Fourth quarter 2017 financial results Total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 20 per cent to $9.9-million compared with $8.2-million in the fourth quarter of 2016.

The increase was primarily due to a favourable mix of higher-margin products and the absorption of fixed costs over the higher revenue volume.

As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses declined to 69.2 per cent compared with 69.3 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2016. Net loss in the fourth quarter improved to $2.7-million or two cents per share, compared with a net loss of $2.9-million or two cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2016.

The $57 billion takeover has been watched by rivals and environmental groups, who are fearful that the number of players in the business of selling seeds and pesticides will shrink further and give one company a suffocating grip on the market. EU Antitrust Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said Wednesday that the remedies proposed by Bayer and Monsanto are worth well over 6 billion euros in business and \"meet our competition concerns in full.\" Monsanto in September accepted Bayer's offer, in which it also assumes $9 billion in debt, in a move affecting anything from tomatoes and cucumbers to the use of pesticides across the globe. Without the remedies, Vestager said that the buyout would have significantly reduced competition in the market and hindered innovation. She said the deal would create the world's largest pesticides and seeds company and therefore needed a large number of remedies to be approved. \"We have made sure that the number of global players actively competing in these markets stays the same,\" said Vestager. \"That is important because we need competition to ensure farmers have a choice of different seed varieties and pesticides at affordable prices.\" Bayer CEO Werner Baumann said that \"the European Commission's approval is a major success and a significant milestone.\" He said the companies were still working with U.S. authorities on the deal, which they hope to close in the second quarter of 2018. Vestager made her approval dependent on the remedies and business sales. She said the divestitures remove all overlaps in seeds and pesticide markets and streamlines R&D. And, Vestager said, Bayer committed to work to keep open the emerging market in digital farming, which focuses on the use of data to guide agriculture. Bayer proposed BASF as the company to take over the business it sells in this sector."}, {"title": "Canada : Government of Canada launches Agricultural Clean Technology program", "article": "Canadian farmers are important drivers of the Canadian economy, and also make important contributions in the fight against climate change by adopting sustainable technologies and practices.

Yet, the value of our universities goes well beyond the individual by affecting the local economy. In recent years, Canadian universities have started using accounting methods to calculate the economic effect of their activities on their provincial economies. In Manitoba, the University of Winnipeg and Brandon University have undertaken this analysis. The 2014 analysis by Brandon University suggests that each dollar invested in BU's operating grant returns $11.30 in economic activity to the province; a 2016 analysis at the U of W shows that $1 invested results in approximately $15 in economic activity. How does this work? The primary purpose of a university is teaching and research. First, we examine the wage premium -- most university graduates fare far better than non-graduates in terms of average wages. Statistics Canada says a university graduate working in Manitoba in 2016 made, on average, about $17,000 more annually than a non-university graduate. That person is earning more, spending more and paying higher taxes to all levels of government, all of which directly benefit Manitoba's economy. The second way to view the university's impact on the local economy is to examine the effect of research on productivity. Universities transmit knowledge; research and knowledge are the bedrock of innovation. Universities help find new ways to tackle pressing problems, often collaborating closely with industry, First Nations, community organizations and government departments. Several recent tangible examples of how U of W faculty, students and graduates contribute to our community include a project with the city of Winnipeg developing new methods to slow the spread of Dutch elm disease, the use of precision farming expertise and techniques to reduce the cost of producing corn and canola to create an advantage in the highly competitive food production industry, and working closely with Manitoba First Nations to examine how the ongoing support of an Indigenous doula can help women remain in their home community to give birth, thereby reducing travel, stress and expenses. These are the real-world benefits that university research creates for all Manitobans. This is true across the country. Statistics Canada says universities account for 40 per cent of total Canadian research and development. Canada's universities conduct $1 billion in research for businesses and help build their competitive advantage, and community-based organizations also benefit: universities conduct $1.2 billion in research annually for the not-for-profit sector, which has nearly tripled since 2000. Universities are a cost-effective way to raise wages and productivity. This high rate of return makes a strong case for investing in universities, particularly as we prepare for the new knowledge economy. Machine learning and artificial intelligence are impacting every industry, and will continue to do so over the next decade. The U of W has significant expertise in this shifting landscape; it is a transformation with tremendous implications across all sectors, from health care and hospitality to agriculture and aerospace. Investing in innovation and collaborative partnerships is critical to the future economy of Manitoba and Canada. New ways of thinking must encourage researchers, governments, the community and the corporate sector to work together to solve complex problems and create new opportunities. A university degree is an investment that continues to give, and investing in Manitoba universities will provide strong value for individual students now, and higher rates of return in the future for all Manitobans.

The Winnipeg-based company isn't harvesting wheat, corn or lentils. It's farming data. \"We're ingesting hundreds of terabytes of satellite imagery data, and we've got thousands of sensors in fields, all providing us information on a per-second, per-minute or daily basis,\" says Kevin Grant, the company's chief technology officer. That information, he says, is gathered from thousands of farms across Canada, the United States and overseas, and includes everything from soil and weather conditions to the performance of farm equipment and evidence of pests and rot. Sometimes it comes from Farmers Edge's own weather stations and in-field sensors; sometimes from third-party databases. The end game is to increase crop yield and lower costs by helping farmers make better decisions about when and exactly where to plant, irrigate, fertilize and harvest, and by allowing for the pro-active maintenance of equipment. As the amount of data piles up, however, companies such as Farmers Edge are increasingly turning to machine-learning technology and other flavours of artificial intelligence (AI) to help spot patterns or trends that might otherwise go unnoticed using conventional agronomics and human labour. \"This is about disrupting what's been done in agronomy for the past few decades. There's a perfect approach you can take to every field, and what we're doing is trying to tease that perfection out from the data we collect,\" Mr. Grant says. \"In essence, we're asking our machine learning algorithms to do what simply wouldn't be feasible for us to do on our own.\" It wouldn't be possible, really, without the Internet of Things and its rapidly expanding network of low-cost, data-gathering sensors, which touch everything from dairy farming to aquaculture. Fredericton-based SomaDetect, for example, uses optical sensors to monitor fat, protein and antibiotic levels (and other biochemical markers) in milk as it flows from a cow's udder. As more data is collected, machinelearning algorithms are trained to instantly spot abnormalities that could ruin a large batch or indicate an infectious disease. Armed with this information, farmers can take action to protect the rest of the herd and preserve batch quality. XpertSea, a precision aquaculture venture in Quebec City, has developed a \"smart bucket\" that uses computer vision technology and machine learning to count, categorize and determine the size of species sampled from massive shrimp and fish hatcheries. It's accurate and superfast, helping fish farms do more with less labour, prevent disease from overfeeding and look at historical trends that can reveal how to improve operations and grow bigger, healthier - and more profitable - fish inventories. Another company, Deveron UAS of Toronto, uses sensorequipped drones and machine learning technology to count and analyze the size distribution of pumpkins, allowing farmers to accurately estimate yield per acre before negotiating sales agreements with retailers. The agriculture industry isn't the only resource sector in Canada that has been shaken awake by the potential of AI. In both mining and energy, there's a recognition that to stay globally competitive industry will need to embrace the future that AI represents. \"It will help us do two things faster,\" says Michelle Ash, chief innovation officer at Barrick Gold. \"One is to understand solutions to our current questions and, more importantly, know the answers to questions we haven't yet thought to ask.\" In Vancouver, a company called MineSense is already using machine learning to analyze data collected from sensors installed on shovels, buckets and conveyor systems that move ore - in this case, copper, nickel, zinc or iron. The technology scans for electromagnetic signatures in the ore and uses X-rays to instantly detect metal concentrations in each shovel load or as ore moves along a belt. \"The system uses machine learning to look for patterns in the data we collect and gets smarter as it predicts the grade and condition of ore,\" CEO Jeff More says, adding that the technology allows his customers - currently large copper mines in British Columbia and Chile - to find pockets of ore that can't be seen in a general mine plan. \"The more precise we are, the more pockets of good ore we can find.\" Higher precision and the ability to adapt to changing ore conditions in real time results in reduced use of energy, water and chemicals and less waste from ore processing, Mr. More explains. \"The idea is to identify and eliminate waste as early as possible.\" The bottom line is that efficiencies enabled through AI means we can get more by using less. We can grow and process more food using less energy, water and fertilizer; we can extract more minerals and metals from the ground using less fuel and producing less waste. Expand this to the energy sector and the impact gets even more compelling. AI is helping monitor the integrity of pipelines, speed up the development of nuclear fusion power, and make it possible for smart homes and intelligent infrastructure to \"negotiate\" with the power grid. It's allowing us to squeeze the most we can out of solar and wind farms, and predict when power plant equipment needs maintenance so repairs can happen before failures. Companies in these sectors that don't yet have a strategy to leverage the power of AI need to get moving. The change won't happen overnight, but the planning needs to start today."}, {"title": "AJX AgJunction receives Steering Solutions order for $55M", "article": "AgJunction Inc (TSX:AJX) Shares Issued 116,878,275 Last Close 3/13/2018 $0.55 Tuesday March 13 2018 - News Release An anonymous director reports AGJUNCTION RECEIVES SIGNIFICANT BULK PURCHASE ORDER FOR ITS STEERING SOLUTIONS PRODUCTS AgJunction Inc. has entered into a bulk purchase order with a customer to supply its Steering Solutions products to the customer for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $55-million.

Patent Issued for Monitoring and Control Systems for the Agricultural Industry (USPTO 9894852)", "article": "2018 MAR 7 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Telecommunications Weekly -- According to news reporting originating from Alexandria, Virginia, by VerticalNews journalists, a patent by the inventors Gilbert, Michael (Vancouver, CA); Metcalfe, Leonard (Surrey, CA), filed on January 7, 2014, was published online on February 20, 2018. The assignee for this patent, patent number 9894852, is SemiosBIO Technologies Inc. (Vancouver, British Columbia, CA). Reporters obtained the following quote from the background information supplied by the inventors: \"Precision agriculture involves observing and responding to localized field conditions on a farm, vineyard or orchard using technologies such as aerial and satellite imagery, sensor arrays and geographic information systems, so as to optimize field-level management. The process involves matching the topology of a production area with the geo-location of data, such as climactic conditions, soil conditions, weeds and diseases, across the area to be managed. \"The recording of localized data and its delivery to a database in so-called precision agriculture may be by means of a wireless sensor network. In practice, the successful implementation of sensor networks over the relatively large areas covered by a farm, vineyard or orchard has faced challenges and obstacles. \"A network of sensors distributed throughout an agricultural production area must have access to sufficient power to operate over long periods with little and preferably no maintenance. \"It has been contemplated to use wireless sensor mesh networks for data collection, for example using the ZigBee or other protocols. \"In order to conserve energy and extend their standalone working life, sensors in wireless sensor mesh networks are sometimes operated using sleep and awake modes, awakening during specified time intervals to transmit data. The awake time must be long enough for the sensor to receive and forward any data that may be received from other sensors in the mesh network. This results in the relatively large number of sensor nodes in the network being awake and transmitting or retransmitting at substantially the same time. The inventors have found that this results in interference and collisions that must be managed and that degrade the performance of the network. An alternative that has been attempted by the inventors is to enlarge the time slots for mesh network transmissions between the sensors. However, any enlargement of the awake time is at the direct (and almost inversely proportional) expense of battery life. \"An additional challenge in the use of wireless sensor mesh networks in agricultural applications is that the optimal location of the sensors is often on the trunk of the plant or within its foliage in which case the vegetation itself acts as an obstruction to signal propagation. This threatens to orphan some nodes in the mesh network or to require more retransmissions and impose a greater network management burden, again drawing more power from the battery. More significantly, placing a sensor unit in or beneath the foliage severely restricts the available insolation for solar panels, particularly in more challenging climates. \"The foregoing considerations combine to severely compromise the ability of the sensors to operate according to a mesh network protocol in agricultural applications where there are many sensor nodes or they are deployed within or under the foliage. \"Libelium Comunicaciones Distribuidas S. L. discloses (on its web site at libelium.com/smart_agriculture_vineyard_sensors_waspmote) the general features of a network-based system for the monitoring of environmental parameters in an agricultural production area. The system includes a plurality of sensor nodes operating wirelessly in any of several network protocols including ZigBee. The sensor nodes have sleep modes and hibernate modes. When active, they communicate with gateway nodes which are mounted on poles and connect to a remote server over the Internet through 3G/GPRS. \"U.S. Pat. No. 8,026,822 to Borth et al. discloses the use of a wireless sensor network in a pest control application. Pest control devices communicate wirelessly, through repeater nodes if necessary, to a gateway that makes data available to a remote data server for viewing, analysis or messaging. \"WO 2011/090938 to Rhee et al. discloses the use of a wireless mesh network in a rodent pest control system. Each of various traps is paired with a wireless device, the wireless devices being in communication via a mesh network for reporting the capture of an animal. A repeater may be used in the mesh to extend the effective range of the network. Data is routed through the mesh network to a wireless gateway to an external network and hence to a management server. \"Neither Borth et al. or Rhee et al. discuss the issues involved in applying the invention to an agricultural context. \"U.S. Pat. No. 7,916,951 to Landwehr et al. discloses an insect monitoring device for use in an agricultural context. Landwehr et al. refer generally to networking multiple devices and relaying information to a processor but no detail is provided in relation to the network operation or in relation to any problems arising from operating sensor mesh networks within crop foliage. \"A specific opportunity exists to apply wireless sensor networking in the field of insect management in agricultural applications. The current practice in agricultural areas involves setting up an array of insect traps distributed across a field, farm, vineyard or orchard, weekly attendance at each trap for manual or automation-assisted logging of insect activity, resetting or cleaning the traps, reviewing the collected data and the subsequent decision whether to disperse pesticides or bio-pesticides in the production area. While the agricultural industry is moving toward fully organic farming by reducing pesticide usage, such a reduction requires precision control of insect infestations, which is economically challenging in view of the labor-intensive approach to insect detection. \"Organic farming also requires using bio-pesticides that rely on artificial insect pheromones to disrupt the insect mating cycle. The pheromones are continuously dispersed using timed aerosol sprayers or time release compounds which can last most of a growing season. The effectiveness of the pheromones is determined by placing traps to catch, count and identify targeted insects on a weekly basis. The trap counts are relied on to adjust the placement of pheromone sprayers or the compounds used. More frequent and real-time monitoring would allow a quicker and more effective response to any pest conditions that might be detected, while the application of precision agriculture concepts may allow the response to be more localized. \"The application of wide scale characterization and analysis of insect populations would also enable the more targeted application of pheromone-based disruptors, and the use of more measured minimal quantities than are conventional used at present. Wind, altitude, humidity, vegetation and topological features can determine pheromone drift. A real-time localized insect count opens the possibility of inferring the propagation pattern of pheromones for more efficient dispersal. \"The present invention is directed to a monitoring and control system for agricultural applications that addresses transmission and network management problems arising from crop foliage.\" In addition to obtaining background information on this patent, VerticalNews editors also obtained the inventors' summary information for this patent: \"In one aspect, the invention comprises a wireless network of sensor/actuator devices within an agricultural production area. The devices are deployed within the crop, and under or within the foliage. Preferably each sensor/actuator device is positioned to communicate wirelessly with at least one of several repeaters mounted preferably above the foliage for line of sight communication with other repeaters. At least one gateway provides for communication to an external communication network. \"Data collected from the devices is transmitted to a remote management server for data analysis, user access, messaging users and providing access by users. The server also issues commands for propagation through the network to the sensor/actuator devices. \"In one embodiment the invention takes the form of a pest management system. The plurality of devices forming the wireless network comprises a plurality of first devices comprising an insect trap, an imager for imaging the trap, a processor and a wireless communications module for broadcasting images of the trap, and a plurality of second devices comprising a pheromone canister, an aerosol actuator and a wireless communication module. The pheromone may be released according to a schedule that is a function of the specific location of each pheromone dispensing device and pursuant to commands from the server. The data collected may be aggregated across multiple growers to provide a broad basis for data analysis and tracking of pest distribution and behavior and more effective management. \"In a further optional embodiment, the network includes a plurality of pheromone tracking devices for determining the levels of pheromone present at particular locations across the production area and for determining pheromone plume distribution. In a particular embodiment, the pheromone dispensing devices may dispense the pheromone along with a tracer to enable tracking of the pheromone plume by detection of the tracer. \"The foregoing is intended as a summary only and of only some of the aspects of the invention. It was not intended to define the limits or requirements of the invention despite identifying certain more detailed embodiments. Further aspects of the invention may be determined from the description and claims that follow.\" Keywords for this news article include: Business, Pesticides, Pheromones, Agricultural, Agrochemicals, Organic Farming, Wireless Network, Biological Factors, Wireless Technology, SemiosBIO Technologies Inc..

Wade Sobkowich, executive director of the Western Grain Elevator Association, says the situation is getting worse instead of better. The latest figures from the Ag Transport Coalition, which represents several grain associations, say car order fulfilments from Canada's two major railways was 38 per cent during the week of February 12th. Sobkowich says the backlog means grain elevators filling up at the farm, and emptying silos at ports leading to penalties for delayed shipments. CN Rail chief financial officer Ghislain Houle says the cold and snow have restricted operations and forced it to cut train lengths by more than half, but that recently improving weather has helped boost speeds.

Unlike the Olympics, after which the athletes can go home and bask in the glory, the victors of the federal government's \"supercluster\" competition are faced with a stark reality. Now, the real work begins. Protein Industries Canada (PIC), a highly diverse cluster of organizations that coalesced around the notion of making Canada a global leader in plant-based ingredients, was among the five winners announced earlier this month in the hotly contested federal competition for innovation funds. It was awarded $153 million out of the supercluster pool of money, but its leaders predict that when all the in-kind contributions and other government program contributions are tallied, the total investment in western Canadian economic diversification could top $800 million. The real prize is tapping into a global market opportunity for plant-based protein that's worth an estimated $13 billion and the potential for increasing Canada's agri-food exports by upwards of $30 billion. You could argue that this is the western Canadian agricultural economy's coming of age, after more than a century of policies that favoured the export of raw commodities and more than two decades after those policies were ended. But the future is unfolding far differently than the pundits imagined. Back in the 1990s, no one predicted farmers would shift production away from cereals that were no longer economical to export. No one anticipated the trade, currency and disease issues that would plague the meat sector. Nor did they predict that Canada would become the world's leading supplier in a surging market for plant proteins. Plant-based proteins are now expected to make up one-third of the global protein market by the midpoint of this century, according to a Canada West Foundation report released late last year. Consumption is expected to double between now and 2023. The growing middle class in developing countries is eating more meat; consumers in industrialized countries are eating more plant proteins. Fractionating or separating the protein from co-products closer to home means more accessible markets for farmers and more high-tech jobs. The opportunity is there and Canada is well-positioned to take full advantage. But will it? As coalitions go, Protein Industries Canada is unique. It has pulled more than 110 companies, commodity groups and research organizations into a value-chain approach. It promises to further the interests of farmers through better germplasm and precision-agriculture technologies, invest in sorely needed food-processing innovations and develop new markets. Processing is the missing link. The region has historically exported raw grains. \"It will allow us to develop new processes for fractionating seed and taking the high value out and developing new markets,\" said Frank Hart, chairman of the PIC board of directors in an interview on the Between the Rows podcast. \"Although, you can pull 20 per cent of the seed out as protein in a pulse crop, for example, what do you do with the other 80 per cent? \"You have to find the value in industrial products, cosmetics, animal feed other uses for the starches. That will make the whole processing cycle a lot more viable and profitable, which means that processing companies will be attracted to locate in the region.\" It all makes perfect sense, except for the legacy of this region's history. We're talking about a region where governments get into spats over licence plates from the neighbouring province. The Canadian West Foundation report didn't tiptoe around the issue, noting that Canadian provinces \"do not always have the best record on co-operation. \"Inter-provincial trade disputes abound and there is often a sense of 'me too' in terms of federal funding,\" it says. \"Provinces can choose to compete against each other or they can collaborate and compete against the rest of the world,\" the report said. Hart cites \"catalytic forces\" behind the PIC's pan-Prairie approach. \"It's attracting people with a strong incentive to collaborate even though they are competitors -- because it will benefit the whole industry.\" Their mission now: keep everyone's eyes on the prize.

McCain personally put in $2.5 million", "article": "You grew up in the food industry. How have you seen it change in that time? The most important thing is the simple idea that the food industry is pivoting toward a crisis. That crisis is rooted in the realization that the global population is drawing for its sustenance on a very limited resource pool, Planet Earth, and the dietary trends and growth in population over the next 20 or 30 years makes the food system we have today unsustainable. At the same time, there's a level of trust in the food industry that is not what it should be. You've spoken before about what you see as the big trends shaping the future of food. Let's start with the idea that Big Food is coming under attack. Why is there this mistrust among the younger generation in particular? The fundamental expectations of consumers have shifted to a higher standard, and the food industry perhaps hasn't fully adapted to all those. Start with the notion of transparency, for example--ingredient decks that are very difficult to read. And in chemical compounds nobody could possibly unwind. And all of which are--according to history and the government and science--perfectly safe, but you probably wouldn't find them in your kitchen. We don't believe there's good food and bad food, per se. There are good diets and bad diets, right? We need to advocate for better nutritional balance. And the food industry has probably not been as open and transparent and participative in that idea of balance and moderation as it could have been. Why is nutritious food so expensive? Because you go into a grocery store, particularly in the United States, and a tomato is ludicrously expensive, but I can buy five bags of Oreos for $6. Completely. Which goes to the paradox of access and affordability. It's not just having food available to you, but having food of the correct nutritional balance. It's a fundamental challenge in the plight of food security, which we've been trying to take a leadership position on. So where does Maple Leaf come in to this? We've declared a goal of becoming the most sustainable protein company on earth. That's a pretty audacious goal, but it's one that inspires the hell out of every soul in our organization. We're small enough in the global scheme of things to be rebellious, we're large enough to scale up these rebellious ideas to make them commercially practical. Can you give me some examples? Let's start with the idea that it means we are a supplier of better food. That means increasingly migrating to natural ingredients. Ingredients you can pronounce. It means being the largest supplier of meat raised without antibiotics in North America today, in pork. You know, 30% to 40% of all greenhouse gas emissions come from the food chain. Meat is a primary protagonist. We've set an interim goal of a 50% reduction in our footprint--in energy, water and natural gas--by 2025. How do you do that, considering raising animals boosts your footprint so much? First, let's be clear--there's a massive, Grand Canyon difference between beef, pork and poultry. Beef has five to 10 times the footprint of pork and poultry. If people converted from beef to pork and poultry, we could reduce greenhouse gas emissions in agrifood by 20% or 25%. Animal welfare also obviously comes into this. That's the third pillar--better care. Better food, better planet, better care. Consumers today are demanding that, as they should. The care of the animals in our stewardship comes in a number of different fashions. First, we're leaders in North America in gestation crate-free production in pork. We're investing tens of millions of dollars in that initiative. So open pens? It's open pens, but we actually take it all the way through. We have the longest period in open crates in the industry. We're investing millions of dollars in remote video auditing, to make sure the handling of the animals is fully aligned with best practices, through to temperature-controlled transportation and enrichment initiatives. Hogs are a very social animals, right? We're investing in ways to enrich their lives beyond just open housing and humane euthanasia techniques. Maple Leaf recently invested $10 million to create the Centre for Action on Food Security. You personally put in another $2.5 million. Was there an epiphany around food security for you? Well, it's the elephant in the room to a food industry leader. It's beyond epiphany--it's right in our face. Four million Canadians suffer from food insecurity--that's one in eight households. It's one in two people in the North. Our goal is a 50% reduction in food insecurity by 2030. What are some of the barriers, when we've got this incredible bounty of food in this country? Is it logistics, affordability? Is it just geography? Basic income-level contributors are, by any measure, the No. 1 driver. But it would be a mistake to assume that's the only factor. There are issues of distribution and access--there are places, particularly in urban centres, that are considered food deserts. There are issues of mobility. There are issues of food and nutritional literacyr. There are distribution issues, particularly in the North. Getting affordable food into the North is a perennial challenge. What about food waste? Globally, 30% to 40% of all the food produced in the world doesn't hit a human stomach. Where does it go? It depends. In the developing world, it's mostly waste in the distribution channel. In the developed world, most of the food waste occurs in the home or in food-service institutions. It's over-portioning. It's inappropriate \"best before dates.\" It's all-you-can-eat buffets. So put the food insecurity issue in context. What does it mean globally? There's going to be nine billion people on Planet Earth by 2050. We can feed seven billion today. We don't know how to feed nine billion people, and if we don't figure it out in a hurry, there's going to be a lot of people starve. I want to talk a little bit about the role of technology. How do we use technology to ultimately feed more people? Technology is going to play a role in all aspects of this. We're using technology around precision agriculture that can radically improve the environmental footprint of livestock production and food production in general. That's the future of modern agriculture. Because part of the problem with food production around the world is not the arable land base--it's getting the arable land base to the same level of productivity that exists in North America. And not carpet-bombing with pesticides and herbicides. So there's that idea, all the way through to technology in actual food production, whether it's animal proteins or plant proteins, including the production of animal-protein look-alikes--lab-based meats. Do you think that's going to become a thing? Who knows? It sort of belies the idea of natural food. Having said that, could it play a role? Yeah, it could. I think that's in the very distant future, but honestly, we'll be a participant in anything that makes a more sustainable diet. What are some of the initiatives Maple Leaf has taken on? Everything from high-tech lighting to the role of alternative energy sources to battery storage for better efficiency in our supply chain. We're looking at technologies like artificial intelligence, sensor technology, the Internet of Things, all the way through to the e-commerce component, which is really about how consumers are going to acquire food. Maple Leaf recently bought a couple of grain-based meat companies. What was your thinking there? Our beliefs are based on a few observations. The first is that consumers want to ingest more protein. They want less carbs and more protein. Two, they want more choice in the proteins they consume. Three, they probably won't consume a huge amount more animal protein in aggregate over the next 20 years. Don't see it going away, don't see it declining. Globally, even with growing appetite for meat in China, for instance? No, I'm saying in our markets here. There's definitely going to be more animal proteins consumed in parts of the world as their GDP grows. Right. Finally, in the pursuit of more protein consumption, the majority of that growth in North America will come from plant-based proteins, not animal proteins. We view ourselves as a protein company. We also think that contributes to our sustainability agenda, right? We're the only meat company in the world that is overtly expressing the objective for consumers to eat meat in moderation. What's your own diet like? I like to think I'm balanced nutritionally, although I have the same human frailties, where my nutritional balance is considerably better Monday to Friday than it is Saturday and Sunday. Did what happened in 2008, with the listeriosis crisis, change your thinking in terms of how you view the future of food? What happened in 2008 was a a complete and utter tragedy, a tragedy that we're embarrassed about and that scarred our psyche, because we took accountability for the loss of 23 lives on our watch, and we'll never forget that. It brings character and meaning to the responsibilities we have in the food industry, but no, it didn't change how we think about things. What will the food system look in 25 years? Any predictions? I would like to think we would be able to reliably feed 10 billion people in an ecosystem that's environmentally sustainable, respectful of the resource base that it was produced in, providing diets that are nutritionally balanced, that are ethnically aligned with people's needs, and affordable across all strata of society around the world.

Economic indicators show a strong and dynamic Canadian agricultural sector, with a growing global middle class looking for our world-class products. Federal Agriculture and Agri-Food Minister, Lawrence MacAulay, celebrated Canada's Agriculture Day alongside farmers, ranchers, food processors, industry leaders and youth today in Ottawa, where he officially launched the six federal programs under the Canadian Agricultural Partnership (see Backgrounder). The Partnership is a progressive $3-billion, federal-provincial-territorial agreement that will help chart the course for government investments in the sector over the next five years. Developed with input from provincial and territorial partners, as well as industry, federal programs and activities under the Partnership will focus on three key areas: *Growing trade and expanding markets ($297 million) - Providing core industry services, such as timely market information and sector expertise to help improve the sector's competitiveness, growth and adaptability. Advancing and defending international trade interests, as well as improving market development and market access activities to address emerging needs of the sector, and of small and medium enterprises (SME).

The unique association is being driven by the fact that Farmers Edge is able to produce data on crop production for farmers in areas that never existed before, which made underwriting insurance policies for those fields almost impossible. The four-year deal with Bermuda-based PartnerRe is hoped to bring Farmers Edge an additional 20 million acres of new farmland using its services over that span. Farmers Edge draws in data from all sorts of points of contact using variable-rate technology, field-centric weather monitoring, in-field telematics and on-site resources to allow farmers to more precisely manage every stage of production. Four months ago, it also added high-resolution satellite imagery to its services through a partnership with Planet, a company that can take pictures of virtually every farm in the world. Ron Osborne, Farmers Edge's chief strategy officer, said, \"In North America, we take things for granted, like ubiquitous access to cellular data... rich networks of weather stations and solid data. Globally, it is that infrastructure that makes insurance even feasible. You can't insure something if there is no underlying data sets.\" With no data sets for certain parts of the world, it meant that many farmers have not been able to access that kind of risk management. \"It would be equivalent to flipping a quarter in the air if you did not have the data,\" Osborne said. By using the data collection and machine-learning analysis that Farmers Edge has now rolled out to millions of acres across five countries, it can bring real-time data needed to underwrite policies. It is expected to help close the insurance gap in emerging markets like Brazil, where only 10 per cent of farms are insured today. Osborne said an extremely large farm in Brazil was recently able to get insurance for the first time thanks to this new arrangement. And rather than having to wait five or 10 years to collect enough data to allow an insurance company to underwrite a policy, it only needed four months after the installation of Farmers Edge. He said with good data and the kind of machine-learning analysis Farmers Edge can achieve, the cumbersome process of making an insurance claim for hail damage, for instance, could become a lot quicker. Now that it can also supply almost real-time satellite imagery, insurance claims could conceivably be settled in a matter of days. PartnerRe, which generated revenues of US$5.4 billion in 2016 with total assets of about $22 billion, will start to work with insurance companies around the world to open the market to the potential of crop insurance. Osborne said PartnerRe will act as a marketing agent of sorts, encouraging insurance companies in various parts of the world to enter the market by putting together customized insurance products that are based on real-time data for very specific local conditions. Greater access to insurance could advance the global food and agriculture industry and increase food yields. \"Our focus is helping the farmer,\" Osborne said. \"Some have never had access to crop insurance before. We are excited to be able to help our customers more than ever before.\" martin.cash@freepress.mb.ca"}, {"title": "Business leaders encouraged by venture capital plans", "article": "In addition to applauding Manitoba's Progressive Conservative government for wading back into the venture capital business, business leaders are also encouraged by the way they are doing it -- making it part of a broader economic development strategy. On Thursday, the province issued calls for submissions on a couple of key areas that impact that economy. One is for proposals for the management of one or two venture capital funds in partnership with the province. The other is a request for information about just about everything concerning provincial programming that supports business. While there has not been any venture capital specifically targeted at Manitoba companies for more than 10 years, more recently there has also been no focused overall economic development strategy. There is widespread positive support for the province's efforts to find partners to run a venture fund in Manitoba to invest in Manitoba. As well, the fact that process also includes an effort to co-ordinate some of the province's tax credits and business support programs is seen as additionally helpful. \"Any strategy that aligns support for business initiatives and offers businesses more opportunities to acquire the capital they need to grow is exciting and definitely a step in the right direction,\" said Jeff Ryzner, the CEO of North Forge Technology Exchange, a Winnipeg incubator that offers a range of support services to help startup businesses. Since the Crocus Investment Fund was placed in receivership in 2005, there have been Manitoba companies that have secured venture capital funding from the billions of dollars floating around in that global market. Most recently, Farmers Edge, the Winnipeg precision agriculture company has raised more than $100 million over the past few years. But Farmers Edge is likely the outlier. In just about every other metric, Manitoba has lagged behind most regions of North America in terms of numbers of deals and dollar values. And there are some who believe the provincial economy has paid a price for that. \"I think it artificially dwarfs our ventures because it takes a much longer time to gather the momentum necessary to get to the growth phase without the venture capital,\" said La Royce Batchelor, director of the Stu Clark Centre for Entrepreneurship, which is part of the Asper School of Business at the University of Manitoba. Prior to her appointment at the U of M, Batchelor spent eight years in North Dakota, where there are seven angel and venture capital funds. \"The province of Manitoba is even substantially behind a rural state like North Dakota when it comes to cultivating venture capital,\" she said. Many have argued for some time that, despite the dearth of that kind of capital to inject in Manitoba companies, that there are plenty of homegrown enterprises that could compete if they had fair access to capital. To some extent, this initiative will determine whether or not that is the case. Marshall Ring, CEO of Manitoba Technology Accelerator, said, \"This is a market test. We'll see who wants to come run a fund in Manitoba and bring their own money to invest in Manitoba. We are going to see what others think about the idea... Of growing companies in Manitoba.\" The province's request for pre-qualification does not specify how large the funds need to be, but Minister of Growth, Enterprise and Trade Blaine Pedersen said the idea is to provide growth capital, not smaller seed financings. A department official said that means the funds will need to provide add-on investments when necessary, and that means the funds will need to be at least $40 million. Loren Remillard, the president of the Winnipeg Chamber of Commerce, said ideally the market needs capital for every stage of growth and that Manitoba has been deprived of access to growth capital for too long. \"This will allow us to move past that moment in history and be able to embrace something that is successful and people see the value in,\" he said. martin.cash@freepress.mb.ca"}, {"title": "GFO announces new agronomist position", "article": "Grain Farmers of Ontario, the province's largest commodity organization, representing Ontario's 28,000 barley, corn, oat, soybean, and wheat farmers, today announces the newly created role of Agronomist.

Gervais", "article": "Release date - 01022018 Agricultural innovation is key in the current economic climate, said J.P. Gervais. Over the next year, 'farm revenues will be driven by volume rather than price,' according to J.P. Gervais, vice-president and chief agricultural economist at Farm Credit Canada (FCC). Given this shift in paradigm, farmers need to look towards agricultural innovation in order to increase efficiency and productivity, as well as to manage costs, Gervais said yesterday at the Farms.com Precision Agriculture Conference. After the third increase in interest rates in the past six months, farmers are asking Gervais if Canadians are seeing the beginning of a trend, he said. (The Bank of Canada raised interest rates to 1.25 per cent on Jan. 17.) While he is reluctant to predict a trend based solely on three data points, Canadians face about a 50 per cent chance of another interest rate increase before the end of March, he said. American interest rates are also trending up. Producers should review their loan portfolios and evaluate the risks of possible interest rate increases, Gervais suggested. In terms of the grains and oilseeds market, global production continues to climb, he said, which means market analysts are focusing on the strength of demand and global weather conditions. The market is well-supplied compared to previous years. Corn prices could move a bit lower as we head into the 2018-19 marketing year. Producers likely face a barely breakeven situation for corn, he said. At this stage, 'soybeans clearly have a better outlook than corn' for 2018-19 but they also face a limited upside, Gervais said. These predictions can shift, of course, as a result of weather challenges in the primary grain- and oilseeds-producing countries. Pulse producers have faced a significant decline in prices because of the Indian tariff. Western Canadian farmers will likely grow more canola and soybeans this year as a result of the market uncertainty, Gervais said. Indeed, the trade issue with India probably will remain unresolved this year, he suggested. Gervais also discussed two looming trade deals: the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). CPTPP opens up markets in high-value countries and growing markets, he said. The trade deal will likely have a 'positive impact on prices' but probably not until next year, Gervais suggested. In terms of NAFTA, a renegotiated agreement likely will not include significant changes, Gervais predicted. The United States could also withdrawal from the deal, which could create secondary impacts, such as a decline in the Canadian dollar. 'Everybody has a vested interest in seeing a trade deal done but we'll see what the United States does,' he said. Overall, however, Gervais is 'excited about the possibilities in the agricultural industry over the next few years.'

Thanks to investments by the Government of Canada in the development of clean technologies, Canadians could see a direct benefit in the food on their plate. Investments in innovative sensors and web-based platforms for better irrigation and crop management could help yield more crops while reducing the amount of pesticide used. The Honourable Jean-Yves Duclos, Minister of Families, Children and Social Development, on behalf of the Honourable Navdeep Bains, Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development, announced a federal investment of $5.9 million, through Sustainable Development Technology Canada (SDTC), to advance technologies being developed by Hortau, a firm with innovative clean tech ventures. This investment in Hortau supports a precision agriculture platform--composed of hardware, software and communication systems--that can provide a more complete approach to managing crops and irrigation. This includes monitoring five elements that can influence crop development: water, nutrients, pests, temperature and salinity. With this technology, Hortau is targeting high-value irrigated crops in Canada and the United States, representing a market of about 9.5 million acres. Hortau made the prestigious 2017 Global Cleantech 100 top companies to watch list as an up-and-coming company that is catching the attention of leading investors and corporations in the market. Investments in clean technology are part of the Government's Innovation and Skills Plan, a multi-year strategy to create well-paying jobs for the middle class and those working hard to join it. Investments in clean technology also support the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change. Quotes \"Our country is built on innovative solutions for crop and irrigation management. From our modest beginnings of clearing forest to plant crops to developing technologies like the ones we are supporting today at Hortau, Canadians are at the forefront of making better use of resources and creating more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly solutions.\" - The Honourable Jean-Yves Duclos, Minister of Families, Children and Social Development \"Our government's investments in clean technology reflect our commitment to protecting the planet. But they also point to a clear and strategic direction for economic development through innovation. That's because innovations in clean tech will lead to products and services that have an impact on all sectors of the economy. And clean tech has the potential to create thousands of well-paying jobs for Canadians. That's how innovation leads to a better Canada.\" - The Honourable Navdeep Bains, Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development \"Hortau's innovative platform helps farmers better manage irrigation, reducing water consumption and pesticide use across the agriculture sector. This groundbreaking technology will deliver real environmental and economic benefits for all Canadians.\" - Leah Lawrence, President and CEO, Sustainable Development Technology Canada \"Our goal is to help farmers grow more with fewer resources and improve production through the use of cutting-edge technologies in the field. Sustainable Development Technology Canada's investment will continue to help Hortau remain at the forefront of precision irrigation innovation and allow us develop new technologies that make irrigation decisions easier for our growers. We're excited about the support from the SDTC because it's only going to help bring more precision and sustainability to Canadian agriculture.\" - Jocelyn Boudreau, Co-Founder and CEO, Hortau Inc.

A lot of the newer farm equipment these days can collect the data about those different conditions, but surveys indicate that many farmers find it's just too complicated converting all that information into something useful. Saskatchewan farmer Florian Hagmann was in Brandon this week to share his formula for pushing canola yields into the record-setting zone with fellow farmers attending the annual Manitoba Ag Days. Hagmann, who farms 10,000 acres southeast of Prince Albert, Sask., won the Dupont Pioneer 2015 Yield Challenge after harvesting a 116-bushel canola crop on a field of 147 acres (which is just shy of a quarter section of land). He routinely captures 70 to 90 bushels per acre. That's about double the Prairie average for canola yields. There are lots of years, like the one just past, in which farmers get a pleasant surprise at harvest. However, high yields are no accident or freak of nature on the Hagmann farm. They are part of the plan. Hagmann's seminar was packed with farmers there to learn his secrets. To the non-farmer, it all sounds pretty complicated. But the principles he follows could be applied to any business. It starts with a willingness to experiment in a way that controls his exposure. Hagmann tries out new ideas on one-third of his land base. If he succeeds, he nets enough new income to make the extra effort worthwhile. If he suffers a wreck, he hasn't risked the whole farm. He routinely soil tests -- which is a tried and true, relatively inexpensive, but widely under-utilized analytical tool. So he knows his baseline. Estimates vary, but some put the rate of annual soil sampling among farmers as low as 20 per cent. Many farmers apply fertilizer based on average recommendations and estimates. Between soil testing and observation, Hagmann knows some of his fields have the potential to yield more than others, so he pays extra attention to how he treats those fields. He looks at the big picture. He is as much focused on feeding his soil as he is on feeding his crop. \"I believe the only way we can achieve these yields is if the health of the soil is good,\" he told his audience. He is particular about the basics. When those seeds burst through the soil surface, he wants to be able to count 10 seedlings per square foot. As well, he doesn't treat fertilizer as a one-shot deal. He applies a base rate of fertilizer with the seed in the spring based on average yield projections. He applies more on certain fields after the crop is growing if the moisture conditions suggest there is a higher-than-average yield potential. If it's too dry, he's saves himself the extra expense. The list goes on. That extra attention to detail on acres that have the higher-yielding potential takes time and money, but the rewards are worth it -- he can net an extra $300 per acre. On a quarter section, that's the difference between $16,000 and $48,000. \"That's a big difference,\" he said. Farmers in the audience were quick to ask what kind of equipment he uses. His answer was, on one hand, surprising, but on the other, completely in character. Hagmann is using a 30-year-old seed drill that cost him $10,000. A $500,000 seeder would undoubtedly work better, but not enough to cover the increase in his fixed costs. He likes to keep those costs low. It's about the ingredients, he told farmers, not the pots and pans. \"If you can get good seed placement, good fertilizer placement and the right ingredients at the right time, you will have success,\" he said. It's deceptively simple and something any farmer can understand. The devil is in the detail. But at its core, that's what precision agriculture is all about.

That's an accurate description of Manitoba's economy and, chances are, it's the way it will be described for many years to come. The fact that 2017 was a good year for Manitoba -- with growth of between 2.1 per cent and 2.9 per cent depending on which forecaster you choose -- it likely won't feel much different compared to next year, when most of them call for two per cent growth, tops. But such reliability doesn't mean Manitoba business stories of 2017 are void of intrigue, home runs, complaints and catastrophes. And with the Pallister government trying out its cost-cutting religious moment, there was plenty of uncertainty. There were also some obvious signs of growth -- like the construction of True North Square and the opening of Outlet Collection Winnipeg -- and plenty of shoring up of existing corporate strength, along with some corporate downsizing. Which is to say, further evidence of a diversified economy that produces slow and steady growth. The family empire Old-money, family-owned businesses in Manitoba were busy this year. The Richardsons made their first foray overseas, acquiring Europe's second largest oat miller; the MacDonalds cashed out on MacDon (after a couple of years of rumours that such a deal was imminent) for $1.2 billion; Gerry Price's Price Industries continues to up its game in the HVAC business with Winnipeg work at the new Apple headquarters (but they can't talk about it) and Albert Cohen's kids are taking Gendis private. It's a Winnipeg thing After suffering through an unfortunate collapse right after it was sold a few years ago, Ben Moss Jewellers stores are reopening, albeit under the stewardship of Halifax-based Charm Diamond Centres. Wawanesa, the multi-billion dollar mutual insurance company came out of it shell, buying Western Financial Group, one of its first acquisitions in years. After being acquired by the American sports equipment company True Temper Sports, Winnipeg's VH Footwear -- the company famous for $1,000 ice skates -- now has the space to make 10 times as many expensive skates. Farmers Edge, which continues to race around the world to accumulate more paying customers for its precision farming tools, partnered with a new satellite imaging company that takes high-res pictures of farmers' fields all day long. A phone company to call our own The sale of MTS to Bell did not mean dropped calls or clunky internet service. And they've only raised rates a little. It was fun to say we had our own little provincial telco, but it also seemed clear that the juicy dividends its stock was paying were going to be needed to invest in broadband to keep up with the wireless world Manitobans need, just like they do in Toronto. The deal also brought Telus into the market along with all its marketing spending, and sometime next year Xplornet will assume the role of the fourth competitor that's supposed to make the stars align in the Manitoba telco universe. The last train to Churchill While the good people of Churchill pursued their unique Canadian experience on the frigid shores of the Hudson Bay, just about every institution that has said they will protect rail service to the Far North town continues to let them down. Like any business, Omnitrax wanted to make its customers happy... until it decided it had enough of those customers and wanted out of the market. Both the federal and provincial government knew for a long time that there was going to be a challenge to the service but put off developing plan B for as long as possible. Even the northern First Nations, who want to become the new stewards of the railroad, were unable to present a united front, indulging instead in long-simmering feuds. At least there are plenty of other northern Manitoba communities that survive without all-season ground transportation who can advise Churchillians on how it's done. NewFlyerpeg If these were still the days when a town was named after its most prominent employer, New Flyer might be the company this city would try to integrate into its name. While it has one of the largest private sector workforces -- especially now that it also owns Motor Coach Industries -- it's also investing in the latest lean manufacturing technology, doing the research and development to stay ahead of the market, and making sure its long-term access to the U.S. market is secure by complying with Buy America regulations. A couple of years ago it bought a U.S. competitor and now it makes New Flyer buses in that former company's Alabama plant. This year, it bought a small bus maker in Indiana, a supplier in Wisconsin and is in the process of building a parts plant in Kentucky, all the while growing the size of its footprint in Winnipeg. Diamonds (and lithium) might be miners' best friends There was plenty of hand-wringing going on about the North this year with the Bay Line washed out. But the fate of the mining industry may have even graver consequences. Vale closed one of its mines in Thompson this year and will close its nickel refinery next year. Hudbay Minerals' big mine in Flin Flon will have to shut down in the next couple of years and its much smaller Reed Lake mine is scheduled to close by the end of 2018. In total, the industry workforce could be down by about 1,500. It remains to be seen if 2017's diamond discovery or major exploration for lithium (used in smartphone batteries) will materialize soon enough to fill the void. Marijuana factory farming Delta 9 Cannabis Inc. has dispensed with its former technical moniker (it used to be Delta 9 Biotech) and is now fully embracing the giddy heights of its potential. One of the city's true recent success stories -- it just finished raising $23 million and its shares have more than tripled in price since going public in early November -- the company is significantly expanding its hydroponic crop at its secret Transcona location. Closer to the inner city, Bonify has invested millions of dollars for three years and is now preparing a space of up to 200,000 square feet for production. When legal marijuana shops open next summer, it will be one other way for us to all support local business. Downsizing, Winnipeg style Three of the largest corporate entities in the city -- Great-West Lifeco Inc., IGM Financial and Manitoba Hydro -- all announced head office reductions this year. Hydro's was the largest at 900, and Great-West Lifeco's about half that. While it surely meant disruptions for many, it does not seem to have caused the city's labour market to break stride as it continued to maintain one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country. Say what you want about Great-West Lifeco, its downsizing was done in concert with an intensification in technology investment, something absolutely necessary to maintain its standing in the global financial services business. New digs The first multi-tenant office building since the early '90s is being built in downtown Winnipeg. True North Square is adding about one million square feet of office, residential and commercial property, most of it occupying the former parking lot for a couple hundred cars. The Portage and Main buildings were also spruced up in 2017. The exterior of the long-standing premier office address at 360 Main St. got a high-end facelift and some of its neighbours at Portage and Main also benefited from capital investment. And, as if to show that Winnipeg is capable of bucking development trends, there were also major retail builds in 2017. The city's first outlet store mall opened, Outlet Collection Winnipeg, with 400,000 square feet and more than 100 stores. Now if they can just find tenants for the shuttered Target and Sears locations. The shorts got snookered Exchange Income Corp. (EIC), a dividend-paying diversified holding company, was subjected to a nasty assault in 2017 by calculated short sellers who attempt to profit from driving down a company's share price (by any means possible). It didn't work very well. While a poorly handled scheduling snafu a year ago at Perimeter Airlines -- one of EIC's companies -- may have been the pretext for the spurious online slagging of the company's safety and accounting policies, Transport Canada didn't bite, because there were no safety issues. The company stood its ground, resisting engagement in the underhanded tactics that included secretly recording and selectively quoting from a late night cocktail-bar conversation with one Bay Street analyst. While the ambush did drag the stock price down 40 per cent, it's gained back almost the same percentage since then. martin.cash@freepress.mb.ca"}, {"title": "Press Release: Agrium and PotashCorp Announce Receipt of Final Regulatory Clearance and Set Closing Date for Merger of Equals", "article": "Agrium and PotashCorp Announce Receipt of Final Regulatory Clearance and Set Closing Date for Merger of Equals Canada NewsWire SASKATOON and CALGARY, Dec. 27, 2017 SASKATOON and CALGARY, Dec. 27, 2017 /CNW/ - Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc.

Fortunately, we Winnipeggers know better. We are rightfully proud of our city and our collective accomplishments, including many in the past year alone. There are very positive homegrown success stories in 2017 that should all make us sit up and take notice. As a modest city we tend to not want to boast, but there are many achievements that are worth talking about. And there's no need to be timid about it -- Winnipeg is a thriving, vibrant city. There are exciting stories happening all the time that most people aren't even aware of. Entrepreneurial drive is nothing new to the fabric of our hometown, but in recent years Winnipeg has developed a thriving tech scene. Multiple industry-leading companies that have grown and flourished here are now having a large impact on industries worldwide. As you gather with friends and family over the holidays, here are some of the stories you should know and talk about: Winnipeg's biggest recent success story has been Skip The Dishes. Founded in 2013, Skip now has more than 10,000 restaurant partners in 40 cities. Late last year, the company was acquired for $110 million and has only continued to grow. With nearly 800 employees and a staggering 11,000 per cent growth rate, the company has recently been recognized by Deloitte as one of the fastest-growing tech startups in the country. E-commerce and digital media company Bold Commerce has grown by over 3,600 per cent during its last four years. Bold now has more than 160 employees providing tools and strategies to help businesses increase their online sales and is continuing to execute on a long-term growth strategy in the e-retail space. Local startup Geofilter Studio has become the world's largest designer of custom Snapchat filters (your kids will have used them), essentially creating an industry and market for itself in the process. Only founded in 2016, the company has designed over 30,000 geofilters for individuals, events and companies, including McDonalds, Google, Coca Cola and more. Farmers Edge is a world leader in new technology applications for precision agriculture, an emerging sector that collects and analyzes data to increase crop efficiency rates. One of the fastest-growing startups in Canada, the company is recognized internationally as a pioneer in high-tech farming technology, with operations in five countries worldwide. It's not just local startups that are having an impact on the world -- the world also is taking notice of Winnipeg and its advantages and we are starting to see the impact of that growing positive reputation. The number of new buildings planned for completion in the next few years is astounding. The $400 million True North Square will be a landmark for our city for generations. ARTIS REIT is planning a $140 million, 40-storey structure at Portage and Main to attract hundreds more residents downtown, while the $200 million SkyCity Centre will bring more opportunities for residential and commercial space. Outside of Winnipeg, the global food processing company Roquette announced this year that it is investing $400 million in a pea-processing plant near Portage la Prairie. The plant will be the largest facility worldwide dedicated to pea processing, with an anticipated annual production capacity of over 100,000 tonnes. Our newly renovated RBC Convention Centre is attracting larger conventions. Because of this, there is also growth in demand for hotel rooms in the city. As a result, nine hotels are being built or expanded, with nearly 1,300 new rooms expected. All of these figures stem from demand-driven growth; people are looking to Winnipeg as a destination for meetings, getaways and more. There are many untold stories in Winnipeg's business community that we should all be proud to talk about. At Economic Development Winnipeg, we like to share these success stories at MyWinnipeg.ca, an information page that showcases our city's strengths and achievements, as well as what to do, where to eat and what's happening. As \"Winterpeg\" residents, we might sometimes fall into the trap of focusing on only the perceptions others may have about us. The reality is that the positive stories happening right now far outweigh any negative notions. We need to stand up and be proud of our successes and our growth, because Winnipeg is bustling with new opportunity. If someone at your next work party, family dinner or holiday event tells you nothing exciting ever happens in our city, take the opportunity to share these stories with them. The work being done here deserves to be known and celebrated. Don't let the naysayers tell you any differently. Winnipeg is trending upward. Dayna Spiring is president and CEO of Economic Development Winnipeg."}, {"title": "Profit, environment can go hand in hand", "article": "Technology helps farmers maximize earnings while increasing sustainability As momentum behind the tools and concepts of precision agriculture continues to grow, one of the most exciting -- but least talked about -- opportunities is their ability to improve farming's environmental footprint. That's a shame, because that's one attribute of this latest revolution in agriculture that is most likely to resonate with an increasingly skeptical public. Much has been said about the new digital technologies' ability to increase productivity and efficiency in farming through more strategic application of fertilizers and pesticides. Some even continue to trot out the worn rhetoric about feeding the world, even though there is growing recognition that the productivity increases needed to accomplish that will have more to do with building roads and storage facilities in developing nations than variable-rate applications of fertilizer in North America. But few, at least so far, have taken the premise of better precision to the logical next step of articulating how these tools might be used to protect the environment, rather than simply furthering the interests of Big Ag. That point is not lost on Robb Fraley, the executive vice-president at Monsanto and the company's chief technology officer. As one of the founders of genetically modified crops, he knows all too well the fallacy of thinking the science can operate independently from the public engagement. Even though genetically modified crops were the most rapidly adopted technology in the history of agriculture and are now grown in 30 countries worldwide, the technology remains mired in controversy 25 years after its introduction. \"We did a great job on the science and we did a miserable job on the communication,\" Fraley said in a recent interview. \"The good news is that we have the opportunity to tell that story differently and better.\" Monsanto subsidiary ClimateCorp recently had its western Canadian rollout of FieldView, a digital data management platform designed to improve farmers' ability to collect and analyze data generated by their farms. While smartphones have paved the way for public acceptance of new digital technologies in food production, Fraley is keenly aware that the benefits they bring by way of environmental performance and improved traceability must be spelled out. The intersection between the data management and biology allows scientists and farmers to make decisions faster and more accurately. It also allows them to measure what's working or not on their land with precision. Clarence Swanton, a weed scientist with the University of Guelph, outlined how that might play out on the landscape recently at the Canadian Weed Science Society meeting in Saskatoon. He believes precision agriculture offers a way to convince farmers that environmental protection and profitability go hand in hand. Most farmers equate conservation with lower profits. However, Swanton says there are acres on most farms that are actually costing farmers more than they earn to farm. Those pieces could be mapped and diverted back to habitat that increases biodiversity, which stabilizes the ecosystem. Swanton says the key to this approach is to shift farmers' focus from commonly used yield maps, to building profitability maps of their fields. Farmers look at yield maps with a view to what they need to do to fix areas where yields are low. But some of those areas aren't fixable. He showed examples of one Ontario farm where the farmer spent more than he earned on small sections of the field in three years out of four. \"Why are we farming that? Can I use that land for something to benefit ecosystem services to build diversity in the landscape?\" he said. \"These profitability maps can be used to help identify areas in our landscape that we can convert back to a natural habitat.\" That opens the door to creating a brand for Canadian agriculture that is sustainable, verifiable and socially responsible -- attributes that could well give Canadian farm exports a competitive edge in an increasingly environmentally conscious global marketplace. However, Swanton acknowledges his hypothesis goes against the prevailing psyche in agriculture. Farmers might need tax breaks or other incentives under proposed environmental goods and services programs to make the change. Laura Rance is editorial director at Glacier FarmMedia.

It's crucial for governments to act because agrifood has the potential to boost its contribution to the national economy, he told the Senate agriculture committee which is studying the impact of climate change on farming. \"There's a golden moment and a golden opportunity here for Canadian agriculture and that this opportunity was recognized by Dominic Barton in his report from the Advisory Council on Economic Growth earlier this year,\" he said. The government has a key role in making the golden moment reach its potential. He recommended the government \"incentivize breeding programs, both for our crops and for our livestock that promote heat tolerance, drought tolerance or pest tolerance. ... For much of the 20th century, our breeding programs focused on simply boosting yields at the exclusion of traits such as resilience.\" \"But I think by shifting government funding programs to support research into climate-resilient crops and livestock and then by engaging in public-private partnerships with input suppliers, we can provide farms with the genetic tools they need to adapt. \"Similarly, we can also create incentives for farmers to use more agri-ecological principles that will help improve resilience as well,\" he said. \"Creating incentives to encourage crop rotation or conservation practices help because these practices build up the organic matter in our soils, and this is important because organic matter acts like a sponge, trapping water when it's abundant and saving it for when it's needed.\" The committee should also focus on agriculture's potential to use technology to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, he said. Digital technologies, \"which include smart tractors that know where they are in the field and plant the right seed in the right place and give it the right amount of fertilizer with no waste, are sometimes called Agriculture 4.0.\" 'They give us the opportunity to produce more food with fewer greenhouse gas emissions, and since agriculture is responsible for a third of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, this is really important. \"At the moment, however, Ag 4.0 is in its infancy, both in Canada and internationally,\" he said. \"For instance, it requires huge amounts of data to be integrated. That smart tractor needs to take soil maps, needs to integrate it with Environment Canada weather station data and needs to take remote sensing data from our satellites and bring it all together. \"At the moment, this sort of data integration isn't happening, and as a result, we as a global society as well as a country are not realizing the potential of these new technologies,\" he said. \"I think this, however, represents an ideal opportunity for Canada to show leadership.\" Ottawa could help by \"developing protocols pertaining to data sharing, cybersecurity, data ownership and data integration that would apply across the entire agrifood sector and make Canada a leader in developing and applying the technologies that will allow us to produce more food with fewer greenhouse gas emissions.\" The committee should also consider carefully the agriculture potential of Northern Canada as the climate warms, he said. \"Our northern soils are very fragile and are huge reservoirs of carbon.\" \"Some work I've been involved in suggests that if we start seriously cultivating northern soils, we will create huge new carbon emissions that will destroy Canada's ability to meet our Paris accord commitments.\" \"This doesn't mean that agriculture can't happen; it means we have to be creative about it. \"Maybe instead of thinking about wheat fields or soybean fields in the North, we think about extensive bison or caribou production that is then deliberately marketed to international discriminating markets,\" he said. Adaptive farming practices and expanded use of digital technology could help the agrifood sector \"become more adaptable to climate change and extreme weather but also reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and build new export markets by demonstrating to our trading partners that our food is the most sustainably produced in the world, thereby establishing a brand Canada.\" \"Similarly, I think we can develop secondary markets to sell climate-friendly agricultural technologies to our trading partners.\""}, {"title": "Linamar Corp to Acquire the MacDon Group of Companies, M&A Call - Final", "article": "Presentation OPERATOR: Good afternoon. My name is Amanda, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the acquisition review conference call. (Operator Instructions) Thank you very much. I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Linda Hasenfratz. You may begin your conference, ma'am. LINDA S. HASENFRATZ, CEO AND NON-INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR, LINAMAR CORPORATION: Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our acquisition announcement this afternoon. Joining me this afternoon are members of my executive team, Jim Jarrell, Mark Stoddart, Roger Fulton, Dale Schneider and some members of our corporate finance, marketing and legal teams. Okay. Just moving through our presentation this morning. I want to draw your attention to this statement regarding forward-looking statements we might make on this call. I'm not going to read it to you because I'm sure you can read it yourself, even though Roger's looking upset about that. So let's move on to the key messages around this acquisition. We are very excited to announce today what we see is a really important step in our growth and diversification strategy, the acquisition of MacDon, who is a global harvesting specialist headquartered in Winnipeg, Manitoba. We're excited about the deal from many different perspectives. It provides us diversification into an opportunistic market. It provides innovation as MacDon is considered an innovative market leader in all their products. Of course, it gives us growth both immediately and longer term as we grow the business globally, and we feel it's a financially attractive deal as well. So just to talk a little bit about each of those these points a little more. Clearly, we see that the opportunity enhancing our position as a global diversified manufacturer. We have talked a lot in the last couple of years about the fact that the agricultural food market is a key long-term growth market given the growing and developing global population out there, so we think lots of opportunity. Linamar has a long history of involvement in the agricultural market, as we'll show you shortly. And we like the idea, as you know, of diversifying beyond the automotive Powertrain/Driveline and access manufacturing we do today. As I mentioned, MacDon is an innovative market leader. In fact, they have #1 market share in each of their key products. They've got a real track record of technology and innovation leadership that we really like. As you know, that's a key element in which we run our business today, so we love the synergy there. We think there's significant opportunity to leverage their strength with Linamar's global manufacturing expertise and lean principles through employee engagement process. We think there is significant growth potential and upside opportunities, first of all, because the agricultural market is in the early stages of cyclical recovery. Secondly, we think there's a lot of opportunity to grow the business globally. A high percentage of sales today are in North America, so the global market is out there for us to expand into. And we think there's possibly some opportunities of synergies from a distribution perspective. And lastly, as I said, I feel it's a financially attractive deal. We think this is a strong, well-managed company with great financial performance and solid outlook. We think it was a fair price that we paid. It is immediately accretive to earnings and cash flow even before considering any synergies. And at the same time, it allows us to maintain our strong balance sheet, which is quite important to us. And we do expect to rapidly delever post the transaction. So just to review the transaction. It's also little bit more on the cost was $1.2 billion from which some transaction-related expenses that will be borne by the sellers will be deducted. The EBITDA multiple for the transaction was 7.8x last 12-month EBITDA, which compares well, we feel, with precedent transactions as well as public company trading comps of similar businesses. We see, as mentioned, high single-digit accretion right out of the gate on both EPS and cash flow. We have fully committed financing in place for the deal, which will leave us at about 1.7x net debt-to-EBITDA at close. And as noted, we do expect to rapidly delever back under 1x EBITDA within the next 18 to 24 months, which is fantastic. So just to recap a few details about MacDon. It was founded in 1949. It's headquartered in Winnipeg, Manitoba. They are selling around the world but as noted, high percentage of sales today in North America. They have several sales and product support offices around the world to support that global network. They have a fantastic dealer and distribution network from which they sell their product and a solid leadership team and a great base of employees. There's about 1,400 people that work with MacDon, more than 100 years of collective experience on the management team, which is great. Key products are rigid and flexible draper headers as well as self-propelled windrowers. I'll describe that a little more in a moment. They have several facilities, as noted, around the world. Most of them are sales and product support offices. All the manufacturing is happening in Winnipeg. Just hitting some of the key historical financials over the last 5 years. Sales have been in the range of $550 million to $650 million. EBITDA margins are typically in the range of 20% to 25%. Depreciation is pretty low, as is CapEx. So not dissimilar to our Skyjack access business. And last 12-month sales were roughly $600 million. So moving on to a better overview of the product portfolio. As I mentioned, the 2 key products are pictured up at the top of the screen. First, draper headers, both rigid and flexible. So these are harvesting units that attach to the front of a combine or a windrower, and they're used to harvest a variety of crops such as soybeans, wheat, oats, et cetera. MacDon sells these units directly to farmers for the most part through their distribution network. The next largest product is self-propelled windrowers, which are used to cut and lay crops in the fields like hay or other crops that need drying before picking up. Other products include pickups. So to go back and pick up that hay once you cut it and it's dried in the field and other hay products like auger headers and rotary disc headers. Of course, they also have a thriving aftermarket parts division, which is branded Westward Parts. You can see here MacDon's global organization. As I mentioned, all the manufacturing is actually in Winnipeg. They have 2 key R&D centers, one large center in Winnipeg and another in Wisconsin, and then several sales and product support facilities around the world, here in North America as well as Europe, Asia and South America. So just good global footprint to grow from. Of great value, of course, is MacDon's extensive North American distribution network, which you can see illustrated here. They have great relationships with their dealers, which have been very carefully developed over the last 30 years and have been a huge asset for them. The international market is, as you can see, a smaller chunk of the revenue today but we feel has huge growth opportunity in the future. Organizationally, the business is going to fall into our Linamar Agriculture group, which we created, as you recall, about a year ago. From a segmented financial perspective, it's going to fall under our Industrial segment, alongside Skyjack, whose business metrics are quite similar, as already described. So turning to the strategic rationale for the acquisition. I would boil it down to really 6 key things: first, clearly enhancing our position as a global diversified manufacturer. We like the idea of having a diverse markets but more avenues within which to grow the company. As noted, we have a long-standing history in the ag market, and we think it adds significant size and scale to our existing agricultural equipment platform. We love the idea that MacDon is an industry-leading business with great market share. So they have leading market share in several categories. They are #1, in fact, in FlexDrapers, in Combine Draper Headers and self-propelled windrowers, which is fantastic. They are certainly recognized to be a technology and innovation leader in terms of great technologies, great product quality and have a long history of innovation in the company. Their technology is supported by over 100 unique patents, with an additional more than 30 pending on a global basis and a strong technically -- technology-focused staff of over 100 people. We feel there is significant growth potential and upside opportunity in several -- from several perspectives. As noted, the opportunity to lever North American leadership with Linamar's global manufacturing is key. We think there's lots of opportunity to tap into those global markets where they are a player but not as big a player as they are in North America and opportunity to expand and enhance our -- both our agricultural and industrial product offerings and market reach on a global basis. The agricultural market, as I mentioned, is in the early stages of cyclical recovery. So it's a great time to step into the market and really take advantage of things starting to improve and gain some momentum. And finally, again, a financially attractive deal. We think it's a fair multiple. 7.8x is absolutely in line with the trading multiples we've seen for both precedent transactions and for companies -- similar companies in the industry. It's immediately accretive. There's some modest synergies that we will realize, and we do maintain that strong balance sheet, which I think is quite an important point and certainly has always been important to us. So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Jim to talk a little further about the diversification concept and how MacDon really helps with that goal. Jim? JIM JARRELL, PRESIDENT AND COO, LINAMAR CORPORATION: Thank you, Linda. Good afternoon, everybody, and it's great to be here today. And it's really a great opportunity for us to explain what we're doing. And really, I will say this is a culmination of a couple -- 3 years of research and study that we have been working on at Linamar in regards to finding the right partner for this product area. So we've really taken a lot of approach and analysis to this deal. Certainly, it's an excellent technology partner in this space. And I can also say based on our getting to know this company, they have a great workforce, great leadership and really a great legacy. And we've gotten to know this leadership group out there very well, very capable team. And the 4 anchor shareholders, the 4 brothers, have this long legacy of discs. And their blood -- their father, Joseph Allen MacDonald (sic) [Joseph Andrew MacDonald], basically founded and started the company and really had trained and helped grow this. So really a great legacy company and really fits in well with Linamar. Certainly, looking at sort of the global trends that we have been talking about probably for a few years with you, our shareholders, is obviously global population growth, which is nothing really new. But that's a big deal for the agricultural business, rapid technology evolution, a lot of things around AI, autonomous. And in the ag sector, this could all be about precision farming, which, of course, a company like MacDon is very aware of. Aging population is certainly another key around growth of people and need for more food, and of course, urbanization. And we've been talking about this Vision 2100 for some time now. And certainly, this was created in Linamar about 4 years ago. And I think with this actual deal transaction that we're doing, we're staying very true to this 2100 year plan. And of course, this is building the future in regards to transportation, of course, which is the mainstream for Linamar today; infrastructure, which is all around Skyjack; and industrial; and of course, Oros as well. And then food, here's our major play into this food sector with MacDon and the other sectors, which, of course, each have an eye out for the future. But obviously, nothing today on those. And then the other side, on the left, which is all about manufacturing, processing capabilities that Linamar is known for and constantly evolve in the company. Sort of why food and ag, I think, would be one of the key aspects that people would be thinking through. It's really an attractive demographic and really economic fundamentals. Really, there's a global food demand which will continue to grow, and the ag market is basically a large and very dynamic market today. And if you look at some of the comments like Linda said that were sort of coming out of the cycle and if you read around what John Deere and companies like that say the uptick looks like 5% to 10% in the ag and food and there's pent-up demand that obviously will be replenished as well. Other reason is Linamar's long history in the ag equipment sector. A lot of you won't know this, but Frank had bought the White Farm in the '80s and had run that. And then also, we produce combines for ag though under the name Western Combine. Of course, I think most of you know we acquired Oros in Hungary, which manufactures corn heads. And currently, we do corn headers and sunflower seeds in Hungary with distribution in North America through Harvestec and then in Europe under Oros. Last area of complementary product portfolio. I mean, this really extends the ag product portfolio that we have in the product lines and certainly, Linda highlighted this as well, starts to be able to share some technologies, geographies, technology through potential crossover distribution channels that obviously we'll have to factor in and think through as we develop our strategy for growth there. The long history. I mean, again, just highlighting this. During the 1980s, owned White Farm; basically during the '90s, produced combines, actually down on the left there, for Massey Ferguson; and then in that time frame, acquires Oros in Hungary, where we manufacture corn heads; and then currently, basically before this transaction, got product lines in corn headers and sunflower harvesting equipment under the brand names of Harvestec and Oros; and now today with this great announcement, have MacDon as our future catalyst that will really take us forward into the future. The complementary product lines, I think this is a pretty interesting slide here. When you look at Oros, Harvestec on the top there under the green harvesting, the checkmark is what we have without MacDon. And then adding in MacDon is a great product portfolio. Check the marks on drapers, pickups and rotary mower heads. And really, this combine business covers a wide crop range of harvesting product lines, as Linda mentioned, wheat, canola, beans, soybeans and other product lines like that as well. When you look at -- this is on basically a segmented basis, the Powertrain/Driveline, which is very familiar with on the left, at the top section, and then moving to the right top section now with Industrial adding really significant size. The Ag business there really taking us up to about 10% in that area on the ag sales. And at the bottom, you see the revenue base on the pie chart, standalone and pro forma on the sales revenue base and then moving over to the EBITDA standalone versus the pro forma. So really just some complementary growth and a really good focus on the growth side as well. With that, I'm going to hand it over to Mark. MARK STODDART, CTO, EVP OF SALES & MARKETING AND NON-INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR, LINAMAR CORPORATION: Thanks, Jim. Good afternoon, everyone. Just a little bit on the products. And as mentioned earlier, MacDon is an industry leader with the FlexDraper, they are #1 in North America; the Rigid Draper, they're also #1; and with the self-propelled windrowers in the mid-horsepower range, they are also #1. They are, as mentioned, an innovative leader. They have well over -- currently have well over 100 patents right now and another 30 some-odd patents that are pending. They have a total of around 110 dedicated product development people in the product engineering group. Looking at some of the innovations around some of the products. On the FlexDraper, one of the unique things about this product is the higher cutting speeds, that the design of header units of being flexible over the terrain of the soil allows for reduced seed losses. And also, the unit has a higher capacity to bring more of the crop into the combine. On the self-propelled windrowers, they are an industry leader in load speed as product travels on the roads to get from the various fields. And they do have some very unique technology that allows it to move fairly quickly on the roads. Very improved operator comfort and interface with the unit. On the hay products, they have market-leading in regards to the transport system on this unit, and they've recently improved the flow for crops and also the formation in the windrowers. As we talked about already, significant growth potential and upside opportunities for internal expansion. As we mentioned, MacDon is pretty focused around North America but does have a fair bit globally, obviously tapping into Linamar's existing manufacturing in Europe and in Asia. We're currently doing fabrication work in our Hungarian plant. So we've got some well-established operations that MacDon can benefit from. MacDon also has a global reach, and we talk a bit about that, but their dealers of over 1,400 dealers and sales of parts globally, which could again benefit for us. On the product line side, we continue to expand and see great opportunities with MacDon as they expand their product range and can look to see what we currently have in regards to our own product range. One of the big areas that we see some great opportunities for expansion is in the parts marketing. Back in 2012, they acquired Westward Parts Distribution, a very well-run operation, and we think could have some benefits for Skyjack. And then on the operation side, obviously Linamar is a leader in manufacturing. And one of the areas we see is incorporating our lean philosophies and working with the employees to make improvements. And we see that as a benefit for MacDon, and we see that there is definitely a lot in sharing technology and distribution networks for both the Ag and the Industrial side. And with that, I will -- oh, sorry, one more. As you've just seen -- just trying to hurry things up. As you've seen -- as many of you have seen, we have an outlook report. So we've adjusted it now to include the ag. And as mentioned earlier, we see really some good growth here in North America. The industry has been in a bit of a downturn for the last several years, but we've seen inventories get fairly depleted. And really throughout 2017, dealers have been starting to restock, and we see this momentum continue out through 2018. Likewise in Europe, we see some moderate growth; and Asia, flat. But again, as we mentioned, MacDon's largest area is North America. So we do see a lot of opportunities for growth. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dale. DALE SCHNEIDER, CFO, LINAMAR CORPORATION: Thanks, Mark. Good afternoon, everyone. Just to look at some of the financial numbers. As Linda mentioned, they do have a very strong EBITDA margin in the 20% to 25% range, which is much better than the peer group numbers you can see there in the 12% range. From a CapEx point of view, they are similar to Skyjack in that they are not a capital-intensive business and tend to be, like Skyjack, a good generator of cash flows. And as a result, you'll see high single-digit EPS and free cash flow accretion in the first 2 years. We do see some moderate synergies from a procurement point of view, leveraging the distribution networks, as Mark had mentioned. And looking at what we can do from an engineering side as well and also looking at it from a Skyjack distribution point of view, it could have some benefits to us as well. From a price point of view, we do think it is a fair deal. As Linda mentioned, the past 12 months EBITDA multiple is in the 7.8 range, and it is a little better than the median precedents and current trading multiples. So we think it was a very fair deal. Looking at it from a balance sheet point of view. As you know, Linamar has always maintained a very conservative balance sheet. We have, in the past, levered up for strategic reasons. And you've seen that in the past, where you see [presented] back in 2016, we levered up to get the ['16] transition business and we levered up in 2016 as well by the Montupet casting business and then have been working on quickly deleveraging those scenarios. And we see this modeling out very similarly. We'll lever up to 1.7x and we will delever rather rapidly over the next 18 to 24 months. A lot of people know that Linamar has had a very solid growth plan. We have a very high CAGR in both revenues and earnings. But I don't think everybody necessarily understands how much of that has been done through M&A in addition to the organic growth we've seen. So if you look at it from back in 2001 when we had about $1.2 billion in revenue, we are now at $7.1 billion. EBITDA has grown by almost $1 billion in the same time period, really being driven by a few -- from the M&A side from a few key acquisitions, going back to Skyjack in 2001. So we got really into some of the fabrication and assembly work we were doing with telehandlers. 2015, we bought our Forging businesses, mainly the Seissenschmidt forging group. In 2016, as we mentioned, we got into the Light Metal Casting through the acquisition of Montupet as they're one of the largest aluminum casters of sonar heads. And now once again, another large but a good acquisition with Montupet, we'll continue to drive that growth -- MacDon, sorry. If we look at it from a trading multiples point of view, Linamar trades -- if you look at enterprise value versus next year's EBITDA and from a price earnings point of view versus next year, we're in the 4.5 to 5 on enterprise value and around 7.8x on the price. If you look at it from a peer group point of view of just purely autos, we are slightly under that. If we look at it from an industrial point of view, so the Skyjack business, most of those trade in the double-digit enterprise value/EBITDA almost 11x and price earnings is almost 20x. So when you look at it from adding in the (inaudible) group who has an enterprise value/EBITDA in the 10x and the price to EPS in the 19x, we think this will track a much higher multiple for Linamar overall and drive more value to our shareholders. So just to summarize everything we talked about from a Linamar perspective, we believe this will help us enhance our entire global manufacturing business. We are adding an excellent company who has an industry-leading business. They are a technology and innovation leader, as we've talked about. We do see significant growth in the business, especially when you look at outside of North America. And we're buying at the right time where the ag market is just starting to recover. So there's also growth opportunities there (inaudible). And as I just went through, it's a financially attractive transaction. So those are my comments, and we'll open up to questions. Questions and Answers OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Mark Neville from Scotiabank. MARK NEVILLE, ANALYST, SCOTIABANK GLOBAL BANKING AND MARKETS, RESEARCH DIVISION: Just, I guess, several questions. First, can you just give sort of a sales breakdown by geography just to understand where they're selling this product? LINDA S. HASENFRATZ: Yes. The majority is in North America. So we flipped through a slide that showed the breakdown of the distribution network. So that's well representative of the actual sales split between Europe, North America. And then there's a small slice there for the OEM -- that we sell to OEMs. So that piece is -- we're not splitting out geographically but it's a smaller chunk. So you can see on that pie chart about 75% North America distribution network and about 14% international. And then the 10% OEM is split out amongst that. MARK NEVILLE: At the North American business, is that primarily the U.S.? LINDA S. HASENFRATZ: U.S. and Canada. DALE SCHNEIDER: It's split. It's split both. MARK NEVILLE: Okay, okay. I guess just in the international expansion, I guess that sounds like where the upside could come from. Would that require significant investments in facilities or manufacturing on your part? Or could you do that on your existing network or your existing footprint? LINDA S. HASENFRATZ: We would do that in the existing footprint. I mean, obviously just like with Skyjack, we used the footprint here in Canada to serve most of our global markets. And once we get up to a significant level of sales outside of -- significant -- enough level of sales in some of these other regions, then we might consider local manufacturing. But that's a long, long, long ways away in terms of getting up to enough volume for that. MARK NEVILLE: Okay. And then I guess just in terms of -- and I get the diversification you talked about. But just any benefits that can be derived from combining this with your existing businesses? Can you maybe just touch on that? LINDA S. HASENFRATZ: Yes. We definitely think that there's opportunity certainly in terms of our Agricultural business that already exist in Hungary. So we will certainly combine the 2 and look to find opportunities there. There could even be some opportunities with Skyjack and their business, particularly in Europe. JIM JARRELL: I think there's synergies on manufacturing and purchasing that drive really closely with Skyjack because they have a similar type of manufacturing processes. And certainly when you look at the branding and the distribution channels, obviously that's something we have to investigate. But there is a lot of distribution channels as well. And certainly, Skyjack, one of [the areas] for European telehandlers can we then embark on that globally as well. MARK NEVILLE: Okay. And then one last one. I mean, you touched on it, Dale, just on multiples and sort of where you're trading and where your comps are trading. I guess just arguably, now you're not really getting credit for the Skyjack business. Just wondering, you add an Ag business again. I appreciate it's a higher multiple business and it's probably a fair price. But again, if you're just sort of worried that again you don't get credit for it and the multiple stays low and just your thoughts on that. LINDA S. HASENFRATZ: Well, I mean, frankly, we think that sum of the part valuation is a better way to look at Linamar. I mean, we've long felt that way about our Industrial business and then only add to that. So I mean, clearly, these businesses have a lot of value. They've got great growth volume. Look at Skyjack, perfect example. We've grown it 6x what it was when we acquired it. And it creates an enormous amount of value. So totally agree, Skyjack, the multiples in that sector are a lot higher, in the 8 to 10x range. Same in the ag space. So we'd love to see you valuing those pieces of our business that way. OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Paige from Gabelli. MATTHEW T. PAIGE, RESEARCH ANALYST, G. RESEARCH, LLC: I guess maybe could you first start off by talking about how you found MacDon? And why are they selling? JIM JARRELL: Yes. We've known MacDon for several years. And as I mentioned at the beginning, we've done a lot of investigation in regards to product lines that would be complementary to what we do over at Oros, and they were also a customer to us as well. And so that's how we originally got to know them. And then when we created our Vision 2100, we really thought we would focus in on this area to add product line to our Ag business. So obviously, MacDon was the key one. And the reason they're selling is their father, Joseph Allen MacDonald (sic) [Joseph Andrew MacDonald ) who ran the company, had 4 sons, and the 4 sons are -- have been in the business and did an outstanding job and made a plan about 8 years ago to have succession. And they brought in a professional management group several years back, which are excellent, the guys I refer to, and have been looking at this divestiture on and off for a few years. And quite frankly, we've been talking to them as well. And the timing was right for both companies in the past 12 weeks to make that deal happen. MATTHEW T. PAIGE: Got it. And you also mentioned that the leadership of the company has been great in the past. Are there people in the management at MacDon that are staying with Linamar now? JIM JARRELL: Yes, absolutely. There is the key, Gary, who's the CEO, President. They've got the CFO. They've got [Jim], who's the marketing guy. They've got [John], the engineering. Yes, and they've got that whole leadership group that are staying. And quite frankly, we want them to stay. And so of course, from a succession perspective, we need to know who's in succession behind those folks. But yes, that's our intention. MATTHEW T. PAIGE: Got it. And from a product perspective, can you speak to the target customer of the self-propelled windrower and how that come compares with that of combine? MARK STODDART: Yes, it really is the same. It just depends upon the geographical region and the product that you're harvesting. LINDA S. HASENFRATZ: Typically, you sell these products through your distribution network directly to the farmers. So we are not selling -- some small percentage, we sell to the OEMs, yes. But most of it is being sold through distribution directly to the farmers. So a farmer would buy the combine, and then they would buy their choice of harvesting equipment that would go along with that. So our FlexDrapers and Rigid Drapers would fit right onto the front of another manufacturer's combine, and that's sort of how the market works. MATTHEW T. PAIGE: Got it. Okay. And then the last question for me is you mentioned that the sum of the parts is the best way to look at Linamar. Have you considered any sort of financial engineering to better bring that value out to the market? LINDA S. HASENFRATZ: Well, at the moment, no. We're happy with the way the businesses are running. We're continuing to grow the businesses and scale that. The way that they're currently in the organization makes the most sense for us. OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Michael Glen from Macquarie. MICHAEL W. GLEN, ANALYST, MACQUARIE RESEARCH: Can you just give the rough size and revenue and maybe the EBITDA of your current agricultural business? LINDA S. HASENFRATZ: Oh, it's quite small. It's one small facility, less than $100 million in sales. So we mainly focus on corn heads in that facility, a few other products, but their major products from an ag perspective would be the corn heads. So it's a pretty small business today, but we think maybe alongside MacDon, we can see some good growth potential in that product. We certainly look forward to the MacDon team's insights and expertise in helping us to strategize around that. MICHAEL W. GLEN: Okay. And then the range on EBITDA margins was pretty wide at 20% to 25%. Like what's sort of the appropriate range that we should think about using as we try to model this business going forward? LINDA S. HASENFRATZ: Well, I mean, as noted, the $1.2 billion purchase price is a 7.8 multiple last 12-month EBITDA. So I think that gives you a pretty good sense for at least where they've been at in the last 12 months. We'd like to stick with the range because, I mean, obviously, markets go up and down and businesses was up and down. So I don't want to give you a promise on what we're going to deliver year in, year out. So I think it's good that you get a sense for the range, and you've got a pretty accurate figure for the last 12 months. MICHAEL W. GLEN: Okay. And sorry, I'm having some difficulties actually looking at the presentation through the WebEx. But what is the LTM sales number exactly? LINDA S. HASENFRATZ: $600 million. MICHAEL W. GLEN: It's $600 million. And are you able to give an idea of what's the organic growth rate for the company over the past, call it, 2 or 3 years? LINDA S. HASENFRATZ: Yes. High single digits, sort of mid -- let's say mid- to high single digit in the last 5 years and a similar kind of outlook in probably a little more high single digit for the next 5. MICHAEL W. GLEN: Okay. And then as we think about Linamar now as a company, I mean, balancing where we see you allocate capital between automotive, the Skyjack business and Agriculture, are these the 3 segments that you're going to focus on? Or should we think about you adding more segments? And what segment do you intend to focus on more going forward? LINDA S. HASENFRATZ: Yes. So I mean, obviously we're going to be focusing on digesting this acquisition and really understanding and growing this agricultural business. With respect to capital allocation between the 3 businesses, the good news is both Skyjack and the Agriculture business are quite light -- lightly capital intensive. In fact, they're great cash generators in comparison to our capital -- very capital-intensive Powertrain/Driveline business, which is a big part of what we like about having the balance of the 2 businesses. They're very complementary from a financial and balance sheet perspective. So it's not like we're going to have to make a lot of decisions around where are we going to invest. With respect to other markets, as we talked about in our long-term plan, there are other markets that we think are interesting to grow into. We're still in the research and sort of strategy building phase around those segments. But they are areas that longer term, over the next 5 to 10 years, that you will start to see us expand more into. But right now, these 3 markets are great markets, lots of growth opportunity and will be our primary focus in the next several years. MICHAEL W. GLEN: And this was -- on the sale of the company, this was a competitive process that was held? LINDA S. HASENFRATZ: The brothers have looked at selling the business certainly several times in the past, evaluated more than one potential buyer, and we are just thrilled that we were able to come together with them and come to an agreement this year. OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from David Tyerman from Cormark Securities. DAVID BRUCE TYERMAN, ANALYST OF INSTITUTIONAL EQUITY RESEARCH, CORMARK SECURITIES INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: My first question is just on the synergies. Can you give us any sense of what they are? It sounded like they were small but... LINDA S. HASENFRATZ: Yes. I mean, modest synergies because they're quite different businesses, right? So as Jim was talking about some opportunities on the purchasing side probably by -- if they're buying a lot of similar things to what Skyjack might be buying. We think there's opportunities in taking our own manufacturing expertise and maybe bringing some ideas to the table there and synergies in combination with our existing agricultural business will be sort of high-level buckets. JIM JARRELL: Yes. And there might be part distribution ideas like that as well. But really manufacturing, maybe cross-channel distribution, purchasing and parts could be the areas of synergies. DAVID BRUCE TYERMAN: Do you think this can add up to $10 million or $20 million within a couple of years? Or... LINDA S. HASENFRATZ: We haven't put a dollar value on it, David. We think there's opportunities there, and we're going to certainly dive in to see what we can find. This isn't something with massive synergies, so we haven't put a dollar number on it. DAVID BRUCE TYERMAN: Right. And just on the sales growth, I think you said at the start, Linda, or somewhere early on that sales have run between $550 million and $650 million per year over the last 5 years. LINDA S. HASENFRATZ: Yes. DAVID BRUCE TYERMAN: So is there actually a trend there like a growth trend? Or is it more that's going up and down with the market, the ag market? LINDA S. HASENFRATZ: I mean, there is a growth, a long-term growth trend. The ag business has been in a bit of a down cycle over the last few years. So if you look at the last 5 years, it's probably not the most representative of the growth potential of a company. The good news is we're coming out of that cyclical low. So the market should be picking up. And our target, as described, is to grow global market share. So we should therefore see some more robust growth. DAVID BRUCE TYERMAN: Okay. And sorry, you're saying... JIM JARRELL: Sorry, David. I was just going to say as well, if you think it through the cycle and you've got everybody sort of talking 5%, 10%, John Deere is saying that in the ag and turf, really this is really going to come back to the technology and how a farmer perceives the technology and use it. And that's where MacDon really comes in. And a lot of their growth potential is still not tapped to replenish some of those implements that are out there. So that's a lot of the growth aspect as well we see. DAVID BRUCE TYERMAN: Right. Okay. So something like 5 to 10 for the next 12 sounds like the best guess. LINDA S. HASENFRATZ: Yes. As I say, high single digit, I think, is a good estimation. DAVID BRUCE TYERMAN: Okay. And then is there seasonality to this business? JIM JARRELL: Yes. It's similar to like what Skyjack has in that the first half of the year is fairly active. DAVID BRUCE TYERMAN: Okay. Okay. And any thoughts on NAFTA? And if they're manufacturing is in Winnipeg, is that going to be an issue? If there are... LINDA S. HASENFRATZ: Yes. Obviously, the NAFTA question is on a lot of people's minds for a lot of different businesses. I think that first of all, if NAFTA goes away for all businesses, the natural expectation will be to revert to WTO, which is, what, 2% or 3%. But the expectation for MacDon is it would fall under the most favored nation principle, which should, for agriculture equipment, result in a 0 tariff. DAVID BRUCE TYERMAN: Okay. That's helpful. And then the last question, I guess, or comment is on the sum of parts. So it's a great idea. We would need some breakout though to do that, like EBITDA at the segment level. And presumably, we need to break Ag from Skyjack. Have you given any thoughts about if you want to go down the sum of parts approach? LINDA S. HASENFRATZ: Yes. I think that the good news is that the financial metrics of the 2 businesses are pretty similar. So you don't necessarily need -- and the multiples in the industry are pretty similar for both the ag and the access. So I think that it's fine to leave them together and you can assess them in that way. OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Todd Coupland from CIBC. TODD ADAIR COUPLAND, MD OF INSTITUTIONAL EQUITY RESEARCH, CIBC CAPITAL MARKETS, RESEARCH DIVISION: I just had a couple of financial questions. What is the rate -- interest rate on the new debt line? DALE SCHNEIDER: It's in line with our existing debt. TODD ADAIR COUPLAND: Okay. And what will be the rough depreciation and amortization against the EBITDA? LINDA S. HASENFRATZ: Depreciation and amortization is pretty low, sort of 1% or 2% and the reason being that CapEx, as I mentioned, is pretty low as well. So it's not a big player. Similar to Skyjack. OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Neville from Scotiabank. MARK NEVILLE: I just want to dig a little deeper into the, I guess, international expansion. How quickly, that something you can (inaudible) after? How exactly would you do it against? It sounds like you would continue to manufacturing in Winnipeg. And I guess you would need to set up some sort of distribution network in Europe. So I guess I was just curious as to when that happens. And when do you think you'll be doing the steps you would need to do that, I guess? JIM JARRELL: Yes. They do sell internationally today. They do have plans for Europe already and they've set up a business in Europe. So really now setting up a distribution -- further distribution network and dealership. In regards to local manufacturing over there, we really haven't pursued that as of yet. That's something we need to do. Obviously, we can leverage off of both. We have the manufacturing and fabrication (inaudible) capabilities. So from a time perspective, we really don't have that nailed down yet, but we have that immediate site. MARK NEVILLE: Sorry, what did you say you had in your -- not the Oros but the -- I think you'd be hosting... JIM JARRELL: They have set up a business structure there, and they do sell into Europe today. So they have taken steps to start Europe already, and now that's what we're going to help leverage. MARK NEVILLE: And what they're selling in Europe is being manufactured in Winnipeg? JIM JARRELL: Yes, it is. OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line once again of Michael Glen from Macquarie. MICHAEL W. GLEN: I apologize. I can't look at the presentation. So you said that sales were $600 million, and the -- if you use -- the $1.2 billion was the entire enterprise value for the transaction? LINDA S. HASENFRATZ: $1.2 billion is, yes, the transaction cost, which represents 7.8x EBITDA. MICHAEL W. GLEN: So the LTM margin then is kind of close to 25% right now on an EBITDA basis? LINDA S. HASENFRATZ: Correct. Yes. MICHAEL W. GLEN: Okay. And so is that then -- I'm just trying to assess that in terms of your guidance on the 20% to 25% then. Are we effectively at peak margin right now for the business? LINDA S. HASENFRATZ: Yes. I mean, I was talking about the historical level. So yes, I mean, we're at the higher end of the margin range today. MICHAEL W. GLEN: Okay. And so we should maintain that level then? LINDA S. HASENFRATZ: I think that's a realistic expectation. OPERATOR: We have no further questions at this time. I turn the call back to the presenters. LINDA S. HASENFRATZ: Okay, great. Thank you very much. Well, as usually, I'd like to leave you with 3 key messages. First, we're really excited about this great opportunity to expand our agricultural business with an innovative market leader like MacDon. Diversification is an important growth strategy for us. Second, we are very happy with the financial performance and outlook of MacDon. This is a strong, well-managed company, which is delivering earnings that will be immediately accretive to our bottom line. Our outlook for 2018 is now for strong double-digit growth, top and bottom line. And finally, despite the size of the transaction, we feel the resultant leverage of 1.7x EBITDA still leaves us with a very strong balance sheet, which we expect to rapidly delever further over the next 18 to 24 months to less than 1x. It's a strong company, great growth, great diversification and innovation and altogether makes a very great deal. Thanks very much, and good evening. OPERATOR: This concludes today's conference.

I'm John Kraus, I'm the Director of Investor Relations, actually the first full-time Director of Investor Relations for The Andersons. I'm a 30-year employee at The Andersons. Spent the first half of my career directing our tax function and after that, moved to lead our accounting and finance organization in our Rail group. So really happy to have you here. I am, I guess, the master of ceremonies. You didn't come to hear me, you came to hear our senior management team and they're all here today, which is actually, we have found a feat. We sometimes need to get to New York to get them all together. So I have a couple -- and I just don't have the clicker. Oh, Pat's got the clicker, thank you. I have a couple of just housekeeping items to take care of. First of all, I think you'll all be happy to hear that we're going to make some forward-looking statements today and you're all familiar with the safe harbors that go with that. And so we want to -- just want to have you spend a moment or two in your books, taking a look at that information. I also want to point out that we have -- we'll make some references to some non-GAAP measures and there's some information in the back of your books that reconciles the non-GAAP measures to some GAAP measures, for those of you who are interested in that kind of information. With that, I'd like to just quickly go over the agenda for today. The day is basically 6 presentations, the first one by our CEO, Pat Bowe, followed by a couple of our group presidents presenting. Then we'll take a break for Q&A and then a little refreshment break. We'll come back, we'll do the presentations for the 2 other groups and then John Granato, our CFO will finish up with the finance organization. We'll do another Q&A presentation and then we'll adjourn to the room on my left, your right, for lunch. And we'd really like to invite you to stay for lunch. That will give you an opportunity to have some good one-on-one time or more private time to ask questions you might not want to ask in this setting. We do have also -- I want to welcome our web audience. We are webcasting this live. And web participants are also going to be able to ask questions, which will be minor during the course of the day. And so hopefully, we'll have a chance to answer some of those as well. With that, I'd like to start by showing you a little more about The Andersons. (presentation) PATRICK E. BOWE, PRESIDENT, CEO & DIRECTOR, THE ANDERSONS, INC.: As a season for many of you the next couple of weeks and making time and some of you traveling from out of town to be here is really greatly appreciated. We're super excited to be here at the leadership team of Anderson to tell our story. We've had a lot going on the last couple years and we thought, this was a very perfect time to do this. So I've just hit the 2-year mark as the CEO of the Andersons and in that time, we've had a lot of change. We knew we have some tough flooding in some of our markets and we had to make some tough decisions, worked on our portfolio and rationed some assets, downsized some people in the process, and also had some growth opportunities that we've been pursuing. So we also have change of leadership that's happening right now. We're having a couple retirements, the group President, so you'll hear more about that later, who our new Presidents are and the transition we're going through right now, so we're excited. This was a good time to share our story with all of you. Oops. There we go. So what I wanted to start with, many of you I've met before but a little bit -- we're all going to do a little introduction about ourselves. In the back of the book, we have bios on all the senior leaders of the company, so you can read about that. My background comes from I'm an ag guy, as they say, right? So my father was in the grain business, and miniature Andersons, if you will. So he ran a grain elevator and sold seed and fertilizer in Stockton, California, the central valley of California for over 40 years, owned and operated that company, which is still going today 120-year-old company. And so the [kind of] the DNA little bit was around I am not a farmer, so I didn't have dirt under my nails, but around trading most my life. I want to college at Stanford and played football there, did a brief stint with the Green Bay Packers before I went to work for Louis Dreyfus, another grain trading company and was located in Springfield, Illinois. And when I was there in the early '80s, I traded grain everyday with this company called The Andersons, and they were one of our biggest suppliers at that time for export to the East Coast and to the Gulf. And so I have this great respect for the Anderson family, the traders who worked there, and they just had a really unique esprit de corps amongst employees and always thought highly of the Andersons. Fast forward, I went back to Stanford for grad school and get a Master's at the food research Institute, which sounds like you're learning to flip hamburgers, that's not what it is. It's kind of an ag business policy, focused mostly on the futures markets and went to work straight to the Board of trade for there for Cargill. I worked for 30 years for Cargill in a myriad of roles. We moved 8 to 10 times, lived in Latin American and Brazil and all around the Midwest, manufacturing, running plants, sales, sales management, and spent 8 years as the President of the U.S. Corn Wet Milling business, about a $6 billion domestic business. And in the last 8 years at Cargill was the Corporate VP of our Food Ingredients platform. With other colleagues, we ran a $30 billion business in some 30 countries, so a lot of travel and fun involved in that. Then I got a phone call one day. And when you all get phone calls, I mean I didn't usually pay attention. They said hey, we're looking for someone to be the CEO of The Andersons. Go back 30 years, last time I was in Toledo, Ohio was at the Andersons farm in Maumee for the Toledo board and trade picnic. And I said, wow that's a great company and I wanted to listen and find out about it. And what I thought was, I knew ag was going to have a tough time. We have had the ag super cycle, if you want to call it from '11 to '14, really good time for all of us in ag space. I knew it was coming off and came off pretty hard. I saw that the Andersons' stock had fallen from $60 to $25. And I thought hey, it's time for a change and maybe I can be the change agent at The Andersons to really make the turnaround happen. I had experience with that before because when I took over the corn milling job, the business had slumped dramatically in the '90s with too much capacity. And over 8 years there, we tripled the top line from $2 billion to $6 billion, and took a tenfold increase in earnings from $25 million to $250 million. So I've been part of turnarounds, doing tough things. We laid off 10% of our workforce the first year, that wasn't the most popular of things. I kind of knew what that would take and knew that The Andersons was a perfect opportunity for me because of the ethics and the values of the company. So when you talk to anyone in the grain, rail, ethanol, fertilizer business, talking about The Andersons, they are quality people. Their words are bond, they always back it up with what they say. And that's the kind of company I want to work for. In our local community, in some way The Andersons are almost worshiped. They've had generations of giving back to the community and that's a fun place to work I'll tell you. And you can't build that overnight and a lot of companies lose it pretty quickly. You've known many of us falling from grace. So it's something we cherish and think about, that's something we don't want to change. What we do what a change in other ways, we're going to talk about today. So thanks for listening a little bit to my background. With that, I'd share a story with and I'll start off with the kind of some key messages you're going to hear throughout the day. It's a little bit of a theme. One, I've told you about this well-respected legacy we have. Also said we're in the early innings of a recovery. So for you baseball fans here, you kind of get what early innings is. You pick the inning, and I don't know if it's second or third but we're beginning to feel like we're getting the starts of a turnaround in our business. You're going to meet some new leaders today. It's an interesting time when I came to the company of the senior leadership team of 10, 9 were in their 60s. There's nothing wrong with being 60, being 59 myself, but we had several people that are approaching retirement. It's just kind of a natural progression, and The Andersons grew dramatically and all these leaders built this company to where it is, and it's great that they can go out with a great retirement at the right time. And so we knew that coming and we had some succession gaps. And so we brought in some outside talent and I'll tell you more about that later. But that's some of -- a part of what we're going to share today. We've also been proactively managing the key performance drivers. So in ag markets, those of you who follow ag know we have cycles, right? And so, what do you do when you have tough cycles? You focus on what you can control. And we were after our cost, our efficiency, productivity, having the right people in the right places, and that's kind of what we can control. We have a very solid balance sheet. Good news, we have several of our banker friends in the room here who are great support to us. But we have available free cash flow to grow the company. Even in this dip of this tough cycle we've been in, we still have a strong balance sheet and have the ability to invest and grow the company. We've also been -- big focus -- I come, I quoted, for a long time in plants and operations. First thing I hit the ground was safety, big improvement on safety we need to make to be world class and 0 if possible. And we've had great strides already. Also on productivity, setting productivity targets for the company, for the businesses, for each group, for each location, and measuring those metrics. And then we also worked on our portfolio. And we'll share a little bit more about that later. We had to turn some assets that weren't performing for us, or locations that didn't look like they had a growth path. And lastly, just build on that value system I talked about but also drive a cultural transformation of accountability. So we can deliver and if you're a salesmen, you have goals, you have targets, they have to hit those targets. Our plan has expectations on yield and production for the day, and those are your key objectives you need to hit. So we've been pushing that throughout the organization so it can be faster, nimbler and more agile, which is part of the focus we've been putting together. Here are the 5 things at the corporate level throughout each of the business President's presentations. For some of you who know our company very well, and a couple of you may just be new to it, an at-a-glance look at the company, some basic facts and figures. We were founded in 1947 by Harold Anderson, and the company was under private ownership as the Anderson family grew. And there's a lot of Andersons, those of you who know us. And they are a very entrepreneurial bunch, who built this company up and then went public 21 years ago. In fact, I had the great pleasure a year ago to be here with Mike Anderson where we got to ring the NASDAQ bell for our 20th anniversary. I was really disappointed, I'd always seen it on TV where you bring the big board bell. When you got to NASDAQ, it's a little studio, it's all like fake, everyone can see the difference. Still cool, still cool. Some big numbers and you're going to learn more from our group Presidents here later, but the $55 million in Grain and $40 million in Plant Nutrition and $45 million ethanol and $62 in Rail, all were a top 10 player in each of our industries. So The Andersons is not a small little sleepy Maumee, Ohio grain company. This company is a significant player in each of our 4 industries that we play in. We have 1,900 employees. I'll share with you later, we trimmed that quite a bit, mainly with the closing of our retail stores. Our market cap has been up over $1 billion and now under $1 billion. And our headquarters is in Maumee, Ohio just outside of Toledo. So I'm going to cover this a little bit later, but we have a dividend history of 21 years of consecutive increasing dividends, so we're excited about that history where we can return our cash back to our shareholders. We also have a strong portfolio of assets. So when you're in these asset-intensive commodity businesses like we're in, you have to have these geographic strongholds where you can win. And you think about the Grain business, where no one player, think about the biggest players in agriculture and grain, has even 10% of the U.S. grain storage capacity, so it's have a foothold where you can be strong. That foothold for the Andersons, started by Harold Anderson, was Maumee Ohio. So why would you be in Maumee, Ohio? People have asked me, Maumee, Ohio? First of all, what kind of name is that? Is it M-O-M-M-Y or how do you spell it? Maumee is right on the Maumee River, which feeds into Lake Erie, and is a delivery point for the Chicago Board of Trade. So historically, in the Grain business were in Chicago and Toledo. And those who manage the space in Chicago and Toledo had the best insight to what was going on in the grain markets. And remember, the Great Lakes, exports especially in the Russian grain deal time was a big factor in U.S. exports. We still are a major exporter out of Maumee and Toledo. We manage not only homes, export asset, you saw the video of loading the boats, as well as we run cargoes assets there. And so that's why we're in Maumee, Ohio because we buy all the grain from the farmers in the north east, an important region of the Eastern Grain Belt, and ship it out there. Wow, gee, we should sell them fertilizer too, that's a nice plan. And then comes the ethanol boom and people are going to build their ethanol plants in your backyard and buy grain away from us. The Andersons had great foresight and said let's build the ethanol plant, and we'll run the ethanol plant and we'll buy the grain. And thank God, that decision was made because that helped protect our grain and fertilizer footprint. And we built that business up to be one of the top players in the Ethanol industry. And then we have our Rail business, Rash Shah, you're going to hear from later, built this business from scratch. The Andersons could handle ship railcars in the business. And you know, we're maintaining them, we're fixing them, why don't we run this thing as a business? And you look today, we're a top 10 player in the country. It's been a great tribute to Rash and how much he's poured his heart and soul into growing this business to be really successful. So when you talk about 550 million bushels of grain traded or 150 million bushels of storage that we have in our assets, 475 million gallons of ethanol, 23,000 railcars or 2 million tons of fertilizer, these are not insignificant numbers. So I've said we're well known in the industry, we're trying to be -- where can we be smart in our backyard to grow and have the biggest future for our businesses? So we talked about the backyard, the map of the United States, I mentioned the Maumee river and Lake Erie. Our footprint from grain, as I mentioned, really is the Eastern Corn Belt. Those of you in the industry know that. That's Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan. And we are a significant player. If not the biggest, one of the biggest players in those markets. We also have facilities around the country. We have food assets in Grain up in Canada, and in Texas and in Nebraska, we have rail shops all over the country. There 19 now with Rash. Is that the right number? And he keeps adding them, so we have -- we go to where the car is flowing and need repair. So we're always looking for opportunities to improve and grow in our location for our rail shops. So the question we get asked a lot, how can you get these 4 businesses? How do they connect? I'm not sure -- I mean, you have these entrepreneurial people, The Andersons, who have built out these individual businesses. I didn't say about the businesses they started and closed, our Seed Milling businesses and other businesses The Andersons started and decided that wasn't the right place. But these 4, we feel can all win in the long term, and all 4 of these businesses have legs for growth. So the world is needing to be fed, the plants are going to need to be fertilized and the products will need to be moved, and we're going to need to fuel our cars. We think these are all fundamental businesses, there's not a lot of faddish in them. They have some cycles, they have some ups and downs, but these are long-term, sustainable, big asset businesses. So you obviously can follow the trail from the farmer who we work with on a daily basis, helping them to understand how he can get the most out of his production of his row of crops. And John Granato will share more later about what we do in fertilizer as a consultant to our key farmer customers and our key retail distribution dealers who are really important in that business. That moves right through to the Grain business, right? And we're the grain people, we buy it straight from that same farmer in many cases in a broad range of farmers all around the Midwest, where we work with them on supply them risk management solutions. One thing we're good at is trading and risk management. One thing the farmer is great at is production and we're helping him market his crops. And by using some of the tools, we work with him with crop insurance and our futures backed products, he could really be more successful for his own income. And then some of the corn flows right into our ethanol plants, our 3 plants in the East and 1 plant we acquired in Denison, Iowa. So you get that flow and then you know we use railcars to put grain in, to put ethanol in and haul fertilizer in, but that business has grown to be a much bigger business, I said 23,000 cars in a very diversified portfolio, a little bit more of a GDP driven business. So we like it as a hedge. You'll see in our earnings later when we have ag cycle going down the last 5 years, Rail performed pretty darn well. And so that's kind of a nice balancing effect for our portfolio, and so that's why we like to fit. In our insights in Grain, Fertilizer and Ethanol, are very helpful to the Rail team as a big portion of their fleet is in those exact industries. So messaging in today, how do we leverage this solid foundation we talked about? So we talked about this culture, focus on OpEx and safety, on skills and merchandising, logistics, plant operations, and a strong portfolio and balance sheet. We need to move that forward to be competitive drivers of success in the future. So this brand loyalty to the customer, in many cases, the farmer, is easy to lose. And I always like to say, the farmers are very, very smart individuals. They're also like elephants, they never forget. Because if you ever burn them in a bad trade or give them a bad load of fertilizer, that's something that's hard, to win that trust back. And you know trust for the Andersons with our farm customers has been built now, generation on generation on generation. So many times, we have the grandfather, who first made business with the Andersons and now we are dealing with the grandson. It was applying precision agriculture and new technologies and really wants to partner with us on new ways he can improve. And so it's really exciting to see that stickiness of our customers, that's critical for our success and why we want to be super sharp at the point of attack with our salespeople, that they understand the technology, they understand the farm economics and they bring insights that, that farmer can't get from anyone else, that's what's really important for us. And we've had a history of being a partner that way but the technology keeps changing. So we have -- you'd see video clips from our trading floor every morning. They get pushed out to our farm customers who yesterday, where perhaps, this is amiss and I said, oh yes, they use a PalmPilot. The guys were giving me a hard time and said Pat, that was technology from 30 years ago. And that was a day with all those palm-held devices, all right? So, but they have this in their cabs, they're watching our guys give them commentary about what the futures market is going to do end of the day. Then they go online into our portal at Miami, look through to their -- these are balances and what they were doing. While all this stuff was happening real-time with electronics let alone, you'll hear later about fertilizer, precision agriculture, drone imagery in the farms, how we do variable rates, how we do new technologies to really penetrate the field in the right way. So it's an exciting time in agriculture merging with technology. So this reputation of being nimble, we're not the biggest of the big so we need to be nimbler. We need to be fast and agile, and we want to focus on that. We don't want to be bureaucratic, we want to be right sized, where we can move quickly on opportunities. And we also have a great deal of experience. So one of the best things I found when I came to the Andersons is a really deep subject matter expertise. So people have been doing some of these jobs for 20, 25, 30 years that really know markets really well and everyone in the industry. One guy is a particular expert on nitrogen. Someone's been in our rail leasing business, with every customer going back for 30 years. This is valuable and then this pipeline of merging talents have come into the company and handing that information on and driving that excitement for younger people that are just starting their careers in the company. And gaining that focus and we had some gaps as I mentioned in leadership, that happens, times in the company. And we've brought in some external talent and that's helped them bolster that and keep that team going strong. Speaking of the team, since we are sitting here in the room today, the business unit presidents. Corey for Grain, and John will be covering Plant Nutrient today. And the reason John's covering Plant Nutrient is Bill Wolf, who's been a long time employee in The Anderson and President of the Grains business -- sorry, Fertilizer business for the last several years is retiring this month. So we didn't it made sense for Bill to give a presentation about the future when he's going to be having his retirement plans in January. So John, our CFO, will be covering Plant Nutrient and we have the new President of Plant Nutrient, who was just recently, Jeff Blair in the room. Jeff, could you please stand up? So Jeff's coming to us from Intrepid Potash in Denver, Colorado, where he's the VP of Sales and Marketing, has really deep knowledge about sales and marketing. And one of the key things you heard me talking about was sales in our fertilizer business. But a lot of people who know a lot about fertilizer and Jeff just has that great, unique combination of leadership and commercial skills that we're looking for. And we're really happy to have Jeff on board. It's his first week, so don't light him on questions. Been also a change in management. I mentioned, Rash Shah has been at the leadership position of our Rail business from the beginning and done a phenomenal job. And he's going to have his 40th anniversary with the company this July, and a fitting time to have a great retirement. And we said well, gee, we got to replace this guy with some great emerging talent in that business that Rash has hired and developed, but not quite ready to be the President. So we went to the outside market and someone Rash had known for a long time, Joe McNeely, and Joe's sharing the room with us. Joe is the President and CEO of FreightCar America, a long-standing key contributor in the rail industry. Worked for GATX early in his career. Worked for Mitsui Rail and early on was an accountant and the CFO and CEO. We think it's been a great addition to bring Joe on board and he's starting in January. Joe? And then, the rest of our team, you'll hearing from later, so I won't be introducing the presenters. Two other important staff members here with the company is Val Blanchett. Val's our CHRO and the Head of Human Resources, who her career is really a two-sided career. She spent the first half of her career at Ford Motor Company, had lots of very interesting jobs at huge, big automobile plants and working with unions, and has a good experience with Six Sigma and Lean manufacturing. Had the good fortune hire Val to come to Cargill. And we work together at Cargill for over 12 years, I believe (inaudible) was then? And she was our Head of HR at the Corn Milling business that I ran and then later became the Head of North America Operations or HR Operations for the Food business and so had tons of people that she managed in the U.S. I was able to convince her to come to Maumee. She's a local girl from Monroe, Michigan. So we kind of brought her back home, and great to add Val to the team. And Naran Burchinow, who's sitting right next to her. Naran is our General Counsel, has been 13 years, I believe, in General Counsel. A phenomenal legal partner. So that's a great job and where we have a pretty small legal staff and Naran's involved in everything and very, very helpful to all of us. He's got a great career with us and has been a terrific help to each of our business. Before that, had distinguished career with ITT, which was GE, which was Deutsche Bank, they all have different -- lots of commercial experience is very helpful for us and prior to that, a practicing attorney. So Naran's done a great job running our legal function. And another new member to the group is Srikanth Dasari, who is our Treasurer. Srikanth is just new here in the last few months. Also a great addition to our team, with extensive experience, coming as Treasury from Westinghouse most recently. Before that, worked for Dow Corning. Before that, Owens-Illinois in Toledo, Ohio, where he was a -- got his engineering degree and an MBA. It's a little bit of coming back home also for Srikanth but we're really fortunate to bring talented people to come to work for The Andersons in Maumee, Ohio. And a lot of it is those values and the vision of where we're going that's bringing you here to be part of it. So thanks, everybody, for introductions. So my favorite slide of the whole presentation today, what I'd call the 3 Rs of strategic execution. So the 3 Rs are refocused, reorganized and reenergized. They're all positive growth words. Refocus or say, how do we focus each of the businesses and our individual contributors on how they can get better? Again, what are your metrics? What are your goals for that quarter, that month? How are we helping you get better? We've had a leadership account in, which we take the Leadership Academy where our top, high potential performers in the company are taught this by our leadership team and others help them get better. A lot of companies do that, but it's something that we have done in the last couple of years that's really helping us grow. We want people to really have a higher level of accountability, as I talked about, and a greater emphasis on talent. So talent planning, succession planning, who is in the right spaces, who can move across businesses in the company. We tend to be a little more siloed historically. We made some cross business moves. On the reorganize front, several of you have known about what we've done in the marketplace. We optimize our portfolio, we've had assets that weren't quite performing the way we would have liked from a profitability standpoint. Grain elevators we've acquired in Iowa which were truck houses in Northwest Iowa, we sold. And we also had fertilizer operations in Florida that we sold, and those are assets that we didn't feel had long term growth potential and a path to profitability that met our expectations. We then -- you'd say well, these retail stores, those of you who have ever been to Toledo or Columbus may have heard of The Anderson stores. And while it's not important from a balance sheet perspective, the stores were less than 3% of our top line revenue as a company, it was a big visible presence in our local community. And people loved The Anderson stores, right? It's kind of a cult following. So they had one problem, they didn't make money and we also employed quite a bit of people, so 1,200 people, most of those are part-time, 800 part-time. And the first act as a new the CEO in hometown is not to lay off 1,200 people, that's usually not the first thing you want to do. But I hired outside consultants. God, what can we do? Shall we partner, can we make them smaller, can we keep one? And we just added the best thing for us to do was to close the stores in a very proper way, given our employees lots of notice with retraining and repurposing, and almost every one of those employees has a new job, it's a good time to find a job in Ohio at least. So it went well and I think we were recognized by the community for doing it in a smart way. We also rightsized the organization. On top of that, we actually took another 10% of the total workforce down. This was not rifts where people walked out with baskets one day. Each business saying hey, what we do better? How do we focus our back office and make it leaner and truly make our production line faster and more robotic and less people involved? So it's not that we're against having employees, we just want to be rightsized for cost. And we had a cost savings goal, we set a productivity target, from run rate cost ongoing for the first 2 years of $10 million. We hit that early and we've reset another $10 million goal that we'll have for 2019. So 2 years more and another $10 million. A little higher fruit to pick on the next goal, but it's things that we're actively pursuing it in each one of our businesses and corporate functions as well. It's actually reenergizing, this new path forward, leveraging our core capabilities that we talked about earlier and then expanding into some value-added products. You will hear more from Corey and John, the food space, we're one of the largest suppliers of oats that has originated from farms and segregated and sent through our supply chain, the largest oat meal producer in the road. We also do that for the largest chip manufacturer in the world where we do corn the same way. We have white corn and blue corn and non-GM corn and then we work with farmers to grow those for them and identify that supply chain and have perfect paperwork so they know exactly where it came from. There's more opportunities there. So we're putting our toe in the water and we bought a company called Purity Foods, that makes Spelt. I didn't really know how to spell Spelt. To be honest, it's an ancient grain and we're working on ancient grains, its' a very popular thing now as is non-GM, organic, other products. And we're a unique company that can work from the farm, right to supply chain to be a trusted partner to a food company. Came back in for fertilizer, especially fertilizer as we bought Nutra-Flo 3 years ago. In low-salt liquid starter, you'll hear more about later, precision ag and doing the right things in agricultural is what we need to focus on, and that's a good opportunity for the future. Maybe tough when fertilizer prices are low, when farm incomes are down, so this is where the future is going to be in agriculture. We're not going to fertilizer the same way we have for 100 years, it's going to modify and change, and we want to be part of that. We also have invested in systems, in SAP. We're almost fully deployed in our Grain business and we're going live in our Plant Nutrient business here soon. So we're excited about our backbone getting better. So we completed the strategic review, we dealt with the portfolio and are focusing on growth items. So real quickly, invest in our core, turn to proper talent, greater sales force effectiveness and focus on accountability. So in the core, provide higher value margins. I just talked about 2 examples of that, look for bolt on projects. We've had some really good projects in many of our businesses that are really close by, right? That's usually our highest IRRs. We did several of those. Using new technology, Mike, will tell you a lot in ethanol about technology for the future and new value-added products we can make in Ethanol. And also in Rail, lots of opportunity to continue to grow our Rail fleet. Okay, I want to talk about right people in the right place with the right training tools, right accountability and objectives. Sales force effectiveness. I can talk -- beginning about sales and again, but these tools like this one on the right, this is called CropCoach, a tool we use in Fertilizer. Our other electronic tools and having our sales people be the best in the industry on knowledge and have that backbone of technology to support that. This has changed pretty dramatically in agriculture and we want to be part of that technology movement. How do we keep track of that? It's a simple thing. I can only count to 5, so this is the 5 P approach. We measure this every month. Every quarter, it's reported to the Board of Directors, persons, on personal safety, and they can know about all the measurements you can have in safety. We've had a 70% improvement in safety in the last 2 years. That's kind of unheard of the industry. We weren't terrible but we weren't great. We're on the road to 0, we're getting a lot better. Partner choice, all the customer measures. Share of wallet, retention, growth of new partners, et cetera. People I talked about before, an individual measurement of our people, productivity, putting in some measurable targets, goals, cost savings, where we're going forward. And all this holes up into profitable growth, and all the measures that you typically see for profitable growth. So wrapping up, we have near-term and long-term goals. So in the near term, the next 1 to 2 years, I told we're early into a recovery in our business. We want to achieve these run rate cost savings I talked about, another $10 million. We want to further integrate this technology. I've been involved in several SAP go lives before. The big thing is to get through them, you get them done and just settle down and get your costs down. We've done it in Grain, it's running well. And we'll do that in fertilizer next, and then we'll settle down and get our costs down. We see the light at the end of the tunnel. We're excited about the future of having a really solid IT platform to work from. We're not concerned or panicked or fearful of it. We also want to drive continued, steady financial performance. That's what you want to see, that's what we want to see, that's the most important thing we can do. And then also in the long term, let's call it 3 to 5 years which in some people's minds, that's middle term, drive shareholder value with greater focus on disciplined, strategic growth. Doesn't have to be M&A, some of them will be bolt-ons, like a little bit of greenfield-s. But overall, we think there's opportunity to grow each of these businesses. We want to move up the chain in value-added products, you hear this from a lot of companies too. I just told you about the opportunities in food, want that to be 20% of our gross profit in Grains, but in Fertilizer, up to 50% as we talked about how this modification is going to happen. Those value-added products tend to be 2x to 3x better margins than commodity products. And lastly and maybe most importantly, the EBITDA target to $300 million plus in 3 to 5 years. We're committed to delivering shareholder value and along this road, continue to pay dividends and return cash to shareholders. So that's what I had to say as an introduction. Thanks for your listening and I'm going to turn over to Corey Jorgensen, the President of our Grain Group. He'll tell you a little bit about our Grain business. Corey? CORBETT J. JORGENSON, PRESIDENT OF GRAIN GROUP, THE ANDERSONS, INC.: Thanks you, Pat. Good morning. Thanks, everybody for coming and being here with us this morning, and thanks for the chance to tell you a little bit of our story. My name is Corey Jorgensen. I've been with The Andersons Grain team and actually with the company for just under 2 years now. I came to the company after a 20-year start to my career. The first half of my career was Cargill. And I spent those 20 years learning about the same kind of businesses that I'm now part of here at The Andersons. For 7 years with Cargill, I was in trading and risk management and merchandising kind of jobs. It's a very typical way to come into these businesses. Then I transitioned into general management jobs, leading businesses. I led a regional soybean crush business in the southeastern U.S. for about 5 years. I transitioned from there to a really fun time in my career, I went to China for a little over 2 years and helped while Cargill built out its soybean processing and veg oil refining businesses in the South of China. So it's a great opportunity, a really fun time for my family, my wife and 2 daughters who were with us, and it was a great time for us. And I came back from China and then I moved into Cargill's Grain business. And that business is lot like our business at The Andersons. And for 6 years, I ran the eastern side of Cargill's U.S. Grain business, that's really similar to The Andersons Grain business, as Pat talked about our footprint. And then for the last year, that time, I was responsible for the vast majority of the U.S. Grain business in a Senior Vice President role. So I spent a short stint in a corporate transportation leadership role and then Pat called me. And Pat had been here for about 3 months, and he asked me if I'd consider the opportunity to come here and lead this business. And I can't just say verbatim what Pat said but I'll tell you the brand of the company, the recognition that this company has with farmers, especially in that footprint that we've been in for 70 years, the respect that this company has in agriculture drew me in really quickly. And there's people sitting in this room I'm looking at who helped build that legacy and build that brand, and it's something that matters a lot when you run a business with farmers and where farmers are the center and the heart of that business. The values and principles and the integrity that Pat spoke to are also really important to me and are tremendously important in the business that we do with farmers. So that was also a huge draw, just as Pat said. Unlike Pat, I'm not 6'6\", I didn't play football in college, but we've got a lot of the same love for this company and pride in this company that we've been at now for a little less than 2 years for me and more than 2 years for Pat. I also made an investment. So when I think about you as a potential or existing investors, I was halfway through my career, right? I was 20 years in and 42 years old, I've got a family. And I loved my time at Cargill and I loved the company and believe in that company. And I made an investment, I put the next half of my career on the table and said, I'm in. And I am bullish of that opportunity still today. I love the businesses that we're in and I love the opportunities in front of us. So I'm walking the talk and I've put my money on the table, and I believe in what we're doing. I want you look at this while I tell a quick story about the 10,000-foot level of explaining the Grain business, okay? Because sometimes, it gets complex and I really think we should make it simple. This is a supply chain business and it's a cycle where crops are grown once a year. We plant seeds and we feed those crops and we take care of those crops, that's just business. And then we harvest them one time per year, right? And you create with that harvest activity, a huge surge of supply into the market. And you need capacity and you need human capability to take that supply and help it transit from when it's grown and where it's grown. And it happens in a big surplus moment, right? We've just come through that in the last 10 weeks. U.S. farmers have harvested 18 billion bushels of corn and soybeans in the last 10 weeks. It's all in our hands now, right? Farmers are storing it, we're storing it, the commercial grain system is storing it. And our job is to transit it across time and across space, to the times and places when it's needed, where it's needed, in the condition that it's needed. And that's the opportunity that we have and that's really the simple view of it. This infrastructure exists to make that happen. We get the chance to do other things to add value along the chain but the asset infrastructure is there to do that. To transit crops that are grown one time per year, but they're needed 52 weeks a year, right? That's the economic lever that we have and I think when you can think about the business in simple way, that's a great way to start. So let's talk about these key messages. We love our asset base, we love that center of it in, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and Michigan that Pat referred to. We're also really proud of the 70-year history of deep relationships with farmers that this company has built. It's that brand that Pat talked about and I have a deep appreciation for. Those relationships and the trust that comes with those relationships give us the chance to work with farmers on risk management solutions and helping them to market their crops better, to run their businesses better. A healthy farmer is really good for us. We want the farmer in the U.S. to have a great business, to have income and balance sheets that support them growing because that's good for the entire chain. The experience and the infrastructure that we have also gives us a chance, as Pat described, to be a player in the specialty foods and niche grain systems, and I'll talk a little bit more about that, building on what Pat said. Number 4 is about hard work that this team has done prior to my coming even. It's been a 3- or 4-year journey and investment in putting a new backbone. The ERP system, bringing SAP into the Grain business at the Andersons. We're the first and we're about 80% done with that . We're operating every day with SAP as our backbone. It's brought efficiencies to us and it's given us information flows in a faster way and we're making more real-time decisions as the result of having it. It was hard work and it's a significant investment but we're happy to have it today and we think it's scalable. We've also done our work in alignment with the productivity efforts that Pat talked to. We're taking about 11% of the headcount out of the grain team since the baseline at the start of 2015. So we're a bit more lean, we're a bit more fit for the future, for the cycles that are inevitable in this business. And we feel good about our organization today and I feel really great about the leadership of our business. Finally, we're always looking at the portfolio and this industry is doing a lot of portfolio examination right now, I think. You hear a lot of the public companies talking about their portfolios and what they're looking at. We've got an active game board and we're always looking at chances to make ours stronger than it is. Here's a look at our business at a glance. I'm going to draw your attention to the middle of the screen. You can't ignore it, it's a dramatic dip and coming out of that dip right now. The 2017 bar is 3 quarters to date. I want to highlight that because the fourth quarter is the time when this business really hums. So that number is still going to add on to that bar. 2016 was clearly a trough. And I guess I'll just say that this industry is a long time history of peaks and valleys and it's a cyclical business. This is the basic grain infrastructure that I spoke to. And our company has been through that for 70 years. We know how to weather those cycles. They're not fun. It was my first full year at The Andersons in the year 2016. So I've got the scars and our team has fought hard and we're coming out of that bottom right now. We're really confident that we're coming out of that bottom. But I want to emphasize the point that we think those cycles will continue. It's an outdoor sport, crops are growing, with Mother Nature as a big influencer. And they're always growing before your demand picture is completely understood. And that's going to inevitably create peaks and valleys in the value of our capacity. We're comfortable with that, but we also think we need to a company with more resilient earning streams alongside that basic grain infrastructure so we can kind of better weather those inevitable peaks and valleys in profitability. All right. These are fun numbers if you're me. Pat kind of spoke about the significance of our businesses. We're not in as big as the top 3 or 4 but we're a top 10 grain merchandiser in the U.S. 150 million bushels of space capacity is a significant asset investment. It's bricks and mortar, it's in the ground. They're long life assets that we seek to return on over a long period of time. That asset infrastructure allows us to trade the 550 million bushels that you see there of corn and soybeans and wheat and some other small grain crops as well. That's a significant trade flow. That's 600,000 truckloads of corn and soybeans and wheat. It kind of represents about 0.5 billion bushels of trade flow that we touch. My belief and what I think this vision can give you is that we're in a great addendum to the rest of these business lines. And there's a lot of companies who do pieces of this chain. And they do well, running businesses like that. I like being integrated in each of them, and I like being grounded in the physical trade flow that happens on that 0.5 billion bushels of touch that we get. We have a conversations with the farmer. We have a conversations with the end users. We understand what's happening in the markets in between them as a result of that asset infrastructure that we own, the 150 million bushels of space that we filled up over the last 10 weeks. And it makes us a better risk manager on the 50 million to 60 million bushels of risk management products that makes us a better food-grade handler on those 50 million bushels of food-grade corn and oats and spelt and spelt flour. We don't make spelt. We make spelt flour, by the way. Farmers make spelt. We're better at each of these things because of being invested in the asset infrastructure. That's the point that I'd really like to make. And I'd like to reiterate that we're a significant company in these trade flows, and we're well-known in the U.S. grain trade. So our footprint. I'll just draw your attention to the kind of centricity of Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and Michigan. That's our basket. That's where we love to be. We're well-known. We're very strong in that area. We like our businesses that are in other places as well. But I'm comfortable of saying they're not in strategic. Our strategic footprint is in those 4 states. And we feel like we're very strong there. You can see our food-grade facilities with the blue dots as far up as in Saskatchewan, over there in Central Nebraska, down in Texas, Purity mills there in Southern Michigan and a food-grade plant in Mansfield, Illinois. That's more diversified, right. That's because we're close to either the growers of this specialty niche crops like up in Saskatchewan or the end-use markets for some of those food-grade products down in Texas will be an example of that. You can also see 2 of our affiliates, these equity investment businesses that we're involved in, the Thompsons Limited business up in Ontario, and a little dot up in East Grand Forks, Minnesota, is in the green dots. And then Lansing Trade Group is represented by the red dot in Overland Park, Kansas. That's our headquarters. Lansing has assets further in the Western U.S. and in Western Canada as well. We just want to put their headquarters here. And I'll talk a little bit more about each of those businesses now for a minute. Lansing, this is a company that the Andersons has been invested in for more than 20 years. Today, we own right at 1/3 of that company. What Lansing provides to us, is an earnings diversification. Lansing is a trade flow heavy, asset lighter company. They own assets, but they don't own assets to the degree that we do. We're an asset heavier, trade flow complementing company as well. So Lansing provides us a diversification into a bit heavier trade flow exposure, which has some great opportunities at times, and Lansing has provided big earnings to this company over the long-year history. It's also realize the difficulty that compressed margin structure in this business over the last couple of years, no different than we have. So it rise up and down in that cycle like we do. But we're really optimistic about what Lansing brings to us, and we got great reasons to think that they're going to do some pretty impressive things over the next couple of years. Lansing also has exposure to some energy infrastructure, energy physical trade flows and energy trading that's a compliment in a very different earnings stream that we have in our portfolio. Together with Lansing as we own Thompsons on a 50-50 basis, and Thompsons as a business is a lot like the Andersons minus the SNL component. And it's Ontario-based. So it's a geographic adjacency. That's why we like Thompsons. It brings us into Ontario, which is adjacent to our own business in Michigan and Ohio, and there's a cross-border trade flow that happens that we get a much better insight to as a result of being in the fertilizer business, the grain business and an edible bean business in Ontario. I tried to describe this slide in a simple way every time, and I always don't end up doing that very well. So let's see how I do. This is a supply-and-demand look at numbers. And the top line, is the supply, which creates demand for our infrastructure. The top line is crop supply. And you can see how that's grown over the last 10 or 11 years. The second line is the capacity to take it. That 150 million bushels of space capacity that we have is part of that space capacity that you see on the second line. And then you can see the utilization of that capacity in the third line, ranging from 91% to a low of 79% up to 102% of last year's harvest. There's 2 things that are important here, I think, when you think about the macros for our business. One is that the demand for our capacity that top line has grown at about a 2.9% compound rate since 2006, while the capacity to handle it, the second line, has grown at about 1.7% rate. That's a good equation if you are in our business. That implies greater value for our capacity today than it might have been 5 or 10 years ago. There's a lot more going around the margin structure in our business than that, but that is the underlying driver for the value of space in handling capacity. So that kind of feels good today. And we feel like that trend continues as the U.S. farmer and the U.S. ag chain response to demand signal for us to continue innovating and growing bigger crops. The second thing I want to speak to just quickly is that you can see the share of on-farm versus off-farm ownership of that capacity. There's a lot of talk in the last couple of years about the U.S. farmer investing in their own infrastructure to be in these businesses. You can hear about that. I think, quite a bit you can read about it. The farmer has invested. The farmer needed to invest. There's no mistaking that, right. But the farmers invested in about the same rate that the commercial industry has invested. The supply has grown, and so the farmer needed to invest, and we needed to invest as well, and that's what happened. So the farmer owned about 57% of this capacity back in 2006, and the farmer owns about 55% of that capacity today. It hasn't changed dramatically, right. So there's a story there of big investment, but the investment has happened on both pieces of the chain in my mind. Macro trends. When I went to China I learned this. It was drilled into my head. In developing countries, when GDP at a family level grows from -- in the $2,000 to $3,000 a year range to the $10,000 a year range, more than $0.50 of every dollar goes to a changing food diet. It goes to that demand for protein, fat, dairy, and sugar-based diets. You think about that. You think about being a family who subsist on rice and on vegetables and on really basic foodstuff. And as your income grows, and you see your neighbors eating chicken or you see your neighbors eating pork, everybody wants to do the same thing. And that trend has played out in places like Korea, places like Taiwan, Hong Kong, Eastern Europe, and we really believe that, that trend will continue to play out on the developing world. And that trend is sending a signal to the most efficient corn producer in the world, the U.S. farmer. That happened in ag super cycle that Pat spoke to. And that signal also want to technology companies to seed companies to fertilizer companies, to everybody in this chain to innovate and to create more capacity to grow and produce crops. That's happened and, again, that creates some cyclicality, but that price signal happened, that demand signal happened, and it creates a need for that capacity in the middle that I showed you on the last chart, to handle, to take that supply surge, to care of it, to condition it, and then to move it into markets when it's demanded, right. So we believe that, that macros trend absolutely continues. We're comfortable with the ups and downs that will come with it over time. But we think over the long haul, the demand for capacity like we have to move crops from places and times of surplus, to places and times of deficits is going to continue because of the developing middle-class in the world. And secondarily, because of the developing biofuels and ethanol space in the world, which Michael talked about here in just a minute. That's clearly created. That was a second big compounding factor in that ag super cycle that we experience. And again, gave the farmer a signal to figure out how to grow more crops and create demand for the kind of capacity that we have. The third section on here is about the specialty and organic and niche food space, which Pat spoke to, and I'll spend time here in a couple of slides going deeper into it. The demand curves in that space are really impressive. It's grown from somewhere in the $60 billion range, somewhere in the 6- to 10-year ago period. I can't remember exactly what that is. I'm sorry, but it's in that space. It was a 10% growth to our business for quite some time. It's now a high single-digit growth service, 15%, between 2014 and 2016. It's now $127 billion piece of the about $1.4 trillion U.S. food system. And I just think this space will continue to grow because of our desire for different kind of health trends for a desire for organic foods, for non-GM foods, for trade-specific grains in a lot of the diets that we have. And so we feel like we've got a great opportunity to grow in that space. This just shows you the big faces that are the pillars of growth of our business. We have our Base Grain business, which is represented in the first, income from trading and risk management solutions that we work on with farmers, and then this food ingredient an specialty grain space, which are the second 2 -- or the 2 more resilient earnings streams that we need to build to help us weather better the ups and downs of the grain cycle. We'll go to each one of those just a little bit here. What are we doing in the Base Grain business. We buy corns and soybeans and wheat from farmers and we handle it through our asset infrastructure. We need to just be better at what we do in this space. This goes to some of the themes that Pat spoke to: sales force effectiveness, accountability, high expectations, measurement, holding people accountable to the measurements that you use, understanding that not everybody is in the right seat on the bus today, and maybe not everybody on the bus needs to be on the bus tomorrow, if they're not suited to the role that they're in. We're raising expectations, and we're using the tools that we have on -- at our hands because of our SAP infrastructure, for example, to have visual measurement in front of our sales organization every day. And we're raising expectations, and we're driving a clear market share growth opportunities in Base Grain. We're also very nimble and we have to be, making, I'd say, kind of nominal investment in our plants because every Grain asset is different. And every geography around the Grain asset is different, and so you have different needs at different times of the year. I got 2 quick stories to share with you. One is sitting in the picture that you're looking at. This is our berth in Toledo, Ohio. Now boat is being loaded. Pat is pointing this all to me yesterday. The spouts that are loading grain onto that boat, were reengineered, rejiggered a couple of years ago with a pretty nominal investment. Just before I got here. So I don't specifically the investment number, but it is well under $1 million. And it opened about 5% of the capacity of that spout to load the boat. If you think about the value of freight, if you think about the value of that boat, [rash] knows these values really well. It's not fun when a boating is sitting at berth. Boats want to move. They want to move that stuff form origin to destination and then get back to a berth somewhere to be loaded again. So 5% capacity utilization improvement is a big deal on a really nominal investment right there. We got another one in Champaign, Illinois. Our team of people in Campaign figured out, this is a facility that handles 550 trucks a day in the peak of grain harvest. There's 5 or 6 weeks a year when that happens, right. They saw an opportunity to add a scale at the front corner of the plant and then to change the truck flow through that plant. And that scale investment is about $125,000. It's real money, but it's a nominal investment in a facility like that, that handles that many truck loads a day coming in from farms. And they thought that they can unlock 10% more flow through that facility as result of that investment. And during this harvest, we had multiple 600-plus truck days through that facility because we put that scale in place and we changed the truck routing to that plant, and there's dozens of opportunities like this. So my point isn't to try to have you remember that scale investment in Champaign, Illinois, that with creative minds and people who are looking at flow, through 36 different Grain assets, we can make nominal investments and increase our ability to pull trucks through our facilities. We're then a better place for farmers to come to, to do their business with us. We, of course, also always have the active pipeline and game board in front of us to continue to shore up our asset portfolio. I love this space. This is the work that we do with farmers to make their business better. This is the team of professional, disciplined, traders and risk managers that we have that this company has grown over 70 years, and some of the 20- and 25- and 30-year people that Pat spoke to. Farmers are very good at running their businesses. They're very, very good at producing crops and at managing agronomy, and some are very good at risk management as well. But there's a big segment of farmers who value our help in the space and others keep it simple and say, we've got the opportunity to grow significantly in what we do with farmers, helping them to price their production and improve the revenue in their businesses because we have a team of people who do it every day for our own business. And we want to turn around and use that with the farmers that we do business with to help them make their businesses better. Markets have become far more global in the last 10 years from being more U.S.-centric in the space, 10 to 20 years ago. You've got much, much, much different money flowing in these markets as well despite of a lot of liquidity, which is a great thing, but it also brought a lot more volatility, right. And so there's opportunities for us with a constant focus on what those markets are doing, and an understanding of economics on the farm, to help farmers do a better job of pricing their corn and soybeans and wheat. The bottom fact here is a really important one, I think. Our fee structures in that business get better as our performance is better. So we're in lockstep alignment with the interest of our customers, and I think that's a great way to be in a business like this one. We do better when our customers do better. That drives what I talked about having farmers with healthier balance sheet and healthier businesses. That's an important thing for us. This is the second of the 2 pillars that we want to grow aggressively to build resiliency into that earnings stream, right, the food ingredients and specialty Grain space. Pat talked about acquiring Purity mills earlier in 2017. We've built in this space both organically and with small bolt-on type acquisition like Purity. We're a big food-grade corn handler already. We connect farmers who grow trade-specific food-grade corn to people who make chips and tortillas and all these things. We connect oat growers to the biggest oat users, oatmeal manufactures in the world. We are building a bigger business in Saskatchewan, accessing the specialty and ancient grains that are growing up there and bringing them to the market that need them. The point in this space is that the capability of connecting that farmer in Saskatchewan or in Nebraska or in Illinois, or in Texas, to the end-use markets that need their crops is really similar to what we do on 500 million bushels of corn and soybeans and wheat every day. The assets are similar. The capabilities are similar. And we've got a good opportunities to provide that clarity and transparency to the supply chain that Pat talked about, and to be trusted by the food companies and to be trusted by the farmers. So this is the space that we want to grow as much as 300% over the coming 5 years and make it a pretty significant part of our earnings stream. These are our near- and long-term goals. The first one is to grow physical share in the Grain business by 20 million bushels, that should represent about $2 million of gross profit in our business over the next 1 to 2 years. And by 15% total trade flow growth, 40 million bushels, $4 million of gross profit over the next 3 to 5 years. We want the value-added products. As a company, we're talking about value-added products in the Grain business, that's going to represent the food and specialty grains and it also going to represent the risk management products that we work on with farmers. We're going to grow that by 100 basis points, from 13% to 14% over the next 1 to 2 years. And then more significantly, we intend to take it to 20% of our total GP in the next 3 to 5 years. That will help us generate $70 million to $75 million of EBITDA in the short term and $85 million to $95 million of EBITDA in the 3- to 5-year window, helping the company achieved that $300 million number that Pat spoke to. So I'll summarize. We love our asset base. We love our presence in the Eastern Corn Belt. We're really proud of the team of people who have built this business over the last 70 years. And we're really confident in that team of people doing the things that I said we need to do to achieve these growth objectives. The trust that we've built with farmers over that period of time, gives us a chance to build that risk management business and to become a bigger player in the food and specialty grain space over the next 3 to 5 years. The trust with the farmer is a huge key to doing that. We understand the cyclicality of the basic grain industry, and we know that we need to build resiliency into our earnings stream, and that's what we're working constantly every day on. And most importantly, I think is to leave you with the fact that we believe in those long-term forces, we believe in that developing global middle class that's going to continue to demand things that the U.S. farmer is very, very efficient and very, very good at producing, and we're pretty excited by our opportunity to continue to grow, being the connector of those people who grow the corn and soybeans and wheat and specialty crops in the places where they're needed in the U.S. and around the world. So thanks for listening to that, and I'm going to introduce you to Mr. Mike Irmen, who leads our Ethanol business. Here you go, sir. MICHAEL S. IRMEN, PRESIDENT OF ETHANOL GROUP, THE ANDERSONS, INC.: Thanks, Corey, and welcome, and thank you all for being here. I'm Mike Irmen. I'm the President of the Ethanol Group. I've been with the company for a long time. Started my full-time employment about 40 years ago. Even before that, I grew up on the Anderson family farm. So I really have been around forever. Last of the old guard once Rash abandons me here in a few months. But I'm thrilled to have the new members of the core team to work with. It's been great the last couple of years since Pat came. And I'm thrilled that they've embraced all the core values that have really been a part of the history of this company. So thank you. I started my career really, even before my full-time employment, working at Grain operations and summer jobs. But early in my career in the '70s, I was a Grain Originator. I worked in accounting for a couple of years. I was part of Grain Facility Management and Grain Operations. I think, I was an integral part of the formation of our aggressive Grain origination policies and processes that are part of a real strength in Eastern Corn Belt today. That's where I spent the largest part of my career. I also work in risk management, commodities risk management, in grain merchandising, even grain hedging. In 2005, at the beginning of what I'll call the dry corn ethanol movement, I was a part of the leadership team that helped conceive and develop our Ethanol business. Our Ethanol business really grew out of what we perceived as a threat to our Grain business. They were going to be 400 ethanol plants at one point back in early 2,000's. And there was -- and likely they're going to start popping up next to our Grain facilities. And should that happen, it certainly would have hampered our ability to at least the quantities that we would have handled to our facilities. So we decided to respond to that threat by offering what we were best at, responding to a threat with our strength, the offering services in terms of Grain originations and commodity marketing, logistics management, risk management, even ethanol marketing, was a new skill that we developed in the early stages. But as we learned more about the business, we had many companies that hired us for our services, but they were part of the 200 facilities that were conceived and never became a reality. We've realized that we really had the skill sets that would allow us to develop this business. And all of the services that I mentioned, we've built in facilities before, the processing part was new to us, but we learn that early on and developed that skill set. And we think we're one of the leaders in the industry in terms of today. So over the last 10 years as part of the leadership team, I helped developed the quality services offerings that we sell today. I'll tell you more about that as we move through the presentation and became the President of the group when my good friend and neighbor, Neill McKinstray, retired in 2016. The things that I'm going to talk to you about is just an overview of our business model. I'll explain how our partnership with Marathon Petroleum company works and the advantages of that relationship. I'll talk about our fee-based model structure, so -- how that helps stabilize the income that can be volatile in the Ethanol business. We talked about the criteria for us in growing our footprint as we go forward and part of our strategy in going forward, too, is now we pretty much maximize the ethanol production capacity in each of the facilities that we operate today on how we're going to focus on adding value to the other coproducts that we'll produce in addition to ethanol. And we will continue to -- our history of investing in innovative technology. So what we do is, we operate facilities. We manage the facilities, we market all of the coproducts, we also provide Grain Origination Services. Our ethanol production footprint has grown over the years, and there is a number of a key differentiator here that I'm going to talk about each of that make us a little bit different than much of our competition. We're one group that really touches all of the other 3 groups. In fact, we lease railcars from our Rail Group, we lease Grain facilities and also hire the Grain Group to handle our Grain Originations and DDG marketing. We also buy inputs from our Plant Nutrient group, urea, nitrogen are part of the process, we also buy the group. So the point I want to make here for Joe and Jeff, they're new to the group is, remember who the customer is right. But welcome. I'll start with our Albion facility. Albion was our first and most recent build. We built that facility in 2006. We double the size of the facility just completed that early this year. That's adjacent to an existing grain facilities that we had operated for 20-some years, prior to the Ethanol Group taking over the site. Clymers is another one, build adjacent to an existing grain-handling facility. Greenville, Ohio was our first joint venture relationship with Marathon Petroleum company. That was our first and only greenfield operation when we built the grain-handling facility as well as the ethanol production facility. And then Denison, Iowa is to date our first acquisition. We bought that in 2012 and have been managing that ever since. We are 1 of the top 10 ethanol producers by volume in the United States. So what is ethanol? You are all our customers, whether you know it or not. I mean, if you own and operate a vehicle or any kind of compression engine, you buy ethanol every time you fill your car, because ethanol is in 98% of all the gasoline sold in the United States. So you are all our customers. We produce a number of coproducts. Our E85 is a flex fuel. There's 21 million or so flex-fuel vehicles on the road in the United States today. We blend our ethanol with our denaturant, which is a petro carbon that we used to denature our ethanol, we've blended a ratio of 85% ethanol, 15% gasoline, and sell it directly to retail stations all across the country. We have 80% market penetration in areas surrounding our plants, but 2 years ago, began shipping it by rail. We're the only shipper of E85 by rail in the country. We shipped to various transload terminals around the United States and offload into trucks and delivered directly to convenience stores and retail operations around the country. DDG, distillers dried grain, that's the coproduct. It's what's left after we take the starch, convert it to sugar and ferment it into alcohol, so it's a high-protein feed products. It's actually a higher protein than the corn, before we started, because we don't develop protein into ethanol. So we market that product. Corn oil is also -- there is a corn -- oil concentration in the germ of every kernel of corn, that we are one of the early adopters of the technology to remove the corn oil from the process. On a pound for pound basis, corn oil is actually the most valuable coproduct that we produce today. We also sell even the air. Part of the process of fermentation is that we -- is we produce a high concentration of CO2, as of yesterday, now at 3 of our plants, we sell -- we compress the CO2 and sell it to Continental Carbonics, which is adjacent to our property, that generates an additional $500 million of revenue for each of our plants. We think there's only about 30 of the 200 or so ethanol plants that are on the country that also have arrangements to sell the CO2. Our ethanol customers are primarily refiners or obligated parties and also to some smaller blenders. When we -- the prime 2 products is we buy corn and we sell ethanol. When we have opportunities where we can lock in margins for the current period or periods forward, the transaction we make is in derivatives market, we'll buy corn futures and we'll sell ethanol. Those are the primaries. The other coproducts we market opportunistically, either in the spot market or as far forward as the -- is the market will support our price projections and expectations. So all 4 of our entities are joint ventures. We don't own all of any of them, these are the ownership percentages. And also the operating capacities next year, we expect to produce 275 million gallons of ethanol. Our actual exposure and opportunity to the ethanol margins that are presented to us is about 230 million gallons. But this provides for us a stable service fee income. It helps stabilize some of the volatility that is involved in the market. Our strategic partner with Marathon is unique and is special. To have a partner that is also our largest customer, they buy about 40% of our total offtake, that's only about 50% of their total use. They're the largest user of ethanol in the country, which makes them the largest user of ethanol in the world. But they don't -- it doesn't give them any rights to buy anything at discount to what we would sell to anybody else. But obviously, we -- they come to us first and the information that we share back and forth between their understanding of the ethanol business and their understanding of the gasoline demand and demands of refiners and blenders, gives us great insight in how we manage the business going forward. Having 4 different plants that are all common, ICM technology, which we think is the leading technology in the business, gives us an opportunity to vet different capital investment opportunities at one plan at a time, once we've -- our track record has been -- once we've proved that to be successful, quickly deployed it at each and all of the other 3 plants. It also gives us opportunity to share parts between the different facilities, because we have a lot of common parts. We don't have to have a huge inventory, but we can also benchmark one against the other, it's -- we have the right economies of scale, I think, that we get the best deals, opportunities from the different vendors that provide us with the various products and we really like this model. And as we continue to grow, we would expect to continue to grow with this model in place. Some of the macro trends that support our business is that domestic demand does continue to grow. At the moment, production capacity is growing faster than domestic demand is, but overall world demand continues to grow as well. We think we know exports will continue to increase, more in that in a minute. And then, the clean air emissions that support the demand for ethanol, which is the leading and cheapest oxygenate in the world to help fuel burn cleaner, we expect that to continue. As far as regulations, the Renewable Fuel Standard, we'd expect to continue in its current form, there have been a number of bills introduce to change or abolish the renewable fuel standard, none of which have gained any traction. We have great support from the current administration. We expect that to continue even post 2022. We expect the EPA will continue to administer the renewable fuel standard in its current standard. We do expect local state and regional level greenhouse gas regulations to continue. The Low-Carbon Fuel Standard that's been in place in California for a couple of years, we think will be adopted by other regions, most likely Oregon next. There's a coalition of 13 North East states that we expect to also adopt similar standards. And blending ethanol into transportation fuel, we expect is going to be a key part of those policies as we go forward. And then plain and simple, ethanol is just the cheapest and cleanest, greenest oxygen enhancer and octane enhancer in the world. Ethanol is 112 octane, and by blending ethanol it raises the octane level for gasoline at the pump. I'll spend a minute on exports. We're on pace to set a record for export this year. Just found out this week, we exported almost another 100 million gallons in the month of October. We think we'll finish between 1.250 billion and 1.3 billion gallons this year, and we expect it to grow aggressively the next couple of years. Exports to Canada have increased significantly. In fact, the province of Ontario is moving from a 5% mandate to a 10% mandate. They don't have the capacity today to produce that ethanol. It'll likely increase our opportunities to export to them. In fact, some of that directly from our plants. China, Mexico and India have also just increased their mandates to 10% between now and the year 2020. So there's plenty of capacity for additional demand from each of those countries. We've had a little blip in the radar with China. China was our largest exporting country last year. This year, so far, well, at least as of last month, they hadn't imported any, but all of a sudden, after President Trump's visit to China here a couple of weeks ago, the window is back open again, where they've raised their mandate. They don't know -- they don't have the capacity to produce it. We believe somewhere between 200 million and 350 million gallons has been booked to ship to China between December and just June of next year. That quantity alone, we think, will just -- will take the excess production capacity that's being developed or just recently added off the market, and that, that business can and should continue to grow. Brazil has been our biggest competitor in the world, the other largest producer of ethanol is also one of our export countries. We hit a little stumble with them here or two where they have imposed an import duty above certain quotas. But the fact is, their mandates still suggest that they'll need to import beyond the quota in this coming year. And we think that the -- they may not be able to hold the pace that they imported at this year. But we do expect them to import almost double what the quota is, in spite of the tariff. So our strategic growth initiatives are to fine-tune the plant productivity and efficiency. I mentioned a little bit earlier that we've pretty much maximized the ethanol production piece through a series of debottlenecking operations. We've done it all of our facilities over the years. Today, those plants run at about 125% of what their original nameplate capacity was. The key part of our strategy going forward is to transfer that effort to developing higher-value coproducts. So the same quantities of ethanol, but getting more value out of the coproducts. And then increasing our footprint or the gallons under management. The technology that we've developed, we've been partners with ICM. They're the R&D firm, we are not. But we work side by side with them in helping them improve the process, and we expect that to continue going forward. We've aggressively maintained these facilities. If you were to visit our Albion, Michigan facility today that was built in 2006 and doubled this past year, you'd have a hard time telling the difference in where the old plants starts and the new one begins. These plants, we run them hard. We run them 365 days a year. Our uptime or minimum downtime for maintenance helps us spread our cost, obviously, over more gallons. I'm really proud of the people we've developed in the group. We have 230 employees and from top to bottom, we're strong in operation and fermentation technology, commodity risk management and originations. I'm really proud of the group that we've developed, mostly from internal. We've hired some external talent, which I like to do from time to time. Many things as we do very well, and we think we do well, we know we don't know at all and bringing some experts in from the outside will only help. The biggest area for growth that we have in the people department is we're going to expand our engineering expertise in this next year. We picked a lot of the lower-hanging fruit in terms of the easy operations to develop. But as we get into these higher technology projects, we want to increase our in-house engineering expertise. And we really like the markets where we're invested in. Most of the ethanol that we produce is distributed locally around our plants, the Iowa plant is the exception, but the advantage to the Iowa plant is just how cheap the corn is. It's an easy $0.20 to $0.30 of bushel cheaper than the price we have to pay at our Eastern plants and that helps pay the additional transportation for the ethanol to move to market. We can move either coast. From Denison, we're served by 2 railroads. So we can go West, East or even South, actually. So the higher value coproducts that we're working on, number one, and the one that's most imminent is distiller's dried grain. Most of you are aware, our last quarterly conference call, the group took a $1.5 million write-off on some [e-tailed] engineering that we're doing on a high-protein products. In the process of designing that product, we found a couple of things. One is that the costs came in significantly higher than we expected to build -- to add that capacity, but we also discovered another process that was going to allow us to develop our DDG shifting from a 32% protein product to a 40% protein product. We expect to do that within the next couple of years at a couple of our plants. We think in the next 2 to 3 years, that will be developed -- we'll be producing cellulosic ethanol from our corn and kernel fiber. Corn kernel fiber can be separated from the rest of the process. It's the lowest value coproduct that we have. And we know that in -- at commercial scale, now that ICM has developed the technology to produce cellulosic ethanol from the fiber and the process of removing the fiber, which has no root -- no protein or very low protein will also raise protein content of our remaining distillers grain and turn our lowest value coproduct into ethanol, which is our highest value coproducts, in addition to the $2 premium for the RINs that are generated from cellulosic ethanol production. We have grown, and we expect we'll be able to continue to grow our E85 business. We have 2 full-time salesman that are just the best salesman on the planet. They're passionate about the business. There -- they knock on doors, we provide what we call keep wet services, where we monitor convenience stores inventory, and we delivered to them just in times, so they never run out. And as a result, they don't negotiate price. We set the price and they pay us what we ask. That adds about $0.05 to $0.07 a gallon to our revenue. And this year, we we'll distribute more than 10% of our total ethanol production as E85. Our target is to move that towards 20% of our total production over the next 5 years. We also expect to double the revenue from our corn oil production in 2 ways. One is to get more oil per bushel of corn processed, but another is by we're working, again, with ICM in a refining process to allow us to take our corn oil that's today a crude distillers corn oil that's valued at $0.25 to $0.26 a pound, refine it into a higher value of coproduct that could eventually be used as food grade, which has a value of as much 2x the crude corn oil. We also are and have been looking for opportunities to increase our gallon -- our number of gallons under management, the acquisitions or further investment. We've reviewed dozens of projects that just didn't meet our criteria. We're going to insist that the technology be the same as our existing plants. We like origin plants, as we call them, where there's a strong local corn supply, access to solid ethanol demand, opportunity for higher value coproducts that I spoke about a moment ago. And also, the same ability to leverage our service offerings via a joint-venture-type arrangement. What we expect to accomplish in the next couple of years is to lower our controllable costs by $0.01 a gallon. $0.01 a gallon doesn't sound very much. To me, that doesn't make me cross the street when I'm filling up my vehicle. But when you produce 475 million gallons a year, that's almost $5 million at the LLC level or $2.5 million to us. And we think by continuing to negotiate and lever our supplies that, that opportunity will present itself. We expect to have this higher value or higher protein distillers grain integrated into at least 1 and, hopefully, 2 of our operations over the next couple of years. And find one opportunity for an acquisition or investment to expand our footprint. Longer term, we think, 3 to 5, but early 3, we expect to be in the business of producing ethanol from cellulose or from corn kernel fiber. We would expect to have this higher value protein product in all of our products or -- I'm sorry, in all 4 of our plants -- or 5, if we have 5, and then look for another opportunity. We've got a dozen different plants identified that would fit all of our criteria that are aware. They all know that if they would decide to do anything different with their ownership that they would be interested in talking to us, and we'll continue to look for those opportunities. One other opportunities I didn't speak of yet is another coproduct, if you will, but is not a product, it's revenue stream. And that is we know that by continuing to lower our carbon footprint, that there's an opportunity to generate carbon credits in shipping to these markets that have, like California, with the lower carbon fuel standard. So we're reviewing several different opportunities that are similar to the CHP, the combined heat and power process, we added as part of our expansion at Albion, where we're regenerating most of, 90% of our own electricity, but also using all of the heat generated from that process to run the rest of the operation. So that's our story. We have a strong performance track record in the short 11-year history of the company. We've contributed well over $300 million of pretax income to the company. It was built on strengths, so we continue to build on those strengths. We think we're really in a great spot to continue from the continued world growth of biofuel demand, and we're going to continue to build on the strategy that we discussed. That's all I've got. At this time, I'd like to ask Pat and John Kraus, and Corey, to come and join me, and we'd be happy to answer questions on anything that we've discussed so far. Questions and Answers JOHN KRAUS: So what we'd like to do, we have a couple folks with microphones that we'd like you to use to ask your questions, and in so doing, identify who you're with and -- or who you are and who you're with so that our virtual audience knows that when you ask the question, and we'll take them as they come. So yes, Farha? MICHAEL S. IRMEN: I knew you'd be first. FARHA ASLAM, MD, STEPHENS INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Farha Aslam from Stephens. Mike, I thought that the technology you talked about was very interesting and compelling. Could you share with us a little more about the cost of putting in some of these programs. And the payback periods that you anticipate these programs to give you? MICHAEL S. IRMEN: Well, I could tell you that to meet the criteria for capital investment for the Ethanol Group that if we don't have internal rate of returns that we project to be in the high teens or around 20%, that we won't invest at that. Over the history of the Ethanol Group, all of the capital projects that we've invested in have met or exceeded those internal hurdles. So I'm not at liberty to discuss exactly what it would have cost on the protein project that we abandoned, but I can tell you that the next protein project that we're investigating now is literally 1/3 of that, but the higher protein is on 100% of distillers dried grain as opposed to only 20% of the DDG. PATRICK E. BOWE: Farha, maybe I should build on that, that I think Mike's team did a great job. When you talk -- because we're talking about bolt-ons, right? We've got at existing plants with those kind of returns, obviously, when we built those plants, the returns were much lower than that on a bigger capital project. And so when you make it -- if we made an investment in a new plant that had good technology, and all the things he just talked about, that those would be lower return base but still accretive and attractive to the company. We like the combination maybe of both. FARHA ASLAM: Maybe a 2- to 3-year payback is what you're looking for with these add-on technologies? PATRICK E. BOWE: That'd be aggressive with the current economic [scene] but I... MICHAEL S. IRMEN: 3 to 5 would be... PATRICK E. BOWE: 3 to 5 would [probably] be right. FARHA ASLAM: 3 to 5? That's helpful. And then just one follow-on for Corey. In your targets that you laid out, do you assume the ag cycle to continue to improve? Are the targets that you're setting in the current environment? Just some color around the macro around those targets you set out. CORBETT J. JORGENSON: Yes, comfortable saying, what I said earlier, that for a business like ours, we're coming out of the bottom of that cycle. And you can see that in our earnings to-date here in '17, and what we can see out in front of us for the handling and value of storage capacity. Farha, I think I'd rather speak to the fact that I'm confident in building the 2 other earning streams that are not susceptible to that same ag cycle. The risk management, the work with farmers and the food ingredients and specialty grains business line. That's our doing. We've got to go and get that. We've got to go and grab that business, right? The rest of the ag chain is going to be determined by what Brazil and Argentina produce in the crops that they'd just planted, by what Eastern Europe produces in their next crop cycle, by what U.S. farmers decide to plant this spring. Right? So I feel like we're coming out of the bottom, and these trends tend to be longer-term kind of trends. So we certainly feel optimistic about that, but I'd hate to predict when the next either drought or what the corn yield in Illinois is going to be next year. ELIZABETH HUND, HEAD OF FOOD AND AGRIBUSINESS DIVISION, U.S. BANK NATIONAL ASSOCIATION: Pat and Corey, I'm Liz Hund. I'm with U.S. Bank. To your point, Corey, about whether this is the third or fourth record year for corn, it just seems to me pretty obvious that we need to get this corn out of the country. So could you talk a little bit about trade policy and the TPP and NAFTA and your thoughts about the U.S.'s ability to really have an active global trade business in the current administration? PATRICK E. BOWE: Well, I'll start. Obviously, we're huge proponents for free trade. And in any impediments to free trade is bad for U.S. agriculture and bad for the U.S. farmer. So rattling swords with our best customer, Mexico, is never a good idea. We don't want to -- I'm not making a political statement. I'm not about walls. We want railroad cars to be flown into Mexico boats to be flown into China, et cetera. So free trade is good for the U.S. economy. It's good for the U.S. farmer. We want to support that. There's obviously some bumps in the road, and Mike talked about tariffs that have come into ethanol, and then we have to monitor that. The bigger issue is what Corey talked about. We just produce too much grain around the world. So it's not just the U.S. farmer; this is Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Eastern Europe, and we're having just an abundant production in the last 3 years. Demand is still continuing to grow. I mean, this whole rising incomes around the world and diets being filled with more protein is working. And this thing is an all -- coming right back to U.S. export. So we do need to have some market volatility that can help that help clear. MICHAEL S. IRMEN: We really do like to eat corn, by the way. PATRICK E. BOWE: There's always a contrarian. CORBETT J. JORGENSON: Right. I can't say any better than what Pat said. We're huge advocates for free trade. I think what you've seen the U.S. ag cycle do in the last 20 years is a great illustration of that. Soy bean exports to China, for example, all the other ag flows that happen. So we want to maintain open flows with all of our trade partners. I think this might sound a little bit romantic. I think there's a great a story in seeing what the U.S. farmer in this chain has been able to do in response to the price signals that came from the super cycle. We have gotten too good at it too fast, right? And so the productive system has been very, very productive. I think this year's crop is a really good example of what seed traits are producing today and what precision agriculture and events kind of farming practices are producing. So we have the demand curve to catch up a little bit, and we really absolutely do believe that, that'll happen. JOHN KRAUS: Eric? ERIC JON LARSON, ANALYST, THE BUCKINGHAM RESEARCH GROUP INCORPORATED: Okay. Eric Larson, Buckingham. My first question is for Corey. Corey, we've talked about -- we've had some of these discussions, but one of your big opportunities with your business is farmers. Again, you mentioned they are very good at producing their crops, but they're probably subpar in marketing their crops. So what percentage of your customers actually use your marketing services? How easy is that to develop? And is it a long-lead sell-in time? I mean, these farmers are uncomfortable with derivatives and things such as that. So could you clarify and maybe frame that for us? CORBETT J. JORGENSON: Yes, I'll try to do it succinctly, and then ask a follow-up if I don't get at all of it. About 10% of the farmers that we target business with today do risk management business with us of some kind. I know from experience that, that number can be a multiple of that. It does take time, Eric. You spoke to that. It's not a first-phone-call, \"Hey, let us show you some great gizmos that we've got that can help you price your corn higher.\" It doesn't work that way. It's a trusted relationship, and you've got to prove your capabilities. You've got to help the farmer know that you want to understand their economics, because every farm's cost of production economics vary from place to place, right? You know that very well as well. So we need to demonstrate that we're a consultative partner. I tell Pat this quite often. I don't like referring to my team as a sales organization. We're a consultative merchandising partner with our farmers, and we have to make an investment in time, Eric. We've got to make the investment in the kind of quality people who can build that trusted relationship with farmers so that we get the chance to then jump into that risk management relationship with them. But I know we can do it because I've seen it happen, and I've seen our team now in action over the last 12 to 18 months growing their penetration. It's happening as we speak with that portfolio today, it won't stop. PATRICK E. BOWE: And it comes with effort and technology and execution. CORBETT J. JORGENSON: Absolutely. PATRICK E. BOWE: Corey and I have the discussion all the time, because having been in sales and my background, I always say, ABS, always be selling, right? Farmers don't like to be sold to. They want you to sit down at the kitchen table with them, have a cup of coffee and go through and really take some time to resonate over -- and our guys do that really well, are first-class, and that's why we think that the number can grow pretty substantially. ERIC JON LARSON: Is that business sticky once you get it? Or will it recycle? CORBETT J. JORGENSON: Yes. We feel like it is sticky. We have to perform, right? Which is what I spoke to about our fee structures kind of being aligned to our performance -- not kind of, they are aligned to our performance. But it is a sticky business. We're talking about 101 customers, 201 customers, 301 customers. You want to get customers at the 101 level and they start working with some of your products on 5% or 10% of their production, and then we grow that as their comfort level grows and our performance is demonstrated. So it is sticky, and it's important to retain that, obviously, and to grow from 10% to 20% to higher than 20% penetration. PATRICK E. BOWE: We're probably sticky at 3 50 Corn or 5 50 Corn. ERIC JON LARSON: Yes. We have to test that yet. The final question I have is -- and I hate to even kind of bring this topic up, because you ask 10 people this question and you'll get 12 different answers. But there's this constant -- in the investment community, there's this argument that the grain business is under some secular change, and there's -- we talk about cyclical versus structural. And I mean, I have my own opinion, and I know everybody else does as well, but I'd be interested in how you folks look at the grain business today versus 5 or 10 years ago and what that means for the next 5 or 10. CORBETT J. JORGENSON: I think I spoke a little bit to how farmers have invested in infrastructure and how the commercial industry has also invested in infrastructure over the last 10 years to continue to handle that growing demand, right? It's been important for farmers to invest in what they've done, and I think that, that's what a lot of people have talked about, is the farmers disintermediating the trade flow. The farmers are going to store their crops, the farmers are going to fertilize their crops, they're going to produce precision agriculture techniques on their own and so on and so on. I think that when you have 18 billion bushels of crops coming to market in an 8-week period of time every year, you're going to need infrastructure like we have. I think the earnings opportunity for that infrastructure is going to continually be an ebb and flow, and we really have to -- we cannot just rely on that engine that this company was built upon. We have to build those adjacent earnings streams around it, which is really what my team is set out to do and what our job is over the next 3 to 5 years. But I think that the returns on a long-term basis, that's the investment that I made. I think the returns on a long-term basis are going to be cost of capital and better than cost of capital in the base grain industry. It's going to have its valleys and it's going to have its peaks. PATRICK E. BOWE: Maybe one thing from a -- it's probably one -- maybe a voice of experience from people like Mike and myself that started in the '80s, the grain business has seen lots of ups and downs, periods of government programs and corn not moving 10x times a year to boom periods to the current -- or hyperproduction period we're in. I think the truth is those trends are always going to be with us. And this idea that -- I've had these questions from Ken, I had them from Farha, I know it, that is there something uniquely different that had happened in these last 2 years in the grain business? And I would say no. Farm storage was added, farm storage didn't get added in the last couple of years. The farmer moves in and out on that. As there've been -- will there be consolidation? Will there be one-player-buy-another? Yes. Go back 10, 15 years ago. Where are all those grain companies? Cargill bought Continental. And you go down the list of them, one right after the other, Central (inaudible) on and on and on. So there's always been consolidation and people buying each other's assets or merging and combining. That will continue. I don't see a major giant shift where big majors are all going to combine in a very dramatic way in the next few years, but there'll likely be 1 or 2 deals that will be a market mover. Okay. KENNETH BRYAN ZASLOW, MD OF FOOD & AGRIBUSINESS RESEARCH AND FOOD & BEVERAGE ANALYST, BMO CAPITAL MARKETS EQUITY RESEARCH: Just to follow up on some of these questions... JOHN KRAUS: And this is Ken Zaslow... KENNETH BRYAN ZASLOW: Oh, (inaudible) Sorry. When I think about this storage, and you kind of made this idea that there's not more storage. But over the last couple of years, something did change where the farmer is not selling. So I'm not sure what you see will change to get to a better environment. Is it just we've seen a cycle and it is a cycle, and therefore we've hit bottom and have to go back up? Or is there something that's going to change my first question? CORBETT J. JORGENSON: Okay. I'll just say first, storage has been added, that's clear, right? But it's been added by both the farm and the industry as that supply has grown. Secondly, I think that the market has shown the farmer different opportunities. So you go back 5 to 10 to 15 years when you had, a lot of times, constant carries in the market, you always had, December of the next year, corn contracts sitting $0.40 above the December contract of the current year. And farmers had a disciplined pattern of selling that back-end future when it was showing that wide carry, right? And that phenomena went away when prices did what they did through the super cycle. First of all, the carry wasn't there. Prices were kind of flat through a lot of the calendar years. I'm speaking generally, right? But it pulled the farmer away from that deferred marketing pattern, and the farmer figured out how to market crops between December and January, February, March, April, May. So I think there is a pattern change there that we'd be silly not to acknowledge. But the reality is crops come to market when that storage crunch happens. And I think the reality is that the farmer will need a partner in the business, even beyond November and December at times, to help them with the risk management work, to help them access the right market to be on the right railroad to get to the right ethanol plant, whatever it might be. So I don't think it's a permanent shift, Ken. And I think actually, today, we've got the widest calendar carries that we've seen in quite a long time. And we own more December of 2018 corn than this business has in quite a long time, and we think farmers need to be looking at deferred prices today relative to their economics and thinking about getting back to that deferred marketing pattern just a little bit that was the right pattern to be in up until about the last 5 years. KENNETH BRYAN ZASLOW: But my second question is, if your average profitability is $55 million over the last 5 years, you're thinking it's going to go to $85 million to $95 million. How much of that is actually in your control? PATRICK E. BOWE: So it's EBITDA, just to be... CORBETT J. JORGENSON: It's the EBITDA number. Yes. PATRICK E. BOWE: So I think I'll take around it because Corey's always -- the things he's talked about, about our risk management programs are working -- marketing to the farmers and growing food space. How -- I've spent a lot of my career in the food ingredient space. We're not talking being a corn wet miller or soy bean crusher. We're talking about some of these other, what I'd call more niche food ingredients... CORBETT J. JORGENSON: Supply chains. PATRICK E. BOWE: That supply -- require farmers' supply chains, right? And to emphasize what Corey said, again, the food -- packaged food manufacturers are looking for transparent supply chains because people want to know where the food was grown and how it was grown and how it got to that food company. So we think those would be opportunities that, whether that will come bigger and faster, it's going to take -- some will be some M&A, a lot of these are smaller pieces. So it's not like there's a lot of big companies in that space. So there's pretty foods there was a small little company relatively to put us in there. So that's the first time we started milling. There will be other opportunities like that. So growing that curve will be part of that growth target. Mother nature and the supply and demand of grains will determine the overall volatility of that earnings curve between now and then. Whether we have a big shakeup and the market gets more volatility, which we like, and trade her on that and profits can come from that, if we continue to produce year-after-year like we had in the last 3 years, it'll be tougher. I think that was the point of the question. KENNETH BRYAN ZASLOW: But is it all -- do you need to make acquisitions to get to that $85 million? EBIT... PATRICK E. BOWE: Yes. Some. CORBETT J. JORGENSON: Not huge, but yes. PATRICK E. BOWE: Not huge. More bolt-on, I think. KENNETH BRYAN ZASLOW: And then, my last question is, I see ethanol margins at, call it, flat, negative 1. And you guys are looking to actually expand pretty aggressively in the ethanol. In fact, why would you do that? MICHAEL S. IRMEN: We -- okay. PATRICK E. BOWE: Now, that's a good question. MICHAEL S. IRMEN: Our -- the key to our -- to the group strategy is to operate top-quartile plants. So we believe we know that we can operate in the black when the lower quadrant of the sector is not only operating in the red but burning cash. We know that we're going to go through periods of volatility where, like I mentioned, production capacity right now is growing faster than demand. But we want to use that -- this opportunity to continue to build our footprint so -- because we do expect margins will rebound through the natural cycles that we've seen 3 times since we've been in the business. This could be the beginning of the fourth cycle, and that -- with adding more value to our core products, we can increase the revenue stream that keep us operating in the black, even when many of our competitors can't. PATRICK E. BOWE: Ken, I'd like to build on Mike's comments. We're not talking about gallons for gallons' sake. If you had heard what Mike talked about, he talked technology for getting different revenue streams from our existing plants as well as embracing new technology. Unfortunately, Mike and I are both guys who said [sayolosic] will never happen. It's 25 years away, it has been 25 years away for the last 20 years. We're not talking about sayolosic making it from switchgrass or [in municipal] ways. Corn fiber is at all wet mills and grind mill plants, and converting that corn fiber and that carbon [sugar] technology, new ends on technology, new processes could allow that to happen economically, which would allow us to access markets like the card market in California and others. So we're looking at areas where we can take technology to make a higher margin, whether it be feed, corn oil, or even sayolosic as a way to enhance a profitability of the business, not just say, \"I just want the same old, same old dried mill gallons for more capacity.\" That's a really important point we want to make. But we like enhanced technologies that can put us in a new position for growth. JOHN KRAUS: Okay. at this point, I want to be respectful of your time. We're a little bit behind schedule. My watch says 10:18, so I'd like to take a 10-minute break and we will reconvene at 10:28. MICHAEL S. IRMEN: Coffee and pop will be right outside so get reloaded. (Break) (Presentation) RASESH H. SHAH, PRESIDENT OF RAIL GROUP, THE ANDERSONS, INC.: Ready? Okay. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for -- I have known some of you for many years, and some of you, I just met today. Thanks for attending my last rodeo, as they say. It has been -- where I stand today, you are not interested in my background, so we will spare you that detail. But what I'll tell you is that what attracted Pat and Corey to The Andersons kept me there for 40 years. That it is an incredible company with fantastic people, and I'm going to have lifetime of memories and friendships and relationships that I'm going to cherish, all the way into my retirement. And my retirement could be very long. My dad is 94 years old, and if I have those genes, I got long ways to go. So -- but anyway, thank you. I also want to do a shout-out to Joe. I have known Joe for last 15 years. We have -- while I have been the face of the business, we have 250 great people working back in our shops and our office, and ideally will now recognize them, and in doing that, we have built a good platform of assets, people and relationships that I think I am leaving it in good hands, and Joe, with his experience, I do believe that for Rail, even better days are ahead. So let's talk about the Rail business. I want to change the mindset that many of you might have. Most of you think about Rail is when you have a derailment somewhere or you have been stopped at a crossing. What I want to do is tell you that the breakfast you had today, the house you live in, the car you drive, the cash you generate at the end of the day, the paper you read, the stuffed toy you buy for your kid, somewhere, somehow, some of it might have moved by rail. I think that our business is an integral part of what keeps America productive and America efficient. So next time, when you are stopped at a crossing, take your time and say thank you. Okay, let's talk about the Rail business. It started -- I still remember, in 1989, when somebody just had a simple idea that, why don't we repair railcars? And sitting in my office that day, we never thought that someday we will morph into someone that has 23,000 railcars. Now having that idea at that time when company was very small, and I think our total CapEx at that time was $5 million to $7 million. So when you get into Rail business and you want to order couple hundred railcars at $15,000 a copy and you go to the management as newest kid on the block and say we want $3 million which will be half of company's CapEx, not that easy to do. But it really worked for us, because coming from that kind of a beginning allowed us to be very efficient, very agile, very customer-focused, value, patient, disciplined buyer, and those qualities have really stayed with us as we have gone. So those early days kind of stuck in our DNA, and that is fantastic. What I'll also tell you is that this business, of the 200-and-some people that work in our area, majority of them are in our shops. About 30 of them really do everything on the leasing side. So the platform we have, if we doubled our fleet -- Joe, if we doubled our fleet, we won't be adding that many people. So this platform is very scalable. In the middle of this chart, Pat talked about it, that the ag cycle and our cycles are a little different. I'm glad that during the ag cycle was in a downturn, that we were able to contribute to the overall success of the company. What makes us different than our other competitors? We go for -- majority of our leases are full-service leasing, where we do bring a value-add. It's not just the money part of it, which any bank can do, many of you can do. For the longest time, and I talked about our beginning, that we had -- we didn't have big pockets, so our fleet at that time, we primarily invested in old and older cars, and that, throughout the year, allowed -- throughout the years allowed us to gain certain pricing flexibility and sustainability that I wouldn't have if there were new cars. And often, a lot of the commodities that we concentrated on in our early days, fertilizers, grains, salts, really, if the integrity of the box is there, people really do not care whether it is a Mercedes or a Yugo. That's how these commodities work because they are bulk commodities, low-margin and you need to move them. So didn't matter the type of car, as long as the integrity of the box was there. From one shop in 1989 that stayed until -- one until 2003, we have grown to 19 shops. And yesterday, our partner kind of jumped the gun, and we have now a 20th one and -- in Texas, and they announced it on their website. So we have a 20th shop in Sunray, Texas, which is about 50 miles from Amarillo on the railroad called TNW. We talked about how our beginning was, so customer focus, effective buying, all that is part of our DNA. Let's talk about 23,000 cars, 20 shops now. Utilization is the #1 factor to our profitability. Over the last 5 years, it has averaged 85% to 92%. If some of you had a question, I'll kind of anticipate that right now and talk about it, that you have heard of competitors having 99%, 98%. This is how we have measured our utilization, and they have measured their utilization maybe a little different method, but our go-to-market strategy is a little different than theirs. And 92% to 93% utilization, if we get that, I feel really good. That's what we are -- our fleet is. And if you look to the right, while our beginnings were in grain and fertilizer, over the years, we have really diversified in the number of commodities that our fleet carries. To an untrained eye, a railcar is a railcar. Even a railcar built in 1950 to today will be about the same. Things have changed, trust me. They have gotten metallurgies better, cars have gotten bigger, the braking system and all those things in safety appliances, they have improved significantly. So if you look at the nation's fleet, the numbers in yellow, I mean that is -- sorry, that is our fleet, and the -- in black is the nation's fleet. There are couple of car types we just don't play in, auto racks and some of the intermodal. But of the other car types, we really do cover a gamut of that, and we do have -- majority of our cars are covered hopper but we serve a lot of different commodities. So while it is concentrated, we are into a lot of different commodities. Let's talk about the relative size. Pat had talked about that, in each one of our businesses, we are top 10. We barely made top 10 here. And that list, every year it changes, even as high as 8. And in our early years, we would be the only one ranked on the list. So there are 1.6 million cars in the U.S. fleet. 65% are in the hands of private shippers and leasing companies, 35% are still owned by railroads. And of the people listed here, there are 12 lessors, 6 manufacturers and 7 shippers. It'll be interesting for you to know that of the 24 besides us, we have commercial relationship with 23 of them. Either we repair cars for them, we buy or sell cars to them, but we have while they are -- many of them are our competitors, we have best of relationships with them. Our income, we generate income 3 ways: The clipping of the coupons, meaning the lease revenue we make on our fleet. We turn our portfolio effectively and sell cars and book profit on that. And then we make profit from repairing and some other activities that we are in. I won't go into the detail of each of the numbers. There are 2 things I want you to keep in mind, which we covered on our last quarterly call. There are 2 headwinds that is -- that are coming in '19 -- I mean 2018. One is the -- we have, when the ethanol boom started, we have an unusual number of 1998- and 2008-built tank cars. All tank cars have to be recertified every 10 years. There is a cost of $5,000 to $7,000 a car, depending on the car type, and that cannot be capitalized, it has to be expensed. So in 2018, which would be the 10-year anniversary of cars that were built in 2008 and 1998, or 20-year anniversary, we have to do those repairs. And we high -- have unusual number of cars, about, call it, about $3 million worth of onetime expense that will be in 2018. And the other one, that's why CPAs and accountants are my favorite people, I had nothing to do with this. But the changing accounting rules and the lease accounting allowed is not going to allow us going forward on certain transactions, the way we had financed that and the way we were doing it, a onetime gain upfront when we do the deal, now that will not be allowed. Fundamentally, nothing has changed. The business is fine. It's just how we used to book that profit, and now when it comes. Okay? And that, over the last 5 years, had averaged about $5 million to $6 million. So just want to give you a sense of what we are looking at on those 2 sides. UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Does that cash come later on? RASESH H. SHAH: That cash will come in when we sell the cars. Okay? Let's talk about the shop network. I said, for the first 15 years of our existence in the rail business, we had one shop, and now it has grown to 20. All shops are not alike. We have shops that are 6, 8 men and 2 trucks, and the reason I say men is most of them are men. And then we have full-service shops like the one we have in Maumee, Ohio; the one in Kansas City, where 40 to 50 people work in each shop. So I see the flight to quality. A lot of the people want to deal with people who are a lot more integrated, people who can stand behind their repair, and I think we are going to continue to have opportunities to grow that business. What are some of the trends that I see that will help us going forward? When we started the business, the railroad ownership was 65%. Today it is roughly 35%. I can't predict the exact percent as to where it will end up, but I expect it to continue to go down. That bodes well for people like us who are in the leasing and shipping business, so we will have to pick up that slack. Our beginning with steel fabrication and our years of knowledge on the operations side have really differentiated us in terms of becoming a comprehensive rail solutions provider. So when someone needs a car that needs to be specially fitted with certain loading or unloading device or certain restraining device within a boxcar or whatnot, we are really the ones who can do that. And often, by solving a problem for somebody on 20 or 30 cars, those relationships as their business grows have grown into hundreds of cars. Food safety, cargo integrity is putting more and more pressure on people wanting to have the same car every time at their loading facility as opposed to relying on system car that can -- today, you get car X and, tomorrow, it could be car Y. Talking regulations more and more off-highway is going to come onto rail, and the reason being is we always hear about the trucker shortage. We -- now with the electronic logging device, hours worked by any trucker can be logged now. You know exactly how many hours that truck was on the road. That's going to bode well for this business. And after losing lot of the coal side of the business, railroads have gotten really efficient at taking care of the small shippers. People who are -- who would ship, say, 5 cars, 10 cars, 20 cars. Prior to that, that wasn't the case. So that bodes well for our business. And then Corey talked about the growing middle class, whether it is in China, India, that I think we will continue to provide the needs of the world, and that bodes well for this business. So what are we going to do going forward? We're going to stick to what we know best and what has worked for us for so many years. In the 30 years we have been in business, we lost money 2 years, 2001 and 2010. And we were cash flow positive every single year. So we are going to stick to what we know, and that being we're going to continue to grow our fleet, going to expand our repair network, and wherever we can, we are going to take advantage of the adjacencies that allows us to eke out underlying gross profit. We will -- we have been a very patient buyer. While size does matter, the size of the fleet, in this business, we haven't grown for the sake of growing. So we are going to continue to play -- pay a lot of attention to being a value buyer. We have shifted our focus little bit from being old and older cars to midlife and newer cars. So our particular investment going forward will be a little higher but it assures the business going forward for many, many years. Where there is an opportunity, we will buy idle cars, retrofit them and take it out of one service and employ that in another service. And we will continue to look for those kind of opportunities. We will look at acquiring some of the people who -- I had the top 25. There are 25 below that to see if there are opportunities to fold them in with our business. I already talked about the scalable platform, so that will be just very easy to incorporate. With the energy independence, there is a lot of investment going on in Texas and Louisiana, where natural gas and/or crude oil is the feedstock. We want to deliberately go after the markets in that area to expand our fleet. Shop network. We talked about it that, while all shops are not same size, we will look at opportunities. We are building very good relationships with lot of short-line railroads. And a lot of short lines are ma-and-pa short lines, and then there are short lines that are 120 short lines under one publicly traded company. And we have relationships with people like that, that'll allow us to really look at opportunities where our fleet is being repaired by somebody else. Where we can send a baseload of business and open a shop. Tank car recertification, we talked about, that every 10 years, all these tank cars, regardless of what service it is in, will have to be recertified. Today, we have 2 shops, Kansas City and Maumee, that can do the tank car recertification. The idea is, by end of 2018, we're going to take it to 4. There is work already started to get our Baltimore shop qualified to do tank car, and before end of 2018, we'll add one more. In the adjacencies, I talked about that strategic partnerships with short lines that'll expand our shop network. Exploring alignment with the manufacturer. When I had the top 25, 6 of them were manufacturers. In order for us to have a steady supply of new railcars at a guaranteed upon delivery, we need to get, really, some kind of a partnership or some alignment with one of the car manufacturers. With Joe's background, I think it'll be a little easier to do than what I would have been able to do. And then, we -- I was pursuing this at The Andersons on expanding our parts business. We have been doing some of that. Joe was trying to do the same thing at the company that he was -- he is coming from. And so now, I think we will be able to really take this to a very deliberate approach and have some presence in that side of the business. So near term, while going from 23,000 to 25,000 doesn't sound like a lot, but keep in mind, we sell cars, some cars fall out, so this is a net growth of the fleet. And we have been -- what was the average for us last 5 years? $62 million or something? EBITDA? Right? Something like that. And so we have continued to do that. We are not in rail. We are not at the bottom of the market; we are definitely not at the top of the market. There is a glut in the market that we need to work through. We are somewhere in the middle of the market, but I think that what I see there is doable. On 3 to 5 years, I was going to put some big numbers because I don't have to deliver them. But then Joe is a good friend, so I kind of scaled it back. So that's what we see going forward. Okay. Like I said, we are going to stick to what we know the best. Grow our fleet, disciplined approach, value buyer, expand the shop network, look at the adjacencies, and that's my story. And now I'm going to have John Granato come up and talk about our PM business, and I also want to -- I have worked with Bill Wolf for a long time, and I wish him a happy retirement. JOHN J. GRANATO, CFO, THE ANDERSONS, INC.: Thanks, Rash, and welcome, everybody. My name is John Granato. I'm the company's Chief Financial Officer. I also have a responsibility for our IT organization as well as our project management office, which oversees our large systems implementations projects here at The Andersons. I've been here about 5.5 years. Unlike most of my colleagues and leadership team members, I don't have a background in agriculture. So I've spent a lot of that time really learning about our businesses. It's been very rewarding to understand what it means to be part of the agricultural community and what it does for the broader good out there. I will say that I'm not a plant Nutrient expert, but I do want to echo what Rash said. Bill Wolf has been a terrific leader at this company and the Plant Nutrient Group for a very long time, and he spent a lot of time with me, helping me prepare for this presentation. And without his help, I wouldn't be up here today being able to present this to you. So with that, let's get started. Who are we as a Plant Nutrient Group? We're a large Midwestern wholesale nutrient provider of base nutrients. So nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus. We also, though, distribute and manufacture value-added products, low-salt liquid fertilizers as well as micronutrients, which is where we want to be because those help to drive sustainable and precision agriculture. And if you think about the environmental impacts, this is where agriculture and the nutrient space is going as we move forward, and I want to keep emphasizing that. We are well positioned for that trend. We're focused on productivity. And as we look at our markets today, there's a couple of phenomena going on. We are in a demand-supply imbalance. In essence, we have more supply than the demand is out there. That's driving margin compression in the nutrient space, which is impacting our ability to drive profitability. In addition to that, we have a situation where we have low farm incomes, and we're going to come back to both of these and talk about that. And what that has done has slowed some of the adoption of the value-added products that we've positioned ourselves in terms of where we think the market is going. So let's take a little bit of a look at our financials here. One of the key things, I think, to look is although the nutrient space has been very challenged the last couple of years -- okay. I'll just -- I'm just going to keep talking. All right, yes. So one of the things that, even in a challenged nutrient space environment, we continue to generate pretty good cash flow. And if you look over the last couple of years, we've generated just under $50 million of EBITDA. The numbers for this year and all the numbers for 2017 are third quarter numbers. I think it's important to think about the breadth and depth of our products as we move forward in this space. We're not just a provider of base nutrients. We have a good product mix in the value-added space, and that's going to be really important. And we're focusing a lot on agronomic solutions, and that's where our sales train is going, and we're going to dig deeper into that as well. So one of the things we always get asked about is, how do your groups work together? Well, if you think about Grain and their connectivity to the farmer, they get off the farm market intelligence, which helps us drive recommendations to our end-user customers around what they should be thinking about in terms of the nutrient space. That also helps us in terms of one of the key things we have to do, which is manage our inventories. And so there's a really close and valuable working relationship there. And ultimately, what that translates into is it allows us to make the right recommendations to our farmer customers so they can drive yield, but more importantly, profitability through their business. And that's really what we want in this space. So let's talk a little bit about our footprint here. Our footprint has grown. As we talked about, we're were primarily a wholesale distributor of base nutrients in the Midwest. A couple years ago, we acquired a company called Nutra-Flo, which is a value-added nutrient provider. It gave us much greater breadth. Today, we touch about 30 states in terms of our distribution network as well as the manufacturing we added. And again, our focus is on driving sustainable and precision agriculture, which meets and is right in the trend of environmentally friendly agriculture. So this chart talks about the nutrient life cycle as well as how we play in that nutrient cycle with both our solutions and our products, and they really are both here. The first thing to note is, on the left-hand side, is the planting season is really short. And if you think about this market, that means a lot of nutrients have to get moved in a very, very short period of time. And what we have, we have the right warehouse space and the right place to handle those nutrients, and we're going to talk about that a little bit more as we move forward. But that is critical to have the right warehouse space in the right place. They need to be well situated. In addition to that, we have -- as the planting season starts, those base nutrients go down, but what also happens is, with our value-added products, we want to put a low-salt liquid fertilizer right in the furrow with the seed. And why do we want to do that? Well, think about this. If, I don't know, you have a new puppy at home, and what do you want to do? You want to provide that puppy the right nourishment so they develop and grow in the best way possible. Well, plants are exactly the same way. And what low-salt liquid fertilizers do, they are immediately accessible to the plant's root system. So what does that mean? The plant grows quickly, and it grows and reaches its potential. If you think about regular broadcast nutrients, only maybe 20% to 30% of those actually reach the plant when you put them down. So this is a good example of precision agriculture. In essence, what we're trying to do and where we're moving to is we're feeding the plant, not the soil, and that's critical. So this chart really highlights kind of the 3 main base nutrients we handle, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, and it shows the relative uses to the 3 main row crops: corn, wheat and soybeans. And what we see here is that, really, corn is the king. And what do we mean by that? Corn consumes the largest amount of nutrients, and this really helps drive our profitability. So what do we like? We like very large corn crops that consume a lot of nutrients. So let's talk a little bit about our relative position in the market. It's a market where we have about 50 million tons of demand each year, and we have -- supply roughly 2.3 million tons or about 4.5% of that total. Our market share in the core areas we play is estimated to be at 15% to 18%. So how do we know that? We actually have grower surveys as well as feedback from our wholesale distribution channel. So we're very, very confident about our position in that space. One of the things, as we've talked about, with low overall crop prices and low margins, one of the keys in this space, because it is a commodity, is to maintain our market share. As you can see, the radius around distribution is critical to your ability to supply your customer base. Again, I can't say enough how important it is and how critical it is to have warehouse space in the right locations, and we've got that, and we'll talk a little bit more about that in a few minutes. So what does this chart show? This actually is a comparison of corn price versus composite nutrient prices. The red line is corn, the green line is composite nutrient prices. And if you focus on the right-hand side and you think about the fact that base grains today have a pretty low price point relative to where they've been historically, nutrients are actually still affordable to the farmer. And that's one of the key reasons we haven't really seen a lot of volume decline. Now the flip side of that is, with low nutrient prices, low margins and low grain prices, what does that do? That actually slows the adoption of some of the value-added products that we provide, because the farmer simply can't get the return because they cost more today. So as we move forward and we get that demand-supply balance improving, we would expect to see the value-added space come back. So here's the second part of the story. And as you can see, what we have is very, very low historic farming incomes. And in fact, we're at about 10-year lows. Well, as we talked about, if you think about corn being the major consumer of nutrients and a low, low farm income environment, the farmer has to make decisions. What do I plant? And corn is more costly to plant than bean and wheats, and so that also does impact some of that demand in the market, and we're feeling some of that today as well. So let's talk a little bit about product flows and our supply chain here. So it's really a 3-step supply chain. On the left-hand side, you have manufacturers. In that big orange bubble in the middle, which is where we primarily play, you have people like ourselves that are wholesale distributors. And on the right-hand side, you have retailers and co-ops as well as farmers. And so you have that 3-step channel today. The key point here is the folks on the left-hand side, the manufacturers, they are producing 24/7, 365 days a year. They have very little storage capacity. That orange bubble in the middle, where we play, has 75% of the storage capacity. So let's put some numbers around that. Today, there's about 25 million tons of storage capacity. We have about a 1 million of those tons, not dissimilar to the volume we actually sell in the market. The point is that volume has to come through our storage. So storage is valuable and it is -- even in today's market, we hear a lot about this intermediation. Corey got some questions in the grain market. There is no other place to do this. You say, \"Okay, retailers, co-ops have some storage.\" They do, but what they don't have is the ability to handle large unit trains, vessels or barges, which are required for bulk break to get all those nutrients in place in that really compressed time we talked about during the planting season. So we're really well situated in this space. So some of the supportive trends that we're driving here are the environmental benefits of value-added nutrients. We talked about our positioning there. We bought a company called Nutra-Flo a couple of years ago, and that makes us a very key player in that market. We just talked about base nutrient storage and demand and the importance of that storage and demand today, tomorrow, moving forward. We have and we'll continue to have good storage there. There is a lot of increasing use of technology in the ag space, and what we are trying to do? We're trying to create products that improve yield, and we're working with companies to help make sure we can deliver those products in a very efficient way. And that's part of the tech revolution in ag, and a lot of it is happening right here in the Plant Nutrient space. And so we also have some adjacent businesses that are really closely aligned with our core NPK and value-add nutrient businesses. Those include our turf and some of our other commercial businesses. There's a long history of product development there. One of the products we've actually helped developed is lightweight cat litter, believe it or not. So you think about today's environment, where if you're in New York and you're walking up 3 flights of stairs to your apartment, do you want to carry a 20-pound bag? Or do you want to carry a 3-pound bag of cat litter? That's just as efficient. Or similarly, with the Internet today where everything's bought online, do you want to ship a 20-pound bag? Or do you want to ship a 3-pound bag? So we're pretty innovative in this space as well. So let's look at a few of the key trends. We talked about these. We selectively want to grow that base NPK business, that storage business and distribution side. We're going to continue to invest in the value-added space. Products are going to continue to be developed there, and we need to continue to do that. We're going to continue to leverage our technology base and develop new products as well, as well as create efficiencies in how we manufacture those products. And we're going to optimize our sales force effectiveness. So let's talk a little bit about that, the NPK-based business. One of the things we are looking to do is standardize our processes across those to drive better margins. We're also going to look to partner with some key suppliers candidly as well as some of our competitors in that space. And you say, \"Wait, competitors?\" Well, one of the things is if you're a co-op, you don't have that storage capacity that we have. So we can add value. It can be a win-win for both of us. On the customer side, what we really want to do is help them buy nutrients in a way where they have price security, and we can do that by selling those in advance. That helps us manage our inventories as well as help them manage their overall profitability. And finally, we can do things on the supplier-manufacturer side through consignment arrangements, which allow us again to drive the value of our warehouse space without necessarily taking the risk on nutrient price volatility. We talked a lot about value-added products. Some of the things that we haven't talked about is we have manufacturing capacity in this space. And so as we develop new products, we're going to be able to use that capacity to lever and drive them through our channels. We're already reducing our production cost through some technological advancements. We're taking imports and figuring out how to use those more efficiently to drive better yield on the outside. And we already talked about the market intelligence that we share between Grain and the Plant Nutrient Groups. So you might be saying, \"Okay, expand technology and product development in turf.\" Well, this is a space where we have a long history. We're one of the key players in the golf course space. We actually provide dispersible granule technology to golf courses all over the world. That's one example. What we did a couple of years ago was we actually merged our turf group into our Plant Nutrient Group to help leverage some of the technological advancements and standardize those across our businesses. Turf has been a launching pad for some really innovative products. We have a product that they developed recently called humic coated urea. It's a carbon-based product which helps nutrient uptake as well as vitality of the product. That came from turf and was moved into agriculture. And the last point on this slide cannot be underestimated. In our turf business, there's a lot of regulatory requirements. As you think about moving into the value-added space, those products are going to need to be registered. Knowledge of how to register and manage products through a regulatory environment is going to be critical, and we have that. So lastly, in this area, we're going to focus on optimizing our sales force. So yes, we do want to take cost out but we want to grow. One of the first things we've done is we hired Jeff with a terrific commercial background to help drive sales through our channels today. We're also looking to ensure that we have an integrated sales approach. So what do I mean by that? When we go to a farmer or one of our other customers, that customer doesn't want to be served by 2 reps. They don't want somebody who's selling base NPK and another rep who's selling value-added products. So one of the things we need to do is drive that integrated sales approach, and that's what we're doing. We also need to measure and build sales plan from the bottom up. So what do we mean by that? We want to make sure that each of our salespeople has targets relative to not just the product mix but also their customers. We want to hold them to those standards. That happens through training. And then finally, we think an educated customer particularly in the value-added space is the best type of customer because they can understand the efficacy and the value proposition of value-added nutrients. If they understand that, they'll want to consume more. The last thing we're doing here -- and this is critical, is we've implemented systems and processes to get better data visibility. What does that do that puts real-time information in the hands of our sales force as well as our manufacturing and distribution side so we can make real-time decisions? So near-term goals. We are implementing SAP in our Plant Nutrient Group as we speak. That feels like it's going to be another good, successful implementation. But that's critical and that's a key focus over the next couple of months. We continue to refine our organizational structure to drive productivity and top line growth for sales. We're going to continue to expand our value-added business, and we want to take EBITDA back up above $60 million. Longer term, 3 years from now, we want to be able to tell you we do have the best-in-class sales organization in the business. We're going to have more strategic alliances with our competitors and our customers, and we're going to grow value-added tons by 3% to 5%. Today -- and this is critical, value-add is a small, small portion of the 50 million tons of nutrients that go down the United States today for row crops. If we can just grow that marginally, we don't know how big it will be. And you think about margins in that space, 2 to 3x base nutrient, that can be a huge lever for us to drive top line growth as well as profitability for the business. And again, we want to continue to drive EBITDA growth in the long run as well. Finally, we're going to aggressively grow our value-added businesses, both organically and through greenfield as well as M&A. We're going to standardize our sales processes and make it more effective. Our new IT platform is critical, and we'll know about that shortly. And then we're going to continue to develop products that are on trend to help the farmer with sustainable and precision agriculture, which are environmentally friendly. That, I'm going to stop and I'll put on my finance hat. Okay, let's jump right into finance. How are we doing on time? Okay. JOHN KRAUS: (inaudible) over. JOHN J. GRANATO: So finance, John. So broadly speaking -- and you heard this from Pat, we do want to focus on profitable growth in this company. So not growth for growth's sake, but how do we grow profitably? Some of that is going to come through talent management, and a lot of it's going to come through operational excellence. We also need to grow that top line again. We've rationalized or largely rationalized elements of our portfolio that no longer really makes sense. And we're on track to achieve the $20 million of cost productivity savings that Pat has talked about and you've heard all the businesses talk about. We put in place tools to enhance data visibility. And so what does that mean? We really want our businesses to be able to make real-time decisions. And if you don't have the right tools to get the right information to them quickly, they can't make those decisions. We have a strong balance sheet, and that gives us flexibility to grow. So even in a time where we haven't performed as well as we would have liked the last couple of years, we've generated solid cash flow and we have the foundation to grow when we find those right opportunities to invest. And we're going to talk a little bit about our balanced capital allocation process. So this chart gives you a bunch of numbers on our historic performance, and we'll again point out that 2017 numbers are year-to-date. So they do not include the fourth quarter results. And you can see that gross profit has come down. It's been a challenging environment. But I would also tell you that through that time -- and you can see in the EBITDA chart, that we've continued to generate pretty good cash flow. And we've continued, on the right-hand side, to invest capital in excess of $100 million a year. Yes, we've tailored it down as the business has been challenged, but we've continued to invest and we've come out of it with a strong balance sheet. So some of the things we've done specifically to enhance our returns are exit underperforming businesses. We did exit assets in Iowa and Florida this year. We also exited our retail business. That was a challenging and difficult decision for the company. I'm really proud of the way we came through that. People really, really handled it well. And candidly, we've moved on that -- from that and the company is ready to go. Cost management. We set a target a couple of years ago to take $10 million out. We achieved that a year early, and then we set another target to take another 20 -- $10 million out. And we're well on track, by the end of 2018, to achieve $20 million of additional cost takeout from the company. We're focused on critical roles. You've seen many members of the new management team here today. We're happy to have them onboard. And we are investing, as we talked about, to grow. We've invested a lot in systems, so not just SAP. We put in a new planning system. We've put in a new procurement system, and we put in new reporting capability to get real-time information to those folks who need it to make decisions. So this chart details some of our specific productivity efforts, and what you can see is they're really in 3 categories. They're labor reductions, they're process improvements and they're systems or technology enhancements that further allow us to drive profitability. And I'm not going to go through each of the individual components there, but those are real examples of cost that have come out and will stay out of the businesses as we move forward. So everybody's talked about the journey and where we've come and the transformation and the turnaround. And what this chart highlights is 5 key areas we're focusing on to drive operational excellence throughout the company. And one of the areas -- obviously, as we talked a lot about the productivity piece, I'm not going to talk anymore about that. We're early days in that area but we're going to continue to push it. Sales force effectiveness. I think you heard Corey talk about it. I talked about it in the Plant Nutrient Group. There is opportunity there. The key is we're going to get more disciplined input processes in place that drive that. Corporate planning. So what do we want to do there? We want to improve decision-making. And we have implemented tools that will allow us to do that, but more importantly, what we have is a good cooperation in balance with our business groups to drive better forecasting. That will let us make better decisions not just real-time but as we look to invest going forward. We're leveraging technology. You heard from Mike Irmen how much additional yield we've gotten out of our ethanol facilities. We're 25% above nameplate capacity. That came from smaller bolt-on acquisitions that allowed us to drive more gallons as well as value-added products. And that's a key for us as we go forward. And finally, safety. It's a key theme of the company. And one of the great things, we recently did an engagement survey. So we do 1 every 2 years. And some of the highest scores for the company consistently across all groups, whether it was in operations or finance or IT or HR, were in safety. And what you can feel through those results and through our employees, they value the safety culture that we've developed, and they're going to continue to value that. And that really creates a great collegial environment for us in the company. So let's talk a little bit about our leverage and liquidity strategy. Most important word there is we have a strategy. It isn't random. We're really, really focused on metrics. And some of the metrics, we want to manage long-term debt equity less than 1:1 for Grain, Ethanol and Plant Nutrient. Rail has a little bit different need, okay. They compete in different markets, and their leverage structure should be different. And so there, we want to manage 3:1. I should also add that we're putting in place a rail-specific facility to allow us to actually do that so that we're going to be able to manage those businesses and provide liquidity to Rail in a way that will really help them grow with their competitors. We want no more than 20% of our long-term debt maturing in a single year. We like to maintain working capital above $175 million. Working capital in our business is actually good. It means we have grains in our bin, which means we can earn from that. I also want to talk a little bit about the fact -- it's not on this chart, but I want to thank our bankers. We have an $800 million committed revolving credit facility. That is a real strength of this company, and it allows us a ton of flexibility. So thank you, bankers. That facility runs another 4 years, so plenty of liquidity there. And then finally, we want to maintain net debt to adjusted EBITDA of less than 4 now. Some of that number -- today, we're at about 2.5. Why do we have that number? Part of that is just because of the volatility and cyclicality of our businesses, and we need to have the flexibility. But we do want metrics even within that volatile environment. Let's talk a little bit about our capital allocation framework. Over the last 5 years, we've invested close to $1 billion back into the business. A lot of that has been invested in organic growth, primarily in adjacencies. We've also put a lot of that back into our acquisition strategy. So again, focusing on taking cost out but how do we grow the top line here and drive profitability? Things we look for: We want bolt-ons primarily in the acquisition space. And as Mike talked about in the Ethanol space, we do look to partner with people to use -- selectively use minority capital. One of the things we're really, really proud of as a company: We don't just focus on internal capital allocation. Our shareholders are really important to us. So as we think about capital allocation, we're thinking about the whole pie, internal uses as well as external uses. We have paid dividends for 20 consecutive years in this company. And over the last 5 years, we've returned over $75 million in cash to our shareholders via dividends. So let's talk a little bit about our M&A process. I think again, key thing here is there is a process. We actually have a growth in acquisition handbook. It's our playbook. It doesn't give you everything, but it's a way to make sure we have a well-defined and well -- in a very measurable process. So what do we start with? We always start with strategic fit, okay. If it doesn't fit strategically, we don't move on. So what do we look for? We really want something that's core or adjacent. Does it address a customer need? Does it strengthen our geographic footprint or increase scale? And does it allow for differentiation? Those are all critical factors that we look at. We actually require all our businesses to do write-ups, a small one, not a lot of bureaucracy but -- to validate that we're strategically aligned and things fit. A lot of times, we don't just get past that filter quite honestly, and we see a lot of opportunities. Once we get past that filter, we look to build models from the bottom up. Typically, we're looking at IRR models. We're going to stress the key variables. That's both the micro that go into the model. But we also look at macro studies. I think Pat alluded to the fact that we did a study externally before we made the difficult decision to close retail. We do that for all our key investments. So we want to understand the macro environment as well as the key variables, and we're going to stress them like crazy. And as we do that and we get through that, we ultimately want to make sure if we move forward with an acquisition that we integrate it well. And so there's a process around integration. If we get through that cycle, then we see the fruits of our labor there. A couple things to look at. We do want our acquisitions to be accretive. We want them to be quickly accretive. I will note that because of the long-lived nature of some of the assets we acquire, it's not always possible to make them accretive in year 1. That's our target. But if they're beyond 2 years, it's just -- we just don't view them as the type of acquisition we want. We look for returns on capital based on risk adjustment. So Ethanol business has a higher return hurdle, candidly, than a Rail business, and it's appropriate. And so we adjust accordingly. And then again, we like a payback period of less than 10 years. And some of that is really tied to the long-lived nature of our assets. So not only do we invest, we actually go back and look historically every year with our board on how we did. So were we good at making our decisions? Weren't we good? And if we weren't, why? And if we were, why? But this chart here really gives you some of the key elements we share with our Board of Directors every year in evaluating our acquisitions. And what we hope to do is get better via the lessons learned. So if you look at the second from the right, the Sioux City, that's our Nutra-Flow acquisition. So that was our play to move bigger into value-added nutrients. And what you can see, so far, it's had a mixed bag performance. So if you look at the -- one of the key learnings, timing during the ag cycle has a critical impact on short-term performance. And so -- well, we believe that we're on-trend there. We're exactly where we want to be. We're probably a couple of years too early given the low-farm income environment as well as the margin compression we've seen in the space. So we've got to make sure we time correctly. Another thing that we learned from that acquisition is we didn't immediately get Andersons personnel on the ground. That delayed some of the synergies we were looking to take. But just as importantly, it delayed connectivity with those Nutra-Flow employees that came onboard with ANDE. I actually went out and visited those folks today. They really enjoy being part of our organization. But the quicker you can open arms and give them the security that they're part of the organization and how they fit, that's critical. Another thing we've learned is that in a lot of cases, we underestimate the CapEx required to bring facilities that we buy up to Andersons' standards. We have high EH&S standards. We have high safety standards. We're not going to jeopardize employees. And so we always emphasize how do we get those facilities up to speed. It always seems like we spend a little more than we had hoped. And then we talked a lot about the focus on key drivers of profitability. And so that's where that healthy tension comes in between the business and some of the corporate and planning folks and others to really validate and test those key assumptions and variables. And I think we've learned some lessons there. That's why we don't have some of the assets we have today because we didn't stress those variables and we didn't look at the macro side of the markets we were going into at a depth and level that we needed to. And so hopefully, we'll put -- and we will put these practices into play going forward. So this chart really just illustrates our 20-year dividend history. We've had a compound average growth rate of 15-plus percent over the 20 years. And so we're very proud of being able to return cash to our shareholders. This year, we paid a dividend of $0.64. And as we continue to grow, we would look to continue this record. So as we think about how we're going to evolve -- and you heard a little bit from each of the businesses in terms of where we're going to invest, what you see today is, on the left hand side, an EBITDA chart giving percentages of contribution from each of our businesses. And on the right-hand side, you see a bigger pie. So we do want to grow EBITDA, but we're also going to create a little bit more balance between the portfolio. We like all 4 of these businesses. You heard Mike talk a little bit about the Ethanol space and Pat talk about how we want to grow gallons profitably in that space, and we believe there is an opportunity to do that. And what you'll see is a more balanced contribution from each of our businesses going forward. Near term, we're going to continue our SAP roll-out. I hope by the end of 2018, we'll be substantially complete. The great thing about the systems we put in place is they're very scalable. And what do I mean by that? That means we don't have to add additional cost as we add new products or we bring on new businesses for the most part, and that gives us a lot of leverage going forward. We're going to grow our market share in both grain and organic fertilizer, and we're going to continue to drive operational efficiencies in our manufacturing environment. We are going to hit our productivity targets, and then we're going to drive more productivity going forward. And finally, we really are on track and want to continue to generate lots of EBITDA, and we're going to target $300 million of EBITDA generation in the year 2020 as a company, which would be a substantial improvement over where we are today. And to wrap up, I'll say we have a strong central finance team. I'm very proud of them. They rank very highly in terms of talent reviews in the company. And more importantly, there's a focus on analytics. How do we partner with the businesses to create a better analytical environment so we can make better decisions? We're adding shared services. So the company Pat talked had been a little bit siloed in the past. That doesn't mean we're taking operational responsibility from the businesses. But what it does mean is we want folks to own the work where they add the most value. And so AP, AR, we don't want Rash spending his time on AP, AR. We want experts in that space. So own the work where you own -- you add the most value. We're going to continue to drive profitability and lever our team and technology, and we're going to maintain that solid balance sheet so we can invest to grow. With that, I'm going to stop. We're going to bring up the rest of the group. Pat -- oh, Pat's going to conclude. Sorry, Pat. PATRICK E. BOWE: I really want to thank John for stepping up. He sounded like a fertilizer expert to me. So I was pretty impressed about how we're going to take care of plants like puppies. It's a great analogy. What I want to do in closing remarks is make it very brief so we'll have more time for questions. I don't want to take up a lot of time here. I think maybe you heard in our presentations today what I was taught in seventh grade -- it's taught in junior high by Mrs. [Friddel]. Tell them what you're going to tell them. Make 3 points. Tell them what you told them and sit down. So you maybe saw that happen. But then we hired professional advisers from Corbin. Rebecca Corbin is here, who really helped us put a lot of this together, and we thank you for your professionalism. I think what the key things I wanted you to think about in wrapping up here is that we told you a lot about our values and our background. We told you a lot about our passion for improving the business. We gave you a look at our vision, where we're going forward and our plans to grow. And most importantly, you met the team. So this is the senior leadership team. I like to use the term all-in. We are all-in to deliver this performance for this company. That's how we attracted people to come here, talented people from the outside and promoted people from in, to grow up in the company. And we're all-in to deliver on this. So to recap -- on the promises, we feel we're really well positioned to maximize long-term shareholder value creation. And we think about this agriculture businesses on -- in long terms, right. We're building a strong foundation and executing this turnaround strategy. I told you it was early innings. I like to win, right. And I didn't like the last 2 years. It was not fun for us as managing the business. It probably wasn't fun for some of you as investors, but we will deliver against our promises and get back into winning ways. We've done it before, and we can do it again. We want to manage what we can control. You heard a lot from John about order and productivity, on cost, on efficiency, back office. These are things we can control. Mike talked about technology and his plant. Corey talked about salespeople in the field. These are things we can control. Whether corn is $3 or $10, that isn't always up to us to control. Mother Nature has a lot to say in that. We can just be better at everything we do. We're looking to organically grow in our core businesses. We -- so since we've bolted on businesses that are close to what we know, we've been very successful at. So John showed you some of the reds and greens up there. The things we do well, we can continue to grow in those areas. So this is a big, huge agricultural industry. We have lots of opportunities to grow. We're excited about some of these specialty areas we talked about a couple of times. And we'll use investments in M&A as accelerators when it's appropriate. Again, I told you I'm an absolute zealot for safety. We've made significant improvements. We can never let down here. We can never have anybody go home with an injury at one of Andersons facilities or one of our contractors or, for that, one of our customers. You saw all those spray rigs on farmer fields. So we're very focused on that and that -- if you want a safe operation, you generally have good maintenance. If you have good maintenance, you have good bottom line deals and then have good performing organization. We're very focused on that lean and six sigma approach to running better operations. And lastly and maybe most importantly is investing in talent. They're not just the people you see in the room. We've talked about the people who are hiring out of schools. We never can slow down on that. We talked about our capital investments. We're still recruiting some of the top students out of colleges we can recruit into The Andersons and train them and develop them, but they'll someday become the Rashs and the Mike Irmens of The Andersons. We continue to do that. We won't slow down on that, because we love that pipeline of key talent that can grow up in the company. So I mentioned we want to win. I told you when winning isn't about we win, when -- as management, winning is about everyone wining. So winning is about our customers winning. Maybe that's probably the most important thing. You heard a lot about that today. Winning is about our communities winning, where we have jobs and facilities. We're a big part of these small town, agricultural communities. That's a big win for those communities. It's a win for our suppliers and our partners. And most importantly, it's a win for investors. So we understand that everyone needs to win, and we're committed to deliver that win for all of our stakeholders. So that's my summary points, and we'll bring everybody up here. We'll have plenty of time for Q&A. So all the presenters would come up, free form, just like we did, so mics in the audience and people online, too, that we can get those. Just pull them up? UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: (inaudible) PATRICK E. BOWE: Yes, either way, okay. There's a pecking order to this. We just have to figure it out. We've got the first one here. Or John, sorry about that. John? Questions and Answers JOHN KRAUS: Name and organization please, Rob? ROBERT ALAN HENDERSON, PRINCIPAL AND PORTFOLIO MANAGER, RUTABAGA CAPITAL MANAGEMENT LLC: Rob Henderson from Rutabaga Capital Management in Boston. For each of the businesses, you laid out near-term and long-term goals. Can you just give us a rough idea on how much help you need from the corn price to reach those goals? PATRICK E. BOWE: I think I will now leave it to the other guys, go. It's not just specific about corn price. I think you heard about farm income and more about volatility in markets. What's tough for -- I'll say on the Grain business side, slow, declining grain markets that don't move much, right. So with a big production, we just kind of grind down slowly. That's hard for trading. It's good for storage income, which is okay because it's not all volatility. So volatility is as important as anything. We need big corn crops to sell a lot of fertilizer. I think you heard that. And even with these low prices and the economics of using this fertilizer, we'll still be planting big crops of corn through the coming years. I think the key thing is ethanol actually doesn't mind having a little bit of a lower corn price. And we watch that spread between gasoline and corn real closely. That's important for that business. So it's giving a complex answer to a simple question. We want to see thriving farmers, and we want to see volatility in a global marketplace that's really moving. And it may need some supply disruptions to get that volatility to come back. JOHN KRAUS: Want to add anything? PATRICK E. BOWE: [Alex], thanks for coming down from Boston, by the way. JOHN KRAUS: Okay. Go there and then to [Alex] right here. UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Okay, I'll go ahead. On the finance part you were talking about, can you be a little bit more specific on some of the new disciplines that are in there? And it just helps us to understand how that process has been strengthened and improved. JOHN J. GRANATO: Sure. So we actually implemented a tool called Host Analytics, which is a planning tool in and of itself. It also has modeling capability. And what that does, again, is allow us to drive better forecasting because we have the ability to not only look back but project forward, and then we can partner with the business unit leadership as we do the analysis. And really, what it does is it streamlines a process so we can talk about the things that drive the business and have the critical debates and healthy tension that we need to, to make the right investment decisions. That's one example of how we're delivering information. We also have a reporting tool we've talked -- put in place called [Click]. And so when you look at disparate systems, different locations, again, how do you gather information quickly? And that tool allows us to put information real-time on the desk of people. Corey can talk about how he uses it. CORBETT J. JORGENSON: Very practical, on-the-ground kind of answer. It came from a place where we had reports in paper and in books day to day, and they're coming from a lot of different systems. Today, I can go into [Click] and I can see our grain positions every morning. I can see our truck unloads from the prior day at every facility that we have in the SAP platform. And I can see our P&L marks-to-market every morning on -- live in that system. It also has expense accruals going on a live basis throughout the course of the month. So it's a great live right there, all-in-one platform kind of system that provides great information for decision making. PATRICK E. BOWE: It's a good question, [Alex], because I think this gets boring or mundane from time to time, it's productivity. So we have, every night, these 600 trucks that pull into Champaign, Illinois,. let alone the thousands all around our network. And every night, you process these tickets. A person takes a grain. A person takes a sample. They type it in. They roll it up. It's all manual, and those jobs don't exist anymore. And the person who probes the trucks out there, but then he goes into the system automatically. In our SAP backbone, we pull that data out every night. So we can process those tickets, pay the farmers. All this automatic, and get a report to the traders real-time, right. So -- now that happened before but through a phone call and a lot of people doing a lot of manual work. And we talked that some of that headcount reduction came from innovations, like that. JOHN KRAUS: Farha? FARHA ASLAM: All right. Rash, congratulations, first of all. RASESH H. SHAH: Thank you. FARHA ASLAM: And you spoke a lot about history of Rail. Could you just think about the near-term dynamics, what you're seeing in terms of lease rates right now and the dislocations that are happening in the rail market right now. Is that benefiting The Andersons? Or is that a challenge? RASESH H. SHAH: Good question. Do you want to say anything? UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: No. RASESH H. SHAH: Okay. So near term, I think earlier, I talked about that we are -- Rail is not at the bottom and not at the top, somewhere just above the bottom. In the good times, we build far too many railcars. So there is overhang that continues to be there. The GDP continues to improve, which is putting more traffic year-over-year on Rail. And as more traffic comes on Rail, the dwell times and the velocity, they work in our favor, which creates a demand for railcars. I expect lease rates for certain car types to go up slightly. But at least for the near term, most car types will trade in the current range. So not a lot of opportunity on the lease side right now. My focus is to get the 87% utilization that we have, push it towards 90% and 92% or even 100%. Joe? JOHN J. GRANATO: No pressure. PATRICK E. BOWE: The story continues. RASESH H. SHAH: Was that -- okay. UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: I'm [Alex Focum] from HSBC. I have a question for the Plant Nutrient Group. The -- in what scale does the merge between Potash and Agrium affect your business? Do you think there's an opportunity since they're going to be focusing on getting some synergies there? Or do you think that puts you in a weaker position competitively? PATRICK E. BOWE: Good point. Thanks for bringing that up. So earlier, I talked about major mergers. And there was one in the fertilizer space between PotashCorp and Agrium. The interesting part is -- John described our business, right. It's that we are a wholesale distributor in the eastern Grain Belt with our commodity NPK with strategically placed, large fertilizer warehouses, right. So that -- my end product that comes out of Canada or from Florida or even offshore imported has to move through an inland terminal and warehouse infrastructure. We are the player there. So today, we happen to buy from Potash. We also happen to buy from Agrium. Those buy from CF and Mosaic. We buy from everybody. Now maybe -- this is my own opinion, that merger could help some of the discipline. And when I say discipline, I don't mean it's illegal, price-fixing terms. I just mean discipline in the pricing of some of those commodities and how they run their mines because it has been a difficult time for the miners. As you've seen, as stocks come down and as the abundance came forward in supplies, it's a lot of price pressure. That might impact that. That remains to be seen. The interesting part about it, Agrium has a very big retail presence in the retail storage around the country, we sell to them, right. And we sell some of our value-added specialty products through those. So it's a 3-tiered market, right. So you have the mining and then you have a wholesale distribution and then you have retail. And there's some up-and-down within the organization. We play in all spaces. So we're partnering and doing business and with new partners, like Farmers Business Network, in the fertilizer space. We do -- we run our own storage at our green facility, where we sell retail to farmers, and we do a lot from wholesale distribution for others. So I gave you a long answer to say I don't think it's going to impact The Andersons specifically. That's a big merger and there are some very big targets. They're both very well run companies and are great suppliers to us and have been for many years. So we wish them the best of success with that new combined company. JOHN KRAUS: Okay. [Kat], you've got a question? Oh, okay. Go ahead, Eric. ERIC JON LARSON: This -- Eric Larson, Buckingham. This goes to -- gets to a little bit broader question that was previously asked. The way that we've always seen agricultural companies build their business is in Cargill, ADM in early years. As you buy assets at the bottom of the cycle and we've had a pretty tough cycle already. We're bumping on the bottom. And I know for the farmers, real -- farmland prices have really been pretty sticky on the downside. It hasn't given a lot of opportunity. Are you starting to see some opportunities in places where you want to build, maybe in some of your higher value-added change? Or is there enough, I guess, financial pressure to get you guys to a point where you can actually make some really decent asset purchases? PATRICK E. BOWE: I'll start. I'd like each of the guys to respond here. It's a very good point. In the long-term analysis, the guy who buys at the bottom buys best, right. It's tough picking bottom sometimes. John gave the story of Nutra-Flow. We feel it's strategically on point. We like the products. We like the people. We like the assets we have. We didn't buy it at the bottom. We bought it on the way down. We thought it provided a good value. Actually, this happened before I came. It looked to be good value, but market's got quite a bit worse in fertilizer the next 2 years. We still think it's the right business for the long term. We've looked at some other acquisitions with that. Maybe we should wait a little bit because it's hard to time the perfect time. You also have to have, \"Are you ready? Can you integrate it? Do you have the right team?\" And you grab the synergies that you need to drive these kind of returns in a tough cycle because we have a couple of more years. Back to the chart John showed you, you want it accretive quickly. If you didn't buy it at the low, it could be a tougher compare. So I'm trying to be smart with that. And that's when the rigor of the process that John showed on M&A. And the discipline -- Mike's example on Ethanol, where we spend a lot of money and time and engineering to the value-added feed product. And we took that write down of that pre-engineering because it just was going to be too expensive and the IRRs didn't pencil like we like. So we stopped it, and we think we've got a better one for the future. So the answer to your question is, yes, we prefer to be a value buyer. Some of you in the room -- phone, that are value buyers, but it's about how does it fit with you? Is it the right technology? Is it the right location? And go through all those key criteria to make it the right acquisition at the right time. CORBETT J. JORGENSON: I'll add in a green space, which has been talked about, I think, by other public companies in calls over the last quarter or two. There's certainly more conversation happening. There's a lot of people talking about possibilities of -- it can be swaps. It can be partnerships. It can be actual M&A happening. I think your observation about land prices is similar. I don't think there's a whole bunch of distressed opportunity out there today. So there's -- and there's people looking at their portfolios and thinking about ways they can shore up, but we haven't seen a bunch of distressed opportunities and specifically not in that footprint where we want to grow strategically. That's a green answer. PATRICK E. BOWE: And you have those -- just I'll give you an example. Corey and I, in the last group had discussions at the top 6 to 8 grain firms. And we're -- all of us are looking at how we can optimize what we have and maybe say, \"I'll buy this from you and you buy this one for me.\" Or there may be some of that trading that goes on that may not be just pure straight-up mergers or acquisitions or maybe asset optimization. So we're part of the good news. We're big enough. We're part of those discussions. And we have some assets that are attractive, and we have some things that maybe we could optimize by making a swap. I don't mean that in a financial term swap, but just as a way to optimize for both parties. JOHN KRAUS: Okay, Ken? KENNETH BRYAN ZASLOW: I have both a qualitative and a quantitative question. On the qualitative side, you guys talked about obviously hiring new management teams at the senior level. What are you doing below that level? What is the new insertion of talent? And then where do you find the -- which divisions do you think have the greatest opportunity there to get rid of people or to actually transfer people? Because there's a lot going on, on the personnel side of it. So that's the first question. PATRICK E. BOWE: Yes. I'll lead with that one and happy for anybody to chime in. One of the reasons I brought my trusted HR partner, invaluable and chat with me is very disciplined processes on recession planning, use of tool, the 9-box, to evaluate talent, our annual PMP processes. You have to have that rigor in HR that makes you have a talent assessed well. I said earlier we had some timing on retirements. (inaudible) tell me, if we had 10 more years of Rash Shah, we'll be happy campers. He's a great player. And sometimes, we have people that hit that (inaudible). So we had a gap in that case, we had some great talent in the Rail business that were just below the experience level to be ready to be the president level, but they will be. And so what we're doing is they're part of our leadership academy and talent development. We have some target areas we look to improve, Mike mentioned engineering. Because I came from a wet mill and ethanol production background, the more technology advanced it gets, the more smart people you need and more technical engineers. Mike's added to his team perhaps some people from outside companies, just here recently that are really helping us already with insight. So that's a specific one. And then you heard us all talk about sales talent, right. It's unique skill to be out in the field with farmers and a lot. So we have a great group of people in our company, but we're always looking to augment that. And we're excited to bring Jeff Blair on especially with the sales and marketing background, which is a big part of our PN business. We have a lot of product experts in PN. We have people that have been in for 30 years, know nitrogen better than anybody. That isn't the shortfall, in my opinion, where we go with value-added. You need really professionally executed sales. And we're really excited to -- Jeff, that's a passionate area for him and has good experience. So those are the targeted areas we have. Overall, I mentioned you never stop hiring from the bottom. We had a great crop of summer interns. We try to get the best we can and then hire the best of those. Anytime you slow up on that, it comes back to haunt you maybe 5 years later. So we want to keep investing in talent at the entry level of our organization. And I mentioned earlier what I'm probably most excited about. We have some great talent in The Andersons a lot that are merging in their careers that are really going to be top professionals in the years to come. KENNETH BRYAN ZASLOW: The next question I have -- and I ask it only because I can back into the Ethanol outlook. So John, don't think this is a a-ha moment. But if I look at the 2020 pie chart and in the presentations, Rail and Grain actually have the exact same EBITDA expectations, but yet the percentages for the 2020 was 24% to 27% for Rail and 27% to 30%. So they had the same numbers, but they have the different percentages. And I was actually just trying to use that back into the Ethanol profitability expectation. So that's why I asked the question. JOHN J. GRANATO: A fair question. I think we'll look at those numbers and get back to you. John, I don't -- I think you had put that chart together. JOHN KRAUS: Yes. JOHN J. GRANATO: So do you have any insight on that? JOHN KRAUS: Well, I think you're talking about the change in the piece of the pie from Ethanol. Is that your... KENNETH BRYAN ZASLOW: I think the pie is 5% of profitability. JOHN KRAUS: Total EBITDA, yes? KENNETH BRYAN ZASLOW: Right. And then in the individual presentations, the EBITDA for Rail and Grain was the same. But then I was just going to use that as a percentage back into what the implied of your Ethanol would be. That was my thought and then I realized that wouldn't work if the percentages aren't right. JOHN KRAUS: Right. Well... KENNETH BRYAN ZASLOW: That's why I just wanted to make sure I was doing some math right. And I know it's excluding the corporate expenses. I don't know if there's an allocation issue. So that's just really a clarification. JOHN KRAUS: Yes. I think specifically, we'll need to get back to you. The other thing that I would say about Ethanol EBITDA is that because of our structure, we have interest and depreciation adjustments that are buried, that aren't part of that number. That could be part of that number if we were allowed to disclose them that way. So -- and the other thing is that -- and I think both Mike and John talked about it, that assumes the addition of more gallons to the footprint as well. CORBETT J. JORGENSON: I'll give you a little levity, Ken. That means I'll hit the high side of my target. John's got a little more time to get into the mid and upper side of his. JOHN J. GRANATO: I can see that with the (inaudible) PATRICK E. BOWE: Also, Ken, I think the lumpy is on EBITDA and it specifically is timing of acquisitions, right. So we didn't talk about a major blockbuster but if Mike talked about technology in his business and how that might play out, Corey talked about food and our specialty ag and fertilizer, I don't know when those -- the lumpiness of that. And so that's -- I'm not so hung up about that percentage. Are they going to be 23% or 26%? Our goal is that we want to keep a balance, but we're going to put M&A through that same M&A stream. And the best returning project is the one in this business. That's what we're going to do. We use Rail as a -- I'll call it, a buffer but a very good use of cash, and it's been a very good returner. And now with this restructuring of putting Rail essentially separate, we can give them plenty of oxygen and leverage for that business to grow. And that will be -- cause any less cash to be available for the rest of the company. So I think that's a -- kind of really smart move with John and John Kraus, our tax guys have put together for Rash and the team. So that can help us, too. JOHN KRAUS: I have a -- actually a question from the Internet, and I want to thank [John Baird] from [Sunwealth Advisors]. So I'll see you for submitting this, and thanks for listening, John. This is for Rash. Can any of your railcars that are used to transport grain be retrofitted to transport frack sand and either be leased or sold to frack sand companies, particularly to those companies with operations in the Upper Midwest? RASESH H. SHAH: Yes, a good question. When the last frack sand boom -- when we didn't have enough small cube covered hoppers built, we, in fact, did put a lot of big cars, grain cars into sand service. Today, the situation is not there. We built enough sand cars over the last few years to take care of that demand. It is not that it can't be done. It is too big a car for the bulk density of the product. So on a very selective, very high-demand market where they cannot get the small cube covered hoppers, we could send some of our 47, 50 cubic foot covered hoppers to grain cars to take care of that. JOHN KRAUS: Okay. Do we have any more questions from our audience? Okay, with that, I would really like to thank you again for the investment of 0.5 day in The Andersons and your attention to our story. We're proud of the company. We're excited for the future, and we would again really like to invite you to lunch next door. We'll have a couple of members of our management team at each table. So maybe you can pick your spots based on your particular interest. And again, thanks for coming, and we wish you safe travels back home. PATRICK E. BOWE: And happy holidays, and please join us for a Q&A follow-up and for lunch next door. We'll all be sitting there and love to have any other conversations you'd like to have. Thanks again.

It's crucial for governments to act because agrifood has the potential to boost its contribution to the national economy, he told the Senate agriculture committee which is studying the impact of climate change on farming. \"There's a golden moment and a golden opportunity here for Canadian agriculture and that this opportunity was recognized by Dominic Barton in his report from the Advisory Council on Economic Growth earlier this year,\" he said. The government has a key role in making the golden moment reach its potential. He recommended the government \"incentivize breeding programs, both for our crops and for our livestock that promote heat tolerance, drought tolerance or pest tolerance. ... For much of the 20th century, our breeding programs focused on simply boosting yields at the exclusion of traits such as resilience.\" \"But I think by shifting government funding programs to support research into climate-resilient crops and livestock and then by engaging in public-private partnerships with input suppliers, we can provide farms with the genetic tools they need to adapt. \"Similarly, we can also create incentives for farmers to use more agri-ecological principles that will help improve resilience as well,\" he said. \"Creating incentives to encourage crop rotation or conservation practices help because these practices build up the organic matter in our soils, and this is important because organic matter acts like a sponge, trapping water when it's abundant and saving it for when it's needed.\" The committee should also focus on agriculture's potential to use technology to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, he said. Digital technologies, \"which include smart tractors that know where they are in the field and plant the right seed in the right place and give it the right amount of fertilizer with no waste, are sometimes called Agriculture 4.0.\" 'They give us the opportunity to produce more food with fewer greenhouse gas emissions, and since agriculture is responsible for a third of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, this is really important. \"At the moment, however, Ag 4.0 is in its infancy, both in Canada and internationally,\" he said. \"For instance, it requires huge amounts of data to be integrated. That smart tractor needs to take soil maps, needs to integrate it with Environment Canada weather station data and needs to take remote sensing data from our satellites and bring it all together. \"At the moment, this sort of data integration isn't happening, and as a result, we as a global society as well as a country are not realizing the potential of these new technologies,\" he said. \"I think this, however, represents an ideal opportunity for Canada to show leadership.\" Ottawa could help by \"developing protocols pertaining to data sharing, cybersecurity, data ownership and data integration that would apply across the entire agri-food sector and make Canada a leader in developing and applying the technologies that will allow us to produce more food with fewer greenhouse gas emissions.\" The committee should also consider carefully the agriculture potential of Northern Canada as the climate warms, he said. \"Our northern soils are very fragile and are huge reservoirs of carbon.\" \"Some work I've been involved in suggests that if we start seriously cultivating northern soils, we will create huge new carbon emissions that will destroy Canada's ability to meet our Paris accord commitments.\" \"This doesn't mean that agriculture can't happen; it means we have to be creative about it. \"Maybe instead of thinking about wheat fields or soybean fields in the North, we think about extensive bison or caribou production that is then deliberately marketed to international discriminating markets,\" he said. Adaptive farming practices and expanded use of digital technology could help the agrifood sector \"become more adaptable to climate change and extreme weather but also reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and build new export markets by demonstrating to our trading partners that our food is the most sustainably produced in the world, thereby establishing a brand Canada.\" \"Similarly, I think we can develop secondary markets to sell climate-friendly agricultural technologies to our trading partners.\""}, {"title": "EUO Eurocontrol loses $1.39-million in Q3 2017", "article": "Eurocontrol Technics Group Inc (TSX-V:EUO) Shares Issued 90,750,238 Last Close 11/30/2017 $0.075 Thursday November 30 2017 - News Release An anonymous director reports EUROCONTROL REPORTS THIRD QUARTER 2017 RESULTS Eurocontrol Technics Group Inc. has filed its financial statements and management's discussion and analysis for its third quarter ended Sept. 30, 2017. Financial and operating highlights - Revenue from continuing operations of $1,761,005 in the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2017, an 86-per-cent increase from revenues in the same period in 2016; - Gross profit of $265,478 and $859,586 in the respective three- and nine-month periods ended Sept. 30, 2017; - Recognized second quarter net loss excluding discontinued operations of $3,746,226, compared with a net loss of $3,942,113 in 2016; - Year to date 2017 investment in research and development of approximately $2.4-million. In the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2017, revenue, excluding discontinued operations, increased to $1,761,005 from $947,484 for the same period in 2016. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the three-month period ended Sept. 30, 2017, remained consistent at $(1,474,501) compared with $(1,463,945) for three months ended Sept. 30, 2016. EBITDA for the nine-month period ended Sept. 30, 2017, was $(4,248,907) compared with $14,335,515 for the same period in 2016. This decrease in EBITDA was due primarily to the one-time gain realized by the company on the sale of its former subsidiary, Global Fluids International (GFI) SA, to SICPA SA on Jan. 4, 2016, and higher sales and marketing expenses incurred during the first nine months of 2017. For the three- and nine-month periods ended Sept. 30, 2017, the company had gross profit of $265,478 (2016 -- $154,568) and $859,586 (2016 -- $362,571), respectively, representing an increase of 72 per cent and 137 per cent in these periods in 2017 compared with the same periods in 2016. The company recorded a net loss of $1,395,949 and $3,746,226 in these three- and nine-month periods in 2017, compared with its net loss of $1,189,360 and $3,942,113 for the respective comparative periods in 2016, primarily as a result of the increased gross profit from continuing operations. Bruce Rowlands, chairman and chief executive officer, stated: \"We are pleased with the solid growth in revenue from continued operations in the nine month reporting period in 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, and our potential to continue this trend in the future through increased sales of our renewed Xenemetrix product line. Given the superior performance that has been achieved in a variety of semiconductor applications tested to date by our XwinSys team, we plan to continue our customer development initiatives, however with the expected long and unpredictable sales cycle for this new metrology technology, Eurocontrol has integrated certain XwinSys personnel within Xenemetrix's operations to consolidate and reduce expenses to ensure continuity of technological know-how whilst XwinSys continues to engage with its potential customers. With regard to Croptimal, our disruptive precision agriculture testing technology is continuing to deliver positive results providing us with an opportunity to leverage our investment with potential partners.\" Subsequent to the end of the third quarter, Mr. Rowlands has completed his consulting obligations to SICPA GFI as described in the purchase agreement between Eurocontrol and SICPA Finance SA that was finalized Jan. 4, 2016 -- Mr. Rowlands took no compensation for his contribution.

JUVEKAR, GLOBAL HEAD OF CHEMICALS AND AGRICULTURE AND MD, CITIGROUP INC, RESEARCH DIVISION: (technical difficulty) And we are pleased to have Jochen Tilk, PotashCorp's CEO. He joined the company in 2014. Mr. Tilk became -- came to PotashCorp after a 30-year career in the mining industry. As many of you know, PotashCorp and Agrium, they're closing their historic merger, which is scheduled to consummate pretty soon. So for an update on that transaction and an update on global potash fertilizer markets, please join me in welcoming Jochen to the podium. JOCHEN E. TILK, CEO, PRESIDENT & DIRECTOR, POTASH CORPORATION OF SASKATCHEWAN INC.: Good to see you, P.J. Good morning. Actually, I think I'm mic-ed up, so I should be able -- excuse me, I should be able to stand here and speak. Can everyone hear me very well? Excellent. Good morning. It's a pleasure to be here and return. Thank you, P.J., for the introduction. I am here today to give you a few updates after the slide -- the obligatory slide. And what I wanted to speak today is, firstly, a bit of an update on markets, and I'll do focus on the potash market, but I'll speak a bit on nitrogen and phosphate. I'll give you a bit of a perspective that we have where we think directionally things will go. And also, I'd like to give you a bit of a very brief update on the merger between PotashCorp and Agrium and what we think will happen in the next couple of weeks. First, company overview. Most of you are familiar with PotashCorp of Saskatchewan. Potash is our core nutrient and has been for many years. Last year, our gross margin or contribution in gross margin was about 53% of Potash. And historically, it's 55, 60-ish, so very consistent with the past. Nitrogen and phosphate tended to be contributors, but you can see that the phosphate piece in this pie has shrunk quite a bit. And that's really the situation in phosphate and certainly our cost position in phosphate. I'll speak to that a little bit more. But that's our distribution. Of course, after the merger, that will change, and the new company, Nutrien, will have a distribution of gross margin, which is quite different because obviously, 2 companies bring in 2 different portfolios but very complementary portfolios, I should say. I'll start with a market update, and then I'll move from the general market on crop to the nutrient markets, to the fertilizer markets. And then I'll highlight potash, and I'll speak about some of our thoughts on historic demand, inventory buildup versus actual demand and then where we see the next couple of years should go. And I'll speak to the supply and demand as well, that -- the S&D always is the big question, the big elephant in the room. In terms of crop prices, and if you look at the last 3 years, it's a bit of a boring story, to be fair, because the price this year in 2017 compared to the average -- rolling average over the last 3 years has been fairly consistent. When you look at soybean, corn sugar and palm oil, not a lot of change. The good news is, and I'll show that later, that in -- as a percentage, fertilizer affordability is actually -- has actually improved and is consistently high, which speaks to the supporting the application of nutrients. Going to the countries just in a bit more detail. India has had a good year. Monsoon has been quite good. The government has implemented some policy, some high import duties on oilseed products. But overall, as you know, the years in India tend to be a lot weather driven, and this year, the monsoon has been good. Asia. Our palm oil's prices remain supportive. 2016 was a year of drought. And Asia, driven by Malaysia, Indonesia, is actually coming back, bringing yields up in those plantations again. And we see that in the demand for potash. In particular, palm oil is a huge consumer -- or palm oil plants -- oil palms are a huge consumer of potash. The other story in Asia is that food and food quality and food -- demand on food is going up quite a bit. And that's most driven by either growth in population but also in the demand for higher-quality, higher-protein foods. North America. The story here really is that once again, we had a higher-than-expected crop. Those who follow the USDA predictions, and I think most of you do probably, somewhere midyear, it all shifted, and soybean and corn once again tend to be somewhat higher than expected. So this would be almost the fifth year in a row that we had normal crops. Of course, the -- that bodes for lower prices in the crop, and we see that in corn, and we see that in soybean. But on the other hand, American farmers are depleting soils. They know that. And so at the end of each -- one of these record years, we tend to see very high demand in nutrients to replenish that. And potassium is one of the demands or one of the nutrients that tend to be focused on replenishing soils. Latin America. Driven mostly by Brazil, it's been another very good year. We see favorable barter ratios in Brazil and have been for a while, that always supports fertilizer demand. We see a continuing story in the expansion of acreage. Brazil is one of the few countries in the world that's still adding land to farming. It has slowed down a little bit, and we see an increased focus on the safrinha planting, which is the second crop in the year which has grown in significance. And what it does actually for us, it kind of equals the demand a little bit because it takes some of the seasonality out. And China finally. We see farm consolidation. China is a story -- when we talk about crops, we tend to think North America, Brazil, which is corn and which is sugar, which is soybean. But thinking crops as well as cash crops like vegetables, fruits, which demand a lot more fertilizer, and China has a good soy population. China loves that, demands that, and the input on fertilizer there is significantly higher than it is in some of the more generic crops that we see across North America and Brazil. And so when we think crop prices, we also have to think domestically what that means in China for those. And then we see some reduction in the subsidy corn prices, but it's somewhat offset by the ethanol policy in China, which actually supports planting of corn. So a bit of an equilibrium on that front. So in summary, the year has been good, in particular in terms of output, which as long as fertilizer is affordable, for us is a positive story because it means replenishing and putting fertilizer into the ground. So what does that mean for pricing in general? I start with the 3 nutrients, and I'll focus in on potash from a longer-term picture. Potash is certainly affordable in terms of pricing. We've seen a good appreciation. Prices are up year-over-year, approximately 20%, which is a great story for us. And I have a bit of a chart that breaks that down later on. The agronomic need, which means the ratio of nutrients, is driving that as well. We look at a number, for example, the N-to-K ratio or NPK ratio, but I'll take N-to-K, which is nitrogen to potassium. And countries like India put a lot more nitrogen into the ground, as you know, than potash. But the agronomic analysis, which suggests to balance it out in time, that's certainly a scientific point. But we see that trend moving. People actually focus on that as they put nutrients into the ground. And that's been supported by relatively good affordability in relation to the crop prices that I mentioned. We look at nitrogen, we've seen strong demand, and we've seen reduced Chinese exports now in the second year. Exports year-over-year are down almost 40%. And I think people asked a year ago, is the reduction of local domestic nitrogen production in China, is that sustainable? And I think the answer today, I would say, it is sustained because of environmental policies, because of the high cost. There's incremental production coming in of nitrogen in China that will replace some of that, but the question will be, is that just a displacement of old production? Or is that new production? I think overall, I'd say we believe that the reduction of output in China is sustainable, and that has an impact. We do expect volatility in pricing for a number of reasons. And some of the main reasons is there is new production that has come on in the United States, a number of plants. That's now leveling off, and there is some curtailment that takes place at lower prices in nitrogen. Russia, as an example, that has an impact. Overall, from a trend perspective, we do think that the nitrogen picture will improve in 2018, particularly in the second half into 2019. That volatility will be there, but the -- essentially, the new production will flow through the system, will be absorbed and that the reduction of Chinese production there for export will be sustained. In phosphate, we've seen seasonal demand. You can see that little peak there on the top line. There's essentially an adjustment to seasonal demand mostly because of input pricing. Input price is going up. Sulfur has gone up. Ammonia has gone up. And that's translated into MAP and DAP production. We do think the longer-term story would be impacted by expansions by OCP and Martin. They will -- they have announced and they have said so, that they will continue to -- and along that effort. And I think that will have -- that will weigh on the market. In particular, North American producers like us, we think our costs are higher, our costs or WACC. And so for -- so when we look at the longer-term story in phosphate, somewhat less bullish perhaps than we do in potash and nitrogen. So that's the overall picture in all 3 nutrients. Just going to potash and just making a point in affordability, which is a big driver. Comparing that to last year and the year before, and you'll recall that the 3-year average of crop price has been relatively consistent. What has changed is that prices have come down. This is a chart that shows the percentage of crop prices as an index of nutrient prices, in this case, potash prices. And then next, because we put a bunch of crops together, and the index for potash means we put a bunch of different prices in the world, FOB and CFR together. The higher that number is, that means crops are, relatively speaking, higher priced. The lower the number is, it means fertilizer is higher priced. And you can see that particularly in 2017, the affordability has been consistently high compared, for example, in 2015. And that means that farmers, despite what crop prices are today, certainly are intrigued and incentivized to put in additional crops to be sure -- sorry, additional nutrients to be sure that the soil is balanced. Potash consumption and shipment growth. This is a chart that looks at the consumption of potash in the last 5 years. And it's 2013, the last 4 years, plus 1 year looking forward. So 2018 is a forecast. And then we offset that chart essentially with potash shipment growth. So the point here is whether demand and shipment are equal. And you think in time, it does, but there's always the question about inventory buildup and whether or not some potash goes into inventory and what is the impact. If you look at the last 4 years plus 2018 looking forward, and there's good visibility in 2018, just the way the contracts have worked, just the way some of the producers, us included, know what -- in particular the first half of 2018, what it will look like, I think this is a pretty good representation of 5 years. And you can see that the demand story is really driven by China and India for potash and Asia and South America. As expected, not so much by North America because we have a very consistent demand as we had in the past going forward. But on the average, the increase in fertilizer and potash fertilizer consumption has been 4%. And these are [serous] numbers, by the way. These are not numbers that we've put in so there's hopefully less of a -- or no bias on those numbers. 4% is higher than what we have projected on average. Our projection is about 2.5% to 3%. So the last 4 years have dealt with perhaps some aberrations. And when you look at the shipment growth, that is very consistent how it corresponds to the countries. So you could see that most of the potash growth has been in China, India, Asia and Latin America, as you would expect from the previous -- from the product on the left side here. So that -- and keep that in mind as reflecting on the last 5 years. And I think we believe it certainly is an indicator on where potash should end up going forward. This chart looks back, but it also looks further into the future. So it comes about 20 years. And 17 of those are looking back retrospectively, and then 5 years are looking into the future. And this is demand for potash in different crops. As I mentioned earlier, we look mostly at grain, oilseeds, but you can see that foods and vegetables and other crops are pretty significant. The orange line is actually the potash consumption. And with exception of the financial crisis in 2007, '08, '09, in that time period, where it was truly an aberration driven by world economic events. This line is almost perfectly consistent with the demand of those crops in terms of consumption. So we look at, on an annual basis, a lot of variation. But when we look over 20 years, we simply follow the increase in demand of these crops, driven by the increase in world population. I mean, that's a simple statement in its way, but it's certainly one supported by this chart. And when you look into the future, as long as you believe that those years will continue to grow as they have in the past, that should translate almost immediately into the same increase of potash fertilizer consumption. When you look at the other side of the equation, which is the supply and demand, the S&D part, it's always been a story that there was more operational capability in potash than there was actual demand. And this has been historically, as you know, part of how the potash market has worked. We anticipate some of that going forward with existing production capability, with new production capability, but that will level out eventually. So if you take this graph out another couple of years, that red line will level out just given that virtually all the projects are now coming into fruition -- have come into fruition and will be operational at their capability in the next couple of years. And of course, the green bar, we expect to continue to grow. And when you look at where we expect that to be, somewhere around 70 million tonnes by 2020, which is consistent with the growth projection of the previous slide. The big point here is that our view is that operation capability and demand are relatively close together as they have in the past. So there is not really a big change. And we saw that particularly in the last year, in 2017. The demand has been the real story for us. We have been sold out most of the year. Canpotex has been sold out most of the year. I think our competitors were committed most of the year. And we anticipate a similar picture in 2018, a very tight narrow balance consistent with the past, which, in our opinion, bodes well for the trends that I've outlined in some of the previous slides. A couple of comments about our strategic focus. So I talked about the crop markets. I talked about the fertilizer nutrient market, specific about potash, what we see in demand growth, how we think inventories will measure up and then certainly looking into the future in terms of supply and demand. How do we position ourselves? And a couple of years ago, I spoke about 4 specific strategic focus areas when I came on as CEO 4 years ago. One was that we would continue to respond to markets in our potash approach, that we would modify or adjust our assets in a way that we will only produce what was demanded in the market. And we have done consistently so. We have certainly adjusted some of our mines. An example that we put up here is that one of our mines, we turn into an all-white soluble fertilizer producer, away from the generic fertilizer so that we would capture that higher margin and not necessarily be left with incremental capacity. The second focus on that was a portfolio optimization. We were committed not to run at a higher cost, that we would move consistently our operations away into the lowest quartile that we could -- or in the lower quartile. And we've done that in a number of ways. We've suspended one of our mines in New Brunswick because it was higher cost. We focused on Rocanville, our flagship now, which has production capability of 6.5 million tonnes per year. It's the world's largest potash mine at this point. And we've reduced our cost about 50% over time by bringing our cash costs down consistently. And part of that was the reduction, the suspension of high-cost operation. The other part was the support and building up capacity of our lowest-cost operations. Financial flexibility. We're devoted to make sure that our balance sheet was pristine. We've taken some difficult steps. We cut our dividend twice. But we also reduced our capital. And 2 years ago, our capital outflow was $1.2 billion. This year, in 2017, it will be about $600 million or even less than $600 million, which is half of what we spent several years ago. So we've focused on financial prudence, not bringing -- just bringing our operating costs down but also our capital. And we realigned the dividend, as I mentioned, to be more consistent with market but also more consistent with our balance sheet. And the other strategic focus that we looked at was diversification, looking at building the company and growing. And of course, P.J. said in his announcement, that resulted in the merger with Agrium, which we announced in September a year ago and that we anticipate to close by the end of the year. And of course, I'll say a few more words to that in a second, but this merger has so much strategic benefit to us in terms of synergies, in terms of strategic opportunity and growth in terms of diversification, that we certainly are very pleased having moved forward on this particular objective. One slide I wanted to show and conclude on, on my comments on potash, and I alluded to that, is just to keep in mind how the year has improved from last year. On those -- through it, when we talk about what potash -- how potash responds in our P&L, it's really 3 things. It's the sales price -- the average sales price; the volume that we sell, and of course, the cost of goods at which we produce it. In all 3 areas, we've seen tremendous improvement over the year. So when we look at the average realized price, which is a composite of all the markets we sell to, including Canpotex or our part of Canpotex, prices have gone up about $25, $29, which is almost 20%. I mentioned it early. That's a significant trend from '16 into '17. The volumes for us, these are our volumes shipped, have gone up 7% in the 12-month period, which is important for us because it happened at the same time price has gone up. And then as I mentioned, our cost of goods have come down and, in the 12 months alone, have come down 16%. In the 5 years, our costs are down about USD 50. So that's just the story for us in the last 12 months in potash. And we're certainly influenced by that in -- looking into 2018. My final comments are just on the merger. The -- we have received regulatory approval, which was the biggest hurdle, I think, for us in general in the countries. In 5 of the 6 countries, Brazil, Canada, China, India and Russia, we have made some concessions, and we have committed to divesting of our minority investments in Arab Potash Company, in ICL and in SQM. And we're in the process of doing so. We have -- we're now in the final stages of discussing with the Federal Trade Commission in the United States. We do anticipate and we continue to believe that we'll be able to close our transaction by the end of the year. So as you know, and you've seen the announcement, Agrium has divested of 2 of its assets: the nitric acid plant in North Bend; and Conda, one of its phosphate mines. And we believe that complies with the expectations of the FTC, which will allow us to close by the end of the year. And the remedies that we have agreed to, which is the sale of our equity investments, are not expected to impact our annual synergies at all because none of these assets were actually part of that. And quite on the contrary, to be fair, I mean, we think that the opportunity to sell our investments in SQM, APC and ICL allow us to really look forward on the number of funds. We can look at how we can improve our balance sheet in terms of credit rating and our debt ratios. We can look at how we can allocate capital to support our shareholders. There's a couple of opportunities. And we can look at growing the company on its cores, which is retail and the other nutrients. And of course, all of that would be discussed by the Nutrien -- by Nutrien as a company, Nutrien management and the Nutrien board. So we very much look forward to closing transaction and getting going on that. I think it'll be a phenomenal company with lots of opportunities, as you can see on our side. And Agrium obviously has equal opportunities to bring to that new company, Nutrien. Thanks very much. And P.J., I'm not sure if there's any questions. Questions and Answers P.J. JUVEKAR: Let me start with a couple of questions. So thank you for the presentation. I'm looking at your divestments, especially of SQM, given that SQM has lithium. Lithium, as we know, a very hard market, as you know, and there is lot of interest in lithium. So can you talk about the level of interest you've received from prospective buyers? I would imagine the Chinese would be interested in getting their hands on lithium. Can we just talk to that? JOCHEN E. TILK: Yes. I mean, I certainly do. And you can think about timing. As you know, the divestitures of these 3 assets was -- is a remedy that we have agreed to with the Competition Commission of India, CCI. So we did volunteer. However, the timing of that is interesting because the lithium market, as you say, is booming, and SQM or [Soc Quimic] has become perhaps more of a lithium company than it is a fertilizer company. That translates into significant interest. I won't specifically talk who is interested and number of bids and these things. I can't say that. But you can imagine that the broad interest of potential bidders and actual bidders is coming from those who are interested in lithium as a mineral, as a metal and also producers of batteries or battery parts. And many of them are in China. China is the largest consumer and largest producer of lithium products. So that's where a lot of interest is coming from. So while I can't specify who that is, and I don't want to speak too much about the actual process, but we're certainly encouraged by those factors, that lithium is a hot commodity and that the interest is broad. And given where China stands in that market, you would expect a pretty good interest coming out from that part of the world. P.J. JUVEKAR: Right. And secondly, Jochen, you sounded quite positive on nitrogen market, particularly given what has happened in China, and their export is going down. Do you foresee a scenario where China could become a net importer ever? Or do you think China will always be a net exporter? JOCHEN E. TILK: Yes, that's a loaded question. And I think we're pleased to see in -- that China's exports are not coming back up, at least don't seem to come back up. And we think it's consistent with their environmental policy, it's consistent with their social plan. And I commend China for that because I think that's the right direction. I shouldn't speak on their behalf, but it certainly is. In terms of whether that will ever swing back, China made a decision years ago to not be an importer of nitrogen and not be dependent on it. I think that was their policy decision, as they have done in phosphate. I would think they would want to sustain that. I can't imagine there's a reversal from that policy. So I'd be surprised if that would happen. So I don't want to -- I'm evading the question because I don't know, but I'd be very surprised if China would ever become an importer of nitrogen again as they have in the past because from a political perspective, they made that clear decision not to be in that position. UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: On -- there's a significant amount of Russian material that's anticipated into the potash market as of now going forward. How much do you think that has come through? Certainly, import data shows that there's been a significant uplift in certain countries importing more Russian material. Would be interested to hear your thoughts. JOCHEN E. TILK: Yes. You speak specifically about EuroChem and its production coming up? UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Yes. JOCHEN E. TILK: Yes. So when we looked at the supply and demand chart, I didn't specifically talk about the producers that are coming up. But there's really been 2. There's K+S' mine in Saskatchewan, now called Bethune, which is ramping up and is expected to be ramped up -- essentially its capacity next year; and then EuroChem's 2 mines, which are coming up just slightly behind each other. And the first mine is expected to produce a little bit this year and then more next year. So I can't speak to their approach to market. So I won't even venture into that. I mean, that will be left to them. But I'll make a couple of comments. First of all, we have seen some reduction in potash production. For example, SQM, the focus on potassium nitrate and the focus on lithium is producing less MOP generic potash. K+S has announced that it will reduce some of its production in Germany, high cost. And so there is an offsetting trend as well of reduction in production. So that's one. The second is that the market has been growing. I mean, we saw the 4% in the last 5 years as an average. We saw 8% in China, 6% in India. We expect the trend to continue. So there is room for the market to absorb that. Think about 4% as a high number. But if you take 2.5%, 2.5% of 6 million -- 65 million tonnes is somewhere 1.3 million, 1.5 million tonnes every single year on average. And K+S' production capability is 2 million tonnes and then the 2 EuroChem mines are 4 million tonnes. So if you look at that in sum, at 6 million tonnes, that's approximately 4 years of that trend if it were to continue. And those mines don't come up that fast. So will that be absorbed in 5 years? At that trend, we think absolutely yes. And that's why we believe that, that supply and demand balance is relatively tight. So they will come in, and we fully expect them to be very successful in their production, but they will come in on time. And we think on that trajectory of demand, that should be absorbed in the market. UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: In your presentation, you touched a bit about affordability. Can you maybe talk a little bit more about sort of how the elasticity of demand evolves? Is -- in an environment of flat grain prices, does that put a cap on the momentum of the different fertilizer prices that you've seen so far this year? JOCHEN E. TILK: Yes. I mean, the discussion about elasticity in fertilizer, I think, is pretty old. And I know, particularly in potash, people always said there is elasticity; there is none. It's binary. What -- if I take last year, and that certainly impacted me, I do believe there is elasticity. So I believe that, and I state that as -- in my opinion, as a fact supported by that because last year, we truly saw an increase in demand based on that. People could afford it. We saw it in India perhaps more than anyone. India will come at close to 5 million tonnes, and which is significantly up from the last couple of years. And that's mostly affordability. It's not subsidies or government policy. So we think there is a fair amount of that. And you saw this index graph that we showed, and it was fairly consistent, which means from a farmer's perspective, if they put fertilizer prices as a ratio to prices they receive for their crops, it's been fairly flat. And the farmers think that way. I don't think they think about it in any other way but can I afford it in terms of what I get from my crops? So that's been fairly consistent. Would there be a point of corn would drop below $3, for example? I think you would have a contraction of the market, no question. At some point in time, it's just not sustainable. But corn right now above $3.50, we think that's still a pretty good point. So to your question, we think there is elasticity, more so in potash probably than there is in others. I mean, nitrogen will always be applied. That's just a more straightforward nutrient. We think that it's supported by the affordability, as you've seen in the graph, which has been pretty consistent, which helps. And sure, there is a point if crop prices were to drop below a certain level when there is a contraction, but I don't think we're close to that. UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: And then maybe just one more quickly, I mean, a longer-term question. Some seed companies and some software companies have put a lot of resources in digital agriculture and about getting farmers to be more efficient with their fertilizer use. On that graph, you saw North America demand growth for potash pretty slow over time. If precision agriculture really picks up, what kind of long-term impact do you think that can have on demand growth? JOCHEN E. TILK: Yes. I mean, markets will mature on that basis, there's no question. If you project that into the future, markets will mature and as yields will improve, relatively speaking, through precision ag. But if you look at United States, where that's the country where precision ag is probably the most established, no, not just -- likely it is the most established in the United States. And the United States is the most mature market. And if you compare that to other markets, whether it's in terms of yields, whether it's in terms of application per acre, every other market will have to migrate to that. And there's a long ways to go. I mean, that's -- if Asia and Latin America would go there, there's a long ways to go. Africa, give you an example of Africa. Africa for us has been not a real story in the last couple of years. In fact, we never spoke about it because the consumption of fertilizer generally but particularly potash in Africa was virtually nonexistent. I mean, you talk less than 2 million tonnes in sub-Saharan Africa. Credit to OCP, they have embarked in a pretty important story. They have built a number of NPK plants. They have done some joint ventures. And you look at the increase in consumption in Africa, it's quite dramatic actually year-over-year. In absolute numbers, not a big story yet, but in terms of percentage, quite remarkable. And we are shifting. We're now paying attention. We're paying attention to Africa more than we have in the past because we think that is a growth story. So yes, I think precision ag will play a role. It eventually will improve yields. But for markets to go there, there's a long ways to go, and there's lots of opportunity in between. UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: I also have a question on fertilizer consumption growth. You have the slide there with regards to fertilizers in general. But for potash in particular, we've seen record yields over the last couple of years. And if you go back a couple of decades, this is a tremendous line in yield growth. Why has that not translated into equal potash demand growth in North America? And I'm not an agronomist, but the number, this 0.7% seems to be very, very tiny. JOCHEN E. TILK: Yes. Let me go back to the slide so you -- that was the slide... UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: On Slide 8, I think. JOCHEN E. TILK: Yes. This one here, right? UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Yes. JOCHEN E. TILK: And your question is we've seen... UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Yes. Basically, I mean this 5 years, but I think if we go back like 50 years, the demand line for potash in North America would have been basically flat as well, although the yields have picked up dramatically. And there's obviously a need for replenishing nutrients in the ground. And I wonder why is that not the case for potash. JOCHEN E. TILK: Well, I think it is the case for potash. So in terms of the desire to replenish that in time as yields go up, I think there is a story to that. I think if you go back that far, 50 years, it was purely a nitrogen story and a phosphate story. I think the understanding of potassium fertilizers way back, I mean, talking about a couple of decades ago, wasn't there. I mean, you look at China, China was nonexistent in terms of potassium fertilizers 20 years ago. China had no domestic production and virtually didn't import anything. And that was true for many other countries. So the mature countries, Europe and North America to some extent, have picked up on that. You look at that today, and it's a different perception. I mean, China now produces 8 million tonnes. It imports the same amount, and it has a much more sophisticated way of looking how to apply that. I think it's just maturing in people's appreciation for balanced nutrient application in the ground. P.J. JUVEKAR: Maybe let me ask you one more final question. Jochen, I think you said you're not as bullish on phosphate as compared to nitrogen and potash. Phosphate has some capacity coming online with OCP, but Mosaic shut down a plant. So it seems like phosphate has less capacity coming online than potash. So wondering why you prefer potash or phosphates in terms of your outlook? I know you're a potash company. JOCHEN E. TILK: A potash company, yes. Well, I admit, I certainly have a bias, so I -- but I'll make 2 comments to that. And these are opinions; these are views. So one is it's -- when I speak about the phosphate market, I'll just speak about our phosphate. And the 2 impacts that we have, we're a North American phosphate producer. And of course, North American phosphate is more challenged than globally. We're a higher-cost producer because of the WACC that we produce, and we are more exposed to environmental constraints that impose higher operating costs. So not as -- so we're not as competitive. When you look at our potash portfolio and you look at our nitrogen portfolio, we have the best potash assets in the world -- among the best potash assets in the world. And we have among the best nitrogen assets in the world. Tremendous respect for our assets in phosphate, but from a cost perspective, we're not as competitive. So that's one part. The other one is that the phosphate market, in our opinion, is more difficult to assess, and therefore, you will have more volatility. If you look at the largest consumers of potash, the United States of 10 million tonnes; South America, 11 million tonnes; Brazil with 9 million; and then China with 15 million tonnes, 8 million is produced domestically. But they are huge importers. They -- and in fact, Brazil and U.S. produce no potash. I mean, Brazil a tiny little bit; U.S., virtually none anymore. And India -- sorry, I forgot India, at 5 million tonnes, produces no potash. So the 4 largest consumers have -- with the exception of China, have -- and China has no incremental capacity, more are importers. Whereas in phosphate, Brazil uses -- produces half its phosphate consumption. United States does. China does. So each one of these countries, they're a big consumer, but they're also a big producer. And that shifts the dynamic a little bit. So for us, we look at phosphate almost as a producer, and therefore, we're somewhat disadvantaged. But we also look at how -- the visibility that we have in potash and how we can assess that going forward. UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Can I ask another question? Sorry. As you might point out, you've got nitrogen, potassium and phosphate. So you -- do you think you're increasing your presence in the NPK market now that you've got the 3 major building blocks and looking to go into more of those value-added products on a global basis? JOCHEN E. TILK: Really good question, but it's a question for Nutrien. And it wouldn't be appropriate to speak on behalf of Nutrien. What I can say is -- and is -- you can imagine that as Nutrien gets together, its board gets together and its management, one of the first things they'll do is look at the portfolio and look at exactly that, what's the right focus? What other core nutrients, whether -- if there's an opportunity to expand in specialty? I mean, those are all really good questions to look at. And the excitement around Nutrien and our own excitement to enter that stage is because we have the capability from a balance sheet perspective, from an asset perspective because you have a company that has tremendous assets in all 3 nutrients. Well, thank... P.J. JUVEKAR: Well, thank you. Oh. JOCHEN E. TILK: There was one more question? UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: If you could comment on your commitment to Canpotex and going forward, that's still in the future? JOCHEN E. TILK: Yes. We're fully committed to Canpotex. So I can say that on behalf of PotashCorp. I'd also say that on behalf of Nutrien. We've been very clear that we are committed to Canpotex and to Canpotex' future. Thank you very much. P.J.

Data from the nearest Environment Canada weather station, about 25 kilometres away, disagreed with him - it said there was no frost in the area. Fortunately, Mr. Scherman had his own sensors. Deployed around his 4,500-acre farm, the devices indeed recorded two days of frost, which let him approach his insurance company about covering the cost of the damage. With definitive data in hand, the insurer gave him the go-ahead to replant his crops, thereby saving the harvest that would occur months later. \"I was basically done reseeding before [other nearby farmers] even considered it,\" he says. \"If I had delayed my reseeding, by even seven days, that could have been very costly.\" Mr. Scherman is what you might call a data farmer. That doesn't mean he tends numbers and information all day, but rather that he applies modern technologies and the data they generate to his farm, where he grows peas, lentils and canola. Aside from the weather stations, he also uses drone footage and satellite imagery, both of which provide him with even more information about the state of his land. He's an example of a new generation of farmers that are adopting Big Data - more known for its applications in fields such as accounting and financial services - to improve yields and overall business. Agriculture experts say this new wave is gathering momentum - that the majority of farmers are now waking up to the value that technology and data can unlock. The growth of Farmers Edge can be seen as proof. Started in 2005, the Winnipeg-based company sells \"precision agriculture,\" or weather and soil data along with the tools to gather it. Mr. Scherman is a subscriber, paying the company about $4 an acre. Farmers Edge is now up to 450 employees and operates in five countries: Canada, the United States, Australia, Brazil and Russia. In Canada alone, where there are about 200,000 farms, the company has about 2,000 clients. Its growth has been especially fast recently, with the total land it surveys for clients now at 10 million acres, up from just 800,000 acres three years ago. \"We're at a tipping point in the industry,\" says chief product officer Patrick Crampton. \"We're now getting focused recommendations and insights rather than just gathering data for data's sake.\" Improved satellite imagery is partly driving the momentum, he adds, since it's now more accurate, detailed and in real time. Farmers are also realizing that they can benefit from their neighbours' data as well, which is aggregated by the company. \"It's opening up insights that aren't just happening on your farm,\" Mr. Crampton says. \"Instead of learning from one season of data, you're learning from 2,000 man years of data.\" Despite that, many farmers are still finding challenges in accessing data because of their rural locations. In many cases, internet and wireless coverage is spotty or expensive, while power and the cost of sensors can also be challenges - especially in less-developed countries. FarmBeats, an internet-of-things platform under development by Microsoft, is trying to help on those fronts. The project is working to lower the cost of both connectivity and sensors. The software giant has been experimenting with \"white spaces,\" or unlicensed parts of wireless spectrum that exist in between cellphone and television signals. Along with other tech giants including Google, the company believes such frequencies can provide inexpensive internet connectivity to rural communities, including farms. \"You could be sending huge amounts of data where you couldn't before,\" says Ranveer Chandra, a principal researcher at Microsoft. FarmBeats is also working on cheaper ground-level sensors, which can currently cost as much as $8,000 (U.S.). The project has succeeded in producing a full processing unit for about $175, with the ultimate goal of getting down to about $80. Mr. Chandra also believes artificial intelligence can be applied to the sort of data that Farmers Edge gathers in order to predict future weather patterns and soil conditions. Drones, for example, can use infrared scanning to detect soil moisture levels. Over time, with enough information, the data can suggest to farmers which parts of their land need more water and which need less. \"Any insights we provide, we believe are actionable,\" he says. \"We want to take the guesswork out of farming.\" Sean Stratman, who runs Dancing Crow Farm in Carnation, Wash., about 50 kilometres west of Seattle, has become hooked on FarmBeats' data since he started working with the project three years ago. The project's moisture sensors have helped him to cultivate his land more precisely. FarmBeats' data has even predicted how a beaver dam that sprouted up on his land would affect moisture levels. \"As I'm starting to understand the value of this data and all of the possible ways I can use it ... I'd say it's pretty much priceless,\" he says. \"I feel like this is one of the most important tools I have in my arsenal.\" Despite the rapid uptake in recent years, experts believe the agricultural data revolution is still only in its infancy, with much more useful information to be unlocked over the coming years. \"We're leaving a lot of data on the table,\" says Stanford Blade, dean of the faculty of agricultural, life and environmental sciences at the University of Alberta in Edmonton. \"There's a huge amount of information that we're just starting to stumble onto.\" Follow this link to view this story on globeandmail.com: Soil sensors, drones and data analytics are the new tools for farmers Globe and Mail Update"}, {"title": "Expanding drone tech still looking for buyers", "article": "Drone technology is quickly catching up to the rest of innovative farming as evidenced by Ontario-based Deveron UAS (Unmanned Aerial Systems) and their recent partnership with Monsanto subsidiary The Climate Corporation.

That type of farming - colloquially, precision agriculture - is used by roughly 10 to 15 per cent of farmers according to Deveron UAS. \"One of the challenges with agriculture and data to date has been really, how do we store it, how do we use it, and how do we integrate it?\" said Norm Lamothe, farmer and head of UAS Agriculture with Deveron. \"The Climate FieldView program is really designed to take all those pieces of information and be able to turn it into a meaningful solution for the grower. \"All of these integration tools ... as they begin to talk to each other more and more, are going to become more valuable,\" he added. That's important. As farmers look toward drone technology the lingering question is whether the savings and yield improvements are worth the hefty price tag. As a result, to this point most of Deveron UAS's clients have been large-scale farmers. That could change as the technology improves and as more systems become integrated. \"I know a few people who are experimenting, or working with drones,\" said Scott Persall, chair of the Norfolk-Elgin district of the Grain Farmers of Ontario. \"There's lot of opportunities ... it's something I've thought about but I just haven't pursued.\" Deveron UAS has expanded rapidly since 2015. Their system employs drones to identify everything from moisture, to tile drainage, to dips in topography. When used correctly the drones help farmers maximize profits. But farmers need to understand how exactly to use the tools at their disposal, according to Dr. Ivan O'Halloran, precision agriculture professor at the University of Guelph's Ridgetown College. \"It really depends on the individual farm or the individual situation,\" O'Halloran said. \"I've not been overly impressed with any of the imagery as it relates to fertilizer requirement; again, some basic soil knowledge, landscape, tells us a lot.\" O'Halloran admits there are positives to glean from drone information. On the other hand, he says, farmers have to know how to use the data to their advantage. \"Before we had satellite imagery,\" O'Halloran said. \"Then we tried to get aerial photographs, and stuff like that ... the drone is allowing instantaneous evaluation of the appearance of the crop. The long and the short of it is it's still very hard to do it from a predictive standpoint.\" Another aspect is high speed internet. Deveron UAS's technology requires a way to transfer large quantities of data and in some places in rural Ontario that isn't possible - not over a manageable time frame, at least. Once true high speed internet is available in rural Ontario it could help push drone technology further. \"Faster internet is going to help (agriculture) tech in general,\" Lamothe said. \"The ability to move data faster, the ability to have data to access in the field, real time ... we're looking forward to see how data in rural areas improve over time.\" St. Thomas Times-Journal"}, {"title": "New crop of farmers; Grey's AG 4.0.1 event in Meaford has added focus on youth", "article": "A conference touting the future of agriculture is putting a call out to the farmers of tomorrow. Grey County is presenting its AG 4.0.1 Digital Agriculture Conference on Friday at Meaford Hall, fallowing up on last year's AG 4.0 conference that focused on technology in agriculture. Touted as \"The Next Big Thing,\" this year's conference has an added focus on youth, with free tickets offered to those between the ages of 12 and 18, and a special session geared towards the young participants. \"We recognize that there is incredible innovation happening in agriculture and there are a lot of kids that are going to go away and learn about that, but they are going to want to come back,\" said Philly Markowitz, Grey County's economic development officer. \"We want them to know that the county supports this kind of innovation and we want them to get excited and come back and implement those ideas here.\" Markowitz said it is important to involve youth in a conference like the one they are holding. \"As technology accelerates the people who are most flexible in their ability to adapt are young people,\" said Markowitz. \"We also recognize that rural Ontario and Grey County is aging and there are a lot of farms that don't have succession plans in place. \"If we can help draw connections between the farms and farmers who are aging out and the young people who are here want to return here, then it is going to be better for everyone.\" The 21st Century Local Food Network youth session is being facilitated by Bernie Blakeney of the Launch Pad Youth Activity and Technology Centre in Hanover. Blakeney has created a simulation of a greenhouse growing environment along the lines of technology being used in Holland and southwestern Ontario with sensors, robotics and other controls. \"He is creating something that students or anyone can access from their phones and play with as if they are running a full system,\" said Markowitz. \"We are really excited about it and we are encouraging teenagers to bring their phones to school.\" This year's conference includes a streamlined program so people don't have to make as many choices around concurrent sessions. In this year's conference there is a strong focus on geographic information system and agricultural mapping. Farming by the Numbers Part 1 includes the launch of Grey's new Agri-Foods Asset Map, a tool to link the county's various agricultural assets, including producers to producers and producers to customers. The I Robot? session includes a look at farm labour trends, cutting edge technology and making the switch to robotics and other technological solutions. The event also includes an introduction to Bluewater Angels, a program that drives innovation and entrepreneurship by providing funding support for start-up businesses. Farming by the Numbers Part 2 features a trio of speakers from the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs providing an introduction to the AgriMaps Portal and other new agricultural data tools. Big Data, Small Farm - Data Driven Agriculture addresses commodity challenges through the use of data, while in the Success Stories session, producers tell how they have adopted new technologies and how they have paid off. The Technology and Sustainability session talks about using data and technology to protect the environment and increase efficiencies. \"We have panels that address the kinds of questions ask when they look to adopt a technology, questions they are asking about where the future of farming is heading, questions about the success and return on investment of making technological changes,\" said Markowitz. \"Kind of the two main themes are what can data do for us and what does change really look like at the farm and on the farm.\" There will also be exhibits on hand from the Brookfield Institute, OMAFRA, Grey County planning, and a display of the Agri-Foods Asset Map. \"All will give attendees an opportunity to interact, ask questions and give feedback,\" said Markowitz."}, {"title": "Prairie groups combine forces", "article": "A Manitoba artificial intelligence/machine-learning consortium didn't make the shortlist for the federal government's $1-billion supercluster funding, but it has teamed up with a Saskatchewan group for the next phase. Enterprise Machine Intelligence and Learning Initiative (EMILI) has merged with Protein Industries Canada (PIC) to form a pan-prairie proposal to access this federal government funding pool. Its goal is to position Canada globally as the leading centre of high-quality, plant-based protein production. Although the EMILI proposal was initially designed to target a broad array of vertical markets including manufacturing, efforts to deploy machine learning technologies in agriculture was always part of the concept. Ray Bouchard, the president of EMILI and the CEO of Enns Brothers, said the EMILI initiative always has contemplated working with other technology superclusters. \"When we submitted under the letter of intent, we said we would be open to working with the other groups and that is what we have done,\" Bouchard said. \"I think we have landed in a pretty good place from an EMILI perspective.\" The deadline for the next phase of the funding competition is Nov. 24. Bouchard and PIC acting president Ron Styles, recently retired CEO of SaskTel, said final details of the proposal are still being worked out. The proposal is focused on developing ways to increase yields and improve production on the farm. \"EMILI really strengthens our proposal,\" Styles said. \"We are going to need farmers to produce more than they have in the past per acre. So we need improved production efficiencies and technologies to get the proteins out. \"In both those areas what EMILI was planning would be vital to those efforts. We see it as a natural fit within the ecosystem we want to build.\" Styles believes that if it is successful in landing funding from Ottawa, as well as up to $200 million in private sector venture capital investments in the various projects, it could mean a total impact of about $1 billion over the next five years. Winnipeg-based Farmers Edge, a rapidly growing global precision farming subscription service that was a major proponent of EMILI, has joined the PIC board of directors. It also had been a member of an Alberta group that is still in the running but has decided to dedicate its efforts to the Saskatchewan-based proposal. martin.cash@freepress.mb.ca"}, {"title": "PotashCorp - Agrium and PotashCorp Announce Mailing of Letters of Transmittal and Election Forms to Registered Shareholders", "article": "Release date - 20112017 SASKATOON, SK and CALGARY, AB - Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc.

This network of spacecraft, due to launch in 2020, will image the entire global landmass (not including Antarctica) every 24 hours. One of its key uses will be in smart agriculture - taking pictures to help farmers better manage their crops. SSTL is a world leader in manufacturing satellite constellations. It has produced series of spacecraft for other EO interests, such as the RapidEye network now owned by Planet and the DMC-3 operation leased to the Chinese concern 21AT. SSTL is also in the consortium that makes multiple spacecraft for the European Commissions satellite-navigation system, Galileo. The Guildford-based manufacturer has been working on the UrtheDaily concept with UrtheCast for a while. It would see, most probably, eight spacecraft launched into a polar orbit about 600km above the planet. Arranged like a pearl necklace, these satellites would follow each other, crossing the equator at 10:30 local time. They would gather something on the order of 140 million square km of land imagery a day (clouds permitting) at a resolution of about 5m. UrtheCast is a relatively new operator. It started out taking pictures of the Earth from the space station using British-built cameras, and has since acquired the Spanish Deimos satellites to complement its business. It plans also to launch in the 2020s a novel, high-resolution capability that would see eight pairs of optical and radar satellites circling the globe. This concept is called OptiSAR. Flying radar with optical enables pictures to be gathered in all weathers, even when there is cloud. The leading radar satellite would also map the cloud cover so that the trailing optical spacecraft could more efficiently target those regions of the Earths surface that were clearly observable. Weve been working with UrtheCast on OptiSAR for about three or four years now, and on UrtheDaily for about the the last year, year and a half,\" explained Luis Gomes from SSTL. \"There is an identified need in the market for very high-quality imagery at medium resolution, around 5m, for precision agriculture and environmental monitoring. \"Wed already been developing a design for this kind of system and then UrtheCast said it was the kind of thing they wanted. \"The aim is to have all the satellites built by 2020.

One initiative being undertaken to support this research is the creation of Canada's first Omics and Precision Agriculture Laboratory (OPAL). OPAL will support state-of-the-art precision agriculture using high throughput digital phenotyping of crops integrated with genomics data and analysis expertise. Precision agriculture is the management of crop inputs like water, fertilizer, and plant protection products at the correct time and place to increase productivity and maximize yields, in a sustainable manner. New digital technologies such as Global Positioning Systems (GPS), remote aerial imaging of plants using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), and in-field environmental monitoring will be combined with genetic information (genomics) for those same plants. The combined data and analysis will be a powerful tool for plant breeders. The Government of Canada, through Western Economic Diversification Canada, will provide $1,351,000 to OPAL, which will be applied to the purchase of phenomics equipment and computational hardware to support phenomics and informatics needs. This will include the purchase of advanced UAVs that have been customized for crop phenotyping, a mobile transportation unit to support the UAV equipment, and aerial on-board and in-field sensors. Additional funding is provided by National Research Council Canada, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Global Institute for Food Security, University of Saskatchewan. Key Benefits *OPAL will provide clients with solutions tailored to their crop data and analysis needs, including: experiment design and workflow, genomic and/or phenomic technical support, and data acquisition and analysis. It will also provide consulting on technical details and costings for project planning. *OPAL will be staffed with experts who have significant scientific knowledge and experience in omics data, crop analysis, and data management and delivery. It will function as a centre of expertise for the crop genomics and phenomics community in Canada. *OPAL services will offer support to an existing portfolio of precision agriculture techniques, associated analysis in genomics (i.e., genome assembly, genotyping) and phenomics (aerial imaging) and will establish new techniques of long term strategic significance for precision agriculture applications in western Canada. *High throughput digital phenotyping of crops (phenomics) integrated with genomics data and analysis will make will precision agriculture faster and more cost-effective. *As a clean technology, the use of precision agriculture will increase production efficiencies, result in significant input cost efficiencies for individual producers, and reduce on-site degradation of soil resources and off-site environmental problems. *The application of the new precision agriculture tools will contribute to permanent savings in CO2 emissions through reduced use of fossil-based fuels, fertilizers and plant protection products. About the Global Institute for Food Security The Global Institute for Food Security (GIFS) performs discovery research that aims to deliver transformative innovation in agriculture in both the developed and the developing world.

Climate change and human actions are altering precipitation patterns, reducing snowpacks, accelerating glacial melt, intensifying floods, and increasing the risk of droughts. This change has tremendous implications on the future of human health and food production as it relates to our environment. To help address this challenge, the SWSL at the University of Saskatchewan will transform the observation of Canadian waters by detecting change in water quantity and quality at high resolutions. SWSL will develop novel sensors that measure snowpacks, ice, open water, flooding, streamflow, soil moisture, wetlands, vegetation and algal growth. Many of these sensors will be deployed on specialized all-weather drones (unmanned aerial systems) for rapid deployment across Canada with first applications in the Prairies and the mountain headwaters of the Saskatchewan River Basin. The Government of Canada, through Western Economic Diversification Canada, will provide $1,374,576 to SWSL. Additional funding is provided by the Canada Foundation for Innovation, the University of Saskatchewan, Global Water Futures and industry contributions. Key Benefits *New capabilities for measuring and forecasting water quality and quantity. *Increased ability to predict the threat of disaster from floods and droughts. *Information for communities and industries to reduce and manage their flood risk. *Information for farmers and ranchers to manage drought impacts on food production. *New opportunities to develop environmental technologies in Canada. About Global Water Futures Global Water Futures is a seven-year, University of Saskatchewan-led research program established within the Global Institute for Water Security in 2016 and funded in part by a $77.8-million grant from the Canada First Research Excellence Fund.

This was driven by strong OEM business growth in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Americas regions. Gross profit in the third quarter of 2017 increased 47% to $3.2 million compared to $2.2 million in the third quarter of 2016. Gross margin increased 310 basis points to 36.0% compared to 32.9% in the third quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily due to the absorption of production overhead by the higher sales volumes. Total operating expenses increased to $6.3 million compared to $5.3 million in the third quarter of 2016 primarily due to higher employee compensation costs. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses declined to 70.0% compared to 79.1% in the third quarter of 2016. Net loss in the third quarter was $3.1 million or $(0.02) per share, compared to a net loss of $14.4 million or $(0.12) per share in the third quarter of 2016.

In fact, 92 percent of United States farmers who consider themselves loyal to their retailers will recommend them to peers. Yet, retailers must earn and re-earn this loyalty, especially in this time of consolidation and farms expansion. Findings from a recent Stratus Ag Research Report about farmer perceptions of ag retailers show that loyalty to retailers in the U.S. is lowest among those farmers who plan to increase their farm size in the next five years. The study is designed to help retailers grow by knowing what farmers want from them, and to understand competitor strengths and weaknesses. Most farmers surveyed feel it is important to receive soil sampling, crop scouting and other agronomic services from their ag retailer. \"Retailers offering agronomic services earn more purchases, increase their influence over buying decisions and earn customer loyalty,\" says Krista MacLean, Project Manager with Stratus Ag Research. \"But the study also highlights that as farm size grows, farmers are more likely to source agronomic services from independent crop advisors not affiliated with ag retailers. The need for custom application services from ag retailer declines, while the use of independent crop advisors for precision agriculture services, such as variable rate prescription maps, imagery and weather data increases.\" She adds that more than 25 percent of farmers with more than 3,000 acres are purchasing agronomic services such as fertility planning and crop scouting from an independent crop advisor. The risk to ag retailers is that the outsourcing of agronomic expertise devalues their role on farm, and results in a loss of customer loyalty. \"The opportunity for today's ag retailers is to assess their future service and staffing offerings, so that they can increase their value to farmers and ensure they meet the evolving needs of the large farm.\" About Stratus Ag Research Stratus is a market research company focused entirely on agriculture.

(TSX: AGU) (NYSE: AGU) announced today its 2017 third quarter results, with a net loss from continuing operations of $69-million ($0.52 diluted loss per share) compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $38-million ($0.28 diluted loss per share) in the third quarter of 2016. The third quarter results were driven by lower overall sales volumes and higher cost of product sold related to several scheduled maintenance turnarounds and higher share-based payments due to a year-to-date total shareholder return of 10 percent at September 30(th) . Highlights:  \"Our results this quarter were impacted by a particularly intense summer maintenance schedule, extreme dry weather in Canada and Australia and the two hurricanes in the southern U.S. Looking at the fall season and into 2018, we see solid grower demand for fertilizer and other crop inputs, and expect fertilizer markets to demonstrate continued strength, \" commented Chuck Magro, Agrium's President and CEO. \"The sale of Conda and North Bend and China's recent regulatory approval are significant steps toward completing the merger with PotashCorp by year end and we are excited to move forward as Nutrien in 2018,\" added Mr. Magro.

MARKET OUTLOOK Agriculture and Crop Input Fundamentals  Nitrogen Outlook  7 Nov 2017 18:19 ET Press Release: Agrium Reports Third Quarter -2-  Potash Outlook  Phosphate Outlook  2017 ANNUAL GUIDANCE Based on our assumptions set out under the heading \"Market Outlook\", Agrium expects to achieve annual diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $4.65 to $4.80 in 2017 compared to our previous estimate of $4.75 to $5.25 per share. We have reduced our annual guidance range to reflect the lost production volumes in the third quarter and the impact of challenging weather conditions on our Retail operations, particularly those areas impacted by hurricanes. We have also narrowed the range width encompassing approximately $30-million of EBITDA variability. We have updated our Retail EBITDA range between $1.160-billion to $1.190-billion compared to our previous guidance of $1.150-billion to $1.20-billion, while our estimate for Retail crop nutrient sales volumes has been reduced to between 9.9 million and 10.2 million tonnes in 2017. Based on our expected utilization rate for our nitrogen assets, we are updating our nitrogen production range to between 3.3 and 3.4 million tonnes. Our earnings per share guidance assumes NYMEX gas prices will average between $2.95 and $3.15 per MMBtu for 2017. We have also revised our expected potash production range for 2017 to between 2.4 and 2.5 million tonnes. Total capital expenditures in 2017 are expected to be in the range of $650-million to $700-million, of which approximately $425-million to $475-million is expected to be sustaining capital expenditures. Agrium's annual effective tax rate for 2017 on continuing operations is expected to range between 27 and 29 percent. This guidance and updated additional measures and related assumptions are summarized in the table below. Guidance excludes the impact of share-based payments expense (recovery), gains (losses) on foreign exchange and non-qualifying derivative hedges, and merger related costs. Except as described under the heading \"Market Outlook\", volumetric and earnings estimates assume normal seasonal growing and harvest patterns in the geographies where Agrium operates.

The variance was primarily due to:  7 Nov 2017 18:19 ET Press Release: Agrium Reports Third Quarter -6- This was partially offset by:  FINANCIAL CONDITION The following are changes to working capital on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Agrium generally expects that it will be able to meet its working capital requirements, capital resource needs and shareholder returns through a variety of sources, including available cash on hand, cash provided by operations, short-term borrowings from the issuance of commercial paper, and borrowings from our credit facilities, as well as long-term debt and equity capacity from the capital markets. As of September 30, 2017, we had sufficient current assets to meet our current liabilities. Summary of Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Below is a summary of our cash provided by or used in operating, investing and financing activities as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:  7 Nov 2017 18:19 ET Press Release: Agrium Reports Third Quarter -7-  Short-term Debt  Capital Management  OUTSTANDING SHARE DATA Agrium had 138,164,264 outstanding shares at November 3, 2017. At November 3, 2017, the number of shares issuable pursuant to stock options outstanding (issuable assuming full conversion, where each option granted can be exercised for one common share) was approximately 1,380,868.  7 Nov 2017 18:19 ET Press Release: Agrium Reports Third Quarter -8- The agricultural products business is seasonal. Consequently, year-over-year comparisons are more appropriate than quarter-over-quarter comparisons. Crop input sales are primarily concentrated in the spring and fall crop input application seasons. Crop nutrient inventories are normally accumulated leading up to each application season. Our cash collections from accounts receivables generally occur after the application season is complete, and our customer prepayments are concentrated in December and January. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS On September 7, 2017, Agrium and PotashCorp provided an update on the regulatory approval process related to the proposed merger indicating that they are working to resolve final issues in superphosphoric acid and nitric acid. A potential remedy to outstanding issues is the disposition of our Conda phosphate operations (CPO) and North Bend nitrogen facilities. A sale of assets of CPO and North Bend assets by September 2018 is considered highly probable as management has committed to a sale and has begun to actively market the assets. In November 2017, we entered into an agreement with a third party to dispose of our CPO and North Bend assets, subject to the approval of the Federal Trade Commission. We have reclassified the results of operations of CPO as discontinued and recorded the assets held for sale at fair value less costs to sell, which resulted in a write-down of $295-million before taxes. We have restated our 2016 financial information to also reflect this change. For further information, refer to note 6 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. NON-IFRS FINANCIAL MEASURES Financial measures that are not specified, defined or determined under IFRS are non-IFRS measures unless they are presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The following table outlines our non-IFRS financial measure, its definition and why management uses the measure.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES We prepare our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with IFRS, which requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates in applying accounting policies. For further information on the Company's critical accounting estimates, refer to the section \"Critical Accounting Estimates\" in our 2016 annual MD&A, which is contained in our 2016 Annual Report. Since the date of our 2016 annual MD&A, there have not been any material changes to our critical accounting estimates. CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES 7 Nov 2017 18:19 ET Press Release: Agrium Reports Third Quarter -9- The accounting policies applied in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 are the same as those applied in our audited annual financial statements in our 2016 Annual Report. We are currently assessing the impact of IFRS 15 and 16 and preparing for implementation. We expect that our financial statements will include expanded disclosures about revenues from contracts with customers while IFRS 16 will have a material impact on our assets and liabilities and reclassifications within our statement of operations. Refer to note 6 of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for details. BUSINESS RISKS The information presented in the \"Enterprise Risk Management\" section on pages 52 - 56 in our 2016 annual MD&A and under the heading \"Risk Factors\" on pages 23 - 38 in our Annual Information Form for the year ended December 31, 2016 has not changed materially since December 31, 2016.

OTHER 7 Nov 2017 18:19 ET Press Release: Agrium Reports Third Quarter -10-  Basis of preparation and statement of compliance The accounting policies applied in these interim financial statements are the same as those applied in our audited annual financial statements in our 2016 Annual Report.  7 Nov 2017 18:19 ET Press Release: Agrium Reports Third Quarter -11-  7 Nov 2017 18:19 ET Press Release: Agrium Reports Third Quarter -12-  7 Nov 2017 18:19 ET Press Release: Agrium Reports Third Quarter -13-  1. Corporate Management Corporate information Agrium Inc. (\"Agrium\") is incorporated under the laws of Canada with common shares listed under the symbol \"AGU\" on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX). Our Corporate head office is located at 13131 Lake Fraser Drive S.E., Calgary, Canada. We conduct our operations globally from our Wholesale head office in Calgary and our Retail head office in Loveland, Colorado, United States. In these financial statements, \"we\", \"us\", \"our\" and \"Agrium\" mean Agrium Inc., its subsidiaries and joint arrangements. We categorize our operating segments within the Retail and Wholesale business units as follows:  Additional information on our operating segments is included in note 2. Seasonality in our business results from increased demand for our products during planting seasons. Sales are generally higher in spring and fall. Discontinued operations and assets held for sale During the quarter, we classified the results of our Conda phosphate operations (CPO) as assets held for sale as described in note 6. The operating results of CPO, previously included in our Phosphate operating segment, are presented in discontinued operations for the periods ended September 30, 2017, and have been restated for the comparative periods ended September 30, 2016. Amounts shown in our operating segments note represent results from continuing operations. 2.

Risk Management Commodity price risk  The underlying risk of the derivative contracts is identical to the hedged risk; accordingly we have established a ratio of 1:1 for all natural gas hedges. Due to a strong correlation between AECO future contract prices and our delivered cost, we did not experience any ineffectiveness on our hedges, and accordingly we have recorded the full change in the fair value of natural gas derivative contracts designated as hedges to other comprehensive income.  7 Nov 2017 18:19 ET Press Release: Agrium Reports Third Quarter -18-  There have been no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements in the nine months ended September 30, 2017. We do not measure any of our financial instruments using Level 3 inputs.  6. Additional Information Planned Merger with Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc. (\"PotashCorp\") Agrium and PotashCorp entered into an agreement dated September 11, 2016 (the \"Arrangement Agreement\"), under which the companies will combine in a merger of equals into a newly incorporated parent entity, which will be named Nutrien, to be formed to manage and hold the combined businesses of both Agrium and PotashCorp. The Arrangement Agreement will be implemented by a proposed plan of arrangement (the \"Arrangement\"). Under the Arrangement, Agrium shareholders will receive 2.23 Nutrien shares for each Agrium share held, and PotashCorp shareholders will receive 0.40 of a Nutrien share for each PotashCorp share held. On November 3, 2016, shareholders of both Agrium and PotashCorp approved the Arrangement. Subsequent to September 30, 2017, regulators in India and China approved the merger, subject to conditions including the divestment of certain of PotashCorp's minority shareholdings in Arab Potash Company, Israel Chemicals Ltd., Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile S.A., and Sinofert Holdings Limited within certain specified time periods over the 18 months following the merger. Agrium and PotashCorp are working to resolve outstanding regulatory approvals in the U.S. and we anticipate the Arrangement will be completed by the end of the fourth quarter of 2017. Additional information and the full text of the Arrangement Agreement and the Arrangement are included in Agrium and PotashCorp's joint proxy circular filed on SEDAR on October 6, 2016. Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale On September 7, 2017, Agrium and PotashCorp provided an update on the regulatory approval process related to the proposed merger indicating that they are working to resolve final issues in superphosphoric acid and nitric acid. A potential remedy to outstanding issues is the disposition of our CPO and North Bend nitrogen facilities. A sale of CPO and North Bend assets by September 2018 is considered highly probable as management has committed to a sale and has begun to actively market the assets. As a result, we have classified these assets as held for sale and have re-measured them to fair value less costs to sell (FVLCS). FVLCS was determined primarily based on expressions of interest received from potential third-party buyers, and was corroborated by discounted cash flows derived from our forecasts. Because we did not base the inputs of our fair value measurement on observable market transactions, we classified the fair value as a Level 3 measurement. In November 2017, we entered into an agreement with a third party to dispose of our CPO and North Bend assets, subject to the approval of the Federal Trade Commission. 7 Nov 2017 18:19 ET Press Release: Agrium Reports Third Quarter -19- As CPO comprises operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished operationally and for financial reporting purposes, its operating results and the impact of re-measurement to FVLCS is included in discontinued operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, and restated for the comparative periods ended September 30, 2016. Amounts shown exclude elimination of intercompany transactions. The majority of the remaining value of assets held for sale is assigned to inventories.  Business Acquisitions During the quarter, our Retail business unit acquired 25 farm centers located in the U.S. for preliminary purchase consideration of $110-million, subject to working capital adjustments. We anticipate that the majority of the fair value of the acquired assets will be comprised of property, plant and equipment, and goodwill. Valuations of the acquired businesses are in progress and are not complete due to the timing of the closing dates. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Our cross-functional project team has been working since September of 2016 to assess the impact of IFRS 15 and 16 and prepare for implementation. The new standards will not have any cash impact and accordingly will not affect the economics of our underlying customer contracts or our leases. We expect to implement changes to our internal control over financial reporting on adoption of each standard, including new policies, training and ongoing contract review requirements.

(TSX: AGU) (NYSE: AGU) announces that it has signed a definitive asset purchase agreement with Itafos, whereby Agrium will sell its Conda, Idaho, phosphate production facility and adjacent phosphate mineral rights for a sale price of approximately $100-million, including working capital. Agrium has also entered into a definitive asset purchase agreement with Trammo Nitrogen Products, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Trammo Inc., whereby Agrium will sell its North Bend, Ohio Nitric Acid facility. The Conda facility and related assets include the entirety of Agrium's superphosphoric acid business (\"SPA\") in North America and the North Bend facility represents the entirety of Agrium's nitric acid business in the Midwest region. These divestitures are intended to address U.S. regulatory concerns raised with respect to Agrium's merger with PotashCorp and are subject to U.S. Federal Trade Commission's approval. \"The divestment of these assets will help pave the way for our merger with PotashCorp and the excellent line of sight to capture $500-million in annual synergies. With Itafos operating the SPA business and Trammo operating the nitric acid business, farmers and industrial customers will be served across the U.S. for many years to come,\" stated Agrium's President & CEO, Chuck Magro. As part of the sale of the Conda business, Agrium and Itafos will enter into long-term strategic supply and off-take agreements as part of the transaction. Under the terms of the supply and off-take agreements, Agrium will supply 100% of the ammonia requirements of Conda Phosphate Operations and purchase 100% of MAP product produced, with pricing formulas for both tied to benchmark phosphate fertilizer prices. Agrium is expected to record a non-cash impairment of $178-million, net of tax, (gross of tax $295-million) associated with the sale of Conda and will retain the historical environmental obligations.

I mean not just any day, I mean a busy day, an in-season day, a day that's a market day. How much time has a farmer to investigate better production, or new technology in the world of growing food? In fact, time gets valuable. Also, improved growth hinges on resources available, and may be costly. And how many farmers are open to some great new/old methods? Sometimes, farmers and lots of people are a bit guarded, even a lot guarded about new ideas. Now a days, it's easy to understand why. Have you ever considered what a major role all farmers could play regarding climate change and carbon sequestration? On Nov. 15 at the Spallumcheen municipal office, at 4144 Spallumcheen Way, a climate smart farming symposium will be held. If you are a farmer, you are welcome to attend this event. If you are not a farmer but appreciate this planet as does a farmer, you are equally welcome. First come will be first served for the limited seating. Charge, is no charge or a donation would be appreciated. Attendees can listen, learn, and ask questions until noon. Some attendees may reserve an opportunity to meet speakers in the afternoon. I look forward to sharing exciting new discovery toward growing healthy food and a healthy planet.

Farmers Edge(TM), a global leader in decision agriculture, today announced a significant geographical expansion with the release of Smart Insite(TM) - the first in-season crop monitoring and digital agronomy solution. With this entry into states throughout major US growing regions, Farmers Edge continues to deliver on its commitment to provide growers and agriculture professionals with digital agronomic tools that are scalable, effective, and easy-to-use. Smart Insite is a set of digital tools that enables and enhances agronomic decisions through field-centric data capture, analysis, and predictive modeling. (Photo: Business Wire) Powered by field-centric data capture, advanced analytics technology, and predictive modeling, Smart Insite enables growers to improve crop yields, quickly react to crop stress, and boost profitability. The solution includes daily satellite imagery, easy-to-read field maps, on-farm weather stations, the FarmCommand Scouting app, and tailored alerts that automatically notify if conditions are susceptible to pests in the field. Unlike other companies that rely on existing public data, Farmers Edge provides growers not only with high-quality, accurate data, but also with field-level analysis, predictive modeling, and a world-class team of farm data scientists in established and emerging growing regions. The company's rapidly growing, global customer base is clear evidence that growers around the world see a real need for solutions that can accurately gather and analyze field-level data so they can farm more sustainably and profitably. Wade Barnes, President and CEO of Farmers Edge, says that the business of digital agriculture has changed dramatically in recent years because farmers themselves are demanding more. \"The industry has moved beyond data collection and data management to using data to make decisions that significantly impact farm's profitability,\" he says. \"Farmers won't settle for mediocrity when it comes to their digital tools -- they expect the same from those as they do from elite seed genetics and crop protection products. It's not enough just to hit the target any longer; digital agriculture needs to hit the bull's-eye every time, and that's what we plan to deliver with Smart Insite.\" The release of Smart Insite comes at a pivotal time for Farmers Edge, following a game-changing deal granting the company sole distribution rights of Planet's daily satellite imagery in key agricultural markets. \"Smart Insite is going to forever change the way farmers, agronomists and retail partners manage their fields,\" says Ron Osborne, Chief Strategy Officer at Farmers Edge. \"With our daily satellite imagery, it has never been easier, or faster, to detect and fix problems in the field. \"Using comprehensive benchmark reports, hybrid and variety performance analysis, and predictive crop modeling, we deliver customized insights that help farmers and their trusted advisors make important agronomic decisions with confidence,\" says Osborne. \"We've worked hard to bring this new technology to farmers and our partners, it's a very exciting breakthrough. The depth and frequency of field-centric data we collect and analyze is game-changing.\" About Farmers Edge  Marina Barnes VP of Marketing communications@FarmersEdge.ca  (END)"}, {"title": "Farmers a big part of greenhouse-gas solution", "article": "On Oct. 27, the provincial government's long-awaited Climate and Green Plan was unveiled, and it indicates that farmers will be given some exemptions from the provincial carbon tax. Some may say ask why there should be an exemption for agriculture and not for other industries, but let me explain by quoting former U.S. president John F. Kennedy from 1960: \"the farmer is the only man in our economy who buys everything at retail, sells everything at wholesale, and pays the freight both ways.\" A lot has changed in agriculture since the 1960s, not least of which is that we recognize the thousands of women involved in the industry now. What hasn't changed, though, is the underlying structure of the agricultural economy. Grain and livestock prices given to farmers are set globally, based on world market demand, so Manitoba prices cannot be altered to pass on additional production costs and taxes to customers. However, many of the industries we rely on for our inputs are not as captive to world prices as farmers, and we are going to see them pass on their carbon tax to us. This is already happening in provinces that have implemented a price on carbon. For example, one trucking company implemented a one per cent carbon tax surcharge at the start of 2017 in Alberta, where there is already a price on carbon. It will increase to 1.5 per cent in 2018 as the Alberta carbon tax increases. Another example: one railway currently charges a carbon tax surcharge of four cents per mile on all shipments from, to or within British Columbia -- and similar amounts in other provinces that already have a carbon price. It's clear that certain other industries can pass on carbon costs, but farmers can't. What has changed since 1960 is nearly everything about how we manage land and livestock. Today's agriculture industry is attuned to the effects of greenhouse gases on climate changes. It has evolved in a dramatic way in order to control its emissions -- and it will continue to do so despite some exemptions from the price on carbon. For example, over half of Manitoba's 11-million acres of cropland is grown in minimal or zero-tillage systems. This means little disturbance of the soil, a practice that sequesters large amounts of carbon dioxide. It is estimated that Manitoba farmers sequester up to 1.4 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year through these cropping systems. In addition, these systems greatly reduce the number of field passes farmers must make with their farm equipment, with the result that less carbon-based fuel is burned. Fertilizer, an important part of agriculture, is needed for most crop production. However, Manitoba farmers have adopted soybeans, a crop that requires no carbon-sourced nitrogen fertilizer. Soybean production has increased dramatically -- from 18,000 acres in 2000 to a current 2.3 million acres. In 2016 alone, this resulted in savings of 245,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions -- the equivalent of taking 52,000 cars off the road. This is all thanks to new varieties that have been bred for Prairie climate conditions. Here's another fact: livestock production has become more efficient. Animal breeding advances and increases in feed efficiency have reduced methane emissions from Canadian dairy and beef cattle by 15 per cent per litre of milk and kilogram of beef over the last 30 years. In addition, the forages (pasture plants) that cattle consume sequester significant amounts of carbon in their roots. In the hog industry, Manitoba farms emit 35 per cent fewer greenhouse gases than they did 50 years ago. And now, farmers are moving toward manure storage under their barns, instead of ground-level lagoon storage. This will profoundly reduce methane gas production. And it doesn't stop there. There are recent innovations that will create even more emission reductions. For example, precision agriculture is a new frontier that uses field data to adjust the amount of fertilizer applied to individual field conditions -- thus reducing the amount of fertilizer used. More research is needed into methods of production that will further reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase carbon sequestration. This could include alternate fuels, new crop varieties, new ways of reducing animal-produced greenhouse gases, improved forage production, improved grazing management -- and the list goes on. I am hoping the new Climate and Green Plan will facilitate research funding, and also include programming to speed up the adoption of new technologies while offsetting financial risk for farmers. Farmers can be a bigger part of the climate change solution than they already are, and in the long run can offset emissions from the rest of society. Current economic modelling by the province indicates that a carbon tax reduction of more than $200 per tonne would be required to meet its greenhouse gas reduction targets -- if the tax was the only tool used. We don't believe this is the right path for Manitoba. Instead, we want to work with the government and other stakeholders to develop a plan that helps achieve our environmental goals, while at the same time growing the provincial economy through investments in agriculture.
