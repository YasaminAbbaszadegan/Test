Potash mining, like the rest of the extractive industries, has declined and may be smaller for a long time. Canadians need to find something else to offer the world in order to put butter on our bread. Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan and Agrium Inc. believe they can reduce their expenses by US$500 million a year by merging to form the world's largest crop-nutrient company. There was no talk of closing potash mines as the two companies announced their plan, but it was hard to see how the intended savings could be achieved without production cuts. When Potash Corp. announced its results July 28, it reported its average selling price for potash in the second quarter was $154 per tonne, down from $273 per tonne the preceding year. Gross margin on nitrogen products had declined 41 per cent from the preceding year and the company actually lost money producing and selling phosphate in the second quarter. The world market is glutted with crop nutrients. Prices are low and seem likely to remain so until some mines close. Potash did close its high-cost Cassidy mine in New Brunswick this year, throwing 430 people out of work. By mid-year, however, the company thought potash markets had reached their low point so that demand might begin to strengthen. Potash and Agrium together, however, explained this week their combined company, yet to be named, could cut its costs through synergies -- shipping potash directly from the mines to Agrium's retail outlets, optimizing selling and administrative functions and more efficient procurement. The two companies together reported US$20.6 billion of revenues in 2015. In that context, the goal of reducing expenses by $500 million without closing any mines seemed ambitious. When mining giant BHP Billiton tried to buy Potash Corp. in 2010, Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall, who could see mine closings coming, persuaded the federal government to block the takeover. This time around, the companies gave no hint of closing more mines, and they won Wall's approval. Weak demand may yet compel them to reduce production if the recovery of demand that they have been waiting for does not materialize. The merged company is likely to reduce spending, which will reduce employment, either within the company or among its suppliers. Canada will still be a crop-nutrients mega-power, but fewer Canadians will make their living from the industry. The increased efficiency will keep the Canadian industry competitive and it will sharpen the need for the next generation of Canadians to find news ways to make their way in the world. The Agrium-Potash merger and its employment effects may cast light on last week's labour-market report from Statistics Canada. The statistical agency found employment in Canada increased by just 77,000 jobs in the course of the last 12 months. The unemployment rate in August ticked up one-tenth of a point to seven per cent -- despite a small monthly increase in employment -- because more people were seeking work. The U.S. job market was appreciably stronger, as it has been all year. Agrium Inc. announced an investment in an agriculture-technology fund to support small innovative firms in the fields of plant nutrition, biologicals, seed technology, digital agriculture and novel farm systems. Those seeds will probably be slow to sprout, but they, rather than potash mining, may be the keys to turning around Canada's stagnant job market."}, {"title": "The Climate Corporation Expands Its Leading Digital Agriculture Platform Into Eastern Canada, Introducing Easy Data Connectivity, Visualization and Analysis to Farmers", "article": "Today, The Climate Corporation, a subsidiary of Monsanto Company, announced at Canada`s Outdoor Farm Show the introduction of the company`s industry-leading Climate FieldView digital agriculture platform into Eastern Canada for the 2017 growing season. With Climate`s digital tools, Canadian farmers will have the ability to easily collect, visualize, and analyze their field data in one centralized platform and uncover personalized field insights to support the many crucial decisions they make each season to maximize crop productivity. \"Similar to the launch of biotechnology in the 1990s, we are now experiencing the next revolution of global agriculture through transformative digital technologies that are helping farmers gain a much deeper understanding of their fields, optimize their resources and maximize their return on every acre,\" said Mike Stern, chief executive officer for The Climate Corporation. \"Through the advanced digital tools in the Climate FieldView platform, Canadian farmers can instantly visualize and analyze crop performance with field data maps and satellite imagery, so they can tailor their agronomic practices for the best outcome at the end of the season.\" Backed by the most powerful data science engine and extensive field research network in the agriculture industry, the Climate FieldView platform combines data science with field science and on-farm data to take the complex, environmental interactions that happen in each unique field and turn them into customized insights farmers can use to make data-driven decisions with confidence. Officially launched in 2015, Climate FieldView is now on more than 92 million acres across the United States, with more than 100,000 U.S. farmers actively engaging in Climate`s digital tools. In less than two growing seasons, Climate FieldView has already become the most broadly connected platform in the industry and has continued to expand new, unique product features and geographic availability of its offerings. Climate FieldView Features in Eastern Canada Data Connectivity - Farmers can experience simple data collection, storage and visualization through the Climate FieldView Drive, a device that provides seamless data connectivity by easily transferring field data from a farmer`s equipment into their Climate FieldView account. Launched early this year in the United States, FieldView Drive captures key planting data including hybrid and planting population, as well as key harvest data such as yield, and digitally displays that data in a farmer`s Climate FieldView account as the farmer passes through the field. This enables the ability for farmers to easily understand hybrid performance by field, and population with side-by-side views of as-planted and yield data. FieldView Drive will work with many tractors and combines in Eastern Canada. In addition to the FieldView Drive, farmers can connect their field data to their Climate FieldView account through Precision Planting`s 20/20 monitors and John Deere`s Wireless Data Server (WDS) technology. Climate FieldView also offers farmers the option of cloud-to-cloud connection with many other agricultural software systems, as well as manual file upload. Yield Analysis Tools - The Climate FieldView platform also provides seed performance analysis tools to help farmers evaluate the impact their agronomic decisions have on yield, so they can build the best plan to maximize profitability for the next season. Farmers can analyze seed performance by field and hybrid, and better understand their field variability by quickly and easily comparing digital field maps side-by-side. Advanced Satellite Imagery - With frequent and consistent high-quality field satellite imagery, farmers can find out what`s happening beyond the end rows and identify issues early, prioritize scouting, and take action to protect yield. Climate`s proprietary imagery process provides consistent imagery quality and frequency by using high-resolution imagery with vegetative data from multiple images, in addition to advanced cloud identification. Farmers can also drop geo-located scouting pins on field health images and navigate back to those spots for a closer look, or share with agronomic partners. Field-Level Weather - With field-level weather information and notifications, farmers can more efficiently prioritize and plan each day. Farmers can view historical, real-time and forecasted weather to decide which fields are workable based on average field precipitation and wind speed."}, {"title": "Agrium and PotashCorp to Combine in Merger of Equals to Create a World-Class Integrated Global Supplier of Crop Inputs", "article": "Release date - 14092016 Calgary, Alberta and Saskatoon, Saskatchewan - Agrium Inc. (TSX: AGU) (NYSE: AGU) and Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc. (TSX: POT) (NYSE: POT) today announced that they have agreed to combine in a merger of equals to create a world-class integrated global supplier of crop inputs. Under the agreement, which the Boards of Directors of both companies unanimously approved, a new parent company will be formed to own both companies. PotashCorp shareholders will receive 0.400 common shares of the new company for each common share of PotashCorp they own, and Agrium shareholders will receive 2.230 common shares of the new company for each common share of Agrium they own. The exchange ratios represent the exchange ratios of the two companies at market close on the NYSE on August 29, 2016 the last trading day prior to when the companies announced that they were in preliminary discussions regarding a merger of equals, which is consistent with the approximate 10 day and 60 day volume weighted average prices through that date. Following the close of the transaction, PotashCorp shareholders will own approximately 52 percent of the new company, and Agrium shareholders will own approximately 48 percent on a fully diluted basis. The new company, to be named prior to the transaction's closing, combines low-cost, world-class potash and high-quality nitrogen and phosphate production assets with a premier agricultural retail network to forge an integrated crop inputs platform to better serve customers. The new company will be a leader in the fertilizer industry with close to 20,000 employees, operations and investments in 18 countries, and a pro forma enterprise value of US$36 billion, based on each company's net debt as of June 30, 2016 and the current shares outstanding and respective closing share prices of the companies on the NYSE on August 29, 2016. On a 2015 pro forma basis, the new company would have had net revenue of approximately US$20.6 billion and EBITDA of US$4.7 billion before synergies. PotashCorp President and Chief Executive Officer Jochen Tilk said, 'Our merger creates a new premier Canadian-headquartered company that reflects our shared commitment to creating value and unlocking growth potential for shareholders. The integrated platform established through our combination will greatly benefit customers and suppliers, and support even greater career development opportunities for employees. Our workforce and the communities in which we operate are critical to both PotashCorp and Agrium, and we intend to carry forward best practices from both companies in corporate social responsibility, including commitments to employees, operating communities and the environment.' Agrium President and Chief Executive Officer Chuck Magro said, 'This is a transformational merger that creates benefits and growth opportunities that neither company could achieve alone. Combining our complementary assets will enable us to serve our customers more efficiently, deliver significant operating synergies and improve our cash flows to provide capital returns and invest in growth.' Strategic and Financial Benefits of the Merger Pre-eminent, low-cost producer of potash and high-quality nitrogen and phosphate: The new company will have a balanced nutrient portfolio that includes world-class potash production and complementary high-quality nitrogen and phosphate operations. It will have the lowest-cost potash production assets and reserves in North America, and a meaningful platform to benefit from continued growth in global potash demand. The merger also results in more diversified and complementary geographic and product portfolios in nitrogen and phosphate, with the North American nitrogen business expected to continue to benefit from low-cost feedstock and local distribution. Leading retail-distribution platform combined with two world-class nutrient production platforms: The new company will have a retail distribution platform encompassing crop nutrients and other input products, services, and solutions with operations in seven countries. The company will continue to emphasize innovation and growth in proprietary products, grower services, and distribution, with customers and suppliers benefiting from a broad agricultural solutions offering. The combined production footprint will drive freight savings and other operational efficiencies. Significant value creation from synergies: The combination is expected to generate up to US$500 million of annual operating synergies primarily from distribution and retail integration, production and SG&A optimization, and procurement. The synergies imply value creation for the combined enterprise of up to US$5 billion, or a 20 percent increase above the combined market capitalizations on August 29, 2016. The all-stock nature of the transaction allows all shareholders to participate in the benefits of the combination. The new company is expected to achieve approximately US$250 million of these synergies by the end of the first year after closing with the full run-rate achieved by the end of the second year. The transaction is expected to be accretive for both sets of shareholders with run-rate synergies. Compelling growth opportunities: Recently completed investments in new, low-cost capacity, particularly in potash, will improve the new company's operating costs and position it well to respond to increases in demand. Continuing to grow the retail business will also be a priority, including roll-up opportunities, new store openings, and innovation in products and services to better serve growers. Strong balance sheet with significant cash flow generation: On a 2015 pro forma basis, inclusive of expected synergies, the new company would have had operating cash flow of over US$4 billion. With major capacity expansion projects essentially complete at each company, the new company's low financial leverage, and significant cash flow generation, the combined company will have flexibility to return excess capital to shareholders and invest in growth initiatives, while also maintaining a strong investment grade credit rating profile. Both companies expect to maintain their existing dividend payments until the transaction is completed. Following the closing of the transaction, the new company will target a stable and growing dividend that reflects the strengthened cash flow profile of the combined company. Subject to market conditions and Board approval at the time of closing, the new company expects to establish a dividend payment equal to the current Agrium level, adjusted for the new share count. Leadership and Communities The new company will be led by a proven team that reflects the strengths and capabilities of both companies. Upon closing of the transaction, Jochen Tilk will serve as Executive Chairman, and Chuck Magro will serve as Chief Executive Officer, both reporting to the new Board of Directors. Wayne Brownlee will serve as Chief Financial Officer, and Steve Douglas will serve as Chief Integration Officer. Additional senior leadership positions for the new company will be named at a later date. The new company's Board of Directors will have equal representation. The Board's independent Lead Director will be designated by Agrium. In addition to leading the Board of Directors, the Executive Chairman will have executive responsibility for the new company's business strategy function. Following the closing of the transaction, the new company will have its registered head office in Saskatoon, with Canadian corporate offices in both Calgary and Saskatoon. In addition to maintaining a strong workforce in each of its operations, the new company will maintain its commitments to community involvement and investment. Canpotex The new company will remain committed to Canpotex, the global logistics and marketing company that provides efficient and cost-effective distribution to many of the world's fastest growing potash markets. Tax Treatment Canadian taxable resident shareholders will be able to elect such that they receive shares in the new company free of Canadian income taxes, and other shareholders will generally not be subject to Canadian income tax. It is expected that U.S. resident shareholders will generally receive shares in the new company on a tax-deferred basis for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Timing and Approvals The transaction will be implemented by way of a plan of arrangement under the Canada Business Corporations Act. It is expected to close during mid-2017, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals, Canadian court approval, and approval by the shareholders of both companies.

Yet the Pacific trade deal would boost dairy sales to Canada by $1.2 billion.", "article": "Rockwell City, Iowa The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced last week that it will spend $20 million to buy 5,500 tons of cheese from American dairy farmers. The food will be given to families in need, but charity is only a byproduct: The purpose of the purchase, according to a USDA press release, is \"reducing a cheese surplus\" and \"assisting the stalled marketplace for dairy producers whose revenues have dropped 35 percent over the past two years.\" By recent standards, this isn't exactly a massive bailout--we're talking millions of dollars, not billions--but it could be an ominous sign of things to come. All across American agriculture, production is up and prices are down. This fall, on my farm in Iowa, I expect to have a bumper crop of corn, growing more than 200 bushels an acre. But corn prices have tanked, dropping to about $2.85 a bushel today from $6.50 three crop-seasons ago. When I go to sell at the local elevator I expect to lose as much as $1.50 a bushel. Other farmers who grow different crops will suffer large losses as well, many for the third year in a row. Cutting back on production wouldn't help because farmers have substantial fixed costs--rent, land taxes, insurance, depreciation of equipment, seasonal labor. So instead we're going to hear more demands for emergency aid. Perhaps a few of these short-term measures make sense. But even if they don't, many farmers will applaud them, joined by the bankers and suppliers who want to be paid back for the farm loans they've made and the tractors they've sold. The calls for help could grow even louder in another few weeks: We're on the threshold of what might be the biggest harvest in the history of American farming. In my area, the weather has been about perfect, with hot days, cool nights and timely rains, plus no major storms or flooding. I'm hearing similar reports from farmers who grow wheat and soybeans in other states. Advanced seed technologies, improved crop protection and the revolution in precision agriculture are helping American farmers grow more food than ever before. Normally this would be excellent news. Yet we're in a moment of oversupply and weak demand, caused by three consecutive years of good weather. On top of that, the strong dollar discourages exports. This year's huge harvest will make a bad problem worse. Most farmers will simply have to tough it out. Some years, when both yields and prices are high, we hit it big. In 2013, I remember pulling 200 bushels an acre when prices were roughly $6.50 a bushel. That's when farmers have to save our money for days like these. Over time, we enjoy gains, suffer losses and eke out a living. There's an old saying that the cure for cheap corn is cheap corn. Today's oversupply will persuade many farmers to switch to other crops, such as millet or pinto beans. Next year's commodity markets could look very different, depending on everything from the weather to those thousands of individual choices that farmers will make in the coming months. Compared with that, what's $20 million in government cheese? Farmers don't need aid programs--we need trade programs. Customers are a much better and more reliable source of revenue than taxpayers.

The second quarter results reflect a 17-per-cent increase in fiscal year revenue, excluding discontinued operations, to $696,853, compared with $593,308 ($2,748,110 including discontinued operations) for the six-month period ended June 30, 2016.

Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, the company received the first of the guaranteed earn-out payments of $750,000 from SICPA SA. On Jan. 4, 2016, the company closed the sale of its wholly owned subsidiary, Global Fluids International (GFI) SA, to SICPA Finance SA (SICPA), a subsidiary of SICPA SA, each a privately owned company based in Switzerland, in exchange for cash and postclosing earn-out payments and certain additional payments. In accordance with international financial reporting standards (IFRS), the second quarter 2016 financial statements and management discussion and analysis are presented on an adjusted basis to include discontinued operations. For a reconciliation of discontinued operations, readers should refer to the sections \"adjusted revenue and profit from continuing operations\" and \"reconciliation of IFRS to adjusted results\" in the management discussion and analysis. Operations update In addition to its core customer base, Xenemetrix has a long-term supply and support agreement with SICPA to supply ED-XRF (energy dispersive/X-ray fluorescence) equipment to support Petromark fuel marking technology, which relies on Xenemetrix's ED-XRF technology to detect Petromark fuel markers. Sales in the first half of 2016 increased 17 per cent to $696,853 over 2015. In the first half of 2016, Eurocontrol invested $581,210 in research and development to update existing Xenemetrix product lines, to develop new products and solutions for field applications, and to enhance its manufacturing facilities and its quality control processes. This investment has been made to ensure that Xenemetrix maintains its position as a leader in the ED-XRF technology field and can continue to meet the high manufacturing and systems integration standards that its customers have come to expect. It is anticipated that sales for the balance of 2016 will remain consistent with 2015 revenue numbers with an increase anticipated in 2017 as SICPA gains market acceptance with its clients for the Petromark technology, the updated product line is rolled out and the expansion into the field of precision agriculture solidifies. Earlier this year, Xenemetrix announced that it had entered into a memorandum of understanding with Netafim, an Israeli company that is the global leader in drip and microirrigation solutions for Eurocontrol sustainable agricultural productivity, to develop a unique and innovative testing system utilizing Xenemetrix's ED-XRF technology for farmers and the greater farming community. Thus far, the equipment solution and its calibration to the precision agriculture business has exceeded Netafim's test parameters. Field trials will commence in the second half of 2016, with a current view to commercialization in mid-2017. Xenemetrix remains focused on the development of new applications for its ED-XRF and establishing new marketing and distribution agreements in various regions. In the first half of 2016, Eurocontrol invested $1,038,635 in research and development in XwinSys toward the development of equipment that combines ED-XRF and automated 2-D and 3-D image processing technologies for use in the semiconductor and related microelectronics industries. Earlier in 2016, XwinSys announced the finalized integration of its NMT (noise-reduced multilayer thin-film measurement system) technology (featured in Solid State Technology magazine) to respond to the evolving metrology and inspection needs of the semiconductor industry due to the advent of 3-D stacking structures for continued miniaturization of devices at an affordable cost. In May, 2016, XwinSys was granted a U.S. patent on this unique multimode technology system that meets both fast in-line and in-depth metrology challenges without interrupting process flow. The XwinSys solution overcomes limitations of current technology that is used to measure thin and ultrathin films, which can be a single layer of atoms of a specific material, and are a critical component in the construction of advanced semiconductor devices. With the XwinSys solution now finalized and demos, including the unveiling of the technology at Semicon West earlier this summer, where significant interest was generated, the XwinSys team is making good progress toward commercialization of this disruptive technology that replaces the need for off-line analytical tasks. Bruce Rowlands, chairman and chief executive officer, stated: \"Like the first quarter of this year, these results reflect operations without our former subsidiary GFI, as Eurocontrol continues a year of transition. Our planned investments in Xenemetrix's ED-XRF technology platform and XwinSys's patented hybrid microelectronics verification technologies, including the new 3-D stacking verification system, introduced at Semicon West in San Francisco last month, are progressing well. We believe that these investments, our relationship with SICPA and our focus on acquisition opportunities will provide us with new technology, as well as new applications and markets.\" Gilles Leraille, a recently appointed director of Eurocontrol and chief executive officer and member of the board of SICPA Global Fluids Integrity, stated: \"Since the acquisition of GFI in early 2016, SICPA has been working to integrate the Petromark fuel marking solution into the broad portfolio of track-and-trace technologies which it is offering to governments. Synergies have been identified as foreseen at the time of acquisition and which should indeed have positive impact. With the support and the ongoing improvements of the existing detectors by Xenemetrix, this should ensure for SICPA GFI, a continuing competitive edge.\" Second quarter 2016 financial and operating highlights (i) - Investment in research and development increased by 202 per cent to $1,619,845; - Working capital of $14,753,995, compared with $4,001,621 in Dec. 31, 2015, a 269-per-cent increase; - The company has no debt, compared with $975,741 in 2015; - Gross profit of $208,003, compared with $220,991 (does not include discontinued operations), a decrease of 6 per cent; - Recognized EBITDA of $15,799,460, compared with $761,233 in 2015; - Recognized income of $13,731,419, compared with $439,460 for the 2016 six-month period.

Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, the Company received the first of the guaranteed earn-out payments of $750,000 from SICPA SA. On January 4, 2016, the Company closed the sale of its wholly owned subsidiary, Global Fluids International (GFI) S.A. (\"GFI\") to SICPA Finance SA (\"SICPA\"), a subsidiary of SICPA SA, each a privately owned company based in Switzerland, in exchange for cash and post-closing earn-out payments and certain additional payments. In accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\"), the second quarter 2016 financial statements and MD&A are presented on an adjusted basis to include discontinued operations. For a reconciliation of discontinued operations, readers should refer to MD&A sections \"Adjusted Revenue and Profit from Continuing Operations\" and \"Reconciliation of IFRS to Adjusted Results\". Operations Update In addition to its core customer base, Xenemetrix has a long term supply and support agreement with SICPA to supply ED-XRF equipment to support Petromark(TM) fuel marking technology which relies on Xenemetrix ED-XRF technology to detect Petromark(TM) fuel markers. Sales in the first half of 2016 increased 17% to $696,853 over 2015. In the first half of 2016, Eurocontrol invested $581,210 in research and development to update existing Xenemetrix product lines, to develop new products and solutions for field applications and to enhance its manufacturing facilities and its quality control processes. This investment has been made to ensure that Xenemetrix maintains its position as a leader in the ED-XRF technology field and can continue to meet the high manufacturing and systems integration standards that its customers have come to expect. It is anticipated that sales for the balance of 2016 will remain consistent with 2015 revenue numbers with an increase anticipated in 2017 as SICPA gains market acceptance with its clients for the Petromark(TM) technology, the updated product line is rolled out and the expansion into the field of precision agriculture solidifies. Earlier this year, Xenemetrix announced that it had entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with Netafim, an Israeli company that is the global leader in drip and micro-irrigation solutions for Eurocontrol sustainable agricultural productivity, to develop a unique and innovative testing system utilizing Xenemetrix's ED-XRF technology for farmers and the greater farming community. Thus far the equipment solution and its calibration to the precision agriculture business has exceeded Netafim's test parameters. Field trials will commence in the second half of 2016 with a current view to commercialization mid 2017. Xenemetrix remains focused on the development of new applications for its ED-XRF and establishing new marketing and distribution agreements in various regions. In the first half of 2016, Eurocontrol invested $1,038,635 in research and development in XwinSys towards the development of equipment that combines ED-XRF and automated 2D and 3D image processing technologies for use in the semiconductor and related microelectronics industries. Earlier in 2016, XwinSys announced the finalized integration of its NMT (Noise-reduced Multilayer Thin-film Measurement System) technology (featured in Solid State Technology magazine) to respond to the evolving metrology and inspection needs of the semiconductor industry due to the advent of 3D stacking structures for continued miniaturization of devices at an affordable cost. In May 2016, XwinSys was granted a US patent on this unique multi-mode technology system that meets both fast in-line and in- depth metrology challenges without interrupting process flow. The XwinSys solution overcomes limitations of current technology that is used to measure thin and ultra-thin films, which can be a single layer of atoms of a specific material, and are a critical component in the construction of advanced semiconductor devices. With the XwinSys solution now finalized and demos, including the unveiling of the technology at SEMICON West earlier this summer where significant interest was generated, the XwinSys team is making good progress towards commercialization of this disruptive technology that replaces the need for off-line analytical tasks. Bruce Rowlands, Chairman and CEO stated, \"Like the first quarter of this year, these results reflect operations without our former subsidiary GFI, as Eurocontrol continues a year of transition. Our planned investments in Xenemetrix's ED-XRF technology platform and XwinSys' patented hybrid microelectronics verification technologies, including the new 3D stacking verification system, introduced at SEMICON West in San Francisco last month are progressing well. We believe that these investments, our relationship with SICPA and our focus on acquisition opportunities will provide us with new technology, as well as new applications and markets.\" Gilles Leraille, a recently appointed Director of Eurocontrol and CEO and member of the board of SICPA Global Fluids Integrity stated, \"Since the acquisition of GFI in early 2016, SICPA has been working to integrate the Petromark(TM) fuel marking solution into the broad portfolio of Track and Trace technologies which it is offering to governments. Synergies have been identified as foreseen at the time of acquisition and which should indeed have positive impact. With the support and the on-going improvements of the existing detectors by Xenemetrix, this should ensure for SICPA-GFI a continuing competitive edge.\" Second Quarter 2016 Financial and Operating Highlights *  29 Aug 2016 10:56 ET Press Release: Eurocontrol Reports Second Quarter -2-  About Eurocontrol Technics Group Inc.

AgJunction's consolidated second quarter 2016 results are presented as a combined entity. However, the comparative second quarter ended June 30, 2015 does not include Novariant's operations. Second Quarter 2016 Financial Summary vs. Second Quarter 2015 (where applicable)  Management Commentary \"Despite the current downturn in the agriculture industry, we continued to execute on our stated objectives,\" said Dave Vaughn, president and CEO of AgJunction. \"This includes effective cash management, a sharp focus on the growth of our existing customer base, and the successful integration of Novariant. \"In the first six months of 2016, we generated $2 million in free cash flow, over twice the amount compared to the same time last year, and we continued to have no debt. Excluding Novariant, we grew second quarter sales in all of our geographic regions by delivering a product portfolio with leading industry features and capabilities, and an explicit focus on customer support. Our integration of Novariant is progressing as planned and we continue to realize various synergies, both financially and competitively. In addition, we have had excellent customer retention with no customer attrition since completion of the merger. \"While long-term industry growth drivers such as population growth and reduced arable land remain strong, low crop prices continue to pressure the capital expenditure budgets of our customers. However, we believe that given our combined product offering, we are well-positioned to grow our revenue base when the industry strengthens.\" Second Quarter 2016 Financial Results Total sales in the second quarter increased 54% to $11.9 million compared to $7.7 million in the second quarter of 2015. The increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of Novariant in the fourth quarter of 2015. Sales were also up in all geographies. Gross profit in the second quarter increased 47% to $4.8 million compared to $3.2 million in the second quarter of 2015. Gross margin was 40.2% compared to 41.9% in the second quarter of 2015. The 170 basis point decline was primarily due to inventory write-downs in a slower moving product category. Total operating expenses were $6.1 million compared to $3.8 million for the second quarter of 2015. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses were 50.9% compared to 49.3% in the second quarter of 2015. The 160 basis point increase was primarily driven by incremental expenses associated with accounting for the acquisition of Novariant. Net loss in the second quarter of 2016 was $1.2 million, or $(0.01) per diluted share, compared to net income of $1.0 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2015. The second quarter of 2015 included a $1.6 million one-time gain on the sale of the Company's cloud services business. EBITDA was $(0.7) million compared to $1.2 million in the second quarter of 2015. The decline was primarily driven by the incremental operating expenses discussed above. While EBITDA in the second quarter of 2016 was negative, EBITDA in the first six months of 2016 was slightly positive. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the second quarter totaled $15.1 million, a 16% increase compared to $13.0 million at the end of 2015. The Company continues to have no debt.

Campbell said this is very relatable for Chatham-Kent, which is known for growing vegetables. \"I think it's a really great way to showcase that initiative, to get people to eat local and just really support their local farmers in their own area,\" she said. Campbell has a degree in food, agriculture and resource economics from the University of Guelph and works as a precision agriculture specialist for Can-Am Tractor Ltd. in Chatham. Since her job requires her to speak with farmers, she said she thinks she has developed useful skills for the competition. \"It definitely helps just with getting to know people (and) your people skills, which is another thing that they look for at the IPM,\" she said. As the local Queen of the Furrow, Campbell has spoken at banquets and promoted the Chatham-Kent Plowmen's Association. She has also spoke about Chatham-Kent's role as the host of the IPM in 2018. \"I've definitely grown as a person,\" she said. \"I'm more outgoing than I used to be and my public speaking skills have definitely grown as well.\" This year's IPM will be held in Minto in Wellington County from Sept. 20 to Sept. 24."}, {"title": "COMPANY SNAPSHOTS; AGRIUM INC.

Catch up on previous stories at tgam.ca/neweconomy A little more than a decade ago, Wade Barnes, a selfdescribed \"farm kid\" from central Manitoba, started a company in his basement with a friend and the idea that they could tap into Canadians' farming know-how to give the world \"precision agriculture\" - a better, more efficient way of maximizing crops and minimizing costs. Today, Farmers Edge Inc. is a high-tech company closing in on 350 employees, a bastion for engineers, scientists, software developers and business consultants. It delivers research, software, hardware and crop-management programs to farmers all over the world. A couple of years ago, Profit Magazine listed it as one of the country's top 20 fastest-growing companies. Now, Farmers Edge is delivering its analysis and cropmanagement information directly to an app on farmers' smartphones, allowing them to use real-time data to make informed decisions minute by minute, from the seat of the tractor, on how to tend their fields - whether those fields are in Canada or Brazil or Russia. \"We couldn't have done this five years ago,\" Mr. Barnes says. Companies such as Farmers Edge are increasingly emerging as the promising future for a Canadian export sector that is grappling with a severe downturn to its traditional resource base and a perhaps irreversible loss of global market share in manufacturing. The digitization of the global economy has created a world of new opportunities that never previously existed for companies that sell services, rather than physical goods. Experts believe that the services sector, which has already grown to be the dominant element in Canada's domestic economy as it has matured in recent decades, may be poised to do the same on a more global scale, as technology expands our capacity to export our country's wealth of knowledge and expertise to customers around the world. \"We think we're at a takeoff point now,\" says Glen Hodgson, chief economist at the Conference Board of Canada, a national economic and public-policy think tank that has published several papers on the fast-growing role of services in Canadian trade. \"We can now export these across borders.\" Canada's economy, and its growth, was increasingly tilting toward services even before the dramatic slowdown in commodities over the past year and a half or the financial crisis a few years before that, as the technological explosion of the digital age has altered the makeup of the country's economic activity. In 1999, service-producing industries accounted for 65 per cent of Canada's gross domestic product. By 2015, their share had risen to 70 per cent. Thirty years ago, households consumed more goods than services. Today, services make up nearly 55 per cent of household consumption. But the biggest shift has been in the makeup of Canada's labour market. In the mid-1970s, services jobs made up about 65 per cent of all employment; today, they account for nearly 80 per cent. While the number of goods-producing jobs in this country has barely budged in the past quartercentury, services-sector jobs have increased 50 per cent. And contrary to widespread public belief, this hasn't been a case of an economy replacing lost high-paying manufacturing jobs with so-called \"McJobs\" - lowpaying, low-skill fast-food and retail positions. In the past decade, the biggest job-growth areas for services has been in professional, scientific and technical services (up 30 per cent), and health care and social services (up 34 per cent), which together have added nearly one million net new jobs. (Over the same period, accommodation and food services have added about 200,000 jobs, about a 20-per-cent increase; retail jobs have increased by about 80,000, or just 4 per cent.) \"[The McJobs worry] seems to be way overblown,\" says Joe Atikian, author of Industrial Shift: The Structure of the New World Economy, a book that explores the global economy's shift toward services. \"If you look at the proportions of professional jobs, higher-paying service jobs, compared to the lower-paying jobs, it puts a lie to the whole general public perception.\" Services still represent a relatively small proportion of Canada's exports - about 15 per cent - but that's up from 13 per cent at the turn of the 21st century. On a volume basis, services exports have risen 26 per cent since 2000; goods exports have grown only 11 per cent. In the past 15 years, exports of such financial services, management services and architectural and engineering services have roughly tripled. Computer and information service exports have doubled. In the same period, exports of motor vehicles and parts, traditionally a linchpin of the country's goods exporting sector, have declined 13 per cent. Calgary's Benevity Inc. is one company that's riding that new wave. The firm, which provides software-based solutions to manage corporate and employee charitable-giving programs, had only about a dozen staff when it signed its first big client (Nike Inc.) three years ago. Today, it has more than 260 employees, and has exported its software platform and services to big-name corporate clients spanning the globe. \"Web-based hosting of software functionality is probably the predominant driver of that,\" says entrepreneur Bryan de Lottinville, Benevity's founder and chief executive. The Conference Board of Canada argued in a report last year that if you consider the services content that now goes into exported Canadian goods - the value added from services effectively \"built into\" those products - services are a much bigger part of our exports than the direct numbers suggest. The study estimated that including these \"supply-chain contributions,\" services account for 44 per cent of Canadian exports, as well as 43 per cent of all products sold through Canadian companies' foreign affiliates. \"There's a huge transformation going on inside what were viewed as old and very staid industries,\" says Peter Hall, chief economist at Export Development Canada. He says the burst in digital technology going into manufactured goods has intensified the service component involved in making traditional goods. \"There's no such thing as a primary industry any more. Every industry is a high-tech industry.\" An announcement from General Motors of Canada in June provided perhaps the highest-profile evidence yet of how this evolution could reshape Canada's export sector. The auto maker announced it would add up to 750 new jobs at its headquarters in Oshawa, Ont. - and they wouldn't be workers on the production line, but rather engineers tasked with designing the hightech, digitally connected vehicles of the future. They'll be paid roughly 40 per cent more than the average worker on the line. The fruits of their research and development will be exported to GM's production facilities around the world. \"In future, manufacturing and engineering companies will really be data companies with huge amounts of customer behaviour and logistics data. Those that can best leverage the acceleration of global data flows will be in the best position to take full advantage of global markets in the future,\" the Conference Board said in a recent report, co-written by Mr. Hodgson and Danielle Goldfarb. But capitalizing further on service-sector opportunities, experts say, will require a new approach to exports. Canada's trade deals of the future may have to look quite different from those of the past, such as the North American free-trade agreement, whose great achievement has been in reducing tariffs on physical goods. Trade experts generally agree that the next wave of trade deals must focus on intellectual property - walking a delicate line between protecting ownership and maintaining security on the one hand, and allowing for freer flows of data across borders on the other. Many experts cite the intellectual-property provisions contained in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, signed earlier this year by Canada and 11 other countries, as an example of the new direction that trade deals will have to take, if trade in services is going to globalize in this century the way trade in goods did in the past century. \"Data flows are now fundamental to every kind of international trade and investment - not just trade in virtual worlds or digital products,\" Mr. Hodgson and Ms. Goldfarb wrote in their report. \"Policies will need to place much more emphasis on the freer movement of data, people, services and investment.\" \"We have to open up our minds to a very different paradigm,\" Mr. Hodgson says. \"It's trade in ideas.\""}, {"title": "INDUSTRY SNAPSHOTS; CANADA - MINING - UPDATED 4 AUGUST 2016", "article": "LATEST COMPANY NEWS News and Commentary BluMetric wins pair of mining sector contracts worth $3M - 2/8/2016 Deals cover analysis and restoration work at two Ontario mine sites For the complete story see: MINING.com - Canada invests $133 million in Tata Steel Quebec-Labrador iron ore project - 30/7/2016 The Canadian province of Quebec will spend $133 million in an iron ore project majority owned by Tata Steel Minerals Canada, a subsidiary of Indian giant Tata Steel.

(TSE: SLW) - Silver Wheaton Increases Its Gold Stream From The Salobo Mine And Revises Production Guidance - 2/8/2016 VANCOUVER, Aug. 2, 2016 /PRNewswire/ - Silver Wheaton Corp. (\"Silver Wheaton\" or the \"Company\") (TSX:SLW) (NYSE:SLW) is pleased to announce that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Silver Wheaton (Caymans) Ltd. (\"SWC\"), has agreed to acquire from a subsidiary of Vale S.A. (\"Vale\") (NYSE:VALE) an additional amount of gold equal to 25% of the life of mine gold production from its Salobo mine, located in Brazil. This acquisition is in addition to the 50% of the Salobo gold production that SWC is currently entitled to. SWC will pay upfront cash consideration of US$800 million for the increased gold stream and the 10 million Silver Wheaton common share purchase warrants previously issued to a subsidiary of Vale will be amended to reduce the strike price from US$65 to US$43.75 per common share1. In addition, SWC will make ongoing payments of the lesser of US$400 (subject to a 1% annual inflation adjustment now commencing in 2019 on the entire 75% stream) and the prevailing market price for each ounce of gold delivered under the agreement. TRANSACTION HIGHLIGHTS Provides immediate and long-term production and cash flow SWC will receive an additional 25% of the gold production from Vale's Salobo mine, entitling SWC to a total of 75% of the life-of-mine gold production from the mine. Immediately increases Silver Wheaton's consolidated production and cash flow profile as Salobo gold production is expected to average approximately 300,000 ounces per year in total between 2016 and 2020, of which SWC will be entitled to 75% as of the effective date of July 1, 2016. Increases Silver Wheaton's consolidated estimated Proven and Probable gold reserves by 3.2 million ounces, Measured and Indicated gold resources by 0.7 million ounces, and Inferred gold resources by 0.4 million ounces. At current production rates, Proven and Probable reserves are sufficient to support 50 years of mine life, with excellent potential to further extend the mine life. Increases Silver Wheaton's gold growth profile With the additional stream from Salobo, Silver Wheaton's estimated attributable gold production in 2016 is now forecast to be 305,000 ounces, and estimated average annual attributable gold production over the next five years (including 2016) is anticipated to be approximately 330,000 ounces per year. \"The Salobo mine is a cornerstone asset for Silver Wheaton and should be for generations to come,\" said Randy Smallwood, Silver Wheaton's President and Chief Executive Officer. \"We did not hesitate at the opportunity to increase our exposure to a mine with one of the lowest copper cash costs in the world, 50 years of mine life on reserves alone, and what we believe to be substantial exploration and expansion potential. As we have said on numerous occasions, Salobo is the ideal asset for the streaming model, as it is primarily a base metal producer where precious metals represent only a relatively small portion of the mine's overall revenues.\" \"The addition of another 25% gold stream from Salobo further adds to Silver Wheaton's robust cash flow. Given the quality of the portfolio, with over 90% of our production coming from mines in the lowest half of their respective cost curves, and the expected production profile over the next five years, Silver Wheaton is very comfortable financing this transaction using cash on hand and our existing revolving credit facility. Based on our guidance and current commodity prices, the upfront payment represents slightly more than one year of anticipated cash flow. The strength of our cash flow potential speaks volumes about the streaming model in general and the unparalleled quality of Silver Wheaton's portfolio in particular.\" TRANSACTION TERMS The existing gold purchase agreement has been amended and restated to provide for the additional 25% stream, with SWC now receiving 75% of the life-of-mine gold production from this mine. SWC will be entitled to all attributable gold production for which an off-taker payment is received after July 1, 2016. SWC will pay a wholly-owned subsidiary of Vale upfront cash consideration of US$800 million for the increased gold stream as an advance payment against the purchase price for the sale of gold to SWC. In addition, subject to the approval of the Toronto Stock Exchange, the 10 million Silver Wheaton common share purchase warrants, initially issued on February 28, 2013 and expiring on February 28, 2023 entitling a wholly-owned subsidiary of Vale to purchase one common share of Silver Wheaton for each whole warrant upon payment of US$65 per common share (subject to the terms of the warrant indenture) will be amended such that the per common share strike price will be decreased from US$65 to US$43.75. The amended warrants will become effective on August 16, 2016. Neither Vale nor its wholly-owned subsidiary is an insider of Silver Wheaton. SWC will make ongoing payments of the lesser of US$400 (subject to a 1% annual inflation adjustment now commencing in 2019 for the Salobo stream) and the prevailing market price, for each ounce of gold delivered under the agreement. The terms of the existing gold stream on Salobo were modified so that the annual inflation adjustment that was scheduled to start in 2017 will now start in 2019. Gold deliveries for the entire 75% gold stream will be the obligation of a wholly owned subsidiary of Vale, but will be guaranteed by Vale and the direct holder of Salobo, Salobo Metais S.A. Mill throughput at the Salobo mine is currently 24 million tonnes per annum (\"Mtpa\"). If throughput capacity is expanded within a predetermined period and depending on the grade of material processed, SWC will be required to make an additional payment to Vale, relative to the 75% stream, that now ranges from US$113 million if throughput is expanded beyond 28 Mtpa by January 1, 2036, up to US$953 million if throughput is expanded beyond 40 Mtpa by January 1, 2021. For example, if Salobo is expanded to 36 Mtpa between 2021 and 2025, the expansion payment would range between US$514 million and US$692 million. FINANCING THE ACQUISITION Silver Wheaton intends to use cash on hand together with proceeds available under the Company's US$2 billion revolving credit facility (\"Revolving Facility\") to pay the upfront cash payment of US$800 million. The Revolving Facility has a maturity date of February 27, 2021. ABOUT THE SALOBO MINE According to Vale's public filings, the Salobo mine, located in the Para state of Brazil, is the largest copper deposit in Brazil. This low-cost copper-gold mine was commissioned in November 2012 with a design throughput capacity of 12 Mtpa and subsequently expanded to 24 Mtpa of mill capacity in mid-2014. The mine is well-positioned relative to infrastructure and is connected to the national power grid. The Salobo mine has total estimated Mineral Reserves of 1.157 billion tonnes grading 0.67% copper and 0.35 g/t gold2, and, along with additional Mineral Resources, also has substantial exploration and expansion potential. The acquisition of an additional 25% life of mine gold stream adds an estimated 3.2 million ounces of Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves, 0.7 million ounces of Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources, and 0.4 million ounces of Inferred Mineral Resources attributable to Silver Wheaton. Total estimated attributable Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources for the now 75% life-of-mine gold stream are detailed in the table below. Vale has indicated that it intends to re-initiate an exploration program at Salobo as early as 2017 that will include additional exploration drilling. SILVER WHEATON ANNOUNCES NEW PRODUCTION GUIDANCE Silver Wheaton is pleased to provide its updated one-year and long-term production guidance, which incorporates the additional 25% life-of-mine gold stream on the Salobo mine. In 2016, Silver Wheaton's estimated attributable gold production is now forecast to be 305,000 ounces, up from 265,000 ounces previously, and estimated average annual attributable gold production over the next five years (including 2016) is anticipated to be approximately 330,000 ounces of gold per year, up from 260,000 ounces. Silver production in 2016 is now forecast to be approximately 32 million ounces, down slightly from 32.8 million ounces previously guided as production from San Dimas and Penasquito is expected to be lower offset in part by better than expected production from Antamina. Average annual silver production over the next five years (including 2016) remains unchanged at 31 million ounces per year. Given the strong performance of the silver price year to date, the gold:silver ratio has contracted substantially since Silver Wheaton originally released silver equivalent production guidance for the year. Previous guidance was based on a gold:silver ratio of 80:1. Given the recent volatility of both gold and silver prices, Silver Wheaton will now provide production guidance on both a silver equivalent basis (SEO) and gold equivalent basis (GEO). As such, and based on the average LBMA gold and silver price for the first half of 2016 ($1,234 and $16.27, respectively)3, Silver Wheaton is now forecasting 2016 production of 55 million SEOs or 730,000 GEOs, and production over the next five years (including 2016) is forecast to average 56 million SEOs per year or 740,000 GEOs per year. Over the next five years, forecast production growth from Salobo, Penasquito and Constancia is expected to be offset by the cessation of production from assets with fixed terms. In particular, the 10-year-term contract on Capstone Mining's Cozamin mine, acquired with Silver Wheaton's 2009 acquisition of Silverstone, expires in April 2017. In addition, Silver Wheaton's streaming agreement with Barrick regarding Pascua-Lama provides the Company with silver production from the Lagunas Norte, Veladero, and Pierina mines until March 31, 2018. Hudbay's Constancia mine is expected to meet the completion test, resulting in gold production from the 777 mine attributable to Silver Wheaton dropping from 100% to 50% in 2017. And lastly, as a reminder, Silver Wheaton does not include any production from Barrick's Pascua-Lama project or Hudbay's Rosemont project in its guidance. SALOBO ACQUISITION PRESENTATION Q2 2016 CONFERENCE CALL Silver Wheaton will discuss the transaction in more detail in its 2016 second quarter results conference call to be held on Thursday, August 11, 2016, starting at 11:00 am (Eastern Time).

Latest Research Effects of organic liquids on coking properties of a higher-inert Western Canadian coal Maria E. Holuszko, W. Ross Leeder, Melanie Mackay, Louis Giroux, Tony MacPhee, Ka Wing Ng, Heather Dexter Abstract The effect of organic liquids (white spirit, perchloroethylene and methylene bromide) typically used in float/sink gravity separations (specific gravity 1.4-1.8) on the fundamental properties of a higher-inert Western Canadian metallurgical coal of mvb rank (Romax 1.22) and its resultant coking ability were examined. Over a 6-month period, untreated (control) and treated coal were characterized using a wide range of analyses including elemental chemistry, FTIR spectroscopy, alkali extraction via light transmittance test and thermal rheology, specifically fluidity, Dilatation, FSI and Caking Index G. Exposure to organic liquids was found to have a minor effect on coal chemistry (Ultimate) and oxidation level (Alkali Extraction via Light Transmission Test and FTIR-Spectroscopy). Trends of H/C, O/C, Light Transmittance and FTIR absorbance spectra versus storage time, following initial 1 h exposure to the organic liquids of varying specific gravities, revealed only minor changes, within the scatter/accuracy of the measurements. However, several coal plastic properties were decreased significantly including Gieseler Maximum Fluidity, Dilatation and G Caking Index. Of these, most affected was Maximum Fluidity which underwent an immediate and dramatic decrease of over 80% following organic liquids treatment. Other rheology indicators including FSI and Sapozhnikov were significantly less sensitive in detecting initial stages of degradation in plastic properties. The coking ability of both the untreated and treated coal in perchloroethylene (PCE) organic liquid, s.g. 1.6, after storage for 1 and 6 months was assessed through carbonization trials in both a small-scale sole-heated oven (12.5 kg capacity) and in a pilot-scale movable wall oven (350 kg capacity) at CanmetENERGY Carbonization facility, Ottawa, Canada. The treated samples had appreciably poorer quality ambient (ASTM, IRSID, JIS tumbler tests) and hot (CSR, CRI) coke strength and modified coke structure. Coke ASTM strength for untreated and treated coal at time 1 month was respectively decreased from 62 down to 57 for Stability and from 72 to 67 for Hardness. Similarly, Coke CSR and CRI for untreated and treated coal at time 1 month was respectively decreased from 74 down to 58 and increased from 21 to 29. The treated sample resulted in a lower coke yield, 71%, in comparison with 78% for the untreated sample, produced coke of smaller mean size, 46 mm, than the untreated sample, 53 mm, and generated an appreciably higher fraction of fines (- 12.5 mm), 21%, than untreated sample, 4%. The coke textures from the untreated coal consist of higher carbon forms, mosaic and flow in medium size, compared to those from s.g. 1.6 treated coal of lower carbon forms, very fine and fine mosaic, which renders the coke more reactive to CO2 gasification during CSR test. The higher effective coking rank, 1.2, and Coke Mosaic Size Index, 2.4, of untreated sample relative to that of treated one, 1.1 and 2.2, respectively, supports the better coke quality of the untreated sample. Extension of storage time to 6 months resulted in negligible changes in coke quality showing that the greatest changes occurred within the first month following exposure to organic liquids. Comparison of 1 month untreated and PCE treated mid coking rank Western Canadian (Romax 1.22) and Australian (Romax 1.17) coals show both to undergo comparable decrease in fluidity (50-60%) post treatment with PCE although only the Western Canadian coal leads to lower dilatation. Coke yield is also decreased for the Western Canadian coal and essentially maintained for the Australian coal. Both CSR and CRI are affected negatively and more so for the Western Canadian coal, 16 point drop in CSR and 8 point increase in CRI, relative to the Australian coal, 3 point drop in CSR and 4 point increase in CRI. The Industry Mining Facts Minerals and metals are the building blocks of the computers and smartphones we rely on, of the vehicles and public transit that get us places, of the buildings where we live and work, and of green technologies that help make the world a more sustainable place. Just as we as individuals depend on mining to support our daily lives, Canada relies on the industry to keep the economy humming. Mining is one of Canada's most important economic sectors and a major job creator. A major employer: Approximately 380,000 people across Canada work in the mining and mineral processing industries. Mining is the largest private sector employer of Aboriginal peoples in Canada on a proportional basis, and employment is poised to increase. Canada has one of the largest mining supply sectors globally with more than 3,400 companies supplying engineering, geotechnical, environmental, financial and other services to mining operations. Those who work in mining enjoy the highest wages and salaries of all industrial sectors in Canada with an average annual pay exceeding $110,000, which surpassed the average earnings of workers in forestry, manufacturing, finance and construction by a range of $31,000 to $46,000 for those sectors. An economic engine: Mining contributed $54 billion to Canada's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2013. The industry accounted for 19.6% of the value of Canadian goods exports in 2013. Canada's value of mineral production was nearly $43.6 billion in 2013. The mining industry's payments to Canadian federal and provincial governments total $71 billion in taxes and royalties over the last decade (2003-2012). A global leader: Thanks to its rich geology, Canada is one of the largest mining nations in the world producing more than 60 minerals and metals. Canada ranks in the top five countries in the global production of 11 major minerals and metals: First in potash Second in uranium and cobalt Third in aluminum and tungsten Fourth in platinum group metals, sulphur and titanium Fifth in nickel and diamonds 57% of the world's public mining companies are listed on the TSX and TSX-Venture Exchanges. Together, the two exchanges handled 48% of global mining equity transactions in 2013, and accounted for 46% of global mining equity capital for that year. Globally, Canada is recognized for its leadership in safety and sustainability. Mining companies in Canada were the first in the world to develop an externally-verified performance system for sustainable mining practices with the creation of MAC's Towards Sustainable Mining initiative in 2004. Leading Companies Agrium Inc. (TSE: AGU) Our vision to help feed the world responsibly means not only helping farmers grow more food, but doing it in ways that protect the environment, support economic vitality and enhance communities. One of the greatest challenges the global community has ever faced is how to sustainably feed a rapidly growing population. This challenge is complex and won't be solved quickly, but we believe we're stronger working together. By collaborating with multiple groups, we build long-term, impactful programs and solutions that we continually learn from and build upon. Agrium's Solid First Quarter Results Driven by Strong Operating Performance TUESDAY, MAY 03, 2016 CALGARY, AB--(Marketwired - May 03, 2016) - Agrium Inc. (TSX: AGU) (NYSE: AGU) announced today its 2016 first quarter earnings results, with net earnings attributable to equity holders of Agrium of $2-million ($0.02 diluted earnings per share) compared to $12-million ($0.08 diluted earnings per share) in the first quarter of 2015. The reduction in net earnings was driven by weaker selling prices across all nutrients. This was largely offset by excellent results achieved from our Retail operations and strong Wholesale operational performance. Highlights: First quarter adjusted net earnings were $7-million or $0.05 per share (see page 2 for adjusted net earnings reconciliation)1. Retail achieved the second highest EBITDA2 for a first quarter, with strong margins across all major product lines. International Retail delivered strong results, with South America achieving record first quarter EBITDA, and Australia reaching record first quarter in local currency. Wholesale continues to achieve impressive operational performance. This quarter, nitrogen margins remained strong despite much lower benchmark prices. Agrium acquired 27 Retail locations through acquisitions in Canada and the U.S., adding expected annual incremental EBITDA of over $11-million. We achieved a 6 percent reduction in consolidated selling, general and administrative costs compared to the same period last year, demonstrating the ongoing results of our Operational Excellence initiative. 2016 annual guidance range has been revised to $5.25 to $6.25 diluted earnings per share due to the weak outlook for nutrient prices (see page 4 for guidance assumptions and further details). \"Agrium's first quarter results once again highlight the resilience of our business model,\" commented Chuck Magro, Agrium's President and CEO. \"Our Retail business achieved impressive first quarter EBITDA, with strong margins across all major product lines. Our Wholesale business unit continued to demonstrate excellent operating performance and capitalized on our extensive competitive advantages,\" added Mr. Magro. First quarter effective tax rate of 29 percent used for adjusted net earnings and per share calculations. These are non-IFRS measures which represent net earnings adjusted for certain income (expenses) that are considered to be non-operational in nature. We believe these measures provide meaningful comparison to the earnings of other companies by eliminating share-based payments expense (recovery), gains (losses) on foreign exchange and related gains (losses) on non-qualifying derivative hedges and significant non-operating, non-recurring items. These should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS and may not be directly comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Earnings (loss) from continuing operations before finance costs, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. MARKET OUTLOOK Agricultural & Crop Input Markets U.S. grower margins and grower sentiment have improved over the past month. This was a result of U.S. new crop corn futures having increased by approximately 5 percent from the lows at the beginning of April, while new crop soybean prices have increased by 16 percent since early March and is now at the highest level since December 2014. As a result, growers' prospective 2016 cash margins are up from 2015 levels, the first year-over-year improvement in two and four years respectively. The United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Prospective Plantings report estimated that U.S. growers intend to plant 93.6 million acres of corn, which would be an increase of 5.6 million acres or about 6 percent from 2015 levels. Agrium believes corn acreage expansion this year will be closer to 5 percent, as soybean prices have strengthened in response to damaging rains during harvest in Argentina. According to the most recent USDA forecasts, U.S. acreage of corn, soybean and cotton could increase by over 6 million acres, supporting crop input and services demand in 2016. However, in Canada it is expected that pea and lentil acreage will expand by almost 2 million acres, which could negatively impact Western Canadian demand for nitrogen this year. The spring season across North America began early, which tends to support higher acreage levels, as well as the premium for North American crop nutrient prices. This has been most evident on nitrogen products. It also tends to bring forward timing of crop protection product applications. In Western Canada, there are some regional concerns about dryness as precipitation has been below normal the past two months. The value of the U.S. dollar has weakened relative to most other global currencies since the beginning of 2016, but non-U.S. currency values still remain weak on a historic basis. A relatively weak currency shields non-U.S. growers from the impact of low global crop prices and has supported relatively high crop acreage outside of the U.S. This is primarily why Brazil had such a strong acreage of second crop corn this year which supported stronger than expected crop nutrient shipments in Brazil to start 2016. Nitrogen Outlook North American nitrogen prices increased beginning in February 2016, driven by a relatively early start to the spring application season, combined with relatively low volumes of offshore imports. In January to February 2016, U.S. offshore imports of urea were down close to 40 percent compared to the same period of 2015. Due to the poor 2015 fall application season in the U.S. and the high corn acreage intentions for 2016 projected by the USDA, U.S. spring nitrogen applications are expected to be historically high. Nitrogen projects in North America are expected to continue to ramp up in 2016, which is expected to keep buyers tentative entering the fill season in the second half of the year. Chinese urea exports were down by 1.5 million tonnes in first quarter of 2016 from Q1 2015 levels due to strong domestic demand in China and low export urea prices to begin 2016. Chinese urea production levels in the first quarter of 2016 were relatively flat to the same period of 2015, but did decline about 10 percent from the high levels in the fourth quarter of 2015. Indian urea imports were lower in the first quarter of 2016 than they were a year ago. However, India recently called a tender for imports for its 2016/17 year. While imports are expected to decline from record 2015 levels, they are expected to be historically high, particularly if the monsoon season is above-average, as projected by the India Meteorological Department. Potash Outlook A number of factors combined to pressure the North American potash market in the first quarter including: the poor fall application season, which created a bottleneck in the supply chain with potash being stored in warehouses rather applied in the fall;; and above-average offshore imports of potash. While first quarter 2016 North American offshore imports of potash were down close to 50 percent from 2015 levels, they were still above any other year since 2011. U.S. potash prices are below other global import levels, which are expected to continue to pressure imports relative to 2015 levels. Brazilian potash demand has been a positive surprise to start 2016, with first quarter imports up over 20 percent from the first quarter of 2015. The uncertainty over the Brazilian political and economic situation will be a source of uncertainty for the remainder of 2016. China has yet to sign 2016 potash supply agreements, which continues to add uncertainty to the global potash market. Chinese import volumes will be an important driver of the potash market in the second half of 2016. The Indian government announced modest changes to the Nutrient Based Subsidy (NBS) for potash in 2016/17, which improves the import economics and should support improved import demand in the second half of 2016. Phosphate Outlook North American phosphate demand is projected to be relatively strong in the spring of 2016 due to the poor fall application season and relative stability in prices, which have increased from the January 2016 lows. Chinese phosphate exports have declined compared to 2015 levels, in part because of lower import demand from India. Similar to potash, the changes in the NBS for phosphate in India appear positive for second half diammonium phosphate demand, but most analysts expect reduced demand in 2016 from 2015 levels. 2016 ANNUAL GUIDANCE Based on our Market Outlook, Agrium expects to achieve annual diluted earnings per share of $5.25 to $6.25 in 2016 compared to our previous estimate of $5.50 to $7.00. We have lowered the guidance range due to a challenging pricing environment for all nutrients and expectations for a stronger Canadian dollar, partially offset by lower natural gas costs and continued strong performance by our Retail business. We are issuing earnings guidance of $4.00 to $4.30 diluted earnings per share for the first half of 2016. We have reduced our estimate of potash production to 2.3 to 2.4 million tonnes. Retail crop nutrient sales tonnes for 2016 are now expected to be from 9.8 million to 10.3 million tonnes. The slight widening of the range from our previous estimate is due to a forecasted increase in U.S. planted corn acres. Our estimates for the Canada/U.S. foreign exchange rate and NYMEX for 2016 have been updated based on current market conditions. This guidance and updated additional measures and related assumptions are summarized in the table below. Guidance excludes the impact of share-based payments expense (recovery), gains (losses) on foreign exchange and non-qualifying derivative hedges and significant non-operating, non-recurring items. Volumetric and earnings estimates assume normal seasonal growing and harvest patterns in the geographies where Agrium operates. 2016 ANNUAL GUIDANCE RANGE AND ASSUMPTIONS   Annual   Low High Diluted EPS (in U.S. dollars) $5.25 $6.25 Guidance assumptions:     Wholesale:       Production tonnes:         Nitrogen (millions) 3.5 3.7     Potash (millions) 2.3 2.4 Retail:       EBITDA (millions of U.S. dollars) $1,075 $1,175   Crop nutrient sales tonnes (millions) 9.8 10.3 Other:       Operational tax rate 28% 27%   Sustaining capital expenditures (millions of U.S. dollars) $500 $550   Total capital expenditures (millions of U.S. dollars) $800 $900   Canada/U.S. foreign exchange rate $1.31 $1.36   NYMEX gas price ($/MMBtu) $2.65 $2.05 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Unless otherwise noted, all financial information in this Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is prepared using accounting policies in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and is presented in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 - Interim Financial Reporting.

This was coupled with better margin rates on our major product lines due to effective price management, change in product mix and higher proprietary product sales. Wholesale sales and gross profit decreased compared to the first quarter last year primarily due to lower realized selling prices, which were consistent with benchmark prices and the scale back of our Purchase for Resale business. This was partially offset by the increase in potash sales volumes due to higher utilization rates in the first quarter of 2016. Expenses General and administrative expenses decreased by $12-million (18 percent) for the first quarter compared to the same period last year as a result of reduced payroll and office expenses related to our ongoing Operational Excellence program. Share-based payments expense was lower by $41-million compared to first quarter of last year primarily due to a decrease in Agrium's share price in the first quarter of 2016.

Retail reported record first quarter sales and the second highest first quarter gross profit and EBITDA in history. The strong results were due to strong margins across our major product offerings and lower operating costs, an early start to the spring application season in the U.S. and record results in our South American operations. Total Retail selling expenses as a percentage of sales decreased by 1 percent compared to the same period in the prior year due to ongoing network optimization and the impact of currency valuations in our international businesses. U.S. operations experienced strong demand this quarter for all major crop inputs, supported by missed fall applications in 2015 due to poor weather, the early spring season this year and grower intentions to expand acreage of crop input intensive crops such as corn and cotton in 2016. Our Canadian business experienced a relatively slow first quarter which is historically its quietest period during the year, while the second quarter is traditionally the busiest. Internationally, South American EBITDA increase of $7-million was a significant improvement compared to the same period last year as a result of favorable growing conditions and improved agricultural policies in Argentina. Australia reported record Australia dollar EBITDA due to strong demand for crop protection, seed and other services but were slightly below last year on a U.S. dollar basis. Retail sales and gross profit by product line           Three months ended March 31,     Sales   Gross profit   Gross profit (%) (millions of U.S. dollars, except where noted)   2016   2015   Change   2016   2015   Change   2016   2015 Crop nutrients   839   911   (72 )   134   126   8     16   14 Crop protection products   831   793   38     121   108   13     15   14 Seed   376   308   68     51   40   11     14   13 Merchandise   117   142   (25 )   19   20   (1 )   16   14 Services and other   127   109   18     77   77   -     61   71 Crop nutrients Total crop nutrient sales were 8 percent lower compared to the same period last year due to lower global prices across all nutrients. Total crop nutrient volumes were 4 percent higher this quarter across our Retail operations compared to the same period last year. Volumes were 15 percent higher in the U.S. due to an early spring application season and 9 percent higher in South America due to favorable weather conditions. In Canada and Australia, growers were conservative given the uncertainty over nutrient and agricultural markets as well as dry conditions in some areas. Total crop nutrient gross profit increased 6 percent due to a combination of higher-value product mix, including continued growth of our higher-margin proprietary nutritional products, increased nutrient volumes and higher margins per tonne for nutrients. Gross profit as a percentage of sales rose from 14 percent in the first quarter of 2015 to 16 percent this quarter. Crop protection products Total crop protection sales were up 5 percent this quarter as North American growers took advantage of the favorable weather to apply herbicides to control weeds, which were prevalent due to the early spring and wet weather last fall which limited post-harvest herbicide applications. In Australia, sales were higher compared to the same period last year due to early rains in the western growing regions and increased sales of proprietary products, despite competitive pricing pressure on glyphosate and herbicides. Crop protection margins as a percentage of sales increased 1 percent, primarily due to higher-margin product mix this quarter. Proprietary crop protection product sales as a percentage of total crop protection sales increased 3 percent compared to the same period in the prior year. Seed Seed sales were up 22 percent this quarter compared to the same period last year, primarily due to the expected increase in 2016 planted acreage for corn and cotton in the U.S. and the early planting window. Total seed margins as a percentage of sales increased 1 percent compared to the same period in the prior year due to seed sales mix and strong sales of higher-margin proprietary product seed. The proportion of proprietary seed sales was 3 percent higher than in the first quarter of 2015 and margins for proprietary seed were also higher year-over-year. Merchandise Merchandise sales decreased 18 percent compared to the same period last year primarily as a result of lower fuel pricing and demand in Canada, and lower animal health sales in Australia. Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased 2 percent this quarter, primarily due to a reduction in the lower-margin Canadian fuel business compared to the prior year. Services and other Sales for services and other was up 17 percent this quarter, due mainly to the early spring application season in the U.S. and higher real estate and livestock marketing revenue in Australia. Wholesale Three months ended March 31, (millions of U.S. dollars, except where noted)   2016   2015   Change Sales   649   867   (218 ) Sales volumes (tonnes 000's)   1,926   2,034   (108 ) Cost of product sold   496   633   (137 ) Gross profit   153   234   (81 ) Expenses   34   40   (6 ) Gain on sale of assets   -   38   (38 ) Total sales were lower than the same period last year, as realized sales prices were pressured by lower nutrient prices globally. Total sales volumes were lower than the same period last year due to a lower volume of product purchased for resale tonnes as we continued to scale back this business.

Sales volumes were slightly lower than the same period last year, as Western Canadian dealers were slow to commit to nitrogen purchases early in the season. However demand in the U.S. was strong due to the early start to the spring application season, which supported increased ammonia sales volumes. Realized selling prices per tonne were down 18 percent compared to the same period last year due to weaker global market conditions impacting benchmark nitrogen prices. Cost of product sold per tonne was 8 percent lower than the same period last year due to lower natural gas prices and lower fixed costs per tonne during the quarter. Natural gas prices: North American indices and North American Agrium prices     Three months ended March 31, (U.S. dollars per MMBtu)   2016   2015 Overall gas cost excluding realized derivative impact   1.61   2.52 Realized derivative impact   0.33   0.41 Overall gas cost   1.94   2.93 Average NYMEX   2.05   2.96 Average AECO   1.53   2.22 Potash Potash gross profit doubled compared to the same period last year. The reduction in realized selling price this quarter was offset by lower cost of product sold per tonne and significantly higher sales volumes given that the same period last year was impacted by the ramp-up of our Vanscoy potash mine expansion. Sales volumes increased by 271,000 tonnes compared to the same period last year and by 28,000 tonnes compared to the first quarter of 2014. 2014 is a more comparable period given the Vanscoy ramp-up was underway in the first quarter of 2015, which impacted available sales volumes. Realized selling prices have contracted sharply over the past year, with international sales prices down 22 percent and an even larger decline in North American markets. Cost of product sold per tonne was 48 percent lower than the same period last year and 12 percent lower than the first quarter of 2014. The lower costs are predominately due to the higher production volumes associated with the completion of our Vanscoy mine expansion and the weaker Canadian dollar. Phosphate Phosphate gross profit was 56 percent lower than the same period last year, due to a combination of lower benchmark selling prices, lower sales volumes and a slight increase in cost of product sold on a per-tonne basis relative to the same period last year. Sales volumes were 22 percent lower than the same period last year due to slow spring demand in Canada and the Western U.S., as dealers in these regions delayed purchasing due to higher supply in the market. Wholesale Other Wholesale Other: gross profit breakdown     Three months ended March 31, (millions of U.S. dollars)   2016   2015   Change Ammonium sulfate   10   17   (7 ) ESN   8   11   (3 ) Product purchased for resale   5   7   (2 ) Other   1   4   (3 )     24   39   (15 ) Gross profit from Wholesale Other was down 38 percent over the same quarter last year. This was predominately due to lower realized sales prices for ammonium sulfate and ESN, in line with other nitrogen products, and lower sales volumes partly related to the scale back in our product purchased for resale operations. Expenses Wholesale expenses decreased by $6-million (15 percent) after adjusting for a $38-million gain on the sale of non-core purchase for resale terminals that was included in the results from the same period last year. Other EBITDA for our Other non-operating business unit for the first quarter of 2016 had a net expense of $18-million, compared to a net expense of $88-million for the first quarter of 2015. The variance was primarily due to the following: $41-million lower share-based payments expense due to a decrease in our share price in the first quarter of 2016 $20-million lower gross profit elimination expense primarily due to lower margin per tonne on inter-segment inventory held at the end of the first quarter of 2016 $6-million (19 percent) lower general and administrative expenses due to ongoing benefits from our Operational Excellence program and the lower Canadian dollar FINANCIAL CONDITION The following are changes to working capital on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for the three months ended March 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015.

As of March 31, 2016, we have sufficient current assets to meet our current liabilities. Summary of Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Below is a summary of our cash provided by or used in operating, investing, and financing activities as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:     Three months ended March 31,   (millions of U.S. dollars)   2016     2015     Change   Cash provided by operating activities   343     705     (362 ) Cash used in investing activities   (277 )   (461 )   184   Cash used in financing activities   (325 )   (295 )   (30 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents   20     (17 )   37   Decrease in cash and cash equivalents   (239 )   (68 )   (171 ) Cash provided by operating activities - drivers behind the $362-million decrease Use of cash * $159-million decrease in cash related to taxes is due to the 2015 final tax payments being higher than the 2014 final tax payments. * $47-million decrease in cash due to higher interest payments made in the first quarter of 2016 resulting from the timing of interest paid on debt issued during 2014 and 2015. Cash used in investing activities - drivers behind the $184-million decrease in use Use of cash * Lower capital expenditures than the first quarter of 2015 due to the ramp-up of our Vanscoy potash facility coupled with decreased spending for the Borger project. Cash used in financing activities - drivers behind the $30-million increase in use Use of cash * In 2015, we generated $1-billion of cash through long-term debt issuance and paid back $1.2-billion in short-term debt. In 2016, we paid $240-million in short-term debt. There was no debt issuance in 2016. Capital Spending and Expenditures (a)             Three months ended     March 31, (millions of U.S. dollars)   2016   2015 Retail           Sustaining   47   54   Investing   9   9     56   63   Acquisitions(b)   94   60     150   123 Wholesale           Sustaining   49   40   Investing   68   295     117   335 Other           Sustaining   1   1 Total           Sustaining   97   95   Investing   77   304     174   399   Acquisitions(b)   94   60     268   459 Our investing capital expenditures decreased in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the same period last year due to the ramp-up of our Vanscoy potash facility in the first quarter of 2015 combined with decreased spending for the Borger project. We expect Agrium's capital expenditures for the remaining three quarters of 2016 to approximate $600-million to $700-million. We anticipate that we will be able to finance the announced projects through a combination of cash provided from operating activities and existing credit facilities. Short-term Debt Our short-term debt of $629-million at March 31, 2016 is outlined in note 6 of our Summarized Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our short-term debt decreased by $206-million during the three months ended March 31, 2016, which in turn contributed to an increase in our unutilized short-term financing capacity to $2.2-billion at March 31, 2016. Capital Management Our revolving credit facilities require that we maintain specific interest coverage and debt-to-capital ratios, as well as other non-financial covenants as defined in our credit agreements. We were in compliance with all covenants at March 31, 2016. Our ability to comply with these covenants has not changed since December 31, 2015. SHARE REPURCHASES We are allowed to purchase for cancellation, on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) or New York Stock Exchange an aggregate of 6,908,450 common shares (5 percent) of our outstanding shares. Repurchases may be made under a Normal Course Issuer Bid (NCIB) approved by the TSX until February 18, 2017. The actual number of shares purchased will be at Agrium's discretion and will depend on market conditions, share prices, Agrium's cash position and other factors.

Consequently, year-over-year comparisons are more appropriate than quarter-over-quarter comparisons. Crop input sales are primarily concentrated in the spring and fall crop input application seasons. Crop nutrient inventories are normally accumulated leading up to each application season. Our cash collections from accounts receivables generally occur after the application season is complete, and our customer prepayments are concentrated in December and January. NON-IFRS FINANCIAL MEASURES Financial measures that are not specified, defined or determined under IFRS are non-IFRS measures unless they are presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Accordingly, we have not identified any non-IFRS financial measures. We presented EBITDA in our 2015 annual consolidated financial statements and accordingly, it is not a non-IFRS measure. Effective January 1, 2016, management no longer considers \"Adjusted EBITDA\" in evaluating our business performance and expects to focus more on our other key earnings measures. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES We prepare our financial statements in accordance with IFRS, which requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates in applying accounting policies. For further information on the Company's critical accounting estimates, refer to the section \"Critical Accounting Estimates\" in our 2015 annual MD&A, which is contained in our 2015 Annual Report. Since the date of our 2015 annual MD&A, there have not been any material changes to our critical accounting estimates. CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES The accounting policies applied in our Consolidated Financial Statements for the three months ended March 31, 2016 are the same as those applied in our audited annual financial statements in our 2015 Annual Report.

OTHER Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (TSE: AEM) Agnico Eagle's mission is to run a high quality, easy to understand business, that generates superior long-term per share returns for our shareholders, creates a great place to work for our employees, and that is a leading contributor to the well-being of the communities in which we operate. Agnico Eagle Reports Second Quarter 2016 Operating and Financial Results; Operations Continue to Deliver Strong Performance; Positive Guidance Revision; Further Reduction in Net Debt; And Dividend Increased by 25% July 27, 2016 Stock Symbol: AEM (NYSE and TSX) (All amounts expressed in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted) TORONTO, July 27, 2016 /PRNewswire/ - Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (NYSE:AEM, TSX:AEM) (\"Agnico Eagle\" or the \"Company\") today reported quarterly net income of $19.0 million, or net income of $0.09 per share for the second quarter of 2016 (on an undiluted basis). This result includes a non-cash foreign currency translation loss on deferred tax liabilities of $7.0 million ($0.03 per share), various mark-to-market and other adjustment losses of $5.8 million ($0.03 per share), non-cash foreign currency translation losses of $5.5 million ($0.02 per share), non-cash stock option expense of $3.1 million ($0.01 per share), non-recurring gains of $4.4 million ($0.02 per share), and unrealized gains on financial instruments of $1.0 million (nil per share). Excluding these items would result in adjusted net income1 of $35.0 million or $0.16 per share for the second quarter of 2016. In the second quarter of 2015, the Company reported net income of $10.1 million or net income of $0.05 per share. For the first six months of 2016, the Company reported net income of $46.8 million, or $0.21 per share. This compares with the first six months of 2015 when net income was $38.8 million, or $0.18 per share. Financial results in the 2016 period were positively affected by higher gold production and realized prices (approximately 2% and 3% higher, respectively) and higher by-product metals revenues. Second quarter 2016 cash provided by operating activities was $229.5 million ($192.7 million before changes in non-cash components of working capital). This compares to cash provided by operating activities of $188.3 million in the second quarter of 2015 ($152.8 million before changes in non-cash components of working capital). For the first six months of 2016, cash provided by operating activities was $375.2 million ($360.2 million before changes in non-cash components of working capital), as compared with the first half of 2015 when cash provided by operating activities was $331.8 million ($329.6 million before changes in non-cash components of working capital). The increase in cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital during the second quarter 2016 and first six months of 2016 was mainly due to a combination of higher gold and by-product metals production, as described above. \"The second quarter saw continued strong operating results from all of our mines coupled with record safety performance\", said Sean Boyd, Agnico Eagle's Chief Executive Officer. \"Given these strong results and a more robust gold price environment, we have significantly improved our financial position, while continuing to make important investments in several of our growth projects. In addition, we have raised our dividend signaling our confidence in our business and growth plan\", added Mr. Boyd. Second Quarter 2016 highlights include: Quarterly gold production - Payable gold production2 in the second quarter of 2016 was 408,932 ounces of gold at total cash costs3 per ounce on a by-product basis of $592 and all-in sustaining costs4 (\"AISC\") on a by-product basis of $848 per ounce 2016 production guidance increased and cost forecasts reduced - Expected gold production for 2016 is now forecast to be approximately 1.58 to 1.6 million ounces (previously 1.565 million ounces) with total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $580 to $620 (previously $590 to $630) and AISC of approximately $840 to $880 per ounce (previously $850 to $890) Investment grade balance sheet further enhanced - In the second quarter of 2016, the outstanding balance of $210 million was repaid under the Company's credit facility, and C$20 million (reflecting the Company's 50% interest) was repaid under the Canadian Malartic General Partnership's (the \"Partnership\") secured loan facility. Net debt was reduced by approximately $181 million, to $742 million, at June 30, 2016. For the seventh consecutive quarter, the Company has reduced net debt. The Company's investment grade credit was re-confirmed by Dominion Bond Rating Service Ltd. (\"DBRS\") with a stable trend Quarterly dividend increased by 25% - The Company has declared a $0.10 quarterly dividend. The previous quarterly dividend was $0.08 Final permit received at the Meliadine Gold project - In May 2016, the Company received the Type A Water License, which is the final license necessary to commence construction activities Second Quarter Financial and Production Highlights - Higher Gold Production, Lower Unit Costs In the second quarter of 2016, strong operational performance continued at the Company's mines. Payable gold production in the second quarter of 2016 was 408,932 ounces compared to 403,678 ounces in the second quarter of 2015. The higher level of production in the 2016 period was primarily due to higher grades at LaRonde, increased throughput levels and higher grades at Goldex and increased throughput levels at Canadian Malartic. A detailed description of the production and cost performance of each mine is set out below. Total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis for the second quarter of 2016 were lower at $592, as compared to $601 for the second quarter 2015. The reduction in total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis in the second quarter of 2016 was a result of higher silver production, higher gold production at most of the Company's mines and weaker local currencies in Canada and Mexico against the U.S. dollar compared to the second quarter of 2015. Payable gold production for the first half of 2016 was 820,268 ounces, compared to payable gold production of 807,888 ounces in the comparable 2015 period. For the first half of 2016, total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis were $582, as compared to $595 for the first half of 2015. The lower costs in the 2016 period are due to the same reasons set out above. AISC on a by-product basis for the second quarter of 2016 were lower at $848 as compared to $864 per ounce for the second quarter 2015. The lower AISC on a by-product basis is primarily due to higher production, lower total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis and timing of capital expenditures. For the first half of 2016, AISC on a by-product basis were $822 as compared to $835 per ounce for the 2015 period. The lower AISC on a by-product basis in the 2016 period are due to lower total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis. Cash Position Remains Strong; Net Debt Reduced for Seventh Consecutive Quarter Cash and cash equivalents and short term investments increased to $473.7 million at June 30, 2016, from the March 31, 2016 balance of $168.0 million. The outstanding balance on the Company's $1.2 billion credit facility was reduced from $210 million at March 31, 2016 to nil at June 30, 2016. This results in available credit lines of approximately $1.2 billion, not including the uncommitted $300 million accordion feature. In order to take advantage of historically low interest rates and improve term and liquidity, on June 30, 2016, the Company issued on a private placement basis an aggregate of $350 million of guaranteed senior unsecured notes due 2023, 2026 and 2028 (the \"Notes\") with a weighted average maturity of 9.43 years and weighted average yield of 4.77%. Net proceeds from the sale of the Notes were used to reduce amounts outstanding under the Company's credit facility and for general corporate purposes. During the quarter the Company's investment grade credit was re-confirmed by DBRS with a stable trend. Total capital expenditures (including sustaining capital) made by the Company in the second quarter of 2016 were $131.6 million, including $28.2 million at Meliadine, $20.7 million at Goldex, $19.3 million at Canadian Malartic (50% basis), $18.8 million at Kittila, $15.4 million at LaRonde, $12.2 million at Pinos Altos, $10.6 million at Meadowbank, $3.3 million at La India and $2.2 million at Creston Mascota. Total capital expenditures (including sustaining capital) for the first six months of 2016 were $232.1 million, including $43.4 million at Meliadine, $35.9 million at Goldex, $33.0 million at Kittila, $29.8 million at Canadian Malartic (50% basis), $29.7 million at LaRonde, $28.2 million at Pinos Altos, $22.1 million at Meadowbank, $5.0 million at La India and $3.5 million at Creston Mascota. Total sustaining capital expenditures made by the Company in the second quarter of 2016 were $78.7 million, including $18.3 million at Canadian Malartic (50% basis), $15.8 million at Kittila, $15.4 million at LaRonde, $10.6 million at Meadowbank, $9.0 million at Pinos Altos, $4.1 million at Goldex, $3.3 million at La India and $2.2 million at Creston Mascota. Total sustaining capital expenditures for the first six months of 2016 were $145.1 million, including $29.7 million at LaRonde, $28.3 million at Canadian Malartic (50% basis), $27.5 million at Kittila, $22.1 million at Meadowbank, $19.8 million at Pinos Altos, $9.1 million at Goldex, $5.0 million at La India and $3.6 million at Creston Mascota. Total capital expenditures (including sustaining capital) in 2016 remain forecast at $491 million. Revised 2016 Guidance - Production Increased, Costs Lowered, Depreciation Decreased Production for 2016 is now forecast to be approximately 1.58 to 1.6 million ounces of gold (previously 1.565 million ounces) with total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $580 to $620 (previously $590 to $630) and AISC of approximately $840 to $880 per ounce (previously $850 to $890). The Company expects depreciation and amortization expense to be in the range of $610 to $630 million. Previous guidance was $630 to $660 million. NORTHERN BUSINESS OPERATING REVIEW ABITIBI REGION, QUEBEC Agnico Eagle is currently Quebec's largest gold producer with a 100% interest in three mines (LaRonde, Goldex and Lapa) and a 50% interest in the Canadian Malartic mine. These mines are located within 50 kilometres of each other, which provides operating synergies and allows for the sharing of technical expertise. LaRonde Mine - Higher Tonnage, Grades and Better Recoveries Drive Strong Production in the Second Quarter of 2016 The 100% owned LaRonde mine in northwestern Quebec achieved commercial production in 1988. The LaRonde mill processed an average of 6,241 tonnes per day (\"tpd\") in the second quarter of 2016, compared with an average of 6,242 tpd in the corresponding period of 2015. Minesite costs per tonne5 were approximately C$106 in the second quarter of 2016, higher than the C$99 per tonne experienced in the second quarter of 2015. The increased costs in the 2016 period were primarily due to higher underground and mill maintenance costs compared to the prior-year period. In addition, costs in the 2015 period were lower than expected. For the first six months of 2016, the LaRonde mill processed an average of 6,295 tpd, compared to 6,223 tpd in the first six months of 2015. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$104, compared to C$101 per tonne in the first six months of 2015. Costs were higher in the 2016 period due to the reasons described above. LaRonde's total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis were $543 in the second quarter of 2016 on payable production of 75,159 ounces of gold. This compares with the second quarter of 2015 when total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis were $613 on payable production of 64,007 ounces of gold. Costs in the 2016 period were positively impacted by higher production driven by higher ore grades and favourable foreign exchange rates. In the first six months of 2016, LaRonde produced 150,496 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $536. This is in contrast with the first six months of 2015 when the mine produced 122,900 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $656. Costs were lower in the 2016 period due to the reasons outlined above. Studies are continuing to assess the potential to extend the mineral reserve base and carry out mining activities between the 311 and 371 levels at LaRonde. At present, the mineral reserve base extends to the 311 level, which is 3.1 kilometres below the surface. An infill drill program is continuing from the 311 to the 371 levels with a focus on the western portion of the deposit. Infill drilling will also be carried out on the eastern portion of the deposit as underground development extends into that area. In the second quarter of 2016, site preparation activities continued at Bousquet Zone 5 on the Company's adjoining Bousquet property. Previous property owners had partly exploited Bousquet Zone 5 using open pit and underground operations. The Company is evaluating the potential to mine Bousquet Zone 5 using underground ramp access. The mining method is likely to be similar to that employed at Goldex and processing could utilize excess capacity from the Lapa circuit at LaRonde. During the quarter, dewatering of the old pit was completed along with rehabilitation of the ramp portal and 92 metres of underground development was completed. A certificate of authorization was issued by the Quebec government to permit collection of a bulk sample. An internal technical study is expected to be completed by the end of 2016. Following the completion of technical studies and permitting, Bousquet Zone 5 could potentially be in production in the second half of 2018. Canadian Malartic Mine - Record Processing Rate Achieved in Second Quarter of 2016 In June 2014, Agnico Eagle and Yamana Gold Inc. (\"Yamana\") acquired all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Osisko Mining Corporation (\"Osisko\") and created the Partnership that owns and operates the Canadian Malartic mine in northwestern Quebec through a joint management committee. Each of Agnico Eagle and Yamana has an indirect 50% ownership interest in the Partnership. During the second quarter of 2016, the Canadian Malartic mill (on a 100% basis) processed an average of 55,481 tpd, compared with an average of 50,705 tpd in the corresponding period of 2015. The record daily throughput in the 2016 period was primarily due to higher crusher availability, better crushing performance from the secondary crusher and better plant availability. Minesite costs per tonne in the second quarter of 2016 were approximately C$24 (C$20.50 excluding royalties) compared to the C$23 (C$19.71 excluding royalties) per tonne experienced in the second quarter of 2015. In the 2016 period costs were slightly higher primarily due to increased contractor use at both the mine and the mill and additional stripping costs which were not capitalized. The average stripping ratio in the second quarter of 2016 was 2.17 to 1.0 as compared to 2.64 to 1.0 in the prior period. For the first six months of 2016, the Canadian Malartic mill processed an average of 53,897 tpd, compared with an average of 51,343 tpd in the corresponding period of 2015. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$24 (C$20.87 excluding royalties) compared to the C$23 (C$19.94 excluding royalties) per tonne in the first six months of 2016. Costs were higher due to the reasons outlined above. For the second quarter of 2016, Agnico Eagle's 50% share of production at the Canadian Malartic mine was 72,502 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $621. This compares with the second quarter of 2015 when total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis were $609 on production of 68,441 ounces of gold. Costs in the 2016 period were higher due to a lower amount of stripping costs being capitalized compared to the 2015 period. In the first six months of 2016, Agnico Eagle's 50% share of production at the Canadian Malartic mine was 146,115 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $589. This compares with the first six months of 2015 when the mine produced 136,334 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $621. Costs were lower in first six months of 2016 due to stronger cash cost performance in the first quarter 2016. Permitting activities for the Canadian Malartic pit extension and deviation of Highway 117 are continuing. As part of the Quebec environmental impact evaluation process, public hearings on the Canadian Malartic pit extension project took place on June 14 to 16 and July 12 and 13, 2016 in Malartic, Quebec. The Quebec Bureau des Audiences Publiques sur l'Environnement (BAPE) will now be reviewing the studies and documents submitted by the Partnership, information that was presented at the hearings and the written submissions received from intervenors. The BAPE is expected to issue its conclusions and recommendations on the acceptability of the project to the Quebec Minister of the Environment, Sustainable Development and Climate Change in October 2016. A decision from the Minister will then follow within the next several months. The Odyssey prospect lies on the east side of the Canadian Malartic property, approximately 1.5 kilometres east of the current limit of the Canadian Malartic open pit. In the second quarter of 2016, drilling was ongoing at Odyssey and a total of 57 holes (53,417 metres) were completed through June 30, 2016 by the Partnership. The Odyssey prospect is composed of multiple mineralized bodies spatially associated with a porphyritic intrusion close to the contact of the Pontiac Group sediments and the Piche Group of volcanic rocks. They are grouped into two elongated zones -- the Odyssey North and Odyssey South zones -- that strike east-southeast and dip steeply south. Odyssey North has been traced from a depth of 600 to 1,300 metres below surface along a strike length of approximately 1.5 kilometres. Odyssey South currently has a strike length of 0.5 kilometres, and has been located between approximately 200 and 550 metres below surface. Recent drilling has yielded significant intercepts such as 2.63 grams per tonne (\"g/t\") gold (capped) over 33.5 metres estimated true width at 1,171 metres depth in drill hole ODY16-5039, showing similarities to the Goldex mine deposit. Additional details on the 2016 Odyssey drill program are reported in the Company's exploration news release of July 27, 2016. Lapa - Potential for Increased Production through Year End 2016 The 100% owned Lapa mine in northwestern Quebec achieved commercial production in May 2009. The Lapa circuit, located at the LaRonde mill, processed an average of 1,771 tpd in the second quarter of 2016. This compares with an average of 1,387 tpd in the second quarter of 2015. Throughput in the 2015 period was lower because of downtime related to the discovery of fatigue cracks in the feed head of the Lapa ball mill. Minesite costs per tonne were C$116 in the second quarter of 2016, compared to C$126 in the second quarter of 2015. Costs in the 2016 period were lower due to higher throughput compared to the same period in 2015. For the first six months of 2016, the Lapa mill processed an average of 1,767 tpd, compared to 1,538 tpd in the first six months of 2015. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$118, below the C$122 per tonne in the first six months of 2015 due to reasons explained above. Payable production in the second quarter of 2016 was 21,914 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $658. This compares with the second quarter of 2015, when payable production was 19,450 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $678. In the 2016 period, production was higher and costs were lower due to higher throughput levels and favourable foreign exchange rates. In the first six months of 2016, Lapa produced 43,623 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $663. This compares to the first six months of 2015 when the mine produced 45,370 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $615. The six month period in 2015 was positively affected by higher production and lower cash costs in the first quarter of 2015. At Lapa, 2016 is the last full year of production based on the current life of mine plan. Production was expected to show a gradual decline moving into the fourth quarter of this year with the full year expected to total 60,000 ounces of gold, as per February 2016 guidance. The Company is now evaluating a number of opportunities that could see production potentially extend through year end and exceed previous guidance. Goldex - Strong Underground Performance and Higher Grades Drive Increased Production and Lower Costs The 100% owned Goldex mine in northwestern Quebec began operation in 2008 but mining operations in the original orebody, the Goldex Extension Zone (\"GEZ\") were suspended in October 2011 (see October 19, 2011 news release). In July 2012, the M and E satellite zones were approved for development. Mining operations resumed on the M and E satellite zones in September 2013. Mining operations at GEZ remain suspended. The Goldex mill processed an average of 7,233 tpd in the second quarter of 2016. This compares with an average of 6,640 tpd in the second quarter of 2015. The higher throughput in the 2016 period was due to better underground hoisting performance and acceleration of the mining sequence compared to the 2015 period. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$32 in the second quarter of 2016, which was lower than the C$34 per tonne experienced in the second quarter of 2015. Costs in the 2016 period were lower primarily due to higher mill throughput levels and a higher proportion of rockfill to paste backfill during the period. For the first six months of 2016, the Goldex mill processed an average of 7,112 tpd, compared to 6,468 tpd in the first six months of 2015. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$33, slightly lower than the C$34 per tonne in the first six months of 2015. The lower costs in the 2016 period are due to the reasons set out above. Payable gold production in the second quarter of 2016 was 31,452 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $513. This compares with the second quarter of 2015, when payable production was 26,462 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $633. The decrease in total cash costs in the 2016 period was largely a result of increased production due to higher throughput, higher gold grades and favourable foreign exchange rates compared to the 2015 period. In the first six months of 2016, Goldex produced 63,792 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $509. This compares to the first six months of 2015 when the mine produced 55,712 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $585. The higher production and lower costs in the 2016 period are due to the same reasons as outlined above. Development of the Deep 1 Zone remains on time and on budget for startup in the first quarter of 2018. In the second quarter of 2016, the excavation of the second leg of the Rail-Veyor (conveyor system) ramp was completed and the initial components of the Rail-Veyor are now being installed. In January 2014, Agnico Eagle acquired the Akasaba West gold-copper deposit from Alexandria Minerals Corporation. Located less than 30 kilometres from Goldex, the Akasaba West deposit could potentially create flexibility and synergies for the Company's operations in the Abitibi region by using extra milling capacity at both Goldex and LaRonde, while reducing overall costs. The Akasaba West deposit currently hosts a mineral reserve of approximately 141,000 ounces of gold (4.8 million tonnes of ore grading 0.92 g/t gold and 0.52% copper). Permitting of the Akasaba project is progressing at both the provincial and federal levels. At the provincial level, following submission of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) in August 2015, the Company responded to two series of questions from the Quebec government agencies and ministries. Public consultation will also be scheduled. At the federal level, following submission of the EIA in September 2015, the Company received two sets of questions from federal agencies and ministries. Responses to the most recent set of questions will be submitted in August 2016. The federal environmental assessment agency will then proceed with a series of consultations with the public and the First Nations and is expected to potentially present its recommendations on the acceptability of the project to the Federal Minister of the Environment in the first half of 2017. In June 2016 the company purchased a property package of mining claims (approximately 840 hectares) adjacent to the Goldex mine from Wesdome Gold Mines Ltd for C$7.0 million. The acquisition was for exploration purposes. These claims, which are collectively referred to as Joubi, consist of three properties including the Joubi and Dubuisson Ouest properties and a portion of the Mine Ecole property. These properties cover the lateral and downdip extensions of the Goldex orebody. There are no mineral resources outlined on those properties. The transaction includes surface rights, infrastructure and certain equipment from the historical Joubi Mine. As part of the transaction, Agnico Eagle has granted to Wesdome a 2% net smelter royalty on the Mine Ecole property and a 3% net smelter royalty on the Joubi property. FINLAND AND SWEDEN Agnico Eagle's Kittila mine in Finland is the largest primary gold producer in Europe, and hosts the Company's largest mineral reserve base. Exploration activities continue to expand the mineral resource base and studies are underway to evaluate the potential to cost-effectively increase production. Kittila - Strong Mine and Mill Performance Continues; Optimization Studies Ongoing The 100% owned Kittila mine in northern Finland achieved commercial production in 2009. The Kittila mill processed an average of 4,274 tpd in the second quarter of 2016 compared to 4,170 tpd in the second quarter of 2015. The higher throughput in the 2016 period is a result of increased development leading to improved ore access and strong mining productivity. Minesite costs per tonne at Kittila were approximately EUR81 in the second quarter of 2016, compared to EUR75 in the second quarter of 2015. Costs increased in the second quarter of 2016 due to higher than expected maintenance costs associated with the scheduled mill shutdown and increased contractor costs compared with the 2015 period. These costs more than offset the benefit of the increased throughput. For the first six months of 2016, the Kittila mill processed an average of 4,512 tpd, compared to 4,004 tpd in the first six months of 2015. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately EUR76 in the first six months of 2016, the same as in the comparable 2015 period as higher throughput was offset by higher operating costs, as described above. Second quarter 2016 payable gold production at Kittila was 46,209 ounces with total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $756. In the second quarter of 2015, the mine produced 41,986 ounces at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $776. The higher production in the 2016 period is a result of higher throughput levels, gold grades and recoveries. Total cash costs per ounce decreased in the second quarter of 2016 primarily due to increased production. In the first six months of 2016, Kittila produced 94,336 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $741. This compares with the first six months of 2015, when the mine produced 86,640 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $727. Production was higher in the 2016 period primarily due to increased throughput. Costs were higher in the 2016 period primarily due to higher contractor costs compared to the 2015 period. The Kittila mine and mill have shown the ability to operate in excess of 4,000 tpd and efforts are ongoing to assess the optimal throughput rate. Studies are also underway to optimize underground mining rates and fully integrate the upper and lower Rimpi zones and the newly discovered Sisar Zone in a new Kittila mine plan. Unit costs are expected to improve once steady state operations are achieved. Drilling is ongoing to infill and extend the mineralization in the Sisar Zone. In addition, underground ramp construction began in March to access the upper portion of the Sisar Zone, which is located approximately 150 to 200 metres from existing underground infrastructure. During the second quarter of 2016, assay results were received from a number of drill holes. Significant results include: drill hole ROD16-700D that intersected 7.4 g/t gold (uncapped) over 9.6 metres estimated true width at 1,161 metres depth, and hole ROD16-700B that intersected 6.4 g/t gold (uncapped) over 6.5 metres estimated true width at 1,261 metres depth. Additional details on these holes are set out in the Company's exploration news release of July 27, 2016. Barsele Project - Drilling Extends the Skirasen Zone In June 2015, Agnico Eagle acquired a 55% interest in the Barsele project in Vasterbotten County, northern Sweden, from Orex Minerals (Orex Minerals subsequently transferred its interest in the project to Barsele Minerals Corp.). The Company can earn an additional 15% interest in the project through the completion of a pre-feasibility study. Recent drilling at the Skirasen Zone has extended the mineralization at depth and to the southeast. Highlights include hole SKI16-006 grading 1.31 g/t gold (capped) over an estimated true width of 69.8 metres at 445 metres depth. This drill intercept is located roughly 850 metres southeast of the core of the Central Zone indicating that the current known mineralization could be part of a larger mineralized system. Additional details on these holes are set out in the Company's exploration news release of July 27, 2016. NUNAVUT REGION Agnico Eagle has identified Nunavut as a politically attractive and stable jurisdiction with enormous geological potential. With the Company's largest producing mine (Meadowbank), two significant development assets (Meliadine and Amaruq) and other exploration projects, Nunavut has the potential to be a strategic operating platform with the ability to generate strong production and cash flows over several decades. Meadowbank - Good Cost Performance Despite Lower Production Volumes in the Second Quarter of 2016 The 100% owned Meadowbank mine in Nunavut, northern Canada, achieved commercial production in March 2010. The Meadowbank mill processed an average of 10,918 tpd in the second quarter of 2016, compared to the 11,199 tpd achieved in the second quarter of 2015. Year-over-year, mill throughput levels were lower primarily due to harder ore being processed from the Vault pit. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$73 in the second quarter of 2016. These costs were lower than the C$74 per tonne in the second quarter of 2015. The lower costs per tonne in the 2016 period were primarily due to lower production costs (for drilling, blasting and fuel consumption) and an increase in deferred stripping compared to the 2015 period. For the first six months of 2016, the Meadowbank mill processed an average of 10,654 tpd, compared to 11,103 tpd in the first six months of 2015. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$75 in the first six months of 2016, which were higher than the C$73 per tonne in the comparable 2015 period. The higher costs per tonne were primarily due to lower throughput compared to the respective 2015 period. Payable production in the second quarter of 2016 was 72,402 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $789. This compares with the second quarter of 2015 when 91,276 ounces were produced at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $688. The lower production and higher costs in the 2016 period compared to the 2015 period are primarily due to processing less tonnage at lower grades (down 18%) and lower recoveries. In the first six months of 2016, Meadowbank produced 144,713 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $789. In the first six months of 2015 the mine produced 179,799 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $672. The lower production and higher costs in the 2016 period compared to the previous period are due to the reasons outlined above. Studies are ongoing to investigate additional opportunities to extend production at Meadowbank through year-end 2018. Potential opportunities include the development of the Phaser pit, which is located to the southwest of the Vault pit, and an additional pushback to access additional ore in the E3 pit at the Portage deposit. Amaruq Project - Exploration and Permitting Activities Progressing as Planned Agnico Eagle has a 100% interest in the Amaruq project in Nunavut, northern Canada. The large property consists of 116,717 hectares of Inuit-owned and federal Crown land, located approximately 50 kilometres northwest of the Meadowbank mine. The Company is actively exploring the Amaruq deposit with the goal of potentially developing the deposit as a satellite operation to Meadowbank. During the quarter, exploration drilling continued at Amaruq. The goals of the 2016 exploration program were to infill and expand the known mineral resource areas and to test other favourable targets with a focus on identifying a second source of open pit ore. Drilling began at the end of January and continued through May based mainly on lake ice; the drilling since June has been land-based supported by helicopters. Exploration and conversion drilling to the end of June has totalled 77,517 metres (338 holes), using up to nine rigs, completing the initial 75,000-metre drill program. Almost half of this drilling was in the IVR deposit (36,545 metres, 152 holes), with 30% at Whale Tail (24,820 metres, 103 holes) and the rest at Mammoth (16,153 metres, 83 holes). In addition, there was 2,186 metres (nine holes) related to engineering studies (rock mechanics / geotechnical drilling and metallurgical testing) in this period. Exploration drilling has encountered a new vein structure in the V Zones, with results up to 15.5 g/t gold (capped) over 9.4 metres estimated true width at 18 metres depth in drill hole AMQ16-706. The V Zones have been shown to include multiple parallel structures. A recent lower intercept was 15.5 g/t gold (capped) over 5.4 metres estimated true width at 349 metres depth in drill hole AMQ16-833. The V Zones are being evaluated as a potential second source of open pit ore for Amaruq. Additional details from the 2016 Amaruq program are set out in the Company's exploration news release of July 27, 2016. Construction of the Amaruq Exploration Access Road commenced in the first quarter of 2016. At the end of the second quarter of 2016, approximately 13.3 km of road had been completed. Construction is expected to resume this August with a focus on bridge installation. Completion of the 62 kilometre long road is expected by the end of 2017. An application for an amendment to the Amaruq Exploration Type B Water License was submitted on March 31, 2016 to allow for the development of an exploration ramp and the potential collection of a bulk sample. The permit approval process for the exploration ramp is expected to take approximately nine months. In order to mine the Whale Tail deposit, a Project Certificate for this satellite pit must be obtained from the Nunavut Impact Review Board (the \"NIRB\") along with an amendment of the existing Meadowbank Type A water license. A positive land use conformity determination was received from the Nunavut Planning Commission on June 17, 2016 for the Amaruq Whale Tail pit project confirming that the planned activity meets conformity with the existing land use plan. On June 30, 2016 the Company submitted an application and environmental impact statement for the Whale Tail satellite pit with both the NIRB and Nunavut Water Board. This application is currently undergoing screening by the NIRB which initiates the permitting process, a process that is expected to take place over a period of approximately two years. Meliadine Project - Final Permit Received May 2016; Optimization Studies Continuing The Meliadine gold project was acquired in July 2010 and is the Company's largest development project based on mineral reserves and mineral resources. The Company has a 100% interest in the 111,757 hectare property, which is linked to the town of Rankin Inlet in Nunavut by a 25 kilometre all-weather access road. In March 2015, the Company completed an updated technical report on the Meliadine gold project. The updated technical report was based on extracting only the 3.3 million ounces of gold in proven and probable mineral reserves (13.9 million tonnes of ore at 7.44 g/t gold), which is all contained in the Tiriganiaq and Wesmeg deposits. The Meliadine property also hosts 3.3 million ounces of measured and indicated mineral resources (20.2 million tonnes at 5.06 g/t gold), and 3.5 million ounces of inferred mineral resources (14.1 million tonnes at 7.65 g/t gold). In addition, there are many other known gold occurrences in the 80 km long greenstone belt that require further evaluation. Internal studies are continuing to evaluate the potential to extract additional gold from the Tiriganiaq and Wesmeg/Normeg deposits, which could extend the potential mine life, increase annual production and improve project economics and the after-tax internal rate of return. These studies are expected to be completed by the end of 2016. In the second quarter of 2016, approximately 1,098 metres of underground development were completed. A total of approximately 4,302 metres of underground development is planned in 2016. On May 19, 2016, the Company received the Type A Water Licence, which is the final permit needed to commence construction activities. The timing of future capital expenditures at the Meliadine project beyond 2016 and the determination of whether to build a mine at Meliadine are subject to approval by Agnico Eagle's Board of Directors, which will be based on, among other things, prevailing market conditions and outcomes of the various plans being evaluated. SOUTHERN BUSINESS OPERATING REVIEW Agnico Eagle's Southern Business operations are focused in Mexico. These operations have been the source of growing precious metals production (gold and silver), stable operating costs and strong free cash flow since 2009. In the second quarter of 2016, the Mexican operations had new record quarterly silver production of approximately 788,000 ounces. Pinos Altos - Shaft Commissioning Continues, Ramp Up to Design Capacity Expected in Q3 2016 The 100% owned Pinos Altos mine in northern Mexico achieved commercial production in November 2009. The Pinos Altos mill processed 5,660 tpd in the second quarter of 2016, compared to 5,854 tpd in the second quarter of 2015. During the second quarter of 2016, approximately 90,000 tonnes of ore were stacked on the leach pad at Pinos Altos, compared to 114,800 tonnes in the comparable 2015 period. Minesite costs per tonne at Pinos Altos were $47 in the second quarter of 2016, which were higher than the $43 in the second quarter of 2015. The difference in minesite costs per tonne was largely attributable to variations in the proportion of heap leach ore to milled ore and open pit ore to underground ore, currency variations and routine fluctuations in the waste to ore stripping ratio in the open pit mines. For the first six months of 2016, the Pinos Altos mill processed an average of 5,297 tpd, compared to 5,758 tpd in the first six months of 2015. Approximately 143,200 tonnes of ore were stacked on the Pinos Altos leach pad during the first six months of 2016, compared to 189,200 tonnes in the prior year period. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately $48 compared to $45 per tonne in the first six months of 2015, with variance due to the proportion of heap leach to milled ore and the proportion of underground ore to open pit, variations in the proportion of waste to ore mined and variations in the currency exchange rate. Payable production in the second quarter of 2016 was 49,458 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $348. This compares with payable production of 50,647 ounces at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $384 in the second quarter of 2015. Lower production in 2016 is largely due to lower throughput compared to the prior year period. The decrease in the year over year total cash costs per ounce is largely due to higher silver production and favourable foreign exchange rates compared to the prior year period. In the first six months of 2016, Pinos Altos produced 97,575 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $346. This compares with the first six months of 2015 when the mine produced 100,753 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $371. The decrease in cash costs for the first six months of 2016 is due to the reasons outlined above. The Pinos Altos shaft project was completed and commissioned for hoisting in mid-June. Adjustments to ore-waste hoisting parameters and settings progressed through the second half of June. Ramp up to the design capacity will continue in July. The shaft completion will allow better matching of the mill capacity with the future mining capacity at Pinos Altos once the open pit mining operation begins to wind down as planned over the next several years. The Company continues to evaluate a number of regional opportunities. During the quarter, exploration drilling commenced at the Madrono prospect. Additional details from the Madrono drilling program are set out in the Company's news release of July 27, 2016. Creston Mascota Deposit at Pinos Altos - Initial Madrono drilling Yields Positive Results The Creston Mascota deposit at Pinos Altos has been operating as a satellite operation to the Pinos Altos mine since late 2010. Approximately 573,000 tonnes of ore were stacked on the Creston Mascota leach pad during the second quarter of 2016, compared to approximately 608,500 tonnes stacked in the second quarter of 2015. In the 2016 period lower grades were stacked compared to the 2015 period. Minesite costs per tonne at Creston Mascota were $12 in the second quarter of 2016, compared to $11 in the second quarter of 2015. Costs in the 2016 period were slightly higher due to an increased stripping ratio and wet weather conditions related to the rainy season compared to the 2015 period. For the first six months of 2016, approximately 1,089,200 tonnes of ore were stacked on the Creston Mascota leach pad, compared to 1,135,500 tonnes in the prior year period. For the first six months of 2016, mine site costs per tonne at Creston Mascota were $12, compared to $11 per tonne in the first six months of 2015. Costs were higher in the 2016 period due to the reasons outlined above. Payable gold production at Creston Mascota in the second quarter of 2016 was 12,398 ounces at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $469. This compares to 15,606 ounces at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $402 during the second quarter of 2015. Production in the 2016 period was lower due to fewer tonnes stacked and lower grades compared to the 2015 period. Cash costs were higher in the 2016 period primarily due to higher minesite costs per tonne, and lower production partially offset by a favourable foreign exchange rate compared to the 2015 period. Payable gold production for the first six months of 2016 was 23,949 ounces at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $465. This compares to 28,054 ounces at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $421 in the first six months of 2015. The lower production and higher costs in the 2016 period are due to the reasons outlined above. Infill drilling continues at Creston Mascota with several high grade intercepts encountered during the period suggesting potential for modest extension of the current mine life. During the first quarter of 2016, an agreement was signed that allows access to the 51-hectare Madrono property for exploration and mining. The Madrono property is located in an area with good access and infrastructure between the Company's Pinos Altos and Creston Mascota operations and includes at least three gold-silver veins: Madrono, Santa Martha and La Curva. Previous mining in this area included small-scale bonanza production from underground mine development on three levels in the 1930s. In the second quarter of 2016, 12 drill holes totaling 2,978 metres were completed on preliminary target areas. Three of the first six holes drilled at Madrono encountered gold and silver mineralization with encouraging grades and widths. Highlights include: 4.1 g/t gold and 64.5 g/t silver (both grades uncapped) over 6.2 metres estimated true width at 45 metres depth in hole MAD16-005. Additional details are presented in the Company's exploration news release of July 27, 2016. Permits were obtained in June 2016 to allow for the construction of an additional 75 exploration drill pads on the Madrono property. Further drilling is planned for Madrono through the balance of 2016. La India - Increased Gold and Silver Production Drive Lower costs The La India mine in Sonora, Mexico, located approximately 70 kilometres from the Company's Pinos Altos mine, was acquired in November 2011 through the purchase of Grayd Resources, which held a 56,000 hectare land position in the Mulatos Gold belt. Commissioning of the mine commenced ahead of schedule in the third quarter of 2013 and commercial production was declared as of February 1, 2014. Approximately 1,534,500 tonnes of ore were stacked on the La India leach pad during the second quarter of 2016, compared to approximately 1,359,500 tonnes stacked in the second quarter of 2015. Minesite costs per tonne at La India were $8 in the second quarter of 2016, compared to the $9 in the second quarter of 2015. The higher tonnage stacked in the 2016 period is a reflection of additional low-grade ore being encountered in areas previously thought to contain waste. The lower minesite costs reflect normal variations in the waste/ore stripping ratio. In the first six months of 2016, approximately 2,930,800 tonnes of ore were stacked on the La India leach pad, compared to approximately 2,738,000 stacked in the first six months of 2015. Minesite costs per tonne at La India were $8 in the first six months of 2016, compared to the $9 in the first six months of 2015. The increased tonnage stacked and lower costs in the 2016 period are due to the reasons outlined above. Payable gold production at La India in the second quarter of 2016 was 27,438 ounces at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $381. Payable production in the second quarter of 2015 was 25,803 ounces at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $410. Production was higher in the 2016 period due to higher tonnage stacked and faster percolation rates from the new lifts on the phase 2 heap leach pad. Total cash costs in the 2016 period were positively impacted by slightly lower minesite costs per tonne, higher gold and silver production and favourable foreign exchange rates. For the first six months of 2016, La India produced 55,669 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $371. This compares to 52,326 ounces at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $414 in the first six months of 2015. The increased production and lower costs are due to the reasons outlined above. Construction of the haul road to the Main Zone was completed during the second quarter of 2016. Mining activities on the Main Zone began in May 2016. During the quarter, several areas on the La India property were drill tested including the infill drilling at the Main Zone and exploration drilling at India East and El Cochi. Encouraging results were obtained from the Main Zone, which could have a positive impact on the year end mineral reserves and mineral resources at La India. At El Cochi, drilling on an outcropping area identified shallow oxidized mineralization and drilling will continue once the change of land use permit is obtained, which is expected in the second half of 2016. In late June 2016, the environmental permit for exploration at the El Realito area was obtained (permission for 40 drill pads), and drilling will be carried out later this year. On July 19, 2016, La India experienced an armed robbery. Employees at La India are safe and normal operations resumed later that same day. The Company is cooperating with federal, state and local authorities who are actively investigating the incident. The Company understands that all losses and damages will be covered by insurance. El Barqueno - Drilling Expands Known Deposits and Outlines New Mineralized Zones Agnico Eagle acquired its 100% interest in the El Barqueno project in November 2014 with the acquisition of Cayden Resources Inc. The 32,840-hectare property is in the Guachinango gold-silver mining district of Jalisco State in west-central, Mexico, approximately 150 kilometres west of the state capital of Guadalajara. The El Barqueno project contains a number of known mineralized zones and several prospects. As of December 31, 2015, the El Barqueno project had an inferred mineral resource of 19.7 million tonnes grading 0.96 g/t gold and 5.78 g/t silver (containing 608,000 ounces of gold and 3.7 million ounces of silver) at the Azteca-Zapoteca, Angostura and Pena de Oro zones. Year-to-date, 44,985 metres of drilling has been completed at El Barqueno in 2016. Drilling focused on expanding the known areas of mineralization (Angostura and Azteca-Zapoteca) and testing new target areas (Olmeca and Pena Blanca). Significant high-grade intercepts are reported at the new Olmeca prospect, which has been traced over 700 metres of strike length. Results from Olmeca include up to 4.5 g/t gold (capped) and 4.7 g/t silver (uncapped) over 11.0 metres estimated true width at 85 metres depth in drill hole OLM16-010, and 9.4 g/t gold (capped) and 14.1 g/t silver (uncapped) over 5.1 metres estimated true width at 67 metres depth in drill hole in OLM16-003. Additional details on the El Barqueno drilling are set out in the Company's exploration news release of July 27, 2016. In addition to the drilling activities, studies are underway to evaluate possible development scenarios for the project. It is currently envisioned that the project's gold-silver deposits could potentially be developed into a series of open pits utilizing heap leach processing, similar to the Creston Mascota deposit at Pinos Altos and the La India mines. Dividend Record and Payment Dates for the Third Quarter of 2016 Agnico Eagle's Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per common share, payable on September 15, 2016 to shareholders of record as of September 1, 2016.

Note Regarding Certain Measures of Performance This news release discloses certain measures, including \"total cash costs per ounce\", \"all-in sustaining costs per ounce\", \"minesite costs per tonne\" and \"adjusted net income\" that are not standardized measures under IFRS. These data may not be comparable to data reported by other issuers. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable financial information reported in the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS, other than adjusted net income, see \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Performance Measures\" below. The total cash costs per ounce of gold produced is reported on both a by-product basis (deducting by-product metal revenues from production costs) and co-product basis (before by-product metal revenues). The total cash costs per ounce of gold produced on a by-product basis is calculated by adjusting production costs as recorded in the consolidated statements of income for by-product revenues, unsold concentrate inventory production costs, smelting, refining and marketing charges and other adjustments, and then dividing by the number of ounces of gold produced. The total cash costs per ounce of gold produced on a co-product basis is calculated in the same manner as the total cash costs per ounce of gold produced on a by-product basis except that no adjustment is made for by-product metal revenues. Accordingly, the calculation of total cash costs per ounce of gold produced on a co-product basis does not reflect a reduction in production costs or smelting, refining and marketing charges associated with the production and sale of by-product metals. The total cash costs per ounce of gold produced is intended to provide information about the cash-generating capabilities of the Company's mining operations. Management also uses these measures to monitor the performance of the Company's mining operations. As market prices for gold are quoted on a per ounce basis, using the total cash costs per ounce of gold produced on a by-product basis measure allows management to assess a mine's cash-generating capabilities at various gold prices. All-in sustaining costs per ounce is used to show the full cost of gold production from current operations. The Company calculates all-in sustaining costs per ounce of gold produced on a by-product basis as the aggregate of total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis, sustaining capital expenditures (including capitalized exploration), general and administrative expenses (including stock options) and reclamation expenses divided by the number of ounces of gold produced. The all-in sustaining costs per ounce of gold produced on a co-product basis is calculated in the same manner as the all-in sustaining costs per ounce of gold produced on a by-product basis, except that the total cash costs per ounce on a co-product basis is used, meaning no adjustment is made for by-product metal revenues. The Company's methodology for calculating all-in sustaining costs per ounce may differ from to the methodology used by other producers that disclose all-in sustaining costs per ounce. The Company may change the methodology it uses to calculate all-in sustaining costs per ounce in the future, including in response to the adoption of formal industry guidance regarding this measure by the World Gold Council. Management is aware that these per ounce measures of performance can be affected by fluctuations in exchange rates and, in the case of total cash costs per ounce of gold produced on a by-product basis, by-product metal prices. Management compensates for these inherent limitations by using these measures in conjunction with minesite costs per tonne (discussed below) as well as other data prepared in accordance with IFRS. Management uses adjusted net income to evaluate the underlying operating performance of the Company and to assist with the planning and forecasting of future operating results. Management believes that adjusted net income is a useful measure of performance because foreign currency translation gains and losses, mark-to-market adjustments, non-recurring gains and losses, stock option expense and unrealized gains and losses on financial instruments do not reflect the underlying operating performance of the Company and may not be indicative of future operating results. Management also performs sensitivity analyses in order to quantify the effects of fluctuating exchange rates and metal prices. This news release also contains information as to estimated future total cash costs per ounce, all-in sustaining costs per ounce and minesite costs per tonne. The estimates are based upon the total cash costs per ounce, all-in sustaining costs per ounce and minesite costs per tonne that the Company expects to incur to mine gold at its mines and projects and, consistent with the reconciliation of these actual costs referred to above, do not include production costs attributable to accretion expense and other asset retirement costs, which will vary over time as each project is developed and mined. It is therefore not practicable to reconcile these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable IFRS measure. Forward-Looking Statements Notes to Investors Regarding the Use of Mineral Resources Cautionary Note to Investors Concerning Estimates of Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources This news release uses the terms \"measured mineral resources\" and \"indicated mineral resources\". Investors are advised that while those terms are recognized and required by Canadian regulations, the SEC does not recognize them. Investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of mineral deposits in these categories will ever be converted into mineral reserves. Cautionary Note to Investors Concerning Estimates of Inferred Mineral Resources This news release also uses the term \"inferred mineral resources\". Investors are advised that while this term is recognized and required by Canadian regulations, the SEC does not recognize it. \"Inferred mineral resources\" have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence, and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Under Canadian rules, estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies, except in rare cases. Investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of an inferred mineral resource exists, or is economically or legally mineable.

Each of them is a \"Qualified Person\" for the purposes of National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\"NI 43-101\"). The scientific and technical information relating to Agnico Eagle's mineral reserves and mineral resources contained herein (other than the Canadian Malartic mine) has been approved by Daniel Doucet, Eng., Senior Corporate Director, Reserve Development; and relating to mineral reserves and mineral resources at the Canadian Malartic mine contained herein has been approved by Donald Gervais, P.Geo., Director of Technical Services at Canadian Malartic Corporation (\"CMC\") a corporation 50% owned indirectly by each of Agnico and Yamana. Each of them is a \"Qualified Person\" for the purposes of NI 43-101. Cautionary Note To U.S. Investors - The SEC permits U.S. mining companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose only those mineral deposits that a company can economically and legally extract or produce. Agnico Eagle reports mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates in accordance with the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum Best Practice Guidelines for Exploration and for Estimation of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, in accordance with NI 43-101. These standards are similar to those used by the SEC's Industry Guide No. 7, as interpreted by Staff at the SEC (\"Guide 7\"). However, the definitions in NI 43-101 differ in certain respects from those under Guide 7. Accordingly, mineral reserve information contained herein may not be comparable to similar information disclosed by U.S. companies. Under the requirements of the SEC, mineralization may not be classified as a \"reserve\" unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically and legally produced or extracted at the time the reserve determination is made. A \"final\" or \"bankable\" feasibility study is required to meet the requirements to designate mineral reserves under Industry Guide 7. Agnico Eagle uses certain terms in this news release, such as \"measured\", \"indicated\", \"inferred\", and \"resources\" that the SEC guidelines strictly prohibit U.S. registered companies from including in their filings with the SEC. In prior periods, mineral reserves and mineral resources for all properties were typically estimated using historic three-year average metals prices and foreign exchange rates in accordance with the SEC guidelines. These guidelines require the use of prices that reflect current economic conditions at the time of mineral reserve determination, which the Staff of the SEC has interpreted to mean historic three-year average prices. Given the current lower commodity price environment, Agnico Eagle has decided to use price assumptions that are below the three-year averages. The assumptions used for the mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates at all mines and advanced projects as of December 31, 2015 (other than the Canadian Malartic mine), reported by the Company on February 10, 2016, were $1,100 per ounce gold, $16.00 per ounce silver, $0.90 per pound zinc, $2.50 per pound copper, and US$/C$, Euro/US$ and US$/MXP exchange rates for all mines and projects other than the Lapa, Meadowbank and Creston Mascota mines and Santo Nino open pit at Pinos Altos of 1.16, 1.20 and 14.00, respectively. Due to shorter mine life, the assumptions used for the mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates at the shorter-life mines (the Lapa, Meadowbank and Creston Mascota mines and Santo Nino open pit) as of December 31, 2015, reported by the Company on February 10, 2016, included the same metal price assumptions, and US$/C$ and US$/MXP exchange rates of 1.30 and 16.00, respectively. The assumptions used for the mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates at the Canadian Malartic mine as of December 31, 2015, reported by the Company on February 10, 2016, were $1,150 per ounce gold, a cut-off grade between 0.30 g/t and 0.33 g/t gold (depending on the deposit) and a US$/C$ exchange rate of 1.24. NI 43-101 requires mining companies to disclose mineral reserves and mineral resources using the subcategories of \"proven mineral reserves\", \"probable mineral reserves\", \"measured mineral resources\", \"indicated mineral resources\" and \"inferred mineral resources\". Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. A mineral reserve is the economically mineable part of a measured and/or indicated mineral resource. It includes diluting materials and allowances for losses, which may occur when the material is mined or extracted and is defined by studies at pre-feasibility or feasibility level as appropriate that include application of modifying factors. Such studies demonstrate that, at the time of reporting, extraction could reasonably be justified. Modifying factors are considerations used to convert mineral resources to mineral reserves. These include, but are not restricted to, mining, processing, metallurgical, infrastructure, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental factors. A proven mineral reserve is the economically mineable part of a measured mineral resource. A proven mineral reserve implies a high degree of confidence in the modifying factors. A probable mineral reserve is the economically mineable part of an indicated and, in some circumstances, a measured mineral resource. The confidence in the modifying factors applying to a probable mineral reserve is lower than that applying to a proven mineral reserve. A mineral resource is a concentration or occurrence of solid material of economic interest in or on the Earth's crust in such form, grade or quality and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade or quality, continuity and other geological characteristics of a mineral resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge, including sampling. A measured mineral resource is that part of a mineral resource for which quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics are estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the application of modifying factors to support detailed mine planning and final evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. Geological evidence is derived from detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing and is sufficient to confirm geological and grade or quality continuity between points of observation. An indicated mineral resource is that part of a mineral resource for which quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics are estimated with sufficient confidence to allow the application of modifying factors in sufficient detail to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. Geological evidence is derived from adequately detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing and is sufficient to assume geological and grade or quality continuity between points of observation. An inferred mineral resource is that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of limited geological evidence and sampling. Geological evidence is sufficient to imply but not verify geological and grade or quality continuity. Investors are cautioned not to assume that part or all of an inferred mineral resource exists, or is economically or legally mineable. A feasibility study is a comprehensive technical and economic study of the selected development option for a mineral project that includes appropriately detailed assessments of applicable modifying factors together with any other relevant operational factors and detailed financial analysis that are necessary to demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that extraction is reasonably justified (economically mineable). The results of the study may reasonably serve as the basis for a final decision by a proponent or financial institution to proceed with, or finance, the development of the project. The confidence level of the study will be higher than that of a pre-feasibility study. Barrick Gold Corporation (TSE: ABX) Our vision is the generation of wealth through responsible mining wealth for our owners, our people, and the countries and communities with which we partner. We aim to be the leading mining company focused on gold, growing our cash flow per share by developing and operating high quality assets through disciplined allocation of human and financial capital and operational excellence. Those who founded and first led the company were committed to a culture of partnership and the values underpinning such a culture: trust, transparency, shared responsibility and accountability, and a sense of emotional and financial ownership. The company is returning to its roots as a lean and nimble organization, with minimal bureaucracy. A small head office manages the company with a balance of entrepreneurialism and prudence, focusing on only a few core activities: defining and implementing strategy, allocating human and financial capital, and fulfilling the obligations required of a public company. Leaders at the operational level have greater autonomy, responsibility, and accountability, functioning as business owners. Free from bureaucracy and middle management, they are focused on maximizing free cash flow, and the head office is focused on allocating that cash flow to maximize shareholder returns. Barrick has mining operations in Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile, Dominican Republic, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Saudi Arabia, United States and Zambia. More than 75 percent of the company's gold production comes from the Americas region. Barrick Reports Second Quarter 2016 Results TORONTO, July 27, 2016 Barrick reported net earnings of $138 million ($0.12 per share), and adjusted net earnings1 of $158 million ($0.14 per share) for the second quarter. Second quarter EBITDA2 was $881 million. The company reported revenues of $2.01 billion in the second quarter, and net cash provided by operating activities (\"operating cash flow\") was $527 million. Barrick generated $274 million in free cash flow3 in the second quarter, marking five consecutive quarters of positive free cash flow. Gold production in the second quarter was 1.34 million ounces at a cost of sales applicable to gold of $1.23 billion, and all-in sustaining costs4 of $782 per ounce. Compared to the first half of 2015, cost of sales applicable to gold has declined by 14 percent to $2.43 billion. Over the same period, we have reduced our all-in sustaining costs4 by 19 percent. For the full year, we expect cost of sales applicable to gold to be in the range of $5.2-$5.5 billion. All-in sustaining cost4 guidance for 2016 has been reduced to $750-$790 per ounce, down from $760-$810 per ounce at the end of the first quarter, and below our original 2016 guidance of $775-$825 per ounce. We continue to expect gold production of 5.0-5.5 million ounces for the year. We have reduced total debt by $968 million year-to-date, and remain on track to achieve our $2 billion debt reduction target for the year. Commercial production has commenced at the Jabal Sayid copper mine in Saudi Arabia. Reflecting this milestone, we have increased our 2016 copper guidance to 380-430 million pounds, up from our original guidance of 370-410 million pounds. Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:ABX)(TSX:ABX) (Barrick or the company) today reported net earnings of $138 million ($0.12 per share) for the second quarter, and adjusted net earnings1of $158 million ($0.14 per share). Second quarter EBITDA2 was $881 million. Second quarter revenues were $2.01 billion and operating cash flow was $527 million. The company generated $274 million in free cash flow3 in the second quarter, marking five consecutive quarters of positive free cash flow. Second quarter cost of sales applicable to gold was $1.23 billion, a reduction of 13 percent compared to the prior-year period. Production in the quarter was 1.34 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs4 of $782 per ounce. We continue to expect full-year production of 5.0-5.5 million ounces of gold. We expect cost of sales applicable to gold for 2016 to be in the range of $5.2-$5.5 billion. We have reduced our all-in sustaining cost4guidance to $750-$790 per ounce, down from our most recent range of $760-$810 per ounce. Our operations continued to deliver robust performance in the second quarter, demonstrating capital discipline, improved operational efficiency and productivity, and stronger cost management as we target Best-in-Class performance. This is driving growing margins and profitability across the entire business, in support of our overriding objective to grow free cash flow per share. At the same time, we continue to strengthen our balance sheet with nearly $1 billion in debt repayments completed so far this year, or roughly half of our $2 billion debt reduction target for 2016. Lower debt levels have better positioned the company to withstand gold price volatility while setting us up to invest in future growth. Barrick has the industry's largest gold reserves and resources, with an average reserve grade significantly higher than our peer group average.5 This represents an immense source of value and optionality for the company. Our Growth Group is actively advancing a strategy to grow our free cash flow per share by allocating capital to the opportunities with the best returns. We are pursuing a multi-faceted approach that will optimize the development of our existing reserves and resources, invest in exploration to discover the next major deposit, and assess external opportunities for acquisitions, seed financing, earn-ins, and other partnerships and joint ventures. Ultimately, the investments we make will be focused on growing our free cash flow per share while maintaining strict capital discipline, such that we are continuously upgrading the long-term value of our portfolio. Our existing operations will also contribute to growth by achieving step changes in performance that will drive down our cost structure and expand margins. We will do this by leveraging innovation and new technology, which is a core pillar of our Best-in-Class philosophy. FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Second quarter net earnings were $138 million ($0.12 per share) compared to a net loss of $9 million ($0.01 per share) in the prior year period. Adjusted net earnings1 for the second quarter were $158 million ($0.14 per share), compared to $60 million ($0.05 per share) in the prior year period. Higher net earnings reflect a decrease in operating costs, particularly lower fuel and energy prices (even when factoring in fuel hedges above spot prices), favorable foreign exchange movements, reduced royalty expense, and the impact of Best-in-Class initiatives, including lower labor, contractor, and consumable costs, and other operating efficiencies. In addition, earnings benefited from lower exploration, evaluation, and project expenses. The company generated $881 million of EBITDA2 in the second quarter compared to $690 million in the prior year period. Second quarter revenues were $2.01 billion, compared to $2.23 billion in the prior year period. Operating cash flow in the second quarter was $527 million, compared to $525 million in the second quarter of 2015. Despite lower production as a result of non-core asset sales, operating cash flow remained in line with the prior year period. This was driven by higher gold prices and lower operating costs, as a result of lower energy and fuel costs, combined with lower labor, consumable, and contractor costs, and improved operating efficiencies driven by Best-in-Class initiatives. These gains were partially offset by an increase in working capital, combined with the impact of higher income taxes paid, compared to the prior year period. Free cash flow3 for the second quarter was $274 million, marking five consecutive quarters of positive free cash flow. This reflects our driving focus on maximizing free cash flow per share through capital discipline, improved operational efficiency and productivity, and stronger cost management. RESTORING A STRONG BALANCE SHEET Strengthening our balance sheet remains a top priority. In 2016, we intend to reduce our total debt by at least $2 billion by drawing on our existing cash balance, and by maximizing free cash flow from operations, as well as potential non-core asset sales. So far this year, we have reduced our total debt by $968 million, representing approximately half of our debt reduction target for the year. We will continue to pursue non-core asset sales with discipline, and will only proceed with transactions that make sense for the business, on terms we consider favorable to our shareholders. In this regard, we intend to initiate a process to explore the sale of our 50 percent stake in the KCGM operation in Western Australia. The company's liquidity position is strong and continues to improve, underpinned by free cash flow generation across the business, and modest near-term debt repayment obligations. At the end of the second quarter, Barrick had a consolidated cash balance of approximately $2.4 billion.6 The company now has less than $150 million7 in debt due before 2018, and about $5 billion of our outstanding debt of $9 billion does not mature until after 2032. Over the medium term, we aim to reduce our total debt to below $5 billion. OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS AND OUTLOOK Our over-arching objective as a business is to grow our free cash flow per share. In support of this objective, we are focused on driving industry-leading margins by improving the productivity and efficiency of our operations. This means a continuous, relentless cycle of improvement and innovation, underpinned by our Best-in-Class program. Our aspiration is to achieve all-in sustaining costs below $700 per ounce by 2019. Barrick produced 1.34 million ounces of gold in the second quarter at a cost of sales of $1.23 billion, compared to 1.45 million ounces at a cost of sales of $1.41 billion in the prior year period. All-in sustaining costs4 in the second quarter were $782 per ounce, compared to $895 per ounce in the second quarter of 2015. Excluding the impact of divested mines, production for the second quarter increased by 126,000 ounces. Compared to the first half of 2015, cost of sales applicable to gold declined by 14 percent to $2.43 billion, primarily due to fewer ounces sold as a result of divestments. Cost of sales at our remaining operations was in line with the prior-year period, with higher grades and sales volumes offset by a decrease in direct mining costs. Compared to the first half of 2015, all-in sustaining costs4 have fallen by 19 percent. These reductions reflect decreased direct mining costs, particularly lower fuel and energy prices, reduced royalty expense, and the impact of Best-in-Class initiatives, including lower labor, contractor, and consumable costs, and more predictive and precise maintenance. Lower mine site sustaining capital expenditures and a higher proportion of production from lower cost operations also contributed to lower all-in sustaining costs. Please see page 31 of Barrick's Second Quarter 2016 Management Discussion and Analysis for individual operating segment performance details. We continue to expect full-year gold production of 5.0-5.5 million ounces. For the full year, we expect cost of sales applicable to gold to be in the range of $5.2-$5.5 billion. We have reduced our all-in sustaining cost4 guidance for 2016 to $750-$790 per ounce, down from $760-$810 per ounce at the end of the first quarter, and below our original 2016 guidance of $775-$825 per ounce. All-in sustaining costs are now expected to be highest in the third quarter, reflecting a shift in the timing of certain sustaining capital expenditures to the second half of the year. Capital expenditures for 2016 are now expected to be $1.25-$1.40 billion, down from $1.35-$1.55 billion at the end of the first quarter, and below our original 2016 guidance range of $1.35-$1.65 billion. As we continue to embed Best-in-Class across the portfolio, we expect to identify additional savings opportunities over the course of the year.

Cortez is now expected to produce 980,000-1,050,000 ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs4 of $520-$550 per ounce, compared to our previous guidance range of 900,000-1,000,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $580-$640 per ounce. At Turquoise Ridge, our share of production is now anticipated to be in the range of 240,000-260,000 ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of $640-$700 per ounce, compared to our previous guidance range of 200,000-220,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $770-$850 per ounce. Reflecting the impact of severe winter weather conditions in the first half of 2016, we now expect full year gold production at Veladero to be in the range of 580,000-640,000 ounces, down from our previous guidance of 630,000-690,000 ounces. All-in sustaining cost4 guidance remains unchanged at $790-$860 per ounce. Copper Copper production in the second quarter was 103 million pounds at a cost of sales of $79 million, and all-in sustaining costs9of $2.14 per pound. The Jabal Sayid project, a 50-50 joint venture with Saudi Arabian Mining Company (Ma'aden), commenced commercial production on July 1. Barrick's share of 2016 copper production from Jabal Sayid is expected to be 10-20 million pounds at all-in sustaining costs of $2.80-$3.10 per pound. The mine is expected to ramp up to a production rate of about 100 million pounds per year in the second half of 2017, as additional underground development is completed. Reflecting the start of commercial production at Jabal Sayid, we have increased our copper production guidance for 2016 to 380-430 million pounds, up from our original guidance of 370-410 million pounds. For the full year, we expect cost of sales applicable to copper to be in the range of $275-$320 million. Copper all-in sustaining cost9 guidance remains unchanged at $1.95-$2.25 per pound. In June 2016, the Zambian government passed legislation to amend the royalty tax for mining operations to a variable rate based on the prevailing copper price, effective June 1, 2016. These rates are four percent at copper prices below $2.04; five percent at copper prices between $2.04 and $2.72; and six percent at copper prices of $2.72 and above. Legislation was also passed to remove the 15 percent variable profit tax on income from mining companies. Our 2016 copper guidance takes into consideration the revised royalty rates commencing June 1. BEST-IN-CLASS IN ACTION Pueblo Viejo Autoclaves Case Study Applying Creative Thinking and Knowledge to Unlock Potential The key to unlocking the massive refractory ore body at Pueblo Viejo rests within four giant autoclaves-the largest ever used in the gold mining industry. Each autoclave weighs 780 tonnes, and is roughly 38 meters long and six meters in diameter-about as wide as a Boeing 747 fuselage. Improving the availability and throughput of the autoclaves has the potential to unlock substantial value for the mine. Until recently, each autoclave has required, on average, a 22-day maintenance shutdown every six months. Large metal walls that separate the compartments inside each autoclave begin to fail as a result of the forces generated by continuous agitation of the ore slurry. A buckled or failed wall can interfere with normal operation, damaging the agitator blades and shafts, and accelerating the build-up of scale and sand, thereby requiring frequent maintenance. Challenging and pushing past technical limits is a critical component of our Best-in-Class philosophy. Faced with this challenge, the team at Pueblo Viejo came up with a plan to increase autoclave availability and throughput by extending the period between maintenance shutdowns-from every six months, to every seven or potentially eight months. To achieve this, the team applied Barrick's extensive autoclave operating experience to propose a number of critical modifications to the autoclaves. High oxidization rates inside the autoclaves implied the number of interior compartments could be reduced, thereby mitigating the build-up of scale, and the associated maintenance requirements. However, the remaining compartment walls would continue to fail at a similar rate, limiting the potential gains. To solve this problem, the team worked with an engineering partner to develop a new design for the interior compartment walls. The design better integrates the walls into the autoclaves using stronger titanium structure sections, improved bracing, and larger bolts. The new walls have been successfully installed in two of the mine's four autoclaves. Initial results have been positive, indicating that increased run-time between shutdown maintenance is achievable. If successful in all four autoclaves, this initiative has the potential to increase throughput at Pueblo Viejo by 240,000 tonnes per year (100 percent basis), increasing autoclave availability from 84 percent to 86.5 percent-driving increased production, lower unit costs, and additional free cash flow from the operation. Other benefits include reducing materials cost for autoclave maintenance work (spare parts, valves, and ancillary equipment), and reducing contractor costs, due to fewer shutdowns per year. Goldstrike Open Pit Haulage Case Study When Challenging Conventional Wisdom Pays Off Over nearly 30 years of managing one of the largest open pit gold mines in the world, conventional wisdom at Goldstrike suggested that the technical limit for open pit haul truck utilization was 79 percent, taking into account the mine runs two open pits seven miles apart. In simple terms, for every hour of potential operating time, the average truck achieved about 48 minutes of productive work time. At the end of 2015, the mine was operating a fleet of 29 Komatsu 930 haul trucks. Motivated by a desire to challenge conventional wisdom in pursuit of Best-in-Class performance, the open pit team at Goldstrike evaluated how to increase haul truck availability to a level the mine had never achieved. Drawing on other experiences from across the industry, they came up with a concept that allows some haul trucks to be parked, while significantly increasing utilization of the trucks remaining in service. The secret was breaks-but not the brakes on the trucks. Typically, when haul truck drivers at Goldstrike were scheduled to take a break, they simply pulled over in a safe location and enjoyed a rest, usually spent inside the cab of the truck itself. This had trucks idling, rather than engaging in productive work. Earlier this year, Goldstrike began testing a new system. The mine is in the process of installing a series of modular break rooms at strategic locations around the open pit where drivers can rest. While drivers are on break, relief drivers take over operation of the trucks. In just six months, the results have been impressive: a six percent improvement in haul truck utilization in the open pit, moving from 79 percent to 85 percent; and six haul trucks taken out of the fleet. Today, the mine is moving the same amount of material in the open pit, with fewer trucks. This initiative, combined with other improvement projects, has helped to reduce open pit mining costs at Goldstrike from $1.40 per tonne at the start of the year to $1.25 per tonne today. The shift to using properly-configured break rooms also increases safety, by promoting a more restful environment for operators. As often happens, when you remove one bottleneck, other opportunities for improvement present themselves. The open pit team is now evaluating how to further optimize shovel use at the mine, matching the right shovels with the right haulage plans and ore types.

Barrick believes this to be a useful indicator of our ability to operate without reliance on additional borrowing or usage of existing cash. Free cash flow is intended to provide additional information only and does not have any standardized meaning under IFRS and may not be comparable to similar measures of performance presented by other companies. Free cash flow should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS.

Other sales Revenues include the sale of by-products for our gold and copper mines for the three months ended June 30, 2016 of $32 million (2015: $33 million) and the six months ended June 30, 2016 of $60 million (2015: $74 million) and energy sales from the Monte Rio power plant at our Pueblo Viejo Mine for the three months ended June 30, 2016 of $14 million (2015: $20 million) and the six months ended June 30, 2016 of $24 million (2015: $38 million). Realized (gains)/losses on hedge and non-hedge derivatives Includes realized hedge losses of $20 million and $44 million (2015: $21 million and $42 million, respectively) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, and realized non-hedge losses of $6 million and $13 million (2015: $6 million and $5 million, respectively) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively. Refer to Note 5 of the Financial Statements for further information. Non-recurring items Non-recurring items consist of $10 million in abnormal costs at Veladero. These costs are not indicative of our cost of production and have been excluded from the calculation of cash costs. Other Other adjustments include adding the net margins related to power sales at Pueblo Viejo of $2 million and $4 million, respectively, (2015: $5 million and $10 million, respectively) and adding the cost of treatment and refining charges of $4 million and $9 million, respectively (2015: $3 million and $6 million, respectively). 2016 includes the removal of costs associated with our Pierina mine which is mining incidental ounces as it enters closure of $12 million and $28 million, respectively. Rehabilitation - accretion and amortization Includes depreciation on the assets related to rehabilitation provisions of our gold operations and accretion on the rehabilitation provision of our gold operations, split between operating and non-operating sites. Exploration and evaluation costs Exploration, evaluation and project expenses are presented as minesite sustaining if it supports current mine operations and project if it relates to future projects. Refer to page 27 of Barrick's Second Quarter 2016 MD&A. Capital expenditures Capital expenditures are related to our gold sites only and are presented on a 100 percent accrued basis. They are split between minesite sustaining and project capital expenditures. Project capital expenditures are distinct projects designed to increase the net present value of the mine and are not related to current production. Significant projects in the current year are Arturo and Cortez Lower Zone. Refer to page 26 of Barrick's Second Quarter 2016 MD&A. Non-controlling interest and copper operations Removes general & administrative costs of $12 million and $22 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 (2015: $14 million and $26 million, respectively), exploration, evaluation and project costs of $4 million and $10 million, respectively (2015: $3 million and $7 million, respectively), rehabilitation costs of $2 million and $3 million, respectively (2015: $3 million and $5 million, respectively) and capital expenditures of $78 million and $129 million, respectively (2015: $79 million and $137 million, respectively) that are related to our copper sites and the non-controlling interest of our Acacia and Pueblo Viejo operating segment and Arturo. In 2016, figures remove the impact of Pierina. Costs per ounce Amounts presented on a co-product basis remove from cost per ounce calculations the impact of other metal sales (net of non-controlling interest) that are produced as a by-product of our gold production. Ounces sold - equity basis In 2016, figures remove the impact of Pierina as the mine is currently going through closure.

Forward-looking statements are necessarily based upon a number of estimates and assumptions; including material estimates and assumptions related to the factors set forth below that, while considered reasonable by the company as at the date of this press release in light of management's experience and perception of current conditions and expected developments, are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies. Known and unknown factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements and information. Such factors include, but are not limited to: fluctuations in the spot and forward price of gold, copper or certain other commodities (such as silver, diesel fuel, natural gas and electricity); the speculative nature of mineral exploration and development; changes in mineral production performance, exploitation and exploration successes; risks associated with the fact that certain Best-in-Class initiatives are still in the early stages of evaluation and additional engineering and other analysis is required to fully assess their impact; diminishing quantities or grades of reserves; increased costs, delays, suspensions and technical challenges associated with the construction of capital projects; operating or technical difficulties in connection with mining or development activities, including geotechnical challenges and disruptions in the maintenance or provision of required infrastructure and information technology systems; failure to comply with environmental and health and safety laws and regulations; timing of receipt of, or failure to comply with, necessary permits and approvals; uncertainty whether some or all of the Best-in-Class initiatives and investments targeted by the Growth Group will meet the company's capital allocation objectives; the impact of global liquidity and credit availability on the timing of cash flows and the values of assets and liabilities based on projected future cash flows; adverse changes in our credit ratings; the impact of inflation; fluctuations in the currency markets; changes in U.S. dollar interest rates; risks arising from holding derivative instruments; changes in national and local government legislation, taxation, controls or regulations and/or changes in the administration of laws, policies and practices, expropriation or nationalization of property and political or economic developments in Canada, the United States and other jurisdictions in which the company does or may carry on business in the future; lack of certainty with respect to foreign legal systems, corruption and other factors that are inconsistent with the rule of law; damage to the company's reputation due to the actual or perceived occurrence of any number of events, including negative publicity with respect to the company's handling of environmental matters or dealings with community groups, whether true or not; risk of loss due to acts of war, terrorism, sabotage and civil disturbances; litigation; contests over title to properties, particularly title to undeveloped properties, or over access to water, power and other required infrastructure; business opportunities that may be presented to, or pursued by, the company; our ability to successfully integrate acquisitions or complete divestitures; risks associated with working with partners in jointly controlled assets; employee relations including loss of key employees; increased costs and physical risks, including extreme weather events and resource shortage, related to climate change; availability and increased costs associated with mining inputs and labor; and the organization of our previously held African gold operations and properties under a separate listed company. In addition, there are risks and hazards associated with the business of mineral exploration, development and mining, including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, unusual or unexpected formations, pressures, cave-ins, flooding and gold bullion, copper cathode or gold or copper concentrate losses (and the risk of inadequate insurance, or inability to obtain insurance, to cover these risks). Many of these uncertainties and contingencies can affect our actual results and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, us. Readers are cautioned that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. All of the forward-looking statements made in this Second Quarter Report 2016 are qualified by these cautionary statements. Specific reference is made to the most recent Form 40-F/Annual Information Form on file with the SEC and Canadian provincial securities regulatory authorities for a more detailed discussion of some of the factors underlying forward-looking statements and the risks that may affect Barrick's ability to achieve the expectations set forth in the forward-looking statements contained in this press release. The company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law. Cameco Corporation (TSE: CCJ) Cameco is one of the world's largest uranium producers accounting for about 16% of the global production from its mines in Canada, the US and Kazakhstan. Our leading position is backed by about 429 million pounds of proven and probable reserves and extensive resources. Cameco reports second quarter financial results Maintaining annual delivery and cost of sales guidance Signed an agreement with Kazatomprom to restructure and enhance JV Inkai Continued focus on controlling costs amid difficult market conditions Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada, July 28, 2016 Cameco (TSX: CCO; NYSE: CCJ) today reported its consolidated financial and operating results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2016 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). \"Our quarterly results were again influenced by a quiet market, as well as a number of notable and one-time items\" said president and CEO, Tim Gitzel. \"However, our annual sales guidance and cost of sales expectations remain unchanged, our long-term contract portfolio continues to keep our average realized price above market prices, and we remain focused on controlling costs across the organization. \"Market conditions have become increasingly challenging over the past five years. Primary supply has simply not responded to decreased demand, and coupled with an abundance of secondary material available today, the uranium market continues to be oversupplied. As a result, prices have remained under pressure, and because we don't know how long the current weak conditions will persist, we must manage the company with that uncertainty in mind. \"Despite the current market challenges, we remain confident in nuclear power as an important part of the long-term global energy mix. Based on the reactor construction that is underway around the world today, we continue to expect uranium demand to increase in the long-term.\" SECOND QUARTER Net losses attributable to equity holders this quarter were $137 million (losses of $0.35 per share diluted) compared to net earnings of $88 million ($0.22 per share diluted) in the second quarter of 2015 due to: impairment of our Rabbit Lake operation mark-to-market losses on foreign exchange derivatives compared to gains in the second quarter of 2015 lower gross profit from our uranium and NUKEM segments higher administration expenditures partially offset by: higher foreign exchange gains On an adjusted basis, our losses this quarter were $57 million (losses of $0.14 per share diluted) compared to earnings of $46 million ($0.12 per share diluted) (non-IFRS measure, see page 2) in the second quarter of 2015. The change was mainly due to: lower gross profit from our uranium and NUKEM segments higher administration expenditures partially offset by: higher foreign exchange gains See Financial results by segment on page 5 for more detailed discussion. FIRST SIX MONTHS Net losses in the first six months of the year were $59 million (losses of $0.15 per share diluted) compared to earnings of $79 million ($0.20 per share diluted) in the first six months of 2015 mainly due to: impairment of our Rabbit Lake operation lower gross profit from our uranium and NUKEM segments higher administration costs higher foreign exchange losses partially offset by: higher gross profit from our fuel services segment mark-to-market gains on foreign exchange derivatives compared to losses in the first six months of 2015 higher tax recovery On an adjusted basis, our losses for the first six months of this year were $64 million (losses of $0.16 per share diluted) compared to earnings of $115 million ($0.29 per share diluted) (non-IFRS measure, see page 2) for the first six months of 2015. Key variances include: lower gross profit from our uranium and NUKEM segments higher administration costs higher foreign exchange losses partially offset by: higher gross profit from our fuel services segment higher tax recovery ADJUSTED NET EARNINGS (NON-IFRS MEASURE) Adjusted net earnings is a measure that does not have a standardized meaning or a consistent basis of calculation under IFRS (non-IFRS measure). We use this measure as a more meaningful way to compare our financial performance from period to period. We believe that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, certain investors use this information to evaluate our performance. Adjusted net earnings is our net earnings attributable to equity holders, adjusted to better reflect the underlying financial performance for the reporting period. The adjusted earnings measure reflects the matching of the net benefits of our hedging program with the inflows of foreign currencies in the applicable reporting period, and has also been adjusted for NUKEM purchase price inventory write-downs and recoveries, impairment charges, and income taxes on adjustments. Adjusted net earnings is non-standard supplemental information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information prepared according to accounting standards. Other companies may calculate this measure differently, so you may not be able to make a direct comparison to similar measures presented by other companies. IMPAIRMENT Production was suspended at our Rabbit Lake operation during the second quarter, requiring us to determine the excess carrying value of the mine and mill over the fair value less costs to sell. As a result, we have recognized an impairment charge for the full carrying value of $124.4 million. CONTRACTING In July, we agreed to terminate a long-term supply contract with one of our utility customers, which had product deliveries from 2016 through 2021. The resulting gain on contract settlement of $46.7 million will be reflected in our financial results for the third quarter as other income. Our strategy We are a pure-play nuclear fuel supplier, focused on taking advantage of the long-term growth we see coming in our industry, while maintaining the ability to respond to market conditions as they evolve. Our strategy is to profitably produce from our tierone assets at a pace aligned with market signals to increase long-term shareholder value, and to do that with an emphasis on safety, people and the environment. We believe the best way to create value is to focus our investible capital on maintaining a strong balance sheet and on preserving the production flexibility of our tier-one assets. This approach provides us with the opportunity to meet rising demand with increased production from our best margin assets, and helps to mitigate risk during a prolonged period of uncertainty. In the context of continued depressed market conditions, we have positioned our production to come from our lower-cost operations. Going forward, we plan to: ensure continued safe, reliable, low-cost production from our tier-one assets - McArthur River/Key Lake, Cigar Lake and Inkai complete ramp up of production at Cigar Lake continue to evaluate the position of the other sources of supply in our portfolio, including Rabbit Lake and the US operations, and retain the flexibility to respond to market signals and take advantage of value adding opportunities, including expanded production capacity at McArthur River/Key Lake and at Inkai maintain our low-cost advantage by focusing on execution and operational excellence You can read more about our strategy in our 2015 annual management's discussion and analysis (MD&A). Uranium market update The second quarter of 2016 continued much the same as the first - with demand remaining low and uranium prices depressed. That is as expected, given that there have been no events to catalyze a change in the current state of the market. In Japan, reactors continue to progress towards restart at a very slow pace, facing further challenges in the form of injunctions from the lower courts. Adding pressure to the market were a number of premature reactor retirement announcements in the United States, as well as the vote by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union, which has increased uncertainty around their new build program. On the other side of the equation, supply continued to be readily available, with secondary supplies abundant and no interruptions to primary supply. Making positive news for the industry were two new reactor startups - one in China and one in the United States - bringing the total for the year to five. Longer term, strong fundamentals underpin a positive outlook for the industry. With 60 reactors under construction today and additional units planned over the next decade, uranium demand is expected to increase as those reactors come online. In addition, as future supply continues to be negatively affected by current depressed market conditions and utilities refrain from contracting replacement volumes, we expect to see a shift from the currently over-supplied market we are experiencing today to a demand-driven market that requires more primary supply. Demand growth combined with the timing, development and execution of new supply projects and the continued performance of existing supply, will determine the pace of that shift. Outlook for 2016 Our outlook for 2016 reflects the expenditures necessary to help us achieve our strategy. Our outlook for our consolidated tax rate, and NUKEM's delivery volumes, revenue and gross profit, has changed. We do not provide an outlook for the items in the table that are marked with a dash. We have increased our uranium production outlook to 25.8 million pounds U3O8 (previously 25.7 million pounds) to reflect the final 2016 production from Rabbit Lake following the operational changes made in April. See Uranium 2016 Q2 updates starting on page 9 for more information. We have decreased our outlook for NUKEM sales volumes to 7 million to 8 million pounds U3O8 (previously 9 million to 10 million pounds) due to continued light activity in the market. This change, along with the inventory write-down that we recognized during the second quarter, has also resulted in a change to our outlook for NUKEM's revenue and gross profit. We now expect NUKEM's revenue to decrease 5% to 10% (previously increase 5% to 10%) and gross profit to be a maximum of 1% (previously 4% to 5%). We have adjusted our outlook for the consolidated tax rate to a recovery of 175% to 200% (previously 50% to 55%) due to the changes to our NUKEM outlook noted above, and a change in the distribution of earnings between jurisdictions. In our uranium and fuel services segments, our customers choose when in the year to receive deliveries, so our quarterly delivery patterns, delivery volumes and revenue can vary significantly. We expect remaining 2016 uranium deliveries to be more heavily weighted to the fourth quarter. REVENUE AND EARNINGS SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS For the rest of 2016: an increase of $5 (US) per pound in both the Ux spot price ($25.00 (US) per pound on July 25, 2016) and the Ux long-term price indicator ($38.00 (US) per pound on July 25, 2016) would increase revenue by $37 million and net earnings by $29 million. Conversely, a decrease of $5 (US) per pound would decrease revenue by $28 million and net earnings by $21 million. a one-cent change in the value of the Canadian dollar versus the US dollar would change adjusted net earnings by $5 million, with a decrease in the value of the Canadian dollar versus the US dollar having a positive impact. Cash flow would change by $1 million, with a decrease in the value of the Canadian dollar versus the US dollar having a negative impact. TRANSFER PRICING DISPUTES We have been reporting on our transfer pricing disputes with Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) since 2008, when it originated, and with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) since the first quarter of 2015. Please see our second quarter MD&A for a discussion of the general nature of transfer pricing disputes and, more specifically, the ongoing disputes we have. Financial results by segment Uranium SECOND QUARTER Production volumes this quarter were 30% higher compared to the second quarter of 2015, mainly due to higher production from Cigar Lake, Inkai and Rabbit Lake. See Uranium 2016 Q2 updates starting on page 9 for more information. The 40% decrease in uranium revenues was a result of a 37% decrease in sales volume and a 4% decrease in the Canadian dollar average realized price. Sales in the second quarter were lower than in 2015 due to the timing of deliveries, which are driven by customer requests and can vary significantly. The US dollar average realized price decreased by 8% compared to 2015 mainly due to lower prices on market-related contracts, while the lower Canadian dollar realized prices this quarter were a result of that decrease, partially offset by the weakening of the Canadian dollar compared to 2015. This quarter the exchange rate on the average realized price was $1.00 (US) for $1.30 (Cdn) compared to $1.00 (US) for $1.25 (Cdn) in the second quarter of 2015. Total cost of sales (including D&A) decreased by 27% ($218 million compared to $297 million in 2015) due to a 37% decrease in sales volume, partially offset by a 17% increase in the unit cost of sales. The increase in the unit cost of sales was mainly the result of care and maintenance costs and severance costs related to the curtailment of production at Rabbit Lake and in the US, partially offset by lower production costs related to higher production from Cigar Lake compared to the second quarter of 2015. The net effect was an $89 million decrease in gross profit for the quarter. FIRST SIX MONTHS Production volumes for the first six months of the year were 33% higher than in the previous year due to the addition of production from Cigar Lake and higher production at McArthur/Key Lake, and Inkai, partially offset by lower production at our US operations. See Uranium 2016 Q2 updates starting on page 9 for more information. Uranium revenues decreased 24% compared to the first six months of 2015 due to a 27% decrease in sales volumes, partially offset by a 3% increase in the Canadian dollar average realized price, in the first six months. In our uranium and fuel services segments, our customers choose when in the year to receive deliveries, so our quarterly delivery patterns, sales volumes and revenue can vary significantly. We are on track to meet our 2016 uranium sales targets, and, therefore, expect to deliver between 20 million and 22 million pounds in the remainder of the year. Our Canadian dollar realized prices for the first six months of 2016 were higher than 2015, primarily as a result of the weakening of the Canadian dollar compared to 2015. For the first six months of 2016, the exchange rate on the average realized price was $1.00 (US) for $1.34 (Cdn) compared to $1.00 (US) for $1.23 (Cdn) for the same period in 2015. Total cost of sales (including D&A) decreased by 18% ($454 million compared to $552 million in 2015) mainly due to a 27% decrease in sales volume for the first six months, partially offset by a 12% increase in the unit cost of sales. The increase in the unit cost of sales was mainly the result of care and maintenance costs and severance costs related to the curtailment of production at Rabbit Lake and in the US. The net effect was a $92 million decrease in gross profit for the first six months. The table below shows the costs of produced and purchased uranium incurred in the reporting periods (which are non-IFRS measures, see the paragraphs below the table). These costs do not include care and maintenance costs, selling costs such as royalties, transportation and commissions, nor do they reflect the impact of opening inventories on our reported cost of sales. The average cash cost of production this quarter was 40% lower than the comparable period in 2015, primarily due to increased low-cost production from Cigar Lake, and the impact of our first quarter production changes at Rabbit Lake. Although purchased pounds are transacted in US dollars, we account for the purchases in Canadian dollars. In the second quarter, the average cash cost of purchased material in US dollar terms was $29.20 (US) per pound with an average exchange rate of $1.00 (US) for $1.31 (Cdn), compared to $36.48 (US) per pound at an average exchange rate of $1.00 (US) for $1.25 (Cdn) in the second quarter of 2015. For the first six months, the average cash cost of purchased material was $36.18 (US) per pound at an average exchange rate of $1.00 (US) for $1.38 (Cdn), compared to $37.40 per pound at an average exchange rate of 1.00 (US) for $1.25 (Cdn) in the same period in 2015. Cash cost per pound, non-cash cost per pound and total cost per pound for produced and purchased uranium presented in the above table are non-IFRS measures. These measures do not have a standardized meaning or a consistent basis of calculation under IFRS. We use these measures in our assessment of the performance of our uranium business. We believe that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, certain investors use this information to evaluate our performance and ability to generate cash flow. These measures are non-standard supplemental information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared according to accounting standards. These measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under IFRS. Other companies may calculate these measures differently, so you may not be able to make a direct comparison to similar measures presented by other companies. To facilitate a better understanding of these measures, the following table presents a reconciliation of these measures to our unit cost of sales for the second quarter and the first six months of 2016 and 2015. Fuel services SECOND QUARTER Total revenue for the second quarter of 2016 increased to $81 million from $70 million for the same period last year. A 21% increase in sales volumes was partially offset by a 7% decrease in average realized price, primarily due to mix of products sold partially offset by the weakening of the Canadian dollar compared to 2015. The total cost of products and services sold (including D&A) increased by 24% ($62 million compared to $50 million in the second quarter of 2015) due to the increase in sales volumes, partially offset by a decrease in the average unit cost of sales. When compared to 2015, the average unit cost of sales was 1% lower. Gross profit remained unchanged at $19 million. FIRST SIX MONTHS In the first six months of the year, total revenue increased by 3% due to a 6% increase in realized price that was the result of the weakening of the Canadian dollar and the mix of products sold, partially offset by a 4% decrease in sales volumes. The total cost of products and services sold (including D&A) decreased 1% ($108 million compared to $109 million in 2015) due to the 4% decrease in sales volume, partially offset by a 3% increase in the average unit cost of sales, which resulted from an increase in the unit opening inventory rate. The net effect was a $5 million increase in gross profit. NUKEM SECOND QUARTER During the second quarter of 2016, NUKEM delivered 2.4 million pounds of uranium, an increase of 60% from the same period last year due largely to the timing of customer requirements. The majority of the deliveries in the quarter were under existing contracts with utilities. Activity in the spot market continued to be light, as was the case in the first quarter. Total revenues increased by 59% as a result of higher sales volumes. NUKEM recorded a gross loss of $10 million in the second quarter of 2016, compared to an $11 million gross profit in the second quarter of 2015. Included in the 2016 gross loss is a $14 million net write-down of inventory. The write-down was a result of a decline in the spot price during the period. FIRST SIX MONTHS During the six months ended June 30, 2016, NUKEM delivered 2.4 million pounds of uranium, a decrease of 40%, due to very light market activity with a lack of profitable opportunities, and the timing of customer requirements. Total revenues decreased 26% due to a decrease in sales volumes, partially offset by a 22% increase in average realized price. The increase in realized price was mainly the result of deliveries under contracts negotiated in prior years when market prices were higher. Gross profit percentage was a loss of 8% for the first six months of 2016, a decrease from a profit of 12% in the same period in 2015. Included in the 2015 margin was a $3 million recovery compared to a $14 million net write-down of inventory in 2016. The write-down in 2016 was a result of a decline in the spot price during the period. The net effect was a $32 million decrease in gross profit. Uranium 2016 Q2 updates URANIUM PRODUCTION MCARTHUR RIVER/KEY LAKE Production for the second quarter was 3% lower compared to the same period last year due to a longer mill maintenance shut down. Production for the first six months was slightly higher than last year when unplanned mill maintenance affected our first quarter production. A new calciner has been installed at the Key Lake mill to accommodate an annual production increase to 25 million pounds when the market signals that more production is needed. However, reliability issues have been encountered with the new equipment during commissioning. Since market conditions do not currently support increased production at McArthur River/Key Lake, and as part of our continuing efforts to reduce costs, we have suspended the commissioning of and transition to the new calciner. We are assessing the cost to resolve the issues and expect to complete commissioning at a time when we see the need for the new calcining capacity. The existing calciner has sufficient capacity to meet our 2016 production target of 18 million pounds (12.6 million pounds our share). CIGAR LAKE Total packaged production from Cigar Lake was 67% higher in the second quarter, and 169% higher in the first six months compared to the same periods last year. The increases are related to the scheduled rampup of the operation. We are on track to achieve our target of 16 million pounds of production (8 million pounds our share) in 2016, and full production of 18 million pounds (9 million pounds our share) in 2017. In the second quarter, AREVA's application to increase the capacity of the McClean Lake mill from 13 million to 24 million pounds of annual production was approved by the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission. The unionized employees at AREVA's McClean Lake mill accepted a new three-year collective agreement during the second quarter. The previous contract expired in May, 2016. INKAI Production was 83% higher for the quarter and 83% higher for the first six months compared to the same periods last year, due to the timing of new wellfield development in our 2016 mine plan. The operation remains on track to achieve our planned 2016 production. As previously disclosed, we also signed an agreement with our partner Kazatomprom and JV Inkai to restructure and enhance JV Inkai. Please see our second quarter MD&A for more information. RABBIT LAKE Given the continued depressed market conditions in the near term, we suspended production at our Rabbit Lake operation during the second quarter. Production was 250% higher than the same period last year due to the timing of maintenance in 2015. Production for the first six months was 1.1 million pounds, unchanged from the comparable period in 2015. The facilities are now in care and maintenance. We expect to complete the transition of the Rabbit Lake operation to care and maintenance by the end of August, at a cost of about $45 million. We then expect the cost to maintain the site in a safe care and maintenance state for the remainder of the year to be about $15 million. We previously estimated the total cost of transition and care and maintenance activities to be about $35 million in 2016. However, due to an accelerated start for transition of the mill to care and maintenance, and the timing of workforce reductions, additional costs were incurred and categorized as care and maintenance costs. Previously, we expected some of those costs to be categorized as operating or capital costs. As long as production is suspended, we expect care and maintenance costs to range between $40 million and $45 million annually for the first few years. A workforce of 120 is remaining on site (down from 650) to maintain the facilities and sustain environmental monitoring and reclamation activities. The related severance cost of $11.8 million is included in our cost of sales and reflected in our results.

Profile We are one of the world's largest uranium producers, a significant supplier of conversion services and one of two CANDU fuel manufacturers in Canada. Our competitive position is based on our controlling ownership of the world's largest high-grade reserves and low-cost operations. Our uranium products are used to generate clean electricity in nuclear power plants around the world. We also explore for uranium in the Americas, Australia and Asia. Our shares trade on the Toronto and New York stock exchanges. Our head office is in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. As used in this news release, the terms we, us, our, the Company and Cameco mean Cameco Corporation and its subsidiaries; including NUKEM Energy GmbH, unless otherwise indicated. Franco-Nevada Corporation (TSE: FNV) Franco-Nevada is the leading gold-focused royalty and stream company by both gold revenues and number of gold assets.  The Company is gold-focused but also has the largest and most diversified portfolio of royalties and streams by commodity, geography, revenue type and stage of project.  The portfolio is actively managed with the aim to maintain over 80% of revenue from precious metals (gold, silver & PGM). The Company does not operate mines, develop projects or conduct exploration. Franco-Nevada's business model is focused on managing and growing its portfolio of royalties and streams. The advantages of this business model are: Market Exposure to the gold price and exploration optionality;  Limited exposure to many of the risks associated with operating companies;  A free cash-flow business with limited cash calls;  A high-margin business that can generate cash through the entire commodity cycle;  A scalable and diversified business in which a large number of assets can be managed with a small stable overhead;  A forward-looking business in which management focuses on growth opportunities rather than operational or development issues; and  A perpetual discovery option over large areas of geologically prospective lands with no cost other than the initial investment. Franco-Nevada's financial results in the short-term are primarily tied to the price of commodities and the amount of production from its portfolio of producing assets. From time to time, financial results are also supplemented by acquisitions of new producing assets. Over the longer-term, results are impacted by the availability of exploration and development capital applied by other companies to advance Franco-Nevada's advanced and exploration assets into production. Franco-Nevada has a long-term focus in making its investments and recognizes it is in a cyclical industry.  Franco-Nevada has historically operated by maintaining a strong balance sheet so that it can make investments during commodity cycle downturns. At year-end 2014, Franco-Nevada had $677.8 million in working capital and  an undrawn $500.0 million unsecured credit facility. Franco-Nevada's shares are listed on the Toronto and New York stock exchanges under the symbol FNV.  An investment in Franco-Nevada's shares is expected to provide investors with yield and more upside than gold ETF without exposure to operating cost inflation. Since its IPO over seven years ago, Franco-Nevada's share price has outperformed the gold price and all relevant gold equity benchmarks. Franco-Nevada Reports Strong Q1 2016 Results and Increases Quarterly Dividend TORONTO, May 4, 2016 - Franco-Nevada Corporation (TSX: FNV; NYSE: FNV) is pleased to report its financial results for the first quarter of 2016. All figures are in U.S. dollars unless noted and highlights include: Record 106,621 Gold Equivalent Ounces1 (\"GEOs\"), a 25% increase over Q1 2015; Record $132.0 million in revenue, a 21% increase; Net Income of $30.0 million, or $0.18 per share; Adjusted Net Income2 of $28.0 million, or $0.17 per share; Adjusted EBITDA3 of $103.7 million, or $0.62 per share; $500 million acquisition of a precious metals stream with reference to production from Antapaccay; $883.5 million of net proceeds raised through a bought deal equity financing; Quarterly dividend increased 4.8% to $0.22 per share. \"Franco-Nevada's recent investments at Antamina and Antapaccay helped generate the record quarterly GEOs and revenue results,\" stated David Harquail, CEO. \"These investments have further strengthened and diversified our portfolio with long duration quality assets. Thanks to the support of our investors, Franco-Nevada was able to raise equity financing and is again debt free. The Company now has over $186 million in cash and short-term investments and $1 billion in available credit facilities so is well positioned to continue to grow the portfolio. I am particularly proud that Franco-Nevada has today raised its dividend for the ninth consecutive year since its IPO. This speaks to the strength of the portfolio and the business model.\" For the first quarter of 2016, revenue was sourced 95% from precious metals (69% gold, 20% silver and 6% PGM) and 82% from the Americas (13% U.S., 16% Canada and 53% Latin America). Costs and expenses increased due to higher depletion and cost of sales as a result of the recent Antamina and Antapaccay acquisitions. Oil & gas production levels were stable while associated revenue was down slightly year over year due to lower average oil and gas prices. Cash provided by operating activities before changes to working capital was $99.4 million. Corporate Updates Antapaccay: On February 26, 2016, Franco-Nevada acquired for $500.0 million a precious metals stream from Glencore plc with reference to production from the Antapaccay mine located in Peru. Equity Financing: On February 19, 2016, Franco-Nevada completed a bought deal financing with a syndicate of underwriters for 19.2 million common shares at $47.85 per common share. Net proceeds were $883.5 million. As the existing shelf prospectus was mostly utilized, a new $2 billion shelf prospectus was filed on May 2, 2016. Debt Repayment: In March, all outstanding debt balances were repaid. At the end of the quarter, Franco-Nevada had $186 million in cash and short-term investments and $1 billion in available credit facilities. Portfolio Updates Precious Metals - U.S.: GEOs from U.S. precious metals assets were essentially unchanged year over year with increases from Goldstrike largely offsetting decreases at Stillwater and Gold Quarry. The South Arturo project currently being advanced by joint venture partners Barrick Gold and Premier Gold Mines is expected to contribute later in 2016. Klondex Mines is reporting exploration success at Fire Creek where Franco-Nevada has a 2.5% royalty. Franco-Nevada has agreed to restructure its existing royalties at the Castle Mountain gold project into a single 2.65% royalty covering a larger property. Precious Metals - Canada: GEOs from Canadian precious metals assets decreased compared with the first quarter 2015 with higher contributions from Detour Lake, Hemlo and Musselwhite being more than offset by a weaker quarter from Sudbury due to PGM prices. Operatorship of several Canadian royalties moved into stronger hands with Lake Shore Gold being acquired by Tahoe Resources and St Andrew Goldfields by Kirkland Lake Gold. Precious Metals - Latin America: GEOs from Latin American precious metals assets increased substantially as a result of the recent investments in Antamina and Antapaccay. Antamina delivered 17,781 GEOs while Antapaccay delivered 8,918 GEOs. The Antapaccay precious metals stream was acquired during the quarter and the GEOs received reflects only two months of deliveries during a seasonably weak period. Candelaria also had a strong quarter and Lundin Mining has revised its guidance higher for 2016. The Cobre Panama project continues to advance and Franco-Nevada expects to advance $25-35 million in the second quarter. Precious Metals - Rest of World: GEOs from Rest of World precious metals assets decreased slightly year over year mainly due to timing of deliveries from the Sabodala fixed ounce obligation. Karma contributed an initial 1,250 GEOs in the quarter with 12,500 GEOs scheduled to be delivered in 2016. True Gold, the previous operator of the Karma mine, was acquired by Endeavour Mining subsequent to quarter end. Kinross has announced it is proceeding with a Phase One expansion of the Tasiast mine, on which Franco-Nevada has a 2% royalty, which it expects will increase average production to 409,000 ounces per annum from 2018 to 2027. Kinross also indicated that it is studying a larger Phase Two expansion which could result in even higher production. Oil & gas: Revenue from oil & gas assets was $3.6 million in Q1 2016 compared with $5.5 million in Q1 2015. Most of the decrease in revenue is attributable to lower realized oil prices. Dividend Declaration Franco-Nevada is pleased to announce that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share. The dividend is a 4.8% increase from the previous $0.21 per share quarterly dividend and marks the ninth consecutive annual dividend increase for Franco-Nevada shareholders.

Goldcorp Reports Second Quarter 2016 Results; Expansions Approved at Penasquito and Musselwhite July 27, 2016 (All amounts in US$ unless stated otherwise) VANCOUVER, July 27, 2016 /CNW/ - GOLDCORP INC. (TSX: G, NYSE: GG) today reported its second quarter 2016 results and a decision to proceed with expansions at both its Penasquito and Musselwhite mines. Second Quarter 2016 Highlights Gold production(1) of 613,400 ounces at all-in sustaining costs(1)(3) (\"AISC\") of $1,067 per ounce, compared to 908,000 ounces at AISC of $853 per ounce in 2015. Lower gold production was expected in the second quarter mainly due to planned lower ore grades, a 10-day mill shutdown for planned maintenance at Penasquito and the exhaustion of surface stockpiles at Cerro Negro which contributed significantly to mill feed in 2015. Further, a slower than expected ramp up after the mill shutdown at Penasquito and the decision to accelerate a large workforce reduction at Cerro Negro had a short-term, negative impact on second quarter gold production. 2016 guidance reconfirmed for gold production of between 2.8 and 3.1 million ounces, at AISC of between $850 and $925 per ounce. Production is expected to increase in the third and fourth quarter as the plant at Penasquito returned to normal operations in July and higher grades are expected from a number of mines. AISC are expected to decrease as a result of higher production. Approximately 50% of targeted $250 million sustainable annual efficiencies identified. Workforce reductions and other improvement initiatives are underway at Cerro Negro which are expected to deliver approximately $65 million of annual efficiencies. Additionally, approximately $55 million in annual administrative cost savings were identified in July and are expected to be fully realized in 2017 as the decentralization of the Company was initiated with a one-third decrease in the number of employees at corporate and regional offices. The Company is on schedule to achieve its $250 million efficiency target by 2018. Adjusted operating cash flows(1,2) of $307 million, compared to $523 million in 2015. The decrease in adjusted operating cash flows in the second quarter of 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to lower production, partially offset by an increase in the realized gold price. Net loss of $78 million, or $0.09 per share, compared to net earnings of $392 million, or $0.47 per share, in 2015. Net earnings in 2015 included non-recurring after-tax gains on the sale of non-core assets of $358 million, or $0.43 per share. Second quarter 2016 earnings were negatively impacted by lower production, partially offset by an increase in the realized gold price. Project pipeline advanced: expansions approved at Penasquito and Musselwhite; Kaminak Gold acquisition closed and Coffee project acquired. During the quarter, the Company advanced its project pipeline with the completion of the Hoyle Deep project at Porcupine. In addition, the Company received Board approval to proceed with the Pyrite Leach Project at Penasquito (\"PLP\"), with an expected capital investment of approximately $420 million, and the Materials Handling Project at Musselwhite, with an expected capital investment of approximately $90 million, each of which are expected to increase gold production commencing in 2019. The acquisition of Kaminak, and its Coffee project in the Yukon, Canada was completed after quarter end and is expected to provide the Company with a medium-term opportunity for low-cost, high return gold production to complement a robust pipeline of expansion opportunities at existing mines. \"While lower production was expected in the second quarter, the decision to accelerate a significant organizational restructuring had a short-term, negative impact on gold production. With the decentralization of our business well underway and new mine management installed at the majority of our operations to reflect the new business model, Goldcorp is poised to deliver better gold production and cost performance,\" said David Garofalo, Goldcorp President and CEO. \"We continued to advance our robust project pipeline with the decision to proceed to construction with high rate of return expansions at our Penasquito and Musselwhite mines.\" ORGANIZATION STRENGTHENED Going forward, the mine general managers will have much greater accountability for growing the net asset value of their individual businesses. The focus of the corporate office will be to provide oversight and allocate capital. To those ends, mine management changes were undertaken and the Company reduced the number of employees at the corporate and regional offices by approximately one-third. As part of the organizational re-design, the Company has strengthened the senior management team with the recruitment of several key individuals. Paul Harbidge has been appointed Senior Vice-President (\"SVP\"), Exploration reporting to George Burns, Executive Vice President (\"EVP\") and Chief Operating Officer. Paul will be responsible for the development, implementation and management of the global exploration function, within the decentralized model. Paul brings over 20 years of mining experience to Goldcorp, most recently as head of exploration at Randgold Resources. Paul holds a Bachelor of Science in Geology from Kingston University in the UK, as well as a Master of Science in Mineral Exploration and Mining Geology from Leicester University in the UK. Jason Attew has been appointed SVP, Corporate Development & Strategy, reporting to Russell Ball, EVP and Chief Financial Officer (\"CFO\"). Jason will lead the optimization of the Company's portfolio of assets, while evaluating new opportunities that are consistent with the strategy of increasing net asset value per share. Jason is a mining and metals banking executive with over 20 years of experience and holds a Bachelor of Science from the University of British Columbia, as well as a Master of Business Administration from Queen's University in Ontario. Wade Bristol has been appointed SVP, Canada, reporting to George Burns. Wade joined Goldcorp in July 2014 as the Vice President, Mine Improvement & Support.

Wade has a Bachelor of Science in Mining Engineering Degree from Montana Tech of the University of Montana. Steven Thomas has been appointed to the new role of CFO, Canada, reporting to Wade Bristol and David Splett has been appointed to the new role of CFO, Latin America reporting to Joe Dick, SVP, Latin America. As part of the regional leadership teams, Steven and David will provide financial analysis, interpretation and metrics to facilitate strategic decision making related to the management of the regional businesses. Steven brings over 30 years of financial experience, with the last 13 years in the mining industry with De Beers Canada Inc. Steven holds a Bachelor of Science Joint Honours Degree in Accountancy and Economics from the University of Wales in the UK, and is a Fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants. David brings with him over 24 years of experience in the resource industry, most recently as VP Finance for Mosaic Corporation. David holds a Bachelor of Arts, Economics from the University of Regina, a Master of Arts, Management Systems from the University of Hull in the UK, as well as an MBA from Queens University in Ontario and is a Certified Management Accountant. During the second quarter of 2016, the Company began implementing a company-wide program to optimize all areas of Goldcorp's business and deliver $250 million in sustainable annual efficiencies by 2018. Cerro Negro began the implementation of a substantial workforce reduction and along with other improvement initiatives is expected to provide increased efficiencies of approximately $65 million. In addition, approximately $55 million of administrative cost savings have been identified through the reduction of employees at corporate and regional offices by approximately one-third as part of the broader decentralization effort. The Company is undertaking a comprehensive optimization effort at each of the mine sites that is expected to allow it to achieve the balance of the $250 million target. FINANCIAL AND OPERATING RESULTS REVIEW millions except where noted) Three months ended June 30 Six months ended June 30 2016 2015 2016 2015 Gold production1 (ounces) 613,400 908,000 1,397,100 1,633,000 Gold sales1 (ounces) 616,000 903,000 1,415,000 1,730,000 Operating cash flows $234 $528 $293 $579 Adjusted operating cash flows1,2 $307 $523 $396 $641 Net earnings (loss) $(78) $392 $2 $305 Net earnings (loss) per share $(0.09) $0.47 $0.00 $0.37 By-product cash costs1,4 (per ounce) $728 $547 $631 $565 AISC1,3 (per ounce) $1,067 $853 $936 $868 Net loss and net loss per share in the second quarter of 2016 and the net earnings and net earnings per share in 2015 were affected by, among other things, the following non-cash or other items that management believes are not reflective of the performance of the underlying operations: (millions except where noted) Three months ended June 30, 2016 Three months ended June 30, 2015 Pre-tax After-tax Per share Pre-tax After-tax Per share Negative deferred tax effects of foreign exchange on tax assets and liabilities and losses $- $60 $0.07 $- $10 $0.01 Restructuring costs $16 $11 $0.01 $- $- $- Gains on dispositions of, and dilution of ownership interest in, mining interests $- $- $- $(414) $(358) $(0.43) Total cash costs on a by-product basis for the second quarter of 2016 were $728 per ounce compared to $547 per ounce for the second quarter of 2015.AISC for the second quarter of 2016 were $1,067 per ounce, compared to $853 per ounce in the second quarter of 2015. The higher AISC was primarily a result of lower sales volumes at Penasquito, Cerro Negro and Red Lake, partially offset by lower production costs and the favorable impact of the strengthening US dollar against the Argentine and Mexican pesos and the Canadian dollar. As of June 30, 2016, the Company had total liquidity of approximately $3.2 billion, including $0.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and money market investments and $2.9 billion in available credit. The Company's $3 billion revolving credit facility was recently extended by a year to June 22, 2021. OPERATIONS REVIEW AND GUIDANCE The Company reconfirmed 2016 gold production guidance between 2.8 and 3.1 million ounces at AISC between $850 and $925 per ounce. Third and fourth quarter production is expected to increase over the second quarter as Penasquito returns to normal operations after its maintenance shutdown and grades are expected to increase at a number of mine sites. In addition, AISC are expected to decrease in the third and fourth quarter as compared to the second quarter of 2016 as a result of higher production. With the approval to proceed to construction of the PLP and the Materials Handling Project, and the addition of the Coffee Project, growth capital for 2016 is expected to increase by approximately $90 - $100 million to approximately $190 - $200 million. Penasquito, Mexico (100%-owned) Brian Berney has been appointed Mine General Manager at Penasquito. Brian has a successful track record of bringing projects to operations and his focus on continuous improvement and safe production will help bring Penasquito to the next stage of productivity and efficiency. Brian comes to Goldcorp with broad mining and project development experience in large operations including Teck's Quebrada Blanca mine, leading and participating in Barrick's Pueblo Viejo and Pascua Lama Projects, and leading the Technical Services areas in former Placer Dome operations. Brian holds a Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering from the University of Queensland. Second quarter gold production totaled 36,000 ounces at an AISC of $3,094 per ounce. AISC were significantly higher compared to the second quarter of 2015, primarily as a result of lower gold production and lower by-product revenues. Production declined compared to the second quarter of 2015 as a result of lower ore grade and recovery from the upper transitional ore and low grade stockpiles in 2016 compared with 2015, when ore was being sourced from the heart of the deposit. Additionally, production declined as a result of a shutdown for 10 days for plant maintenance and a longer than anticipated period to ramp the plant up to full production due to a variety of restart issues. The plant has operated normally in July. Over the next three years, mining activities in the pit are expected to be focused on lower grade ore in the upper parts of the Penasco pit while stripping is emphasized to ensure an economically optimal pit shell design to maximize the net asset value of the operation. By 2019, Penasquito's gold production is expected to benefit from an improvement in mined grades as it recommences mining higher grades at the bottom of the Penasco pit and significantly enhanced metallurgical recoveries with the planned completion of the recently approved PLP. Further information on PLP is described within the 'Project Pipeline Review' below. At the Northern Well Field project, 15% of the total fresh water production was commissioned by June 30 and the balance is expected to be completed by the end of the third quarter of 2016. Cerro Negro, Argentina (100%-owned) Vern Baker has been appointed Mine General Manager at Cerro Negro. Vern has more than 30 years of mining experience, including more than 10 years as Mine General Manager of multiple open pit and underground operations, working for Barrick, Teck and Antofagasta, among others. Vern holds a Bachelor's degree of Science in Mining Engineering from the Mackay School of Mines at the University of Nevada and an MBA from Stanford University. Second quarter gold production totaled 86,000 ounces at an AISC of $808 per ounce. Production decreased compared to the second quarter of 2015 as a result of lower mill tonnage processed due to the exhaustion of surface stockpiles which contributed significantly to mill feed in 2015. While underground ore production improved from 2015 levels, productivity was negatively affected by a large workforce reduction as part of the restructuring process that commenced during the second quarter. This reduction resulted in a five-day shutdown of the site in May. These reductions and other improvement initiatives, which have been undertaken in order to reduce the large labour productivity gap between this mine and the Company's North American operations, are expected to deliver approximately $65 million in annual efficiencies. The Marianas Complex Life of Mine Study is progressing and is focused on developing an optimal mine design, development execution plan and production schedule to maximize net asset value for Cerro Negro. The short-term plan is to enable ore development from Mariana Norte in 2017 to provide a third source of ore which would allow the mill to be operated at its designed capacity of 4,000 tonnes per day in 2018. During the second quarter of 2016, exploration continued to focus on resource and reserve expansion from surface drilling at the Marianas Complex, with 24,263 metres drilled at the Emilia and Mariana Norte Este B veins. Additional reserve expansion at these two zones has the potential to further enhance the value of synergies being developed by the Marianas Complex Life of Mine Study. The most significant result received to date at the Emilia Vein, which is interpreted to be a fault offset structure to the east of the Mariana Central mine, was in hole MDD-16041 which intersected 4.66 metres true width at 149.17 g/t Au and 858.2 g/t Ag in a step-out approximately 150 meters to the east of the December 31, 2015 inferred resource boundary. The most significant result received at Mariana Norte Este B was in hole MDD-16053 which intersected 15.47 metres true width at 31.22 g/t Au and 184.0 g/t Ag, in a step-out approximately 135 metres east of the main December 31, 2015 inferred resource body and 100 metres up dip of the nearest hole from the 2015 drilling program. Both of these holes are noteworthy in that they are step-out holes greater than 100 meters to the east of the December 31, 2015 inferred resource boundaries, represent grade thicknesses in excess of deposit averages, and additional ore grade results have been encountered in nearby holes. Pueblo Viejo, Dominican Republic (40%-owned) Second quarter gold production totaled 100,000 ounces at an AISC of $587 per ounce. Gold production increased compared to the second quarter of 2015 primarily due to higher grades. Silver production increased compared to the second quarter of 2015 primarily due to higher recoveries due to the preg-robbing characteristics of ore processed in 2015. Eleonore, Quebec (100%-owned) Second quarter gold production totaled 74,000 ounces at an AISC of $919 per ounce. Gold production increased compared to the second quarter of 2015 as a result of higher throughput and grades. AISC decreased as a result of substantially higher production. Higher tonnes processed were the result of greater tonnes mined as mining continued across four horizons compared to two in the second quarter of 2015. Higher grades were the result of improved stope designs after accounting for the folding and faulting of the ore body. The focus continues to be on optimizing stope designs to lower dilution. Work on the production shaft continued and is expected to be fully operational by the end of 2016, which will result in increased efficiencies and reduced operating costs. During the second quarter of 2016, exploration drilling was focused on the 494 area (below 650 metres) and tested the deep projection of the south and central portion of the deposit (below 1,000 metres). In the third quarter of 2016, exploration will be focusing on the 494 zone, on the deep projection of the south and central portion of the deposit and on the upper horizons (upper 650 metres). Red Lake, Ontario (100%-owned) Bill Gascon has been appointed Mine General Manager at Red Lake. Bill joined Goldcorp in October 2013 as the Mine General Manager of Musselwhite and under his leadership has significantly improved the profitability of the mine. He has more than 20 years of underground mining experience. He originally started his mining career as an underground miner and has progressed through to a senior operational leadership level by taking on roles of increasing scope and responsibility. Prior to Goldcorp he was the Underground Mine Manager at Barrick's Hemlo Operation. Second quarter gold production totaled 73,000 ounces at an AISC of $958 per ounce. Production decreased compared to the second quarter of 2015 due to lower grades processed and lower mill throughput. Production from the Upper Red Lake zones continues to increase with the completion of a more efficient material handling system and improved mining efficiencies through the conversion to bulk mining. As expected, lower grades and lower tonnes from the High Grade Zone and Campbell offset these improvements. Trade-off studies continued to advance on the rationalization of the infrastructure with results expected by year-end. During the second quarter of 2016, exploration drilling focused on the R Zone, Upper Red Lake and Far East and HG Young. Porcupine, Ontario (100%-owned) Marc Lauzier has been appointed Mine General Manager at Porcupine. Marc has held roles with increasing responsibility including Manager of Mining at Red Lake and Mine General Manager of Porcupine. His most recent role at Goldcorp was Vice President, Operational Support, Canada & US. Second quarter gold production totaled 73,000 ounces at an AISC of $844 per ounce. Production increased compared to the second quarter of 2015 as a result of higher grades and recoveries, offset by lower tonnes processed. Grades were positively impacted by increased Hollinger pit material displacing lower grade stockpile material and higher grades from Dome underground. Lower milled tonnes were due to the longer grinding time required for Hollinger material to optimize recovery as well as lower tonnes from Dome underground. The Dome underground has deferred closure activities, which were previously scheduled for mid-2016. With the recent increase in gold prices and operating cost reductions that have resulted in higher margins, the site is determining options to extend mine life. The Hoyle Deep project was completed early in the quarter and has allowed for more efficient movement of personnel and material to the lower levels of the mine. Since completion, travel time has been reduced by two hours per shift, and together with increased production levels in 2016 has resulted in an additional 100 meters of development per month. Further production increases beyond the current 1,000 tonnes of ore per day are expected as development expands and efficiencies from the new infrastructure are leveraged. Musselwhite, Ontario (100%-owned) Peter Gula has been appointed Mine General Manager at Musselwhite. Peter has over 27 years of mining experience. He has held a variety of roles increasing in responsibility during his career at Goldcorp. His most recent role was Operations Manager at Musselwhite. Peter received a mining diploma from Haileybury School of Mines, holds a Bachelor Degree in Mining Engineering from Laurentian University and is a Professional Engineer of Ontario. Second quarter gold production totaled 59,000 ounces at an AISC of $721 per ounce. Production was essentially unchanged compared to the second quarter of 2015. Following a decision to proceed with the Materials Handling Project, incremental production of approximately 20% is expected beginning in 2019. Further information on the Materials Handling Project is described within the 'Project Pipeline Review' below. PROJECT PIPELINE REVIEW Penasquito District Pyrite Leach Project (\"PLP\") (100%-owned) PLP was approved by the Board on July 27 and mobilization will commence in August 2016. The project is expected to increase overall gold and silver recovery by treating the zinc tailings before discharge to the tailings storage facility. Based on a feasibility study entitled \"Feasibility Study Report Penasquito Metallurgical Enhancement Project\" completed December 2015 by Fluor Canada Inc. (the \"feasibility study\"), the PLP is expected to recover approximately 40% of the gold and 48% of the silver currently reporting to the tailings. PLP is expected to add annual incremental production of approximately 100,000 - 140,000 gold ounces and approximately 4.0 - 6.0 million silver ounces. Commercial production is expected in the first quarter of 2019. Based on the feasibility study the project is expected to have an after-tax internal rate of return (\"IRR\") of approximately 17% at long-term gold and silver prices of $1,250 per ounce and $18.00 per ounce, respectively. Every $100 change in the gold price and $1.50 change in the silver price would impact the project IRR by approximately 2.5%. The expected capital investment of approximately $420 million will be funded over the next three years in the following amounts: Year Amount 2016 $40 million 2017 $270 million 2018 $110 million TOTAL $420 million PLP operating costs are expected to be approximately $1.75 per tonne. The project has a minimal impact on the site water balance and will not require upgrades to the water supply as the Pyrite Leach processing plant recirculates existing plant processing water. Camino Rojo (100%-owned) At Camino Rojo, located approximately 50 kilometres from Penasquito, the pre-feasibility study on the oxide resource continues to advance and is on track to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2016. Musselwhite Materials Handling (100%-owned) The Materials Handling System was approved by the Board on July 27. Mobilizing a contractor for additional development will commence in August and the winze raisebore construction is expected to commence in December. Currently, mining is at a depth below 1,000 metres under Lake Opapimiskan and the truck haulage distance is 7.5 km to the 400 mL underground crusher. This growth has resulted in a haul truck fleet size of 17 haul trucks, necessitating a more economical and practical means of transporting ore as the current ventilation system cannot support the additional haul truck fleet required to extend mine life. The project will enable hoisting of ore through an underground winze and associated infrastructure which will result in reduced reliance on high-cost truck haulage by significantly reducing uphill truck haulage between the winze and underground crushers leading to improved energy efficiency, reduced ventilation requirements, reduced mining costs, enhanced production profile and potential to extend mine life through exploration success. Based on an internal study, the project is expected to have an after-tax IRR of approximately 25% (exclusive of resources). Following completion of the winze, which is expected in the first quarter of 2019, incremental production of approximately 20% is anticipated and operating costs are expected to be reduced by approximately 10% for the life of the mine. The expected capital investment of approximately $90 million will be funded over the next three years in the following amounts: Year Amount 2016 $15 million 2017 $40 million 2018 $35 million TOTAL $90 million Borden (100%-owned) The Borden project, located 160 kilometres west of Porcupine, has the potential to further enhance the long-term economics of Porcupine. A pre-feasibility study is underway to determine the optimization of a combined Borden-Porcupine operation and is expected to be completed during the first quarter of 2017. An advanced exploration permit is expected to be received by late 2016 or early 2017 to allow for the construction of a ramp into the deposit and the extraction of a 30,000 tonne bulk sample, providing an underground platform for exploration drilling on a deposit that remains open at depth and laterally. Exploration for the second quarter of 2016 continued to focus on discovery of additional resources along strike from the known Borden deposit as well as on high potential targets away from the main ore body, both to the east and northwest to look for new zones in the regional land package. Red Lake (100%-owned) At the HG Young deposit, a high-grade exploration discovery near the Red Lake operation, a concept study is advancing and is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2016. Assuming a positive business case from the concept study, a pre-feasibility study is expected to commence in the first half of 2017 with a decline from surface that will provide access to the higher confidence areas for further exploration and bulk sampling. Exploration drilling has focused on increasing the confidence of the continuity of the mineralization and defining the plunge of the mineralization at 14 level. At Cochenour, the focus during the second quarter continued on exploration drilling. Drilling in the core area of the deposit (3,990 foot level) continues to increase data density and is moving to push the known mineralization downward toward the 5320 foot level. Sill development along the Upper Main Zone commenced on both the 3990 and 4060 foot levels with all the material being stockpiled for processing through a sample tower in the third quarter. A rigorous face sampling program was initiated this quarter and will allow reconciliation with the mined material. During the second quarter, one economic test stope was successfully mined on the 5320 level and the results were as expected. Further drilling, sampling and test mining is expected to be completed by the end of 2016. Coffee (100%-owned) Following the announcement of the closing of the transaction on July 19, 2016, the Company appointed Buddy Crill as Mine General Manager for the Coffee project. Buddy joined Goldcorp in April 2015 as the Energy Manager for the Latin America region. In July 2015, he accepted the role of Interim Director of Operations Support for the region to manage business improvement, supply chain, maintenance, and information technology/operations technology functions within the region. Prior to joining Goldcorp he was with Barrick in a variety of roles, most recently as the Asset Manager at the Pueblo Viejo Mine. Buddy holds a B.S. Electrical Engineering from the University of Idaho. The Coffee Gold project (\"Coffee\"), is a structurally hosted hydrothermal deposit located approximately 130 kilometres south of the City of Dawson, Yukon. Coffee is a high-grade, open pit, heap leach mining project located in a top tier mining jurisdiction. The Coffee land package, comprising over 60,000 hectares, demonstrates potential for near-mine discoveries, with mineralization remaining open along strike and at depth, and the potential for the discovery of a major new mineral system. An expanded exploration program will commence in August and the Company expects to invest $15 million in 2016 with a focus on exploration, permitting process, infrastructure upgrades and basic engineering. The Company has retained the core team of Kaminak geologists, including members of the initial discovery team to lead exploration activities. The drilling program is expected to follow-up on existing targets peripheral to existing resources and reserves, test potential gaps in the existing resource models and numerous near-surface oxide mineralization targets which have been identified with gold-in-soil anomalies while also investigating the potential for additional high-grade sulphide mineralization at depth. The permit application is expected to be submitted to the authorities in the Fall of 2016 based on positive consultations with First Nations. An Environmental Socioeconomic Assessment (ESA), Water Use License and Quartz Mining License will be permitted simultaneously. The Company expects permitting and construction activities to take four years with first gold production targeted for the end of 2020. Footnotes The Company has included non-GAAP performance measures on an attributable basis (Goldcorp share) throughout this document. Attributable performance measures include the Company's mining operations and projects and the Company's share from Alumbrera, Pueblo Viejo and NuevaUnion subsequent to the formation of the joint venture on November 24, 2015. Adjusted operating cash flows comprises Goldcorp's share of operating cash flows, calculated on an attributable basis to include the Company's share of Alumbrera, Pueblo Viejo and NuevaUnion's operating cash flows. The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, the Company and certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company's performance and ability to operate without reliance on additional external funding or use of available cash. In prior periods, adjusted operating cash flows was presented on an attributable basis before working capital changes to provide a consistent measure of the Company's performance of its core business operations as the Company, at times, can experience changes in working capital from one period to another. In the current quarter, the Company revised its presentation of adjusted operating cash flows to use operating cash flows as shown on the Company's statement of cash flows and adjusts it to include operating cash flows of the Company's associates. The Company believes this measure provides a better measure of cash available to the Company for financing and investing purposes. AISC include total production cash costs incurred at the Company's mining operations, which forms the basis of the Company's by-product cash costs. Additionally, the Company includes sustaining capital expenditures, corporate administrative expense, exploration and evaluation costs, and reclamation cost accretion and amortization. The measure seeks to reflect the full cost of gold production from current operations, therefore growth capital is excluded. Certain other cash expenditures, including tax payments, dividends and financing costs are also excluded. The Company believes that this measure represents the total costs of producing gold from current operations, and provides the Company and other stakeholders of the Company with additional information of the Company's operational performance and ability to generate cash flows. AISC, as a key performance measure, allows the Company to assess its ability to support capital expenditures and to sustain future production from the generation of operating cash flows. This information provides management with the ability to more actively manage capital programs and to make more prudent capital investment decisions. The Company reports AISC on a gold ounces sold basis. This performance measure was adopted as a result of an initiative undertaken within the gold mining industry; however, this performance measure has no standardized meaning and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company follows the guidance note released by the World Gold Council, which became effective January 1, 2014. The World Gold Council is a non-regulatory market development organization for the gold industry whose members comprise global senior gold mining companies. The Company has included a non-GAAP performance measure - total cash costs: by-product in this document. Total cash costs: by-product incorporate Goldcorp's share of all production costs, including adjustments to inventory carrying values, adjusted for changes in estimates in reclamation and closure costs at the Company's closed mines which are non-cash in nature, and include Goldcorp's share of by-product silver, lead, zinc and copper credits, and treatment and refining charges included within revenue. Additionally, cash costs are adjusted for realized gains and losses arising on the Company's commodity and foreign currency contracts which the Company enters into to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in by-product metal prices, heating oil prices and foreign exchange rates, which may impact the Company's operating costs. In addition to conventional measures, the Company assesses this per ounce measure in a manner that isolates the impacts of gold production volumes, the by-product credits, and operating costs fluctuations such that the non-controllable and controllable variability is independently addressed. The Company uses total cash costs: by product per gold ounce to monitor its operating performance internally, including operating cash costs, as well as in its assessment of potential development projects and acquisition targets. The Company believes this measure provides investors and analysts with useful information about the Company's underlying cash costs of operations and the impact of by-product credits on the Company's cost structure and is a relevant metric used to understand the Company's operating profitability and ability to generate cash flow. When deriving the production costs associated with an ounce of gold, the Company includes by-product credits as the Company considers that the cost to produce the gold is reduced as a result of the by-product sales incidental to the gold production process, thereby allowing the Company's management and other stakeholders to assess the net costs of gold production. The Company reports total cash costs: by-product on a gold ounces sold basis. In the gold mining industry, this is a common performance measure but does not have any standardized meaning. The Company follows the recommendations of the Gold Institute Production Cost Standard. The Gold Institute, which ceased operations in 2002, was a non-regulatory body and represented a global group of producers of gold and gold products. The production cost standard developed by the Gold Institute remains the generally accepted standard of reporting cash costs of production by gold mining companies. The estimated effective tax rate is on net income exclusive of share-based compensation, the effects of foreign currency translation of deferred tax balances, impacts of foreign exchange fluctuation on tax losses and deductions and balances and other discrete events. Cautionary Note Regarding Reserves and Resources Cautionary Note to United States investors concerning estimates of measured, indicated and inferred resources: The Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates contained in this news release have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the securities laws in effect in Canada, which differ from the requirements of United States securities laws and uses terms that are not recognized by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"). The terms \"Mineral Reserve\", \"Proven Mineral Reserve\" and \"Probable Mineral Reserve\" are Canadian mining terms as defined in accordance with the CIM -Definition Standards adopted by CIM Council on May 10, 2014 (the \"CIM Definition Standards\") which were incorporated by reference in NI 43-101. These definitions differ from the definitions in SEC Industry Guide 7 (\"SEC Industry Guide 7\") under United States securities laws. Under SEC Industry Guide 7 standards, a \"final\" or \"bankable\" feasibility study is required to report reserves or cash flow analysis to designate reserves and the primary environmental analysis or report must be filed with the appropriate governmental authority. In addition, the terms \"Mineral Resource\", \"Measured Mineral Resource\", \"Indicated Mineral Resource\" and \"Inferred Mineral Resource\" are defined in and required to be disclosed by NI 43-101; however, these terms are not defined terms under SEC Industry Guide 7 and are normally not permitted to be used in reports and registration statements filed with the SEC. United States investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of mineral deposits in these categories will ever be converted into reserves. \"Inferred Mineral Resources\" have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence, and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility. A significant amount of exploration must be completed in order to determine whether an Inferred Mineral Resource may be upgraded to a higher category. Under Canadian regulations, estimates of Inferred Mineral Resources may not form the basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies, except in rare cases. United States investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an Inferred Mineral Resource exists or is economically or legally mineable. Disclosure of \"contained ounces\" in a resource is permitted disclosure under Canadian regulations if such disclosure includes the grade or quality and the quantity for each category of Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve; however, the SEC normally only permits issuers to report mineralization that does not constitute \"reserves\" by SEC standards as in place tonnage and grade without reference to unit measures. Accordingly, information contained in this press release containing descriptions of the Goldcorp's mineral deposits may not be comparable to similar information made public by United States companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements under the United States federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements This press release contains \"forward-looking statements\", within the meaning of Section 27A of the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the United States Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and \"forward-looking information\" under the provisions of applicable Canadian securities legislation, concerning the business, operations and financial performance and condition of Goldcorp. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to the future price of gold, silver, copper, lead and zinc, the estimation of Mineral Reserves (as defined above) and Mineral Resources (as defined above), the realization of Mineral Reserve estimates, the timing and amount of estimated future production, costs of production, targeted cost reductions, capital expenditures, free cash flow, costs and timing of the development of new deposits, success of exploration activities, permitting time lines, hedging practices, currency exchange rate fluctuations, requirements for additional capital, government regulation of mining operations, environmental risks, unanticipated reclamation expenses, timing and possible outcome of pending litigation, title disputes or claims and limitations on insurance coverage.

A member of the S&P/TSX Composite Index and the S&P/TSX Global Mining Index, Hudbay is committed to high standards of corporate governance and sustainability. Mission To create sustainable value through increased commodity exposure on a per share basis, in high-quality and growing long-life deposits in mining-friendly jurisdictions. Competitive Strengths Growth in copper, gold and zinc production with exploration upside Consistent performance from reliable operations Disciplined and clear growth strategy already being executed Strong financial position Experienced management and operating team  Hudbay Announces Second Quarter 2016 Results July 27, 2016 TORONTO, ON -- (Marketwired) -- 07/27/16 -- HudBay Minerals Inc. (\"Hudbay\" or the \"company\") (TSX: HBM) (NYSE: HBM) today released its second quarter 2016 financial results. All amounts are in US dollars, unless otherwise noted. Summary: Increased production in both Peru and Manitoba across all metals compared to the second quarter of 2015 Cost efficiencies and economies of scale resulted in consolidated cash cost, net of by-product credits, of $0.83 per pound and all-in sustaining cash cost, net of by-product credits, of $1.42 per pound1 Operating cash flow before changes in non-cash working capital increased to $75.1 million, or $0.32 per share, from $17.0 million, or $0.07 per share, in the second quarter of 20151 Total liquidity increased to $293.5 million compared to $190.1 million at the end of the first quarter of 2016, including new commitments of $30.0 million under Hudbay's revolving credit facilities In the second quarter of 2016, cash generated from operating activities increased to $137.5 million from $10.4 million in the second quarter of 2015. In addition, operating cash flow before change in non -cash working capital increased to $75.1 million in the current quarter from $17.0 million in the same quarter of 2015. Operating cash flow in the quarter benefited from substantially higher copper and precious metals sales volumes due to the Constancia project reaching commercial production on April 30, 2015. The increase in sales volumes and associated economies of scale more than offset the decline in realized sales prices of copper and zinc metals compared to the same quarter last year. \"We continue to be pleased with Constancia's strong operating performance and the cost efficiencies achieved at all of our operations, resulting in positive free cash flow generated from the business,\" said Alan Hair, president and chief executive officer. \"We remain on track to meet the cost reduction initiatives we announced earlier this year, as well as our production, operating and capital cost guidance for 2016.\" The net loss and loss per share in the second quarter of 2016 were $5.7 million and $0.02, respectively, compared to a net loss and loss per share of $44.3 million and $0.19, respectively, in the second quarter of 2015. In the comparable period last year, there was an asset impairment charge of $19.9 million as a result of the decision not to proceed with construction of the new concentrator at Lalor following the acquisition of the New Britannia mine and mill. Net loss and loss per share in the second quarter of 2016 was affected by, among other things, non-cash deferred tax adjustments of $8.4 million or negative $0.04 per share. 1 Cash cost and all-in sustaining cash cost, net of by-product credits, per pound of copper produced, operating cash flow before changes in non-cash working capital, and operating cash flow per share are not recognized under IFRS. For a detailed description of each of these non-IFRS financial performance measures, please see the discussion under \"Non-IFRS Financial Performance Measures\" beginning on page 5 of this news release. Notwithstanding lower copper and zinc realized prices, revenues nearly doubled and gross profit increased more than ten-fold compared to the same quarter last year as a result of higher sales volumes and cost optimization at Hudbay's operations. As a result of production growth and ongoing cost optimization initiatives, consolidated cash cost, net of by-product credits, declined to $0.83 per pound of copper produced from $1.28 per pound in the second quarter of 2015. Similarly, incorporating sustaining capital, capitalized exploration, royalties and corporate general and administrative (\"G&A\") costs, consolidated all-in sustaining cash cost, net of by-product credits, declined to $1.42 per pound from $2.28 per pound in the second quarter of 2015 and $1.80 per pound in the first quarter of 2016. Sales of copper contained in concentrate lagged production in the second quarter of 2016 mainly as a result of a delay in loading a 20,000 tonne parcel of concentrate at the port of Matarani in Peru due to extended ocean swells in late June. Earnings per share and operating cash flow per share would have been approximately $0.02 and $0.05 higher, respectively, if this parcel had loaded prior to the end of the second quarter of 2016. Concentrate inventory at the Constancia mine site and the Matarani port are currently at normal working levels. During the second quarter, a Canadian chartered bank joined the syndicate for Hudbay's Canadian and Peruvian senior secured revolving credit facilities with $30.0 million in new commitments, bringing total commitments under the facilities to $530.0 million. Including this additional credit availability, cash flow generated from the business and collection of Peruvian sales tax refunds during the quarter, total liquidity at June 30, 2016 was $293.5 million, compared to $190.1 million at March 31, 2016. A semi-annual dividend of $0.01 per share was declared on July 27, 2016. The dividend will be paid on September 30, 2016 to shareholders of record as of September 9, 2016.

Peru Operations Review During the second quarter of 2016, Constancia mining operations and cost optimization continued as planned. Ore mined during the second quarter of 2016 slightly decreased compared to the first quarter of 2016 as ore production rates were aligned to mill throughput rates. Mined and milled copper grades in the second quarter of 2016 were 0.64% and 0.62%, respectively, which is slightly higher than the first quarter of 2016. Mill throughput during the second quarter of 2016 was affected by higher than expected liner wear in the semi-autogenous grinding (SAG) mills. The affected liners were successfully replaced in July 2016. Optimization of plant performance remains the primary focus for Constancia. Total copper recovery in the second quarter of 2016 was 82.7%, compared to 81.8% in first quarter of 2016, as the metallurgy associated with the varying ore types is better understood. During the second quarter of 2016, production of copper, gold and silver increased by 19%, 50% and 53%, respectively, compared to the first quarter of 2016. This growth is due to higher throughput, grades and recoveries at the mill. Combined unit operating costs for the second quarter of 2016 were $7.88 per tonne, within guidance expectations for 2016. Cash cost and sustaining cash cost, net of by-product credits, for the three months ended June 30, 2016 were $0.97 and $1.39 per pound of copper produced, respectively, a decrease of 16% and 7% from the first quarter of 2016, which reflects higher production and ongoing plant optimization and cost reduction initiatives. The port expansion at Matarani was completed at the end of June 2016, which improved access to Hudbay's designated pier and reduced port costs. Manitoba Operations Review Ore mined at Hudbay's Manitoba mines during the second quarter of 2016 increased by 17% compared to the same period in 2015 as a result of increased production at Lalor and 777. Copper grades were higher at Reed as a result of the stopes mined. This was offset by lower copper grades at the 777 and Lalor mines, as expected. Silver grades in the second quarter of 2016 were in line with the same period in 2015, while zinc and gold grades were lower than the second quarter of 2015 by 8% and 11%, respectively. Ore processed in the Flin Flon concentrator in the second quarter of 2016 was 17% higher than the same period in 2015 primarily as a result of higher production at the 777 mine. Gold and silver recoveries were higher in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 as a result of higher head grades, while zinc recovery was slightly lower due to lower zinc head grades. Ore processed in the Snow Lake concentrator in the second quarter of 2016 was 15% higher than the same period in 2015 as a result of higher production at the Lalor mine. During the second quarter of 2016, overall Manitoba production of copper, zinc, gold and silver were higher by 15%, 13%, 9% and 16%, respectively, as compared to the same period in 2015 as a result of higher mill throughput, offset by lower grades when compared to the same quarter in 2015. Manitoba combined mine, mill and G&A unit operating costs in the second quarter of 2016 were 18% lower than in the same period in 2015 as a result of higher overall production and ongoing cost reduction initiatives, and were in line with full year guidance expectations. Manitoba cash cost and sustaining cash cost, net of by-product credits, in the second quarter of 2016 was $0.37 and $1.10 per pound of copper produced, a decrease of 73% and 48%, respectively, compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease is largely the effect of decreased purchases of zinc concentrate for processing, a decrease in general support costs as a result of cost reduction initiatives, and a reduction in costs in US dollar terms as a result of the weaker Canadian dollar versus the US dollar. Cash cost and sustaining cash cost were also positively impacted by increased copper production and increased sales of precious metals. Non-IFRS Financial Performance Measures Hudbay's calculation of cash cost per pound of copper produced (\"cash cost\") designates copper as the company's primary metal of production as it has been, and is expected to be, the largest component of revenues. The calculation is presented in four manners: Cash cost, before by-product credits - This measure is gross of by-product revenues and is a function of the efforts and costs incurred to mine and process all ore mined. However, the measure divides this aggregate cost over only pounds of copper produced, Hudbay's primary metal of production. This measure is generally less volatile from period to period, as it is not affected by changes in the price received for by-product metals. It is, however, significantly affected by the relative mix of copper concentrate and finished zinc production, and an increase in production of zinc metal will tend to result in an increase in cash cost under this measure. Cash cost, net of by-product credits - In order to calculate the net cost to produce and sell copper, the net of by-product credits measure subtracts the revenues realized from the sale of the metals other than copper. The by-product revenues from zinc, gold, and silver are significant and are integral to the economics of Hudbay's operations. The economics that support Hudbay's decision to produce and sell copper would be different if the company did not receive revenues from the other significant metals being extracted and processed. This measure provides management and investors with an indication of the minimum copper price consistent with positive operating cash flows and operating margins, assuming realized by-product metal prices are consistent with those prevailing during the reporting period. It also serves as an important operating statistic that management and investors utilize to measure the company's operating performance versus that of its competitors. However, it is important to understand that if by-product metal prices decline alongside copper prices, the cash cost net of by-product credits would increase, requiring a higher copper price than that reported to maintain positive cash flows and operating margins. Sustaining cash cost, net of by-product credits - This measure is an extension of cash cost that includes sustaining capital expenditures, capitalized exploration and net smelter returns royalties. It does not include corporate G&A. It provides a more fulsome measurement of the cost of sustaining production than cash cost, which is focused on operating costs only. All-in sustaining cash cost, net of by-product credits - This measure is an extension of sustaining cash cost that includes corporate G&A. Due to the inclusion of corporate G&A, all-in sustaining cash cost is presented on a consolidated basis only. The table below presents a summary of cash cost and sustaining cash cost, net of by-product credits, by business unit in addition to consolidated all-in sustaining cash cost, net of by-product credits, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.

JUL 27, 2016 - 17:45 ET Lundin Mining Second Quarter Results TORONTO, ONTARIO--(Marketwired - July 27, 2016) - Lundin Mining Corporation (\"Lundin Mining\" or the \"Company\") (TSX:LUN)(OMX:LUMI) today reported cash flows of $153.2 million generated from operations in the quarter, not including the Company's attributable cash flows from Tenke Fungurume. A net loss attributable to Lundin shareholders of $791.2 million ($1.10 per share) for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, included an asset impairment on the Company's interest in Tenke of $772.1 million. Mr. Paul Conibear, President and CEO commented, \"Our operations continued to perform very well during the quarter, positioning us to meet or improve upon full year guidance on metal production, capital spending, and cash costs. Positive cash flow generated at all operations has enabled the Company to further strengthen our financial position, with our net debt improving by almost $100 million during the quarter. \"We are pleased to announce that we have received the first of two key approvals necessary to commence construction of the main Los Diques dam at Candelaria, and that the second is expected shortly. \"As we progress through 2016 and beyond, we intend to maintain focus on consistent high performance at our operations, cost efficiencies, capital discipline, and brownfields growth available at each of our operations. During the quarter, we reached a milestone with the announcement of a maiden resource for the Eagle East high grade nickel/copper deposit and access ramp development has commenced based on favourable study results.\" Summary financial results for the quarter and year-to-date: Three months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30, US$ Millions (except per share amounts) 2016 2015 2016 2015 Sales 342.3 501.3 711.9 1,032.8 Operating earnings(1) 134.5 243.0 286.3 517.0 Impairments (772.1 ) - (772.1 ) - Net (loss) / earnings (787.9 ) 53.7 (803.4 ) 137.0 Net (loss) / earnings attributable to Lundin shareholders (791.2 ) 46.4 (813.3 ) 118.1 Basic and diluted (loss) / earnings per share (1.10 ) 0.06 (1.13 ) 0.16 Cash flow from operations 153.2 262.7 196.1 486.6 Ending net debt position(2) 341.9 497.2 341.9 497.2 Operating earnings is a non-GAAP measure defined as sales, less operating costs (excluding depreciation) and general and administrative costs. Net debt is a non-GAAP measure defined as cash and cash equivalents, less long-term debt and finance leases, before deferred financing fees. * Highlights Operational Performance For the second quarter of 2016, production and cash costs(1) results were favourable as the Company continues with its production optimization and spending restraint measures, but financial results were negatively impacted by a lower metal price environment, when compared to the prior year. The Company remains on track to meet or exceed full year guidance across all operations. Candelaria (80% owned): The Candelaria operations produced, on a 100% basis, 36,907 tonnes of copper, approximately 345,000 ounces of silver and 22,000 ounces of gold in concentrate. As expected in this year's mine plan, copper production was 21% lower than the prior year comparable period due to lower head grades and recoveries. Copper cash costs of $1.28/lb for the quarter were marginally higher than the prior year, but better than full year guidance due to cost reduction plans, operational efficiencies, lower electricity and diesel prices, increased productivity, and higher sales volumes. Early works on the Los Diques tailings project continue under budget and on schedule. To date, approximately $25 million has been spent on the project in 2016 with a further $35 million expected over the remainder of the year. The existing tailings dam freeboard permit has now been granted, which enables an extra year of capacity in the existing facility. We are also pleased to report that Sernageomin, Chile's National Geology and Mining Service, has now approved the construction of the main Los Diques tailings facility. Subsequent approval from Direccion General de Aguas (\"DGA\"), Chile's General Water Directorate, is expected shortly now that the prerequisite Sernageomin approval has been received. Eagle (100% owned): Eagle produced 6,812 tonnes of nickel and 5,639 tonnes of copper in the current quarter, higher than the prior year comparable period for both metals due to higher head grades and recoveries. Nickel cash costs of $1.75/lb for the quarter were lower than the comparable period in the prior year and guidance due largely to cost control measures, excellent nickel and copper production results, and lower treatment costs. On June 29, 2016 a maiden Eagle East Inferred Mineral Resource estimate was announced. Given the positive results from a Preliminary Economic Assessment, a Feasibility Study has been initiated and construction of a development ramp has been approved. The Eagle East access ramp has been started, supporting the fast track approach adopted for the project. Neves-Corvo (100% owned): Neves-Corvo produced 12,146 tonnes of copper and 18,272 tonnes of zinc in the second quarter. Copper production was lower than the prior year comparable period due to lower mill throughput and lower recoveries, while zinc production in the quarter exceeded the prior year comparable period as a result of higher throughput, grades and recoveries. Zinc plant operations exceeded expectations year-to-date with stable, better than expected zinc recoveries. Copper cash costs of $1.49/lb for the quarter were marginally higher than the prior year comparable period, but lower than previous guidance ($1.60/lb). Zinkgruvan (100% owned): Zinc and lead production in the second quarter of 2016 were 19% and 4% lower, respectively, than the comparable period in 2015, partially as a result of lower throughput due to harder ore milled and lower zinc head grades in the current period. Cash costs for zinc of $0.34/lb for the quarter were better than both the prior year comparable period and previous guidance ($0.45/lb) due primarily to higher by-product credits. Tenke (24% owned): Tenke operations continue to perform well, generally meeting expectations for the quarter. Lundin's attributable share of second quarter production included 13,300 tonnes of copper cathode and 1,033 tonnes of cobalt in hydroxide. The Company's attributable share of sales included 13,539 tonnes of copper at an average realized price of $2.07/lb and 1,011 tonnes of cobalt at an average realized price of $6.58/lb. (1) Cash cost/lb of copper, zinc and nickel are non-GAAP measures defined as all cash costs directly attributable to mining operations, less royalties and by-product credits. Financial Performance Operating earnings for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 were $134.5 million, a decrease of $108.5 million in comparison to the second quarter of the prior year ($243.0 million). The decrease was primarily due to lower metal prices, net of price adjustments ($72.9 million) and lower sales volumes ($36.5 million). On a year-to-date basis, operating earnings were $286.3 million, a decrease of $230.7 million in comparison to the first six months of 2015 ($517.0 million). The decrease was primarily due to lower metal prices, net of price adjustments ($153.4 million), lower sales volumes ($64.7 million), and the shutdown of the Aguablanca operations ($28.4 million). Sales for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 were $342.3 million, a decrease of $159.0 million in comparison to the second quarter of the prior year ($501.3 million). The decrease was mainly due to lower metal prices, net of price adjustments, lower sales volumes ($70.7 million), and the shutdown of the Aguablanca operations ($24.7 million). On a year-to-date basis, sales were $711.9 million, a decrease of $320.9 million in comparison to the first six months of 2015 ($1,032.8 million). The decrease was mainly due to lower metal prices, net of price adjustments, lower sales volumes ($123.5 million), and the shutdown of the Aguablanca operations ($53.2 million). Operating costs (excluding depreciation) for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 were $202.2 million, a decrease of $49.4 million in comparison to the second quarter of the prior year ($251.6 million). The decrease was largely due to lower sales volumes ($34.2 million) and the shutdown of the Aguablanca operations ($13.3 million). On a year-to-date basis, operating costs (excluding depreciation) were $412.5 million, a decrease of $89.7 million in comparison to the first six months of 2015 ($502.2 million). The decrease was largely due to lower sales volumes ($58.8 million) and the shutdown of the Aguablanca operations ($24.8 million). Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense decreased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 when measured against the comparable period in 2015. The decrease was attributable to lower production in the current year at Candelaria and an increase in the Candelaria Mineral Resources & Reserves Estimate (Q2: $31.4 million, YTD: $55.2 million), and the shutdown of the Aguablanca operations (Q2: $6.6 million, YTD: $11.3 million). Cash flow from operations for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 was $153.2 million, a decrease of $109.5 million in comparison to the second quarter of the prior year ($262.7 million). The decrease was primarily due to lower operating earnings in the current quarter. On a year-to-date basis, cash flow from operations was $196.1 million, a decrease of $290.5 million in comparison to the first six months of 2015 ($486.6 million). The decrease was attributable to lower operating earnings in the current year ($230.7 million) as well as changes in non-cash working capital and long-term inventory ($73.9 million). During the second quarter, Freeport announced that it intends to sell its interest in Tenke. This was identified as an impairment indicator. The Company has re-estimated the recoverable amount of its interest in Tenke and as a result an impairment loss of $772.1 million was recorded in the period. Net loss for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 was $787.9 million compared to net earnings of $53.7 million in the second quarter of the prior year, primarily as a result of the impairment loss of $772.1 million, as discussed above. Before the impact of the impairment, net loss for the current quarter was $15.8 million, which was impacted by: lower operating earnings ($108.5 million); and  lower income from investment in Tenke ($9.8 million); partially offset by  lower depreciation, depletion and amortization expense ($42.3 million); and  comparative foreign exchange gains ($9.5 million).  On a year-to-date basis, net loss was $803.4 million, compared to the first six months of 2015 (net earnings of $137.0 million). Net loss in the current year was impacted by: impairment of investment in Tenke ($772.1 million); lower operating earnings ($230.7 million); lower income from investment in Tenke ($24.0 million); and comparative foreign exchange losses ($12.7 million); partially offset by lower depreciation, depletion and amortization expense ($79.8 million); and lower net tax expense ($22.8 million). Corporate Highlights * On May 9, 2016, Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (\"Freeport\") announced that it had entered into an agreement to sell its indirect interest in TF Holdings Limited (\"TF Holdings\") to China Molybdenum Co., Ltd (\"CMOC\"), which is subject to, among other things, Lundin's right of first offer. TF Holdings is the holding company that indirectly owns an 80 percent interest in Tenke Fungurume Mining S.A. Lundin has an indirect 30 percent interest in TF Holdings and an effective 24 percent interest in Tenke. On July 19, 2016, the Company announced that the period in which the Company has the right to acquire Freeport's indirect interest in TF Holdings had been extended to September 15, 2016 at 11:59 pm. The Company, in consultation with its legal and financial advisors, continues to evaluate all its options in connection with its ownership interest in TF Holdings. * On June 29, 2016, the Company announced a maiden Eagle East Inferred Mineral Resource estimate. Eagle East is located 2 km east and 650 metres below the Eagle mine deposit. The Company also announced the results of a Preliminary Economic Assessment that indicate that these Inferred Mineral Resources can potentially be mined with no significant changes to the current mine, ore transport, mill and tailings disposal infrastructure. Similar mining methods to Eagle are proposed and the potential mine production will significantly increase nickel and copper production from 2020 and extend the mine life to at least the end of 2023. Given the robust results of the Preliminary Economic Assessment, the Company has initiated a Feasibility Study on Eagle East, which is due for completion prior to year-end. In parallel, the Company has also commenced ramp development to Eagle East in order to fast track access to the deposit. Financial Position and Financing Net debt position at June 30, 2016 was $341.9 million compared to $441.3 million at December 31, 2015 and $438.1 million at March 31, 2016. The $96.2 million decrease in net debt during the quarter was largely attributable to operating cash flows of $153.2 million and receipt of distributions from Tenke of $14.6 million, partially offset by investments in mineral properties, plant and equipment of $38.8 million and net interest payments of $38.3 million. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, net debt decreased by $99.4 million due primarily to operating cash flows of $196.1 million and receipt of distributions from Tenke and Freeport Cobalt of $15.4 million and $6.3 million, respectively, partially offset by investments in mineral properties, plant and equipment of $86.3 million and net interest payments of $38.9 million. The Company has a revolving credit facility available for borrowing up to $350 million. As at June 30, 2016, the Company had no amount drawn on the credit facility, only a letter of credit in the amount of $19.1 million (SEK 162 million). Net debt at July 27, 2016 is approximately $385 million. Outlook Market Conditions Production optimization, cost saving and cost deferral programs remain in place, pending improvements in market conditions. As metal prices improve, spending restraint programs will be reassessed. 2016 Production and Cost Guidance Copper production guidance has increased to reflect higher than expected throughput at our Candelaria operations. Cash cost guidance has been lowered at our Candelaria, Neves-Corvo and Zinkgruvan operations, reflecting the expected full year impact of cost savings initiatives and overall operating performance improvements. Guidance on Tenke's cash costs reflect the most recent guidance from Freeport. 2016 Guidance Previous Guidance(a) Revised Guidance (contained tonnes) Tonnes C1 Cost Tonnes C1 Cost(b) Copper Candelaria (80%) 124,000 - 128,000 $1.45/lb 128,000 - 132,000 $1.35/lb Eagle 20,000 - 23,000 20,000 - 23,000 Neves-Corvo 50,000 - 55,000 $1.60/lb 50,000 - 55,000 $1.55/lb Zinkgruvan 2,500 - 3,000 2,500 - 3,000 Tenke (24%) 52,800 $1.32/lb 52,800 $1.28/lb Total attributable 249,300 - 261,800 253,300 - 265,800 Nickel Eagle 21,000 - 24,000 $2.00/lb 21,000 - 24,000 $2.00/lb Zinc Neves-Corvo 65,000 - 70,000 65,000 - 70,000 Zinkgruvan 80,000 - 85,000 $0.45/lb 80,000 - 85,000 $0.40/lb Total 145,000 - 155,000 145,000 - 155,000 Guidance as outlined in our Management's Discussion and Analysis for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Cash costs remain dependent upon exchange rates (forecast at EUR/USD:1.15, USD/SEK:8.30, USD/CLP:690) and metal prices (forecast at Cu: $2.10/lb, Ni: $4.00/lb, Zn: $0.80/lb, Pb: $0.75/lb, Au: $1,150/oz, Ag: $15.00/oz, Co: $11.00/lb). Prior guidance assumed exchange rates of EUR/USD:1.10 and USD/SEK:8.50 and metal prices of Zn: $0.75/lb and Co: $10.00/lb. 2016 Capital Expenditure Capital expenditures (excluding Tenke) for 2016 are expected to be $185 million. This is a $35 million reduction from the previous guidance and is largely the result of further project deferrals and cost savings measures at Candelaria and Neves-Corvo. The Company estimates its share of sustaining capital funding for 2016 at Tenke to be approximately $25 million, unchanged from previous guidance. All of Tenke's capital expenditures and exploration programs are expected to be self-funded by cash flow from operations. After capital expenditures, the Company expects to receive cash distributions from Tenke and Freeport Cobalt in 2016 of approximately $50 million to $60 million, in-line with previous guidance.

Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc. (TSE: POT) PotashCorp is the world's largest fertilizer company by capacity, producing the three primary crop nutrients: potash (K), nitrogen (N) and phosphate (P). We are the world's leading potash producer by capacity and our Canadian operations represent nearly one-fifth of global capacity1. To enhance our global footprint, we also have investments in four potash-related businesses in South America, the Middle East and Asia. With operations and business interests in seven countries, PotashCorp is an international enterprise and plays an important role in helping the world grow the food it needs. What we produce Our potash, phosphate and nitrogen products help provide the primary nutrients that crops need. They are also used to make livestock feeds and industrial goods. Produced from mineral deposits (potash and phosphate) and from the air we breathe (nitrogen), our main products are: potash, in standard and granular grades DAP (diammonium phosphate), MAP (monoammonium phosphate) and phosphoric acid Ammonia and urea Why fertilizer? With world population rising, arable land per person diminishing and demand increasing for higher quality diets that include more fruits and vegetables and protein from crop-fed livestock, the need to maximize the efficiency of farmland has never been greater. Every crop harvested removes nutrients from the soil, which must be replaced to keep soil healthy and productive. Responsible for more than 40 percent of the world's total crop yield, fertilizers feed plants, which help to feed animals and people. Where we serve Our products serve customers throughout the global marketplace from China, the world's most populous nation and largest fertilizer consumer, to India, with its 1.2 billion people. From Latin America an agricultural superpower to the rice and oil palm producing fields of Other Asian countries and the breadbasket markets of North America. Together these five regions account for nearly three-quarters of the world's population and roughly 80 percent of the total fertilizer consumption. Delivering when we're needed As the world's food challenges become more pressing, we're taking an active role in meeting them, investing heavily in our assets to deliver quality product when and where our customers need it. We are adding to our current potash capacity without building a new mine - an advantage as demand is expected to rise. And through our partnerships and investments, we strive to better serve customers in emerging markets. How we do business We hold ourselves to the highest business standards and consider factors beyond financial performance when evaluating our success. Guided by our Core Values, we cultivate mutually beneficial relationships with our communities, customers, employees, investors and other people critical to our success. Acting with a long-term view, we make decisions that consider people and the planet, always looking for opportunities to improve. JUL 28 2016 Q2: PotashCorp Reports Second-Quarter Earnings of $0.14 per Share Key Highlights Second-quarter earnings of $0.14 per share1, including: Share of Canpotex's2 Prince Rupert project exit costs of $0.02 per share Unfavorable discount rate adjustment to asset retirement obligations of $0.01 per share Impairment of investment in Sinofert Holdings Limited (Sinofert) of $0.01 per share Intend to reduce quarterly dividend by 60 percent to $0.10 per share Full-year 2016 earnings guidance lowered to $0.40-$0.55 per share, including: Notable charges through the first half of 2016 of $0.11 per share Third-quarter earnings guidance set at $0.05-$0.10 per share CEO Commentary \"Fertilizer markets have been under pressure through the first six months of 2016, however we believe the uncertainty that weighed on potash market sentiment is now lifting and a recovery is beginning,\" said PotashCorp President and Chief Executive Officer Jochen Tilk. \"With key Asian contract prices settled by a number of producers - and buyer inventories at reduced levels - we are seeing improved engagement in all key markets.\" \"This recovery process requires patience and we believe adherence to our strategy will continue to position us for long-term success. Consistent with our strategy, we have taken meaningful steps over the past 12 months to align our operating capability with expected market conditions and to reduce costs, including the suspension of potash operations in New Brunswick and production curtailments in Saskatchewan,\" said Tilk. \"This measured approach to markets and operations is also reflected in our approach to capital allocation. Protecting our balance sheet while maintaining a competitive dividend remains a top priority as it not only enables us to weather challenges like those experienced this year, but it also positions us to seize opportunities as we go forward. In that context - and with a need to balance the interests of our shareholders and debtholders - we intend to realign our quarterly dividend to $0.10 per share beginning with the declaration of our next dividend in September.\" \"With customer sentiment improving and announced industry shutdowns, we anticipate a more supportive potash environment through the balance of the year. Importantly, we see the potential for record demand in 2017 with annual shipments in the range of 61-64 million tonnes, as strong affordability incents farmers to replenish soil nutrients. We are positioned to benefit from an improved environment next year and we support Canpotex as they take a cautious approach to the Chinese and Indian markets, committing volumes only through the remainder of 2016.\" Saskatoon, Saskatchewan - Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc. (PotashCorp) reported second-quarter earnings of $0.14 per share ($121 million), resulting in first-half earnings of $0.23 per share ($196 million). Results for both periods trailed those in 2015 and included notable charges of $0.04 per share ($38 million) and $0.11 per share ($94 million), respectively. Gross margin for the quarter ($243 million) and first six months ($477 million) was below 2015 levels ($711 million and $1.4 billion, respectively), primarily due to weaker prices for all three nutrients and lower potash sales volumes to offshore markets. Cash from operating activities of $424 million for the second quarter and $612 million for the first half of 2016 were both well below prior year totals. Investments in Arab Potash Company (APC) in Jordan, Israel Chemicals Ltd. (ICL) in Israel, Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile S.A. (SQM) in Chile and Sinofert in China contributed $44 million to our quarterly earnings, bringing first-half totals to $66 million. These contributions were partially offset by a non-cash impairment charge of $10 million related to our investment in Sinofert. Totals for both the second quarter and first half trailed the respective amounts generated last year. The market value of our investments in these four publicly traded companies was approximately $3.8 billion, or $4 per PotashCorp share, at market close on July 27, 2016. Market Conditions Global potash markets were subdued in the second quarter. Despite healthy demand in North America and Latin America, delayed contracts in China and India, combined with cautious buying patterns in Other Asian markets, weighed on shipments. Spot prices declined from those in the first quarter, though they began to show signs of firming as market fundamentals improved at the end of the quarter. Nitrogen and phosphate markets also experienced near-term headwinds. In nitrogen, lower energy costs and additional capacity pushed benchmark prices for most products to multi-year lows, despite reduced Chinese urea exports and relatively strong global demand. In the US market, strong offshore imports and increased domestic supply put additional pressure on prices following the spring application season, especially for urea and UAN. Global phosphate prices also trended lower during the second quarter due to declining input costs, increased competitive supply and weaker Indian demand. Potash Potash gross margin of $123 million for the second quarter and $211 million for the first six months of 2016 reflected significantly lower prices and offshore sales volumes, as results in both periods fell short of 2015's respective totals of $417 million and $845 million. Sales volumes for both the quarter (2.1 million tonnes) and first half (3.9 million tonnes) were lower than those in 2015, down 16 percent and 20 percent, respectively. While North American volumes were up relative to last year's totals, a lack of engagement in key contract markets kept offshore volumes well below 2015 levels. China accounted for 7 percent of Canpotex's deliveries for the quarter while volumes to India were negligible. The majority of shipments were to spot markets in Latin America (47 percent) and Other Asian markets outside of China and India (37 percent). Our average realized potash price of $154 per tonne for the second quarter was down from $273 per tonne in the same period last year. This decline was driven by a weaker pricing environment and a $26 per-tonne charge to our average offshore realized price related to PotashCorp's share of Canpotex's Prince Rupert project exit costs. The decision not to proceed with development of an export terminal in Prince Rupert, British Columbia - and avoid potential capital expenditures - was, in part, supported by the recent availability of up to 2.5 million tonnes of storage and loading capacity at the Port of Saint John in New Brunswick. Optimizing production to our mines in Saskatchewan, combined with lower royalties and the favorable impact of a weakened Canadian dollar, reduced our per-tonne manufactured cost of goods sold to $91 per tonne for the second quarter compared to $105 per tonne in the same period of 2015. Nitrogen Weaker prices for all nitrogen products resulted in gross margin of $130 million for the quarter and $237 million for the first six months, a 41 percent decline from last year's comparable periods. Our US operations accounted for 77 percent of our nitrogen gross margin for the quarter, with Trinidad providing the remainder. Second-quarter sales volumes of 1.5 million tonnes marked an 8 percent decrease from the same period last year due to weaker North American industrial demand. Total first-half sales volumes were 3.2 million tonnes - 8 percent higher than the same period last year, primarily due to additional production at our recently expanded Lima facility. Weaker benchmark pricing lowered our average realized price to $244 per tonne during the quarter, compared to $334 per tonne in the same period last year. Cost of goods sold for the quarter was $160 per tonne, down from $201 per tonne in 2015's second quarter, driven primarily by lower natural gas costs in the US and Trinidad. Phosphate Weaker phosphate prices, and notable charges of $29 million related to inventory writedowns and an unfavorable discount rate adjustment to our asset retirement obligations, resulted in negative gross margin of $10 million for the second quarter. These factors led to first-half gross margin of $29 million, 78 percent below first-half 2015. Sales volumes of 0.5 million tonnes for the quarter and 1.2 million tonnes for the first six months were down 25 percent and 8 percent from 2015's respective periods due primarily to weaker North American demand. Our average realized phosphate price for the quarter was $485 per tonne, down from $553 per tonne in the same period last year as weaker demand weighed on prices for nearly all our products. Cost of goods sold of $506 per tonne for the second quarter was higher than the same period in 2015 as lower input costs were more than offset by a $19 million inventory adjustment and a $10 million unfavorable discount rate adjustment to asset retirement obligations. Financial Provincial mining and other taxes for the quarter totaled $26 million, down 71 percent from last year's corresponding period due primarily to lower potash prices. Due to reduced earnings, income tax expense declined to $24 million in the second quarter, down from $152 million during 2015's comparable period. Potash Market Outlook Following a prolonged period of market uncertainty and weakening fundamentals, we believe potash markets have reached their low point. Recently settled contracts in China and India and a reduction in inventory throughout the supply chain over the last six months are expected to support a more constructive environment. Much like recoveries seen after previous periods of delayed contracts, we anticipate stronger buyer engagement to support demand through the second half of 2016 with full-year estimates of 58-61 million tonnes. In North America, we anticipate improved affordability will help support deliveries for the rest of 2016. We expect shipments for the full year in the range of 9.2-9.7 million tonnes, up from the prior quarter's estimate and above 2015's total. In Latin America, favorable crop economics and agronomic need are expected to push 2016 shipments to 10.8-11.3 million tonnes - slightly above 2015 totals and in line with our previous guidance range. In China, we expect recently settled contracts and strong underlying consumption to support 2016 shipments in the range of 13.5-14.5 million tonnes, consistent with our previous estimates, but below 2015's record levels. While contract negotiations are ongoing, Canpotex expects to deliver tonnage to its Chinese customers in the second half of 2016. In India, we anticipate that an improved monsoon and lower farm retail prices will support improved potash consumption for the rest of the year, but due to weaker first-half deliveries, we have lowered our 2016 shipment estimate to a range of 3.7-4.2 million tonnes. Canpotex has reached agreements with its customers in India for shipments over the next three months with deliveries expected to begin in the weeks ahead. In Other Asian markets, adverse weather conditions and cautious buying patterns during the first half are expected to result in demand of 8.3-8.7 million tonnes for the full year, below our previous expectations and 2015's total as well. Financial Outlook While markets have stabilized in recent weeks and we continue to forecast our 2016 potash sales volumes in the range of 8.3-8.8 million tonnes, lower prices earlier in the year are expected to weigh on our results for the remainder of 2016. We now expect potash gross margin to be in the range of $400-$600 million. Similarly, we anticipate a weaker price environment to negatively impact our nitrogen and phosphate segments through the rest of 2016. We have lowered our combined nitrogen and phosphate gross margin guidance for the year to a range of $400-$550 million. Lower earnings have reduced our expected provincial mining and other taxes for 2016, now forecast in the range of 23-26 percent of potash gross margin (excluding $32 million of New Brunswick severance costs). Additionally, our effective income tax rate is expected to fall to a range of 16-18 percent given reduced earnings and a greater proportion of income from lower-tax jurisdictions. Anticipated selling and administrative expenses for the year have been lowered to a range of $220-$230 million. Due to the recent strength of the Canadian dollar, we have revised our full-year foreign exchange rate assumption to CDN$1.32 per US dollar. As a result of the noted changes, we have lowered our full-year 2016 earnings guidance to $0.40-$0.55 per share, including notable charges through the first half of $0.11 per share. For the third quarter, we forecast a range of $0.05-$0.10 per share. We also intend to reduce our quarterly dividend from $0.25 per share to $0.10 per share commencing with the declaration of our next dividend in September. All annual guidance numbers - including those noted above - are outlined in the table below. 2016 Guidance Earnings per share Annual: $0.40-$0.55 Q3: $0.05-$0.10 Potash sales volumes 8.3-8.8 million tonnes Potash gross margin $400-$600 million Nitrogen and phosphate gross margin $400-$550 million Capital expenditures* ~$800 million Effective tax rate 16-18 percent Provincial mining and other taxes** 23-26 percent Selling and administrative expenses $220-$230 million Finance costs $210-$220 million Income from offshore equity investments*** $120-$140 million Annual foreign exchange rate assumption CDN$1.32 per US$ Annual EPS sensitivity to foreign exchange US$ strengthens vs. CDN$ by $0.02 = +$0.01 EPS Does not include capitalized interest As a percentage of potash gross margin, excluding New Brunswick severance costs Includes income from dividends and share of equity earnings This release contains \"forward-looking statements\" (within the meaning of the US Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) or \"forward-looking information\"(within the meaning of appropriate Canadian securities legislation) that relate to future events or our future performance.

SILVER WHEATON ANNOUNCES SOLID START TO 2016 9 May 2016 VANCOUVER, May 9, 2016 /PRNewswire/ - Silver Wheaton Corp. (\"Silver Wheaton\" or the \"Company\") (TSX:SLW) (NYSE:SLW) is pleased to announce its results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2016. All figures are presented in United States dollars unless otherwise noted. Silver Wheaton realized the second best quarter ever in terms of production and sales volumes in the first quarter of 2016. Of note, Salobo once again reported record production, and, for the first time, Silver Wheaton sold over 65,000 ounces of gold in a quarter. Furthermore, operating cash flows increased 28% and revenues increased 44%, compared with Q1 2015. FIRST QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS Attributable silver equivalent production in Q1 2016 of 12.7 million ounces (7.6 million ounces of silver and 64,900 ounces of gold), compared with 10.3 million ounces in Q1 2015, representing an increase of 24%. Attributable silver equivalent sales volume in Q1 2016 of 12.8 million ounces (7.6 million ounces of silver and 65,300 ounces of gold), compared with 7.7 million ounces in Q1 2015, representing an increase of 65%. During the three month period ended March 31, 2016, payable silver equivalent ounces attributable to the Company produced but not yet delivered2 decreased by 0.9 million ounces to approximately 6.1 million ounces. Revenues of $188 million in Q1 2016 compared with $131 million in Q1 2015, representing an increase of 44%. Average realized sale price per silver equivalent ounce sold in Q1 2016 of $14.70 ($14.68 per ounce of silver and $1,175 per ounce of gold), compared with $16.90 in Q1 2015, representing a decrease of 13%. Net earnings of $41 million ($0.10 per share) in Q1 2016 compared with $49 million ($0.13 per share) in Q1 2015, representing a decrease of 17%. Operating cash flows of $114 million ($0.28 per share1) in Q1 2016 compared with $89 million ($0.24 per share1) in Q1 2015, representing an increase of 28%. Cash operating margin1 in Q1 2016 of $10.26 per silver equivalent ounce compared with $12.44 in Q1 2015, representing a decrease of 18%. Average cash costs1 in Q1 2016 were $4.14 and $389 per ounce of silver and gold, respectively. On a silver equivalent basis, average cash costs1 decreased to $4.44 compared with $4.46 in Q1 2015. Declared quarterly dividend of $0.05 per common share. On January 8, 2016, Silver Wheaton commenced an appeal in the Tax Court of Canada in relation to the Notices of Reassessment (the \"Reassessments\") issued by the Canada Revenue Agency (the \"CRA\"). In order to commence the appeal, Silver Wheaton was required to make a deposit of 50% of the reassessed amounts of tax, interest and penalties. Upon approval from the CRA, Silver Wheaton posted security on March 15, 2016, in the form of a letter of guarantee in the amount of Cdn$192 million rather than making a deposit in cash. Asset Highlights On March 21, 2016, the Company announced that it had entered into a definitive Early Deposit Precious Metals Purchase Agreement with Panoro Minerals Ltd. in respect to the Cotabambas project located in Peru. Events Subsequent To The Quarter On April 14, 2016, the Company completed a bought-deal common share financing, whereby a total of 38,105,250 common shares (inclusive of the underwriters' over-allotment option) of Silver Wheaton were sold at a price of $16.60 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds to Silver Wheaton of approximately $633 million. After deducting underwriter commissions, the Company raised total net proceeds of approximately $607 million, which was used to repay debt that was outstanding under the Company's $2 billion revolving credit facility. \"Silver Wheaton had a solid start to 2016, and the company is on track to realising its production guidance of 54 million silver equivalence ounces for the year,\" said Randy Smallwood, President and Chief Executive Officer of Silver Wheaton. \"With strong performances from the Salobo and Antamina mines offsetting a shortfall from the San Dimas mine, Silver Wheaton achieved its second best quarter ever of production and sales volumes. Production at the San Dimas mine was below expectations; however, it was related to Primero's efforts to enhance safety at the mine, an initiative that we fully support. Beyond our existing assets, Silver Wheaton continues to focus on acquiring new accretive streams from high-quality, low-cost mines. Having recently completed an equity offering, we believe that we are well-positioned to benefit from an environment that is ripe with opportunities.\" Financial Review Revenues Revenue was $188 million in the first quarter of 2016 on silver equivalent sales of 12.8 million ounces (7.6 million ounces of silver and 65,300 ounces of gold). This represents a 44% increase from the $131 million of revenue generated in the first quarter of 2015 due primarily to a 65% increase in the number of silver equivalent ounces sold, partially offset by a 13% decrease in the average realized silver equivalent price ($14.70 in Q1 2016 compared with $16.90 in Q1 2015). Costs and Expenses Average cash costs1 in the first quarter of 2016 were $4.44 per silver equivalent ounce as compared with $4.46 during the comparable period of 2015. This resulted in a cash operating margin1 of $10.26 per silver equivalent ounce, a reduction of 18% as compared with Q1 2015. The decrease in the cash operating margin was primarily due to a 13% decrease in the average realized silver equivalent price in Q1 2016 compared with Q1 2015. Earnings and Operating Cash Flows Net earnings and cash flow from operations in the first quarter of 2016 were $41 million ($0.10 per share) and $114 million ($0.28 per share1), compared with $49 million ($0.13 per share) and $89 million ($0.24 per share1) for the same period in 2015, a decrease of 17% and an increase of 28%, respectively. Balance Sheet At March 31, 2016, the Company had approximately $87 million of cash on hand and $1,371 million outstanding under the Company's $2 billion revolving term loan. On March 18, 2016, the Company's lenders extended the term of the revolving term loan by an additional year, with the facility now maturing on February 27, 2021. On April 14, 2016, the Company completed a bought-deal common share financing, whereby a total of 38,105,250 common shares (inclusive of the underwriters' over-allotment option) of Silver Wheaton were sold at a price of $16.60 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds to Silver Wheaton of approximately $633 million. After deducting underwriter commissions, the Company raised total net proceeds of approximately $607 million, which was used to repay debt that was outstanding under the Company's $2 billion revolving credit facility. The Company has repurchased 3,060,454 common shares under the NCIB at an average price of $13.81 per share, including 2,295,665 common shares repurchased during the three months ended March 31, 2016 at an average price of $14.43 per share. Update on CRA Dispute and Audit of International Transactions On September 24, 2015, the Company received Reassessments from the CRA totaling Cdn$353 million for federal and provincial tax, transfer pricing penalties, interest and other penalties for the 2005-2010 taxation years. The CRA's position in the Reassessments is that the transfer pricing provisions of the Income Tax Act (Canada) (the \"Act\") relating to income earned by the Company's foreign subsidiaries outside of Canada should apply such that the income of Silver Wheaton subject to tax in Canada should be increased by an amount equal to substantially all of the income earned outside of Canada by the Company's foreign subsidiaries for the 2005-2010 taxation years. Management believes that the Company has filed its tax returns and paid applicable taxes in compliance with Canadian tax law, and as a result no amounts have been recorded for any potential liability arising from this matter. Silver Wheaton intends to vigorously defend its tax filing positions. On January 8, 2016, Silver Wheaton commenced an appeal in the Tax Court of Canada. In order to commence the appeal, Silver Wheaton was required to make a deposit of 50% of the reassessed amounts of tax, interest and penalties. Upon approval from the CRA, Silver Wheaton posted security on March 15, 2016 in the form of a letter of guarantee rather than making a deposit in cash. The letter of guarantee is in the amount of Cdn$192 million, which includes interest accrued to-date plus estimated interest for the following year. The timing for the court process is uncertain. The CRA has also commenced an audit of the Company's international transactions covering the 2011-2013 taxation years, which is currently ongoing. The Company has not received any proposal or notices of reassessment for the 2011-2013 taxation years in connection with this audit. First Quarter Asset Highlights During the first quarter of 2016, attributable silver equivalent production was 12.7 million ounces (7.6 million ounces of silver and 64,900 ounces of gold), representing an increase of 24% compared with the first quarter of 2015. Operational highlights for the quarter ended March 31, 2016, are as follows: Salobo In the first quarter of 2016, Salobo produced a record 37,871 ounces of attributable gold, an increase of approximately 39% relative to the first quarter of 2015. This growth was primarily due to increased throughput resulting from the expansion to 24 million tonnes per annum, which commenced production in mid-2014. According to the Vale S.A. (\"Vale\") first quarter 2016 production report, Salobo is expected to continue to improve production throughout 2016 as rainfall decreases. Vale further reports that Salobo achieved the monthly production record for copper concentrate in March 2016, and is expected to reach its full production capacity in the second half of 2016. Penasquito In the first quarter of 2016, Penasquito produced 1.4 million ounces of attributable silver, a decrease of approximately 7% relative to the first quarter of 2015 due to lower grades being mined as part of mine sequencing. As disclosed in Goldcorp Inc.'s (\"Goldcorp\") first quarter of 2016 MD&A, the lower grades will persist through the year and a 10-day maintenance shutdown is scheduled in the second quarter. Goldcorp further reports that construction of the Northern Well Field project continued to progress during the quarter and is on track to be completed in late-2016. San Dimas In the first quarter of 2016, San Dimas produced 0.9 million ounces of attributable silver, a decrease of approximately 52% relative to the first quarter of 2015. As per Primero Mining Corp.'s (\"Primero\") first quarter production results, production at San Dimas was impacted by changes to the mining sequence which now includes the implementation of Canadian standards for ground support, and the condition that all employees will never work under unsupported ground. As a result, mill throughput was restricted to an average of 1,639 tonnes per day (\"tpd\") during the quarter. In April, Primero was successful in re-establishing operations above the current 2,500 tpd nameplate capacity. Primero further reported that the addition of ground support has resulted in a modified mine plan for the remainder of 2016, with the Company targeting higher grade stopes at slightly lower tonnes. Primero indicated that the 2016 operating plan does not require completion of the mill expansion to 3,000 tpd and as a result the project has been deferred. On February 3, 2016, Primero announced that its Mexican subsidiary had received a legal claim from the Mexican tax authorities, Servicio de Administracion Tributaria (\"SAT\"), seeking to nullify the Advance Pricing Agreement (\"APA\") issued by SAT in 2012. Primero has indicated in its MD&A for the first quarter of 2016 that it intends to vigorously defend the validity of the APA and that it has filed procedural and substantive responses to the claim. Antamina In the first quarter of 2016, Antamina produced 2.0 million ounces of attributable silver as higher grades and recoveries more than offset the impact of planned maintenance in the quarter. As a reminder, Silver Wheaton is guiding for 2016 production at Antamina to be approximately 5.5 million ounces. Sudbury In the first quarter of 2016, Vale's Sudbury mines produced 12,247 ounces of attributable gold, an increase of approximately 41% relative to the first quarter of 2015. This increase was attributable to higher grades (driven by increased production from the Totten mine), mill recoveries and throughput. Other Constancia: In the first quarter of 2016, Constancia produced approximately 3,435 ounces of attributable gold and 0.5 million ounces of attributable silver, an increase of 77% and 388%, respectively. These increases were due to the ramp up of the mine after commercial production was declared on April 30, 2015. Minto: In the first quarter of 2016, Minto produced 3,114 ounces of attributable gold, a decrease of approximately 18% relative to the first quarter of 2015, primarily due to lower grades and recoveries more than offsetting higher throughput. According to Capstone Mining Corp.'s (\"Capstone\") first quarter production results, mining rates and access to Minto North ore remained on schedule. 777: In the first quarter of 2016, 777 produced 8,275 ounces of attributable gold, a decrease of approximately 32% relative to the first quarter of 2015 primarily due to lower grades. Cotabambas: As per Silver Wheaton's news release dated March 21, 2016, the Company announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Silver Wheaton (Caymans) Ltd. (\"SWC\"), has entered into a definitive Early Deposit Precious Metals Purchase Agreement (the \"Cotabambas Early Deposit Agreement\") with Panoro Minerals Ltd. and its wholly owned subsidiary Panoro Trading (Cayman) Ltd. (\"Panoro\") in respect of the Cotabambas project located in Peru. SWC will be entitled to purchase 100% of the silver production and 25% of the gold production from the Cotabambas project until 90 million silver equivalent ounces attributable to SWC have been delivered, at which point the stream would drop to 66.67% of silver production and 16.67% of gold production for the life of mine. Under the Cotabambas Early Deposit Agreement, SWC will pay a total cash consideration of US$140 million plus an ongoing production payment. Once certain conditions have been met, SWC will advance US$14 million to Panoro, spread over up to nine years. Following the delivery of a bankable definitive feasibility study, environmental study and impact assessment, and other related documents (collectively, the \"Feasibility Documentation\"), and receipt of permits and construction commencing, SWC may then advance the remaining deposit or elect to terminate the Cotabambas Early Deposit Agreement. Produced But Not Yet Delivered 2 As at March 31, 2016, payable silver equivalent ounces produced but not yet delivered to Silver Wheaton by its partners decreased by 0.9 million ounces to approximately 6.1 million silver equivalent payable ounces, as decreases at Constancia, Minto, San Dimas, Zinkgruvan, and Yauliyacu more than offset increases at Sudbury, Penasquito, and Salobo. Payable ounces produced but not yet delivered to Silver Wheaton companies are expected to average approximately two months of annualized production but may vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of mining operation factors including mine ramp-up and timing of shipments. Detailed mine by mine production and sales figures can be found in the Appendix to this press release and in Silver Wheaton's consolidated MD&A in the 'Results of Operations and Operational Review' section. Sherritt International Corporation (S: TSE) Sherritt is one of the world's largest producers of nickel from lateritic sources with operations in Canada, Cuba and Madagascar. We pride ourselves on being a leading low-cost producer that generates sustainable prosperity for our employees, investors and the communities in which we operate. We are also the largest independent energy producer in Cuba, with extensive oil and power operations across the island. Sherritt Announces Q2 2016 Results July 25, 2016 TORONTO, ON -- (Market wired - July 25, 2016) - NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION TO UNITED STATES NEWSWIRE SERVICES OR FOR DISSEMINATION IN THE UNITED STATES Sherritt International Corporation (\"Sherritt\" or the \"Corporation\") (TSX: S), the world leader in the mining and refining of nickel from lateritic ores, today reported its financial results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016. \"Our Moa JV operations performed well in the quarter with a Net Direct Cash Cost (NDCC) of US$2.94/lb, making Moa one of the few HPAL operations globally to perform near the lowest quartile of cash cost,\" said David Pathe, President and CEO, Sherritt International. \"We are encouraged by the recent strengthening of the nickel price and continue to believe that having more than 60% of global nickel production underwater on a cash margin basis is not sustainable in the long term.\" \"We also made significant progress in the quarter in protecting our balance sheet as we reduced recourse debt levels and made progress on extending our bond maturities.\" Q2 HIGHLIGHTS (1) Nickel prices remained under pressure in the quarter, with reference prices averaging US$4.00/lb. Signs of a rally are emerging with news of Philippine mine shutdowns in process or expected with the new government environmental regulation. LME nickel prices have averaged US$4.60 per pound in July to date, up 30% from the low of US$3.50/lb in the first quarter. Gulf Coast Fuel Oil 6 prices increased by 47% from the average reference price in the first quarter this year. Net direct cash costs (NDCC) of US$2.94/lb at the Moa JV and US$5.12/lb at Ambatovy are both improvements on a year over year basis, despite Ambatovy's lower production. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at the end of the second quarter were $312.6 million, a drop of $57.3 million from the end of the first quarter. The main drivers were $17.4 million expended to repurchase debentures, $20 million in interest payments on the debentures, and lower than expected receipts from the Cuban energy business. Sherritt is in the process of extending the maturities of its debentures by three years to 2021, 2023, and 2025. The noteholder meeting to approve the transaction was held earlier today, and received the support of over 94% of noteholders, being more than 99% of votes cast as announced previously. A final court hearing for approval of the transaction pursuant to the CBCA proceedings is scheduled for July 27, 2016 and the transaction is expected to close on or about July 29, 2016. In July, the Moa JV commenced operation of the third acid plant, which is expected to further reduce NDCC by approximately US$0.50/lb starting in the fourth quarter this year, with the full benefit anticipated in 2017. OUTLOOK AND SIGNIFICANT ITEMS With better than expected Cuban oil production in the first half of this year, and the results of a successful workover in the second quarter, Cuba oil production guidance has been increased on both a Gross Working Interest (GWI) and Net Working Interest (NWI) basis, to 15,000 bopd and 9,200 bopd respectively. Production guidance for Ambatovy has been reduced to a range of 42,000 - 45,000 tonnes finished nickel and 2,900 - 3,300 tonnes finished cobalt (100% basis), in light of year to date production. Capital spending guidance has been reduced by US$7 million, as seismic processing activity in Oil & Gas that was originally expected to be performed on Block 8A has been deferred to 2017, while the focus remains on drilling the first well in Block 10 this year. All amounts are Canadian dollars unless otherwise indicated. (1) For additional information see the Non-GAAP measures section of this press release.

This is the main use of cash year to date. In addition, the cash balance has been reduced for negative working capital changes. Cuban overdue oil receivables have increased from approximately US$50 million at the end of 2015 to US$70 million at the end of June 2016, and discussions are underway regarding payment. Payments from Energas year-to-date have been allocated to repayment of cost incurred by Sherritt at the end of 2015 and current year pipeline construction. Interest and principal repayments on the outstanding CSA receivable in the Power business unit were a significant source of cash last year, and are expected to resume in the second half of 2016. The payment schedule, as disclosed previously, contemplates $34 million in principal and interest payments in 2016. Fertilizer cash flows tend to be weighted toward the second half of the year, when prepayments are received in advance of fertilizer deliveries (and revenue recognition) for the following year.

During the second quarter, $(12.5) million $(0.04) per share in adjusting items occurred, primarily a $12.6 million gain on the repurchase of $30 million principal value of 2018 debentures. This gain plus adjustments for Ambatovy VAT collected and $2.7 million in deferred consideration received in oil and gas pursuant to last year's North Sea asset sale was offset by a small unrealized foreign exchange loss and tax adjustments of $7.7 million, relating to the writedown of loss carry-forwards that are no longer usable at Moa Nickel.

Prices have recovered significantly from the lows of US$3.50/lb reached in the first quarter this year, but the price recovery has not been enough to change the fundamental problem of more than 60% of the world's nickel production being underwater on a cash margin basis. There are reports of nickel ore operations in the Philippines being shut down for violations, with potential further shutdowns in the coming quarter. As the Philippines has replaced Indonesia as the largest supplier of ore to the Chinese NPI industry, any reduction in ore shipments would be expected to directly impact NPI production, and the overall nickel supply. Cobalt Cobalt is marketed in two distinct forms, being metal (cathode, metal powders or briquettes) or chemical (cobalt hydroxide, cobalt sulphate, or intermediates). Cobalt metal supply has contracted in 2016 with the announced suspension of production from Votorantim (Tocantins) in Brazil. Indications are that the metal market is approaching balance or slight deficit, which has resulted in stabilized prices, with average reference prices in the second quarter this year being US$10.85/lb, a slight improvement over the US$10.70/lb of the first quarter. Overall cobalt demand is supported by the longer term outlook for cobalt in rechargeable batteries, a market that will utilize either metal or chemical forms of cobalt, with purity being an important factor in the decision-making. Superalloy demand also remains strong, along with other applications such as magnets, diamond cutting tools, soaps and paint driers which are growing but at a slower rate. As a result of the positive medium term outlook for cobalt, speculative interest has picked up adding to improved pricing. Moa Joint Venture (50% interest) and Fort Site (100%) Adjusted EBITDA of $6.7 million in the quarter is an improvement from the breakeven result in first quarter this year, but cash used by operations was negative $8.4 million in the second quarter, mainly due to seasonality and timing of cash received versus revenue recognized in the fertilizer business. Cash prepayments for fertilizer sales were received in the fourth quarter last year and to a lesser extent, the first quarter this year. Finished nickel production of 4,145 tonnes (50% basis) in the second quarter of 2016 was up from the comparable quarter a year ago reflecting a shorter planned annual refinery shutdown. The annual refinery shutdown also resulted in marginally lower finished nickel production than in the first quarter of 2016. Lower quality ore at Moa (increased deleterious elements in new mining concessions) coupled with some equipment reliability issues was the main cause of the lower mixed sulphide production in the first half this year. The impact of the lower mixed sulphides production in the first half was offset by processing third party feeds, which have been more cobalt-rich, and explain the 14% increase in cobalt production year over year. The NDCC of US$2.94 per pound of nickel in the second quarter of 2016 was a significant improvement over last year's comparable quarter, and reflects mainly lower mining, processing and refining costs (driven by lower fuel oil, sulphuric acid and sulphur prices) and a higher fertilizer credit. The fertilizer credit of $0.77/lb is significantly higher than the $0.42/lb credit in the second quarter of 2015, mainly due to the lower planned maintenance costs in fertilizer production as the annual shutdown this year was less extensive than last year's shutdown. Capital spending of $11.4 million in the quarter is down from its level a year ago consistent with plans to reduce spending. The expansion capital of $4.1 million (US$3 million) refers to the 50% share of the new Moa Nickel acid plant. Construction was completed in June, and commissioning activities have commenced, with first acid produced as announced last week. The acid plant was completed within the budgeted completion amount of US$65 million (100% basis). Ambatovy Joint Venture (40% interest) The Ambatovy Joint Venture senior debt financing of US$1.6 billion (100% basis) is non-recourse to the Joint Venture partners as a result of achieving financial completion in September 2015. As announced June 15, 2016, the Ambatovy Joint Venture financing lenders and the Ambatovy Joint Venture have entered into a temporary deferral agreement to defer the June 15, 2016 principal repayment due date to August 5, 2016. An agreement in principle has been reached on future principal payment deferrals. A semi-annual interest payment of US$28.0 million was made to the lenders during the three months ended June 30, 2016. Total cash funding provided by Sumitomo and KORES was US$21 million and US$72 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, pursuant to total cash calls of US$35 million and US$120 million for the same periods. Sherritt has not funded any portion of these cash calls, and continues not to fund. By agreement amongst the partners, Sherritt has not been considered to be a defaulting shareholder under the Ambatovy Joint Venture Shareholders Agreement as a consequence of such non-funding to date. However, new cash calls have been received for payment in early August and, while constructive discussions amongst the partners continue, in the event that a waiver is not agreed before the cash call due date, Sherritt would become a defaulting shareholder. Sherritt's unfunded amounts remain payable with accrued interest at LIBOR +3%. These amounts will be subtracted from future Ambatovy Joint Venture distributions, or may be set off against other amounts owed to Sherritt. Sherritt also has the option to pay the amounts in cash at any time, at Sherritt's election. Until the funding deficit is addressed, and subject to continued discussions with the Ambatovy partners, Sherritt will not exercise its Ambatovy voting rights. Sherritt continues not to fund further cash calls at this time due to the structure of the Ambatovy partner loans, which, at current nickel prices, effectively reduce Sherritt's 40% interest in Ambatovy to a 12% economic interest. Sherritt continues to serve as operator, as constructive discussions are ongoing between partners. Ambatovy production in the second quarter of 2016 was 9,050 tonnes finished nickel (100% basis), or 60% of design capacity, with PAL throughput in the same quarter of 976,765 tonnes or 67% of design capacity. Production was impacted by a tailings pipe blockage and subsequent decision to bring forward the planned third quarter total plant shutdown, as announced by press release June 24, 2016. This pipeline is a five kilometre span that transports tailings material from the plant to the tailings management facility. The blockage happened when thickened tailings slurry mixed with high concentrations of flocculent and lime and was then allowed to harden when an unplanned maintenance issue required a rapid shutdown of the tailings pumps. The blockage was cleared during the total shutdown, and preventive measures put in place to address any potential future process control events of this nature. In addition to this event, plant equipment reliability issues that characterized the first quarter 2016 operations also affected second quarter production. Some of these issues were addressed during the total plant shutdown and further capital projects and asset management processes are currently underway to further improve plant reliability. The total plant shutdown, originally planned for August this year, was brought forward in order to perform the required work on the air separation unit and hydrogen plant, along with inspections of pressure vessels in accordance with statutory engineering codes. These statutory inspections are required every three years, which eliminates the need for another total plant shutdown in the next three years, barring unexpected events. Other activities that were originally scheduled for the August planned shutdown will be postponed to 2017, but are expected to be performed during normal run time. Nickel production is ramping up since the re-start of operations, with July finished nickel production expected to be approximately 1,500 tonnes (100% basis). Taking into account year to date production, offset to some degree by no further planned major shutdowns for the balance of the year, production guidance has been reduced to 42,000-45,000 tonnes finished nickel (100% basis) and 2,900-3,300 tonnes finished cobalt (100% basis). Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter of 2016 was $(14.1) million compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $(1.7) million in the same quarter last year, due to the production shortfall and lower nickel prices. Even with the production shortfall in the second quarter, the second quarter 2016 NDCC of US$5.12 was an improvement year over year, largely due to sales out of inventory in the quarter which did not get shipped in the first quarter this year. Finished nickel sales in the second quarter were down only 0.5% from last year, compared to production being down 13%.

The quarterly average Gulf Coast Fuel Oil 6 prices improved by 47% from US$21.13 per barrel in the first quarter to US$31.02 per barrel in the second quarter this year, although a stronger Canadian dollar this quarter mitigated the impact to average realized prices reported in Canadian dollars. Both WTI and Gulf Coast Fuel Oil 6 prices remain weak, with second quarter 2016 WTI average prices down 21% from their comparable quarter last year, and Gulf Coast Fuel Oil 6 prices down 39%. The spread between Gulf Coast Fuel Oil 6 and WTI prices has narrowed modestly since the first quarter this year, when Gulf Coast Fuel Oil 6 prices averaged only 63% of WTI. In the second quarter, the spread narrowed, with Gulf Coast Fuel Oil 6 averaging to 68% of WTI, which is still historically low compared to average ranges between 70 - 85%. Gross working-interest (GWI) production in Cuba was a better than expected 16,200 bopd in the second quarter of 2016, down only marginally from first quarter 2016 production, due to better than expected performance from existing wells, helped by a successful workover in the quarter. GWI production is down 13% compared to the same period last year. With the better than expected production and a revaluation of the balance of the year, the Outlook for Cuba GWI production has been increased to 15,000 bopd from the original guidance of 14,500 bopd. Cuba net working-interest (NWI) production was 9,933 bopd in the second quarter this year, which was consistent with Cuba NWI production in the first quarter. Cuba NWI production guidance has been increased to 9,200 bopd from the original guidance of 8,900 bopd. Unit operating costs continue to be competitive, at $10.57 on a weighted average basis (boepd, all ops) and $9.30 per barrel on a Cuba GWI basis in the second quarter. On a three and six month basis, the oil business has been free cash flow neutral even in the current oil price environment; however, most of the capital expenditure this year is expected to fall in the second half as Block 10 drilling is expected to commence in the third quarter. The outlook for capital spending in 2016 has been reduced to the current US$27 million from US$34 million at the end of the first quarter, as exploration spending on future development outside of Block 10 has been deferred.

Unit operating costs increased significantly, due to the major inspection on a gas turbine at Boca de Jaruco that occurred in the second quarter this year. No gas turbine major inspections are planned for the second half of this year, although other scheduled major maintenance expenditures will impact unit operating costs in the second half this year. Quarterly unit operating costs fluctuate significantly between quarters, although the full year average unit operating costs for 2016 are expected to be similar to the full year average in 2015 of $21.00 per MWh. Production has been consistent on both a quarter over quarter basis, and year over year basis, and average realized prices are also consistent, excluding the impact of a weaker Canadian dollar in the first half of this year compared to last year. Spending on capital and service concession agreements so far this year relates to the construction of a new pipeline that will conserve gas that is currently being flared, which will be processed at the Puerto Escondido facility. The pipeline is scheduled to be operational in the fourth quarter this year. Free cash flow generation of $4.8 million in the quarter is low compared to its comparable quarter last year. The main difference in the quarter and in the first half this year is the absence of principal repayments and interest repayments received on the Energas conditional sales agreement. As disclosed previously, 2016 repayments are expected to be lower than 2015 due to higher capital spending while the pipeline is being constructed. Repayment in 2016 is expected to be $34 million based on a payment schedule that Energas provided at the beginning of the year. Discussions continue to address ongoing payments given the current liquidity concerns in Cuba. STRATEGIC PRIORITIES The table below lists Sherritt's strategic priorities for 2016. The 2016 Strategic Priorities reflect the continuing depressed commodity outlook and the Corporation's responsibility to preserve liquidity, continue to drive down costs, and execute rational capital allocation plans. Sherritt's purpose, originally communicated in 2014, continues to be a low-cost nickel producer that creates sustainable prosperity for our employees, investors and communities. Strategic Priorities   2016 Targets   Status           1 UPHOLD GLOBAL OPERATIONAL LEADERSHIP IN FINISHED NICKEL LATERITE PRODUCTION   Complete and commission the acid plant at Moa in the second half of 2016   Acid plant construction completed in Q2 and commissioning underway               Further reduce NDCC costs at Moa and Ambatovy towards the goal of being in the lowest quartile   Q2 NDCC of US$2.94/lb at Moa, and US$5.12/lb at Ambatovy               Increase Ambatovy production over 2015, despite the major maintenance work scheduled for Q3   Ambatovy production was lower in the first half this year due to planned and unplanned impacts               Maintain peer leading performance in environmental, health, safety and sustainability   Performance improved over 2015 and on track           2 EXTEND THE LIFE OF OUR CUBAN ENERGY BUSINESS   Allocate capital to new drilling on Block 10, with future drilling to be contingent on results from 2016 activity   Drilling is expected to take place in the second half, and exploration spending outside Block 10 has been deferred. Results from the first well in Block 10 will dictate next steps           3 PRESERVE LIQUIDITY AND BUILD BALANCE SHEET STRENGTH   Protect Sherritt's balance sheet and preserve cash   Recourse debt reduced by $81 million since end of 2015, and debenture maturities to be extended by 3 years in each series pending approval              Establish clarity on long-term funding of Ambatovy                 Run business units to be free cash flow neutral, and continue to optimize administrative costs   Ceased funding Ambatovy cash calls due to the \"40 for 12\" issue OUTLOOK 2016 PRODUCTION AND CAPITAL SPENDING GUIDANCE In 2016, Sherritt has made certain modifications to how guidance is presented. For example, capital spending estimates are presented in US dollars. In the quarterly reporting, actual capital spending is presented in Canadian dollars consistent with Sherritt's reporting currency, but estimates and forward looking information continue to be provided in US dollars. This change in presentation is intended to align with Sherritt's capital budgeting practices, and to mitigate the change to capital spending that arises from translation to the Canadian dollar reporting currency. In Sherritt's full year and Q4 2015 reporting, when guidance was first presented, the forecast exchange rate was Cdn$1.36 per US dollar. Capital projects in the Metals business are generally US dollar expenditures, while in Oil & Gas, the expenditures are roughly 50% Canadian dollar denominated and 50% US dollar denominated.

NON-GAAP MEASURES The Corporation uses combined results, Adjusted EBITDA, average-realized price, unit operating cost, and adjusted operating cash flow to monitor the performance of the Corporation and its operating divisions and believes these measures enable investors and analysts to compare the Corporation's financial performance with its competitors and evaluate the results of its underlying business. These measures do not have a standard definition under IFRS and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. As these measures do not have a standardized meaning, they may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other companies.

Teck Reports Unaudited Second Quarter Results for 2016 28 July 2016 Vancouver, BC - Teck Resources Limited (TSX: TCK.A and TCK.B, NYSE: TCK) (\"Teck\") reported profit attributable to shareholders of $15 million ($0.03 per share) compared with $63 million ($0.11 per share) a year ago. Adjusted profit attributable to shareholders was $3 million, or $0.01 per share, compared with $79 million, or $0.14 per share in 2015. \"While the commodity cycle continues to be challenging, we are starting to see some positive changes in the direction of zinc and steelmaking coal prices,\" said Don Lindsay, President and CEO. \"We are pleased with the performance of our operations, which have continued to reduce costs while maintaining production volumes. In addition, through recent transactions, we now have no substantial bond maturities for five years.\" Highlights and Significant Items Profit attributable to shareholders was $15 million and EBITDA was $468 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared with $63 million and $596 million, respectively, in the second quarter of 2015. Gross profit before depreciation and amortization was $536 million in the second quarter compared with $676 million in the second quarter of 2015. Cash flow from operations was $339 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared with $335 million a year ago. We extended the maturity of US$1.0 billion of our US$1.2 billion revolving credit facility by two years, from June 2017 to June 2019. We also issued US$1.25 billion of five and eight-year senior unsecured notes maturing in 2021 and 2024, using the proceeds to buy back notes maturing in 2017, 2018 and 2019. Our liquidity remains strong at $5.4 billion inclusive of $1.4 billion in cash at July 27, 2016 and US$3.0 billion of undrawn, committed credit facilities. Our cash balance is in line with expectations and, given current prices and exchange rates, we anticipate that we will exceed our original goal and end the year with more than $700 million. We continue to achieve significant reductions of our cash unit costs at our operations. Steelmaking coal unit costs, including transportation charges, decreased to CAD$76 (US$59) per tonne in the second quarter compared with CAD$83 (US$68) per tonne a year ago, while copper cash unit costs after by-product credits declined to US$1.34 per pound from US$1.49 per pound from a year ago. We have reached agreements with the majority of our steelmaking coal customers for the third quarter of 2016, based on a quarterly benchmark of US$92.50 per tonne for the highest quality product, and we expect total sales in the third quarter, including spot sales, to be at least 6.8 million tonnes of steelmaking coal. We expect our realized price as compared to the current quarterly benchmark to be consistent with the typical range we normally achieve. Construction of the Fort Hills oil sands project has surpassed 60% completion. In early July we acquired the 2.5% minority interest stake in our Highland Valley Copper mine for $33 million. We now have a 100% interest in the mine. We were named to the Best 50 Corporate Citizens in Canada ranking for the fourth consecutive year by media and investment research company Corporate Knights. The Best 50 ranks companies based on 12 sustainability metrics, including carbon productivity, gender leadership diversity, health and safety performance and pension fund quality. We have updated our production and cash unit cost guidance for 2016 as a result of our strong first-half performance. Steelmaking coal production is now expected to be 1.0 million tonnes higher and in the range of 26 to 27 million tonnes. Copper production is now revised to 310,000 to 320,000 tonnes. Mined zinc production is now revised to 645,000 to 665,000 tonnes, including co-product zinc production from our copper business unit. Cost of sales at our steelmaking coal operations are expected to be $42 to $46 per tonne, down from $45 to $49 per tonne. Copper unit costs after by-product credits are expected to be US$1.40 to US$1.50 per pound, down from US$1.50 to US$1.60 per pound.

Webcast Turqoise Hill Resources Ltd. (TSE: TRQ) Turquoise Hill Resources (TRQ: TSX, NYSE & NASDAQ) is an international mining company with copper-gold and coal mines in the Asia Pacific region. Principal assets: A 66% interest in Oyu Tolgoi, one of the world's largest copper-gold-silver mines now producing and shipping concentrate to customers in China. A 22.63% interest in established Mongolian coal miner SouthGobi Resources (SGQ: TSX, 1878: HK). Turquoise Hill announces financial results and review of operations for the second quarter 2016 VANCOUVER, CANADA - Turquoise Hill Resources today announced its financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. All figures are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated. HIGHLIGHTS Oyu Tolgoi achieved an excellent safety performance with an All Injury Frequency Rate of 0.13 per 200,000 hours worked for the six months ended June 30, 2016. On May 5, 2016, Oyu Tolgoi received the formal notice to proceed for underground development by the boards of Turquoise Hill, Rio Tinto and Oyu Tolgoi LLC. As part of the notice to proceed process, the 2016 Oyu Tolgoi Feasibility Study was approved. In June 2016, Oyu Tolgoi signed a critical contract with Jacobs Engineering Group to provide engineering, procurement and construction management services for underground development. Major contractor mobilization for the sinking of Shafts #2 and #5, underground development, critical construction works and maintenance are all progressing. As of June 30, 2016, Oyu Tolgoi had drawn down approximately $4.3 billion of the project finance facility and used all net proceeds to pay down shareholder loans payable to Turquoise Hill. Turquoise Hill deposited net project finance funds of approximately $4.2 billion with Rio Tinto in Q2'16. Oyu Tolgoi recorded revenue of $329.7 million in Q2'16, a decrease of 22.0% over Q1'16, reflecting mainly lower gold sales volumes. Turquoise Hill generated operating cash flow before interest and taxes of $161.6 million during Q2'16. For Q2'16, Turquoise Hill reported income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders of $29.8 million. In Q2'16, concentrator throughput was broadly consistent with Q1'16; resulting in average throughput of approximately 105,000 tonnes per day for the quarter Copper production in Q2'16 declined 10.3% over Q1'16 reflecting lower grades from reduced mining in Phase 2 and relative lower recovery from Phase 6 ore. As expected, gold production in Q2'16 declined approximately 52% over Q1'16, due to lower grades from reduced mining in Phase 2. Concentrate volumes sold in Q2'16 increased 6.7% over Q1'16. For Q2'16, Oyu Tolgoi's C1 costs were $1.12 per pound of copper and all-in sustaining costs were $1.55 per pound of copper. Sales contracts have been signed for essentially all of Oyu Tolgoi's expected 2016 concentrate production. Open pit, cash-basis capital expenditure for 2016 (excluding underground expenditure) is now expected to be approximately $200 million. Operating cash costs for 2016 are now expected to be $840 million. Turquoise Hill's cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2016 were approximately $1.5 billion. FINANCIAL RESULTS In Q2'16, the Company recorded net income attributable to owners of Turquoise Hill of $29.8 million ($0.01 per share) compared with net income of $24.9 million ($0.01 per share) in Q2'15, an increase of $4.9 million. Operating cash flows before interest and taxes in Q2'16 were $161.6 million compared with $239.2 million in Q2'15, reflecting the impact of reduced gold production and sales in concentrates. Capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment was $53.3 million on a cash basis in Q2'16, attributed to both underground prestart and sustaining capital activities. Turquoise Hill's cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2016 were approximately $1.5 billion. OYU TOLGOI The Oyu Tolgoi mine is approximately 550 kilometres south of Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia's capital city, and 80 kilometres north of the Mongolia-China border. Mineralization on the property consists of porphyry-style copper, gold, silver and molybdenum contained in a linear structural trend (the Oyu Tolgoi Trend) that has a strike length extending over 26 kilometres. Mineral resources have been identified in a series of deposits throughout this trend. They include, from south to north, the Heruga Deposit, the Southern Oyu deposits (Southwest Oyu, South Oyu, Wedge and Central Oyu) and the Hugo Dummett deposits (Hugo South, Hugo North and Hugo North Extension). The Oyu Tolgoi mine has initially been developed as an open-pit operation. A copper concentrator plant, with related facilities and necessary infrastructure to support a nominal throughput of 100,000 tonnes of ore per day, has been constructed to process ore mined from the Southern Oyu open pit. Long-term development plans for Oyu Tolgoi are based on a 95,000-tonne-per-day underground block-cave mine. In August 2013, development of the underground mine was suspended pending resolution of matters with the Government of Mongolia. Following signing of the Oyu Tolgoi Underground Mine Development and Financing Plan (Underground Plan) in May 2015 and the signing of a $4.4 billion project finance facility in December 2015, Oyu Tolgoi received the formal notice to proceed approval by the boards of Turquoise Hill, Rio Tinto and Oyu Tolgoi LLC on May 5, 2016. Preparation for underground development Prior to suspending underground construction in August 2013, underground lateral development at Hugo North Lift 1 had advanced approximately 16 kilometres off Shaft #1. Approximately 65 kilometres of lateral development is expected to be complete by the first draw bell. A total of approximately 200 kilometres of lateral development are planned over the life of Hugo North Lift 1. The following table outlines the shafts planned for underground development. Following the approval of the Underground Plan in May 2015 and the filing of the revised schedules for the statutory feasibility study with the Mongolian Minerals Council in August 2015, pre-start activities began. Prestart activities included ramp-up of the owners' and engineering, procurement and construction management (EPCM) teams, detailed engineering and procurement for equipment and materials required for necessary critical works that are key enablers for recommencement of underground development mining activity. In June 2016, Oyu Tolgoi signed a critical contract with Jacobs Engineering Group to provide EPCM services for underground development. Major contractor mobilization for the sinking for Shafts #2 and #5, underground development, critical construction works and maintenance are all progressing. A site infrastructure office has been established as well as project personnel being mobilized. In July 2016, Oyu Tolgoi signed a contract with mining services provider Thiess and Mongolian contractor Khishig Arvin for development of twin declines, incorporating both a service and a conveyor tunnel. Project finance and funding of Oyu Tolgoi by Turquoise Hill In December 2015, Oyu Tolgoi signed a $4.4 billion project finance facility for underground development provided by a syndicate of international financial institutions, export credit agencies representing the governments of Canada, the United States and Australia and 15 commercial banks. As of June 30, 2016, Oyu Tolgoi had drawn down approximately $4.3 billion of the project finance facility. Since the December 2015 signing, Oyu Tolgoi has used cash reserves to pay bank fees of approximately $0.2 billion. Steps are being taken to finalize the drawdown of the remaining amount. As part of the project finance facility, a debt cap of $6.0 billion for Oyu Tolgoi was agreed, which provides the possibility for an additional $1.6 billion of supplemental debt in the future. Net funding received by Oyu Tolgoi of approximately $4.3 billion was used to pay down shareholder loans payable to the Company. Oyu Tolgoi's proceeds from project finance funds were reduced by bank fees and withholding taxes of approximately $0.1 billion in line with contractual obligations. Approximately $4.2 billion was placed on deposit with Rio Tinto, in accordance with the cash management services agreement. The amount on deposit with Rio Tinto will be available for drawdown by Oyu Tolgoi as required for the development of the underground mine. In accordance with the Amended and Restated Shareholders' Agreement (ARSHA) dated June 8, 2011, Turquoise Hill has funded Oyu Tolgoi's cash requirements beyond internally generated cash flows by a combination of equity investment and shareholder debt. For amounts funded by debt, Oyu Tolgoi must repay such amounts, including accrued interest, before it can pay common share dividends. At June 30, 2016 after the project finance drawdown, the aggregate outstanding balance of shareholder loans extended by subsidiaries of the Company to Oyu Tolgoi was $2.8 billion, including accrued interest of $0.5 million. These loans bear interest at an effective annual rate of LIBOR plus 6.5%. In accordance with the ARSHA, a subsidiary of the Company has funded the common share investments in Oyu Tolgoi on behalf of Erdenes. These funded amounts earn interest at an effective annual rate of LIBOR plus 6.5% and are repayable, by Erdenes to a subsidiary of the Company, via a pledge over Erdenes' share of Oyu Tolgoi common share dividends. Erdenes also has the right to reduce the outstanding balance by making cash payments at any time. As of June 30, 2016, the cumulative amount of such funding was $751.1 million, representing 34% of invested common share equity; unrecognized interest on the funding amounted to $265.9 million. Feasibility study completion The 2016 Oyu Tolgoi Feasibility Study (2016 Feasibility Study) was approved in May 2016. The 2016 Feasibility Study is based on Oyu Tolgoi reserves. The 2016 Reserve Case includes mineral reserves from the Southern Oyu Tolgoi open pit and the Hugo North Lift 1 block cave. Turquoise Hill expects to publish an updated National Instrument 43-101 compliant independent technical report relating to the project in the second half of 2016. Highlights of the 2016 Feasibility Study are as follows. After-tax internal rate of return of 18% (NPV8% of $4.6 billion) assuming long-term copper and gold prices of $2.86 per pound and $1,201 per ounce respectively. With the exception of depletion from ongoing operations, there have been no material changes to the mineral reserve and resource estimates included in the 2014 Oyu Tolgoi Technical Report (\"2014 Technical Report\"). Nominal expansion capital of $5.3 billion ($5.1 billion 2016 real costs) for the underground project, which is broadly in-line with the $4.9 billion estimate (2014 real costs) contained in the 2014 Technical Report. Project assumes a five-year construction period, first sustainable underground production around 2021 and five to seven-year ramp up period. Underground mine targeted full production remains at 95,000 tonnes per day. The concentrator rate is planned at 40 million tonnes per annum. Additional details on capital expenditure for the total project capital costs between 2016 and 2054 in the Reserve Case are outlined below. Production from the first draw bell is expected in 2020. Underground operations are expected to begin with first sustainable production in 2021. Q2'16 performance Safety continues to be a major focus throughout Oyu Tolgoi's operations and the mine's management is committed to reducing risk and injury. Oyu Tolgoi achieved an excellent safety performance with an All Injury Frequency Rate of 0.13 per 200,000 hours worked for the six months ended June 30, 2016. Revenue of $329.7 million in Q2'16 decreased 22% over Q1'16 mainly reflecting significantly reduced sales of gold in concentrates driven by lower gold head grades. Production and delivery costs include primarily the cash costs in inventory sold as well as allocated mine administration costs. Depreciation and depletion includes the depreciation and depletion in inventory sold as well as any depreciation of assets used in the selling and delivery process, including the depreciation of capitalized production phase stripping costs. Q2'16 cost of sales were $237.1 million (Q2'15: $225.7 million) reflecting higher unit cost of production due to lower feed grade and lower recovery. Capital expenditure, on a cash basis, for Q2'16 was $53.3 million (Q2'15: $35.1 million) including amounts attributed to both underground (including pre-start) and sustaining activities of $36.5 million and $14.1 million respectively. Sustaining capital expenditure includes the tailings storage facility and deferred stripping. Total operating cash costs at Oyu Tolgoi in Q2'16 were $215.5 million. The 5% royalty payable to the Government of Mongolia is reflected as a cash operating expense; deferred stripping costs are not included in operating cash costs. Oyu Tolgoi administrative costs were $49.5 million reflecting increased management service fees incurred as a result of project finance drawdown during the quarter. Oyu Tolgoi's C1 costs in Q2'16 were $1.12 per pound, compared with $0.06 per pound in Q1'16. The increase was mainly due to lower gold sales, combined with lower copper production reflecting lower grades from reduced mining in Phase 2, and relative lower recovery from Phase 6 ore. All-in sustaining costs in Q2'16 were $1.55 per pound, compared with $0.66 per pound in Q1'16. The increase was mainly due to lower gold revenues and the impact of reduced copper production. Operational outlook Open pit cash-basis capital expenditure (excluding underground expenditure) in 2016 is expected to be approximately $200 million, compared with previous guidance of approximately $300 million. The reduction primarily reflects lower capitalization of deferred stripping following open-pit optimization to reduce waste. Operating cash costs in 2016 are now expected to be approximately $840 million, compared to the previous estimate of $800 million. The change reflects the impact of: deferred stripping reclassification as part of open-pit optimization and additional management service fees incurred in relation to project finance, offset by further cost rationalization and lower royalties due to lower gold sales in the second half of 2016. Sales contracts have been signed for essentially all of Oyu Tolgoi's expected 2016 concentrate production. CORPORATE ACTIVITIES Election of directors The nominees set forth in the Company's management proxy circular dated March 15, 2016 were elected as directors of Turquoise Hill at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders, which took place on May 3, 2016. NON-GAAP MEASURES The Company presents and refers to the following measures (non-GAAP measures) which are not defined in IFRS. A description and calculation of these measures is given below, and may differ from equivalent measures provided by other issuers. These measures are presented in order to provide investors and other stakeholders with a greater understanding of performance and operations at Oyu Tolgoi. Operating cash costs The measure of operating cash costs excludes: depreciation and depletion; exploration and evaluation; charges for asset write-down (including write-down of materials and supplies inventory), and includes management services payments to Rio Tinto, and management services payments to Turquoise Hill which are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements of the Company. C1 cash costs C1 cash costs is a metric representing the cash cost per unit of extracting and processing the Company's principal metal product to a condition in which it may be delivered to customers, net of gold and silver credits from concentrates sold. It is provided in order to support peer group comparability and to provide investors and other stakeholders with useful information about the underlying cash costs of Oyu Tolgoi and the impact of gold and silver credits on the operations' cost structure. C1 cash costs are relevant to understanding the Company's operating profitability and ability to generate cash flow. When calculating costs associated with producing a pound of copper, the Company includes gold and silver revenue credits as the production cost is reduced as a result of selling these products. Turquoise Hill's principal metal product is copper and C1 cash costs are reported for Oyu Tolgoi only. All-in sustaining costs All-in sustaining costs (AISC) is an extended cash based cost metric, providing further information on the aggregate cash, capital and overhead outlay per unit, and is intended to reflect the costs of producing the Company's principal metal product in both the short term and over the life-cycle of its operations; as a result, sustaining capital expenditure on a cash basis is included rather than depreciation. As the measure seeks to present a full cost of copper production associated with sustaining current operations, development project capital is not included. AISC allows Turquoise Hill to assess the ability of Oyu Tolgoi to support sustaining capital expenditures for future production from the generation of operating cash flows."}, {"title": "Canada : Agrium Reports Solid Second Quarter Earnings", "article": "Agrium Inc. announced today its 2016 second quarter earnings, with net earnings attributable to equity holders of Agrium of $564-million ($4.08 diluted earnings per share) compared to $674-million ($4.71 diluted earnings per share) in the second quarter of 2015. The reduction in net earnings this quarter was driven primarily by continued weakness in global nutrient prices. This was partially offset by solid demand for crop inputs, lower costs and strong margins within our ag-retail distribution business. Second quarter adjusted net earnings were $578-million or $4.18 per share (see page 2 for adjusted net earnings reconciliation)1. Retail earnings results were the second highest in history and in line with our guidance, due to strong margins which were supported by our proprietary product lines, lower costs and an increase in normalized comparable store sales.

These are non-IFRS measures which represent net earnings adjusted for certain income (expenses) that are considered to be non-operational in nature. We believe these measures provide meaningful comparison to the earnings of other companies by eliminating share-based payments expense (recovery), gains (losses) on foreign exchange and related gains (losses) on non-qualifying derivative hedges and significant non-operating, non-recurring items. These should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS and may not be directly comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Agricultural and Crop Input Fundamentals Agricultural prices were volatile over the past quarter. Crop prices increased through mid-June, driven by declining South American corn and soybean production estimates, but crop prices declined again in July due to higher than expected planted acreage and very favorable growing conditions across North America. There is potential for production of U.S. corn and soybeans to set record highs, barring a significant deterioration in growing conditions in August and September. While this has pressured crop prices, grower sentiment has been supported by the potential for strong crop yields and we expect robust fungicide and nutritional demand in order to preserve yield potential. Wet conditions across most North American growing regions have created an ideal environment for disease development and delayed herbicide applications. This factor and the desire by growers to protect strong yield potential are expected to support strong fungicide and herbicide demand this summer. Strong crop development this year is likely to result in high levels of nutrient removal from soils and is expected to support fall application demand. Nitrogen Nitrogen prices have been pressured due to slow demand from India and seasonal pricing pressure. Indian urea imports in 2016 have been 19 percent below last year's levels; however, the import pace is expected to improve in the second half of the year. Chinese urea exports were down 25 percent in the first half of 2016, as Chinese export prices have been uncompetitive with most international markets and domestic production has been declining continuously since March 2016. U.S. offshore urea imports over the past three months are down approximately 30 percent compared to a year ago as North American prices have been below import parity levels. Nitrogen buyers have managed inventories carefully entering a period when there is the potential for new capacity to come on-stream. We expect this will lead to pent-up demand becoming apparent closer to the North American seasonal application period. Potash End users have managed inventories carefully over the past year, which has pressured potash producer shipments but depleted inventory levels among end users globally. Deliveries in the second half of 2016 are expected to be supported by a number of positive factors, including the normal seasonal upturn in demand and the recent supply agreements with China and India which have provided increased certainty to the market. In Brazil, firm domestic crop prices have supported stronger than expected demand so far in 2016 and North American retail inventories are believed to be below average levels. We do not expect any additional capacity to come on-stream in the second half of 2016. Global effective potash capacity is now more than 2 percent below where it was in 2014, largely due to the recent capacity closures. Phosphate Indian diammonium phosphate (DAP) imports are down close to 40 percent in the first half of 2016, due partly to high domestic inventories at the beginning of the year. The weak Indian demand has been a source of pressure on the market; however, the demand outlook for the remainder of 2016 is more positive as the monsoon season progresses and reductions in the maximum retail price are expected to be positive for grower demand. Another source of pressure has been Brazilian phosphate imports, which have not improved from depressed 2015 levels. The demand outlook for the second half is positive given the firm crop price environment in Brazil and the fact that import demand for other nutrients has increased year-over-year. Chinese exports of DAP and monoammonium phosphate (MAP) were down 31 percent in the first half of 2016. We expect that the pace of Chinese phosphate exports will increase in the second half of 2016, but continue to be below 2015 levels. In the first half of 2016, the U.S. phosphate market was pressured by exports being down 15 percent and imports into the U.S. up more than 40 percent year-over-year. This was partly offset by production being lower and domestic shipments being higher than the first six months of last year. Similar to other products, we expect a return to a more normal fall application window to support strong second half U.S. phosphate shipments. 2016 ANNUAL GUIDANCE Based on our Market Outlook, Agrium expects to achieve annual diluted earnings per share of $5.00 to $5.30 in 2016 compared to our previous estimate of $5.25 to $6.25. We have lowered our annual guidance range due to an expected weak pricing environment for all nutrients, partially offset by expected continued strong performance by our Retail business and lower year-over-year costs. The second half 2016 diluted earnings per share range based on the annual guidance range is weighted over 80 percent to the fourth quarter. Our estimates of nitrogen and potash production remain between 3.5 million to 3.7 million and 2.3 million to 2.4 million tonnes, respectively. We are anticipating strong demand for Retail crop nutrient sales tonnes this fall and have narrowed our expectation for Retail EBITDA1 between $1.1-billion to $1.15-billion, and Retail nutrient sales tonnes between 9.8 million to 10.2 million tonnes. Our estimates for the Canada/U.S. foreign exchange rate and NYMEX for 2016 have been updated based on current market conditions. Guidance excludes the impact of share-based payments expense (recovery), gains (losses) on foreign exchange and non-qualifying derivative hedges. Volumetric and earnings estimates assume normal seasonal growing and harvest patterns in the geographies where Agrium operates.

(TSX: AGU) (NYSE: AGU) announced today its 2016 second quarter earnings, with net earnings attributable to equity holders of Agrium of $564-million ($4.08 diluted earnings per share) compared to $674-million ($4.71 diluted earnings per share) in the second quarter of 2015. The reduction in net earnings this quarter was driven primarily by continued weakness in global nutrient prices. This was partially offset by solid demand for crop inputs, lower costs and strong margins within our ag-retail distribution business. Highlights:  \"Agrium reported solid second quarter results driven by lower costs and strong margins across most of our business portfolio, supported by a stable cash flow from our retail operations. Our steadfast focus on operational excellence continues to deliver results and we believe our strategy and assets will create long-term shareholder value,\" commented Chuck Magro, Agrium's President and CEO. \"We also made excellent progress on our growth and innovation strategy this quarter. We surpassed the number of retail locations acquired annually over the past couple of years and have a full pipeline of acquisitions and new build opportunities remaining in 2016,\" added Mr. Magro. \"Our recent investment in Finistere supports our agricultural innovation and technology strategy which will be instrumental in meeting the challenge of feeding a growing global population, providing our customers with new products and solutions, and generating future earnings growth for shareholders,\" concluded Mr. Magro.

FINANCIAL CONDITION The following are changes to working capital on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015.  3 Aug 2016 17:30 ET Press Release: Agrium Reports Solid Second -6-  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Agrium generally expects that it will be able to meet its working capital requirements, capital resource needs and shareholder returns through a variety of sources, including available cash on hand, cash provided by operations, short-term borrowings from the issuance of commercial paper, and borrowings from our credit facilities, as well as long-term debt and equity capacity from the capital markets. As of June 30, 2016, we have sufficient current assets to meet our current liabilities. Summary of Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Below is a summary of our cash provided by or used in operating, investing, and financing activities as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:  Short-term Debt  Capital Management  SHARE REPURCHASES 3 Aug 2016 17:30 ET Press Release: Agrium Reports Solid Second -7- We are allowed to purchase for cancellation, on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) or New York Stock Exchange an aggregate of 6,908,450 common shares (5 percent) of our outstanding shares. Repurchases may be made under a Normal Course Issuer Bid (NCIB) approved by the TSX until February 18, 2017. The actual number of shares purchased will be at Agrium's discretion and will depend on market conditions, share prices, Agrium's cash position and other factors. There were no shares repurchased under the NCIB for the first half of 2016 or the period from July 1, 2016 to August 3, 2016. Shareholders can obtain a copy of the NCIB notice submitted to the TSX from Agrium without charge upon request. OUTSTANDING SHARE DATA Agrium had 138,175,400 common shares outstanding at July 29, 2016. At that date, the number of common shares issuable pursuant to stock options outstanding (issuable assuming full conversion, where each stock option granted can be exercised for one common share) was 937,528.  The agricultural products business is seasonal. Consequently, year-over-year comparisons are more appropriate than quarter-over-quarter comparisons. Crop input sales are primarily concentrated in the spring and fall crop input application seasons. Crop nutrient inventories are normally accumulated leading up to each application season. Our cash collections from accounts receivables generally occur after the application season is complete, and our customer prepayments are concentrated in December and January.

(Amounts are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated.) The reduction in net earnings this quarter was driven primarily by continued weakness in global nutrient prices. This was partially offset by solid demand for crop inputs, lower costs and strong margins within Agrium's ag-retail distribution business. Highlights: - Second quarter adjusted net earnings were $578-million or $4.18 per share(1); - Retail earnings results were the second highest in history and in line with Agrium's guidance, due to strong margins that were supported by Agrium's proprietary product lines, lower costs and an increase in normalized comparable-store sales; - Wholesale delivered solid operational results due to industry-leading nitrogen margins, higher overall production and sales volumes, and lower costs; - Agrium has acquired 33 retail locations with expected annual sales in excess of $230-million on a year-to-date basis. In addition to these completed transactions, Agrium is currently working on the completion of the Cargill and another retail acquisition, which together would add over 30 locations and represent over $300-million of expected annual sales. As a result, Agrium will easily surpass the pace of retail acquisitions over the past couple of years; - Agrium has invested $15-million into Finistere Ventures Fund II, a leading ag-tech venture fund focused on identifying and investing in early-to-growth-stage companies within plant nutrition, biologicals, seed technology, digital agriculture and novel farm systems; - Annual guidance range has been revised to $5.00 to $5.30 diluted earnings per share due to the weak outlook for nutrient prices (guidance assumptions and further details provided herein). \"Agrium reported solid second quarter results driven by lower costs and strong margins across most of our business portfolio, supported by a stable cash flow from our retail operations. Our steadfast focus on operational excellence continues to deliver results, and we believe our strategy and assets will create long-term shareholder value,\" commented Chuck Magro, Agrium's president and chief executive officer. \"We also made excellent progress on our growth and innovation strategy this quarter. We surpassed the number of retail locations acquired annually over the past couple of years and have a full pipeline of acquisitions and new-build opportunities remaining in 2016,\" added Mr. Magro. \"Our recent investment in Finistere supports our agricultural innovation and technology strategy, which will be instrumental in meeting the challenge of feeding a growing global population, providing our customers with new products and solutions, and generating future earnings growth for shareholders,\" concluded Mr. Magro. Note: - Effective tax rate of 27.5 per cent for the second quarter and first half of 2016 used for the adjusted net earnings and per-share calculations. These are non-IFRS (international financial reporting standards) measures that represent net earnings adjusted for certain income (expenses) that are considered to be non-operational in nature. Agrium believes these measures provide meaningful comparison with the earnings of other companies by eliminating share-based payments expense (recovery), gains (losses) on foreign exchange and related gains (losses) on non-qualifying derivative hedges, and significant non-operating, non-recurring items. These should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS and may not be directly comparable with similar measures presented by other companies. Market outlook Agricultural and crop input fundamentals - Agricultural prices were volatile over the past quarter. Crop prices increased through mid-June, driven by declining South American corn and soybean production estimates, but crop prices declined again in July due to higher-than-expected planted acreage and very favourable growing conditions across North America. There is potential for production of U.S. corn and soybeans to set record highs, barring a significant deterioration in growing conditions in August and September. - While this has pressured crop prices, grower sentiment has been supported by the potential for strong crop yields, and Agrium expects robust fungicide and nutritional demand in order to preserve yield potential. - Wet conditions across most North American growing regions have created an ideal environment for disease development and delayed herbicide applications. This factor and the desire by growers to protect strong yield potential are expected to support strong fungicide and herbicide demand this summer. - Strong crop development this year is likely to result in high levels of nutrient removal from soils and is expected to support fall application demand. Nitrogen - Nitrogen prices have been pressured due to slow demand from India and seasonal pricing pressure. Indian urea imports in 2016 have been 19 per cent below last year's levels; however, the import pace is expected to improve in the second half of the year. - Chinese urea exports were down 25 per cent in the first half of 2016, as Chinese export prices have been uncompetitive with most international markets and domestic production has been declining continuously since March, 2016. - U.S. offshore urea imports over the past three months are down approximately 30 per cent compared with a year ago, as North American prices have been below import parity levels. - Nitrogen buyers have managed inventories carefully, entering a period when there is the potential for new capacity to come on stream. Agrium expects this will lead to pent-up demand becoming apparent closer to the North American seasonal application period. Potash - End-users have managed inventories carefully over the past year, which has pressured potash producer shipments but depleted inventory levels among end-users globally. - Deliveries in the second half of 2016 are expected to be supported by a number of positive factors, including the normal seasonal upturn in demand and the recent supply agreements with China and India, which have provided increased certainty to the market. In Brazil, firm domestic crop prices have supported stronger-than-expected demand so far in 2016 and North American retail inventories are believed to be below average levels. - Agrium does not expect any additional capacity to come on stream in the second half of 2016. Global effective potash capacity is now more than 2 per cent below where it was in 2014, largely due to the recent capacity closures. Phosphate - Indian diammonium phosphate (DAP) imports are down close to 40 per cent in the first half of 2016, due partly to high domestic inventories at the beginning of the year. The weak Indian demand has been a source of pressure on the market; however, the demand outlook for the remainder of 2016 is more positive as the monsoon season progresses and reductions in the maximum retail price are expected to be positive for grower demand. - Another source of pressure has been Brazilian phosphate imports, which have not improved from depressed 2015 levels. The demand outlook for the second half is positive given the firm crop price environment in Brazil and the fact that import demand for other nutrients has increased year over year. - Chinese exports of DAP and monoammonium phosphate (MAP) were down 31 per cent in the first half of 2016. Agrium expects that the pace of Chinese phosphate exports will increase in the second half of 2016 but will continue to be below 2015 levels. - In the first half of 2016, the U.S. phosphate market was pressured by exports being down 15 per cent and imports into the U.S. up more than 40 per cent year over year. This was partly offset by production being lower and domestic shipments being higher than the first six months of last year. Similar to other products, Agrium expects a return to a more normal fall application window to support strong second-half U.S. phosphate shipments. 2016 annual guidance Based on its market outlook, Agrium expects to achieve annual diluted earnings per share of $5.00 to $5.30 in 2016, compared with its previous estimate of $5.25 to $6.25. It has lowered its annual guidance range due to an expected weak pricing environment for all nutrients, partially offset by expected continued strong performance by its retail business and lower year-over-year costs. The second-half 2016 diluted earnings-per-share range, based on the annual guidance range, is weighted over 80 per cent to the fourth quarter. Agrium's estimates of nitrogen and potash production remain at 3.5 million to 3.7 million and 2.3 million to 2.4 million tonnes, respectively. Agrium is anticipating strong demand for retail crop nutrient sales tonnes this fall and has narrowed its expectation for retail EBITDA (earnings (loss) from continuing operations before finance costs, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) to $1.1-billion to $1.15-billion and retail nutrient sales tonnes to 9.8 million to 10.2 million tonnes. Agrium's estimates for the Canada/U.S. foreign exchange rate and Nymex for 2016 have been updated based on current market conditions. This guidance and updated additional measures and related assumptions are summarized in the accompanying table. The guidance excludes the effect of share-based payments expense (recovery) and gains (losses) on foreign exchange and non-qualifying derivative hedges. Volumetric and earnings estimates assume normal seasonal growing and harvest patterns in the geographies where Agrium operates.

Eight states indicated that the corn condition had improved, 8 states indicated that the corn condition had declined, and 2 states indicated no change in the corn condition. Most of the improvements were found in the central Corn Belt while most of the declines were found in southern and northern states. The top five rated corn states are: Wisconsin, Colorado, Minnesota, Iowa, and Pennsylvania. The five lowest rated corn states are: Michigan, South Dakota, Kansas, North Carolina, and Texas. The corn crop just keeps rolling along in very good condition and it looks like the weather this week will once again be beneficial for the crop. The dry areas continue to shrink and I see no problem with pollination this year. Soybeans The condition of the 2016 U.S. soybean crop improved 1% last week to 71% rated good to excellent. Eleven states indicated that the soybean condition had improved last week, 5 states indicated that the soybean condition had declined last week, and 2 states indicated no change. Most of the improvements were found across the Corn Belt while most of the declines were found in the southern areas. The top five rated soybean states are: Wisconsin, Tennessee, Nebraska, Iowa, and Minnesota. The five lowest rated soybean states are: Arkansas, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri, and South Dakota. After a couple weeks of small declines, the soybean condition ticked higher this week with the abundant rainfall that fell last week across many of the previously dry areas. It looks like it is going to be another positive week for the soybean crop this week as well. Soil Moisture The nation's topsoil moisture improved last week with 16 states indicating improved soil moisture and only two states indicating declining soil moisture. The improvements were found all across the Corn Belt while the only two declining states were Louisiana and Ohio. The five states with the best soil moisture are: Kentucky, Minnesota, Illinois, Missouri, and Wisconsin. The five states with the worst soil moisture are: Arkansas, Mississippi, Michigan, Ohio, and South Dakota. The soil moisture improved after several weeks of declines. Improving soil moisture in the middle of July is very important in insuring adequate moisture during what could be the hottest time of the year. 2.3 March 31, 2016: Thompsons Limited: Canadian dollar tops 77 cents US [Company Release] Loonie hits highest value of the year above 77 cents US Source: March 30, 2016 CBC News The Canadian dollar rose above 77 cents US on Wednesday, a day after U.S. Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen brought the U.S. currency back down to Earth with her comments on the American economy. The loonie, as it's known, closed at 77.17 cents US, up by.68 of a cent. Earlier in the day the loonie was at 77.44 cents US, its highest level since October. The loonie's gain comes despite a slightly down day for oil, which lost three cents to trade at $38.25 US a barrel. U.S. dollar sliding on Fed comments The loonie has been gaining ground for more than 24 hours since Yellen reiterated Tuesday afternoon that America's central bank will only ratchet interest rates higher gradually. \"Just when the greenback was getting a renewed lift from Fed officials talking up an April rate hike, along comes the chair to put it and them in their place,\" BMO economist Sal Guatieri said. The greenback was slipping against both the euro and the yen as well as the Canadian dollar. A 59-cent loonie? It could happen this year, Macquarie says After bottoming out at a new 13-year low near 68 cents US earlier this year, the Canadian dollar has quietly staged a mini-rally and is now the best performing major currency in the world since January.

Meaning the JUL16 contract might now be nearing the upper end of it's range, possibly somewhere between our current price of $3.75 and $3.90 per bushel? There's also more talk that most commercials have satisfied their appetite for old-crop supply. Meaning the basis in many parts of the country may continue to fall under pressure in the days ahead, especially if flat-price continues to move higher. Many commercials are saying they will take old-crop bushels, but only at discounted rates as they seem content simply waiting on new-crop supply to enter the pipe-line. Make certain you are factoring this into your marketing strategy. Technically we also seem to be approaching more heavier resistance on the charts, in old-crop up between $3.80 and $3.90 per bushel, while in the DEC16 new-crop contract up between $3.95 and $4.05 per bushel. As you can see from the graphic I included below, producers are going to start jumping in the field at a rather aggressive pace. The planters are now officially rolling in parts of Arkansas, Kansas, Kentucky, Oklahoma, southern Missouri, Texas and Tennessee. I still think it's smart to start cleaning up old-crop bushels in an attempt to reduce longer-term downside risk exposure. Trust me when I say we have plenty of \"open risk\" we will need to deal with during the next 24 to 36 months.

Corn vs soybeans vs wheat The apparent trend lower in expectations for corn area comes ahead of a much-anticipated report next week, in which the USDA will update its forecasts using results from a farmer survey. And it follows underperformance by new crop December corn futures, appearing to offer some financial incentive for growers to switch to other crops. While December corn futures have appreciated by 2.7% this month, the key November soybean lot has risen by 5.0%, lifting the much-watched soybean:corn ratio to 2.37, from 2.32 at the start of the month. A higher ratio is seen as encouraging farmers to sow soybeans rather than corn. Minneapolis spring wheat futures for September have gained 4.5%. Above production costs However, commentators flagged too the support to corn as an option from reduced costs of production for a crop which has relatively high fertilizer needs. \"Even though corn prices are at multi-year lows, they are still above variable costs of production,\" Rabobank said. At Global Commodity Analytics, Mike Zuzolo said that the results of the group's survey show that \"lower nitrogen prices will keep corn acres ample\", even if below the USDA's initial estimate. The results came as Rabobank trimmed by $0.10 a bushel to $3.80 a bushel its forecast for spot Chicago corn futures in the April-to-June quarter, flagging the strong competition from South American exports, and the prospect for a rebound of 2m-3m tonnes in Ukrainaina shipments in 2016-17.

Source: Company Website 2.12 February 18, 2016: Thompsons Limited: All that confusion on seed treatments [Company Release] Some implications of Ontario's new neonic regulations are stunning. By Ralph Pearce, Country Guide, Production Editor As the calendar has turned to a new year, the news from seed and chemical companies is that there is considerable confusion about seed-applied treatments. Growers, they're finding, have been left with a mixed bag of information about the options available to them, much of which is flat out wrong. Some growers believed they had no seed-applied options at all, while others were confused about the levels of neonicotinoid seed treatments they could use. Some thought they could use 50 per cent, while others thought neonics had been banned altogether. It turns out the facts are a little more straightforward. In 2016, farmers will have four options: If planting untreated seed or fungicide-only treated seed, nothing has changed and there are no regulations requiring self-declarations or assessments. In 2017, the rules will change again. Option 3 will be gone entirely, and in order to use 100 per cent neonic-treated seed, growers will need to complete an integrated pest management (IPM) course and have IPM training certification to show the seed company as proof. In addition, the grower will need to sign a form saying they have considered IPM principles. That's over and above the required soil-pest assessment. The requirement for an independent pest assessment does not take effect until 2018, depending on the county where the grower lives. It's important to note that farmers can do their own soil pest assessments in this first year (2016). However, the paperwork must be in order and may be subject to audit. In future years, farmers will be required to conduct their own pest assessments under the supervision of a qualified pest assessor. Every second or third year, the assessment must be done by a qualified pest assessor. It's also important to note that a grower can use neonic seed treatments after qualifying with a plant-loss assessment. These assessments must all be done by a CCA. The primary online source for all of this information is ontario.ca/neonics. Storm clouds with a silver lining? Farmers are losing the option to freely treat both corn and soybeans with neonic-based treatments, and the cost could be significant. Yield losses in corn have been documented at anywhere from two or three bushels per acre to 20 on light-textured soils and in continuous corn operations. On top of that, they will also be losing some of the benefits of no-till planting and of early season planting, since neonic-based seed treatments have helped open up those opportunities in the past 10 years. On the other hand, the changes do mean that agriculture is having to look at other methods to control insect infestations - and there are some possibilities. Indeed, this is where best management practices (BMPs) and IPM guidelines could be a potentially useful refresher course of sorts. But the industry is warning there's no magic wand. Aphids mount their attack on this soybean plant. Photo: Tracey Baute, OMAFRA Aphids mount their attack on this soybean plant. Photo: Tracey Baute, OMAFRA \"I don't think that we're naive; we recognize that sustainability is going to work its way into our industry in a significant way - and that's fine,\" says Dave Baute, president of Maizex Seeds near Tilbury, Ont. \"Most growers will agree that a very slow and science-based approach to a phase-in of changes and policies is survivable. But if science isn't in the mix, we're in trouble.\" Baute is also concerned that fungicide treatments and Fortenza Maxim Quattro sometimes get pointed to as a viable substitute for neonic seed treatments. While Fortenza provides excellent activity on cutworm, European chafer and wireworm, for instance, it is registered for use on corn only, not on soybeans. Confusion remains For Stephen Denys, it's essential to clear up the confusion that's been created by what he calls a combination of poor government communications and a lack of foresight, on the one hand, as well as unfounded rumours about neonics. \"Coming into the fall, there was a percentage of farmers who were keeping track of this whole thing, but I would say the majority were not,\" says Denys, vice-president of sales and marketing with Pride Seeds in Pain Court, Ont. \"Some farmers were waiting to see if this was going to be a reality and some were relying on their suppliers, seed companies and retailers, and asking, 'What am I going to do?' Despite some efforts by the government, the majority of farmers just didn't understand the impact that this is going to have on their operation.\" From Baute's viewpoint, those numbers shake out with a third of farmers who know little or nothing of the situation, a third who are aware but haven't attended one of the information sessions, and the final third, often the larger-scale producers, who are relying on the seed sector for help and direction. \"There's a big range, and everyone has different ideas as to what they want to do or need to do,\" says Baute. \"It has really fallen into the laps of the seed companies to do the job of the government.\" In hindsight The province did hold a number of information sessions, but not to Denys's liking. He believes more of an effort could have been made to communicate to growers at the grassroots level, including on a county level instead of just three or four meetings across the province. \"We do know - some would say by design, some would say by coincidence - that when the consultations for these regulations were happening and when input was needed, farmers were planting,\" says Denys. \"And the experts are saying you can do the pest assessment in the fall but the best time to do it is in the spring, when insects can do damage to the seed or seedling, and at that point it wasn't a law. So farmers have been put behind the eight ball because of the timing.\" The long-term impacts beyond 2016 or 2017 are also not well understood, according to Denys. In spite of what he refers to as a \"common goal\" with the minister of the environment and climate change (i.e. leaving the land in better shape than when it was found), he says the respective approaches are completely different. Instead of bringing regulations which are manageable from the producer's standpoint - as has been done before - he charges that the government instituted a ban without calling it a ban. \"There was no consideration of the impact this has had outside of the mechanics of controlling insects,\" Denys alleges. \"In other words, we asked the government repeatedly, 'Have you thought about the impact this will have on crop insurance, long-term? Have you thought about the impact this will have on what growers will have to use as alternatives?' And repeatedly, we were looking into blank stares from people across the table.\" Baute agrees, and says the science shows that the key issue is unintended dust-off at planting. It's a concern, he says. It's even a \"red flag,\" but he says it's also being addressed and it's fixable. \"It's unfortunate that politics and public opinion rule the day,\" says Baute. \"Our focus should be on best management practices, and that's all we need when planting any treated seed, to limit unintended exposure to the environment. We're light-years down the road from where we were in 2012 when this whole mess started.\" It's also worth mentioning that many issues have been addressed. Seed coatings and polymers have reduced seed treatment losses, and there's also the fluency agent with its guidelines pertaining to negative pressure (vacuum) planters, and deflector kits that are now available - both as factory-installed units and in after-market kits. Best of all, the response was quick and it was initiated and carried out within the agri-business industry. \"What's really significant - and nobody talks about this - is that for the first time, growers recognized that there was something coming off their planter that impacts things downwind,\" says Baute. \"Growers do the right thing - there's not a grower in the province who would intentionally impact a bee colony if they knew it was there, and if whatever they were applying was blowing towards them.\" Baute has talked about this at meetings, yet there is no comprehensive means of identifying and monitoring the location of beehives in Ontario. That opens the possibility that growers will refuse to allow beekeepers to locate hives on their land. But that's not a real solution either. If we could go back in time, Baute says, and if there was awareness of where the beehives were, and who the beekeepers are, growers would ensure there is a dialogue and some form of advanced notice as to when planting is taking place. That way, beekeepers could cover their hives for two days, and likely see little if any impact. Or they could use an idea of Baute's, to fund some sort of marker - say a candy-cane post supplied by beekeepers - and they put that at the field's edge nearest where they have hives. That would be the universal sign that there are beehives in the area. One final note Baute is also hearing a sad and disturbing statement from growers, usually through his staff: for older growers, this may be the tipping point that convinces them to leave the industry. And the implications of this aren't well understood by those outside of the agri-food sector, including politicians. \"There's not a day goes by,\" Baute says, \"that somebody on our team doesn't hear a 65-year-old, 200-acre farmer say, 'You know what? I'm done; I had been planning on going for several more years, but if it's this difficult and if the general public don't appreciate what we're doing, I'm done.'\" Source: Company Website 2.13 January 29, 2016: Thompsons Limited: Soybean Storage and Conditioning [Company Release] Now that your crops are in the bin, it's important to learn how to keep them conditioned and stored properly. Throughout the winter months it's important to monitor your soybean temperature, and to aerate your bins. If you haven't sold any beans then coring out your bin can be an option to remove some fines, and help stir the grain a bit. It is important to make sure that soybeans are stored at a 14% moisture or lower. Don't assume that because your beans went into the bin really dry, you don't have to aerate. Those low moisture beans are still hot and need to have the field heat removed. When should you run the fan? Air temperature and relative humidity levels are the two most important things you need to focus on when dealing with your fanning operation. It is important to check both of these things constantly throughout the day so you know how long to run the fan. In order to have effective drying the outside air has to be drier than the inside air. The fan operation is limited to temperature and relative humidity levels. On some days, drying can be accomplished from 9 AM until midnight, while on others it may only be from 9 AM to 6 PM or sometimes even shorter. Times will change depending on size of bin, amount of grain, etc. It is important to remember that the beans at the top of the bin will usually be the last to dry, and sometimes can have the highest moisture levels from drying, or if you have been aerating in the past. Important tips for winter storage of soybeans: Aerate stored soybeans to maintain grain temperature between 40 F to 45 F (4.4 C to 7.2 C) in the winter. These temperatures reduce mold, insect activity and moisture movement within the bin Check stored soybeans for heating or spoilage every two weeks in cold weather. In addition, conduct periodic germination tests to monitor viability of seed beans Monitor grain and aerate monthly to maintain uniform temperature and moisture levels throughout. Aerate more often if moisture or temperatures increase For winter storage, store beans at 13% moisture or less Get the cone off the top of the bin (most times that is where there will be problems as air will take the easiest route and not go to the top of the cone. If you have bins with no heat cables, keep an eye on bin roofs for snow or frost. A quick visual check whenever possible may save a bin. When running fans remember that soybeans have 25% less airflow resistance than corn, so fans sized for corn drying will produce greater airflow through soybeans. This means that cooling will occur quicker Growers can also use a 6' or 10' probe to collect samples from various depths at bin center and outwards and then monitor moisture and temperature with a hand-held meter. Sensors can also be hung on cables in bins, allowing growers to track moisture and temperature and look for hot spots. By checking stored grain weekly, growers can identify problems before they become unmanageable. Even grain in good condition in the fall can develop problems over the winter. Soybean seed stored over the next planting season should be held at 12% moisture or less If heating, mold or foul odors occur, unload the bin and sell. It is a common practice to pull out a load from the core of the bin where grain tends to stay moist and overheat BinSafety Estimated aeration cooling and warming cycles (hours) Aeration fan timing depends largely on the airflow (cubic feet per minute [cfm] per bushel) produced by the aeration fan(s). It is recommended that air be pushed from the bottom to the top of the grain and the temperature of the grain be monitored in the headspace area to determine when the cooling/warming front reached the top of the grain. Once desired grain temperature has been reached, temperature should remain fairly stable in the grain mass because grain is an excellent insulator as long as there are no air movements through the grain mass. Thus, after each aeration cycle is complete, the aeration fan should be blocked off to prevent unwanted air flows. Soybean_dryingchart Are there any websites that can help me know when to turn on my fans? Yes. Weather Central - BINcast System BINcast helps by providing you with the predicted equilibrium moisture content (EMC) for your bin for the next 5 days. This will help you know when to turn your fan on. In conclusion It's important for a grower to constantly monitor their bins throughout the winter.

The course, called the Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Course for Corn and Soybeans, is being made available through the University of Guelph's Ridgetown campus and sponsored by the province. As of next Aug. 31, buying and using neonicotinoid-treated corn or soybean seed will only be possible with training and certification. Certification is valid for five years. Up to seven people can be supervised to plant under this certification. Participants will learn IPM principles (including corn and soybean pest identification), planting best management practices, the new regulatory requirements regarding Class 12 pesticides and pollinator protection from neonicotinoid exposure. \"The aim of this course is for farmers to further understand how to apply [integrated pest management] concepts to their own corn and soybean fields, specifically for the early season pests,\" says Wentworth County farmer and Ontario Federation of Agriculture director Drew Spoelstra. \"They'll learn how to look for these pests on their farms and consider all the options for managing them.\" The online course also starts Nov. 3. It requires four hours of commitment over two days. High-speed internet and computer competency are required. There are no requirements for using non-treated seed or fungicide-only treated seed. Class 12 pesticides do not include seed for popping corn, sweet corn, or corn used for the production for seed (seed corn) or soybean seed grown for certified status in accordance with a seed production contract (seed soybeans).

How can a farmer farm successfully without knowing their cost of production? We're always told every successful corporate executive outside of agriculture knows the cost of their widgets or grommets, usually down to the last fraction of a penny. Then the question comes again: Can agriculture afford to be different? But agriculture HAS changed, especially in the past 10 to 15 years, maybe not because the idea of farming for profitability is so new (it isn't) but because farmers now have the ability to measure specific properties on the farm, from fertility levels to soil organic matter percentages to cation exchange capacity. Of course, farming has also changed because the numbers are getting so much more volatile, which puts additional pressure on farm decision-making, not just from year to year but sometimes from one week to the next. \"It's not precision ag anymore, it's agronomy.\" - Mike Wilson, Advanced Agronomy Solutions Manager, Thompsons Limited The equipment and systems used to support these decisions are far more complex than they were even five years ago, just as the complexity of our seed technologies has leapt ahead, with double- and triple-stacked traits as well as drought tolerance and above- and below-ground pest protection. It's a new universe compared to when Bt genetics first hit the market in the early 1990s. All of these things have changed the landscape in which farmers conduct business. Yet the focus in the fields still tends to be centred on productivity. How is your company rep or your ag dealer helping you drive yield? In spite of the layers and the complexity, yield remains the single most-important factor in measuring success, and some are arguing that's only because there's a comfort level that comes with yield, along the same lines of \"if it's bigger, it must be better.\" Now it's all being challenged by individuals including Mike Wilson, a certified crop adviser with Thompson's Limited. For the past two years, Wilson has been building tools that can monitor, measure and collate farm details into a workable program to increase profitability. \"A lot of this is still in the experimental stages,\" says Wilson, who's based at the company's Blenheim, Ont. office. \"With some of our key customers, we're starting to see some really positive results, and it's starting to confirm that we are on the right track and it is something that we're going to be able to take to the mainstream as we move forward to develop into a more encompassing program for all of our customers.\" Contrary to the perception that \"precision ag\" is something new, it really has been around for 20 years, if GPS-based yield monitors represent its beginning. The yield monitor quickly evolved towards variable-rate technology (VRT) but then developed at a much slower pace, if for no other reason than the theory of VRT was created without farmers necessarily having the ability to make full use of the data. Now that hardware exists and is being upgraded constantly, there are more growers willing to adapt to it, in spite of the steep angle of its learning curve. It's in recognition of these changes, along with multi-hybrid planter units and automated down-pressure systems, that Wilson has renamed his department \"Advanced Agronomy.\" \"It's not precision ag anymore, it's agronomy,\" Wilson says, noting how it's been influenced by a number of different catalysts, from land prices to commodity price volatility, and from input costs to market demand. \"That's how we're going to farm in the future and that's how we're going to be more profitable,\" Wilson continues. \"The progressive farmer, the farmer who's in it to make money and treat it as a business, this gets their attention every time. They want to be more profitable and usually with profitability comes more bushels anyway - we wind up being more productive as well.\" It's interesting that in the past, the two have been positioned as exclusive aspects of farming, much like oil and protein in soybeans, where you can't have high levels of both, only one or the other. Wilson believes the idea that profitability leads to improved productivity may be a starting point for the discussion. There are some fields in Ontario, he says, that are incapable of producing more than say, 125 to 150 bushels, and that no matter how much fertilizer is applied, or how high the plant densities are pushed, they can't produce more. Wilson has witnessed one field where the combination of low yield potential and high fertilizer and chemical inuts was costing the farmer $400 per acre every year. The challenge is convincing growers that in spite of combining more corn and thinking they're making more money, they may actually be losing money by doing so. What helps is Wilson's system, where there are multiple layers of data and calculations that can show land or rent prices, fuel costs, inputs and fertilizers, so the losses become easier to outline on the page or the computer monitor. Maybe the farmer can just cut back on seeding rates or drop fertilizer allotments, thereby improving per-bushel cost enough to net more per acre. It's similar to a pitch senior agronomist Dale Cowan made several years ago: stop growing corn on the headlands where the yields are at their lowest. Those numbers are just dragging down the field's average, he once said. Instead, throw down the cheapest cereal or grass seed you can find, let it grow for two or three years, and let the roots break down the compacted layers and add some organic matter to the headlands. Wilson agrees. \"If we're farming based on your farm's average, we're going to continue to produce average yields,\" he says. \"If we start creating management zones and farming the farm based on zones, then we increase profitability, because that spot of the field that only yields 125 bushels, we've been wasting money on for years. Let's save our money, or better yet, let's spend it where it's needed. That area of the field that yields 250-plus because it's the best spot on the farm and we've been fertilizing for 180 bushels, can it yield more?\" Wilson insists it can, and that with the latest upgrades in measuring nutrients and performance, farming by zones also becomes more economical. \"Now we're getting more bushels off the farm for the same amount of money, or we're getting the same bushels for less money,\" Wilson says. \"It can shake out many different ways.\" It also starts with the essential step of a yield map. Without some form of precision agriculture, decisions based on management zones are not possible. And there are some misnomers tied to this trend. Wilson has actually proved some of the systems that fall under the umbrella of \"precision ag\" may not help drive profits. The ultimate goal for Wilson is to have the recommendations from the advanced agronomy calculations match the variation in the field. If grid sampling can't match what the customer knows is happening in the field, then the information is incomplete. What has to be kept in mind is that the customer's stake in this is the biggest factor to be considered. What's changed in the last few years isn't just the layering of information that's become available. It's that we also have the means of analyzing and incorporating that information. We can look at yield zones on a map, bare-ground imagery that shows colour variation and variability, or even an elevation layer from RTK or a UAV flight, and if those components can be combined, and the customer agrees that this is the shape and condition of the field, that's the most important facet. \"Then we can start measuring more of what's happening with greater specificity, and have a stronger correlation to the results, because we're actually applying in those yield zones more accurately,\" says Wilson. \"It gives farmers a better in-depth look at each zone, and allows them to make better decisions on things they may have questioned before.\" On a much smaller scale Chris Boersma, who farms around Ridgetown, Ont., has been working with Wilson for the past year or two but has been engaged in improving his profitability since the late 1980s, when he was involved with a group called \"the Most Economical Yield.\" For Boersma, it's not a new concept; what's changed is the capacity to measure against the expectations of farmers who consider using this relatively new system. \"It's more intensive now; there are a lot more details to it and there's more paperwork involved, and a lot more to consider,\" says Boersma. \"You understand that the crop is influenced by 100 different factors and you're trying to manage 80 of them, so there's more intensity, without a doubt. But you have to be of the mind and have the resources to do it, and if a farmer doesn't have that, they're not likely to see the benefit of it.\" - Chris Boersma, Ridgetown, Ontario area farmer Plus there's the level of the return on investment; it isn't a dollar at a time. Instead, with this management zone or Advanced Agronomy concept, the farmer is aiming to shave a few pennies here, or maybe a nickel or a dime there. Thompsons_FarmingForProfitability_Charts But together, they might add up to dollars per acre. It's a longer-term process and it requires greater management input, but once you get started with it, the benefits only continue to grow, especially as the equipment and software continue to drive deeper for more detail. But Boersma agrees that convincing a grower that there's value in a process that might cost a dollar or two - or more - per acre to get started is a difficult pitch. The value of that information, generated on a 12- or 30-square-foot basis, continues to build. Added to that is the potential for measurements to become better defined, similar to being able to measure parts per million. Now there's the capability to measure in parts per billion and parts per trillion, and that's opened the door for better standards and more specific applications. As the scale continues to shrink, the value only gets bigger. \"Now because of technology, I can get the percentage return on any one product based on a number of different scenarios, without a lot of extra labour or work throughout the season,\" explains Boersma. \"That's because every implement's recording what's applied, and the combine's picking it up, and it's all reporting that if we spent $1 per acre on product A, we got $1.10 back or $1.80.\" It's not necessarily an indication of increased yield, it's a reflection of the product applied, and a return on that investment, so the correlation is much more direct. Prerequisites In some ways, Advanced Agronomy is similar to other trends where there are innovators and then early adapters. There are two primary differences, says Boersma. The first is the capital investment and the size of the farm play a role in that investment. Smaller farmers are less likely to be able to justify that kind of financial commitment. The second difference from other trends is the learning curve, which tends to be more vertical. \"With the technology, the equipment is data logging everything,\" says Boersma, noting that he can see a spot in the field where a spray application was missed or went awry. \"It's probably a combination of things, but everything comes together.\" CG Source: Company Website 2.16 September 24, 2015: Thompsons Limited: Estimating Soybean Yield [Company Release] Calculating soybean yields can be difficult. Plant spacing, soil types, environmental factors, insect and disease stress can all affect the final yield. Pod numbers, seeds per pod, and seed size will all control yield. When do I begin counting? The earliest time to begin yield counts is around R5-R6 stage with the R6 stage being preferred (a pod on any of the top four nodes of main stem full of seed.). By R6, all flowering will stop, pods have developed, and seeds in the pods are mostly filled. The accuracy of counts will always increase the closer you are to harvest. How many spots should I sample? Generally doing a count every 10-15 acres is recommended. For soils that are extremely variable, doing a count every 5-10 acres would be beneficial. Select random spots in the field when walking through as you are trying to get the best representation of the field. Soybean pod stages Steps to calculating yield Count your pods Count the number of pods in 1/10,000th of an acre. Row width # rows to count Length of row 30'' 1 21'' 7.5'' 4 21'' Soybean row calculation Count pods that are greater than an inch. If you want to know your plant population, count how many plants are in the section and multiply by 10,000 to get your final population. Seeds per pod The next step is to figure out how many seeds per pod you have. The average that most people use is 2.5. As you go through the plant counting the pods you will soon identify which number of seeds seems to be the most common. Seed size factor Most use the number 18 for seed size which is normal for 3000 seeds/lb. Depending on crop conditions and weather, you can adjust for larger or smaller seed sizes. IP varieties in general have a larger seed size than Roundup Ready soybean. Seeds per pound Seed size factor 2500 (large seed) 15 2666 16 2833 17 3000 (normal seed) 18 3166 19 3333 20 3500 (small seed) 21 Calculate bushel per acre Use the following equation to now calculate your final yield estimate. Do this for each count area and average the results. Source: Company Website 2.17 September 24, 2015: Thompsons Limited: Estimating Corn Yield [Company Release] Early corn yield estimations are a great way to get out into your field and start to predict the yield of different varieties given the growing season. It allows a grower to start making harvest decisions, marketing decisions, and to estimate needed storage capacity. How many spots should I sample from? Generally doing a kernel count every 10-15 acres is recommended. For soils that are extremely variable, doing a kernel count every 5-10 acres would be beneficial. Select random spots in the field when walking through as you are trying to get the best representation of the field. Steps to take for estimating corn yield Measure 1/1000th of an Acre. Measure the length stated against one row of corn. Row width 1/1000th of an acre 20'' 26' 1'' 30'' 17' 5'' 36'' 14' 6'' 38'' 13' 10'' Count the number of ears in the row length that you measured. Select 5 average cobs in the measured length. Count the number of rows around the cob and then multiply that by the amount of kernels in one of the rows. Only count the kernels that are fully developed, and not aborted kernels. CornYieldCalculate_blog Repeat this for every spot, recording your results each time. Calculate the average for the number of cobs per row and kernel count for all the sample areas. Determine your kernels per acre using this formula: Average number of ears x Average number of kernels x 1000 The last step will be to figure out how many kernels are in a bushel. The number commonly used in Ontario is 90,000 kernels per bushel. This may differ depending on your variety. Take your answer from Step#6 and divide it by either 70 000, 90 000, 110 000 depending on your seed size. This is your bushel per acre estimate. Calculating Corn Yield Chart Representative kernel sizes to help guide you in determining the kernels per bushel for different varieties. Things to remember Yield estimates are only as accurate as the samples that you take. Make sure you sample several areas over the whole field. The best estimates are taken as close to black layer (physiological maturity) as possible. Insects, disease and water can all affect actual final yield from the time you take your estimate to the time you harvest.

But this Frisbee is blasting fertilizer and seeds into the ground at 350 feet per second, faster than paintballs fly out of a gun. Beaverton, Oregon-based drone startup DroneSeed created a drone with a device that fires seeds into the ground using compressed air in an effort to reforest the Pacific Northwest, and eventually forests around the world. \"A worker could have 3 birthday cakes and whatever Outback Steakhouse is making these days, and still have burned off more calories doing this work,\" DroneSeed Chief Executive Grant Canary said. \"You have people who will turn down the jobs for lower paying easier work elsewhere,\" he said. \"Not because they're lazy, but because it's so draining. It's one of the hardest jobs on the planet.\" Canary would not comment on the cost of DroneSeed's offering, but says the service offers a \"significant reduction in cost\" to clients needing to plant trees. While the agriculture industry has developed tractors and other machinery to automate difficult processes, the forestry industry has struggled to develop a similar technology due to harsh and uneven terrain. Drones could be the solution, as terrain is less of a concern. DroneSeed's clients include Clean Water Services, a wastewater utility in parts of Oregon, which regularly plants trees to lower temperature of the waterways. It is also working to cover several million acres for one of the Northwest's top five foresters and works internationally in Canada. DroneSeed says its solution is good for the environment, worker safety and investors. DroneSeed's drones currently have a flight time of about 30 minutes; after changing batteries, the drones can cover an acre within 1.5 hours. \"In the early 1900s, when the tractor came along, we saw 90% of Americans working on farms drop down to about 3%,\" Canary said. \"If we could have that same efficiency in planting trees, the cost could significantly be reduced.\" Goldman Sachs estimated in a March 2016 report that agriculture would be the second-largest commercial application for drones behind construction. Farms are currently using drones to monitor crop health and identify potentially problematic areas in the field, often using mounted thermal cameras. The agricultural robot market is expected to grow to $16.3 billion by 2020 from $817 million in 2013, according to a 2015 Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Research report. The agricultural drone market has the potential to generate an additional 100,000 jobs in the U.S. and $82 billion in economic activity between 2015 and 2025, according to the report. \"There is so much parallel with what happened to precision agriculture and what is happening with us in the forestry industry with drones,\" Canary said. \"We see drones as forestry's tractor.\""}, {"title": "Agrium to acquire Cargill's U.S. Ag-Retail business", "article": "Release date - 07072016 CALGARY, Alberta - Agrium Inc.

Editor Louisa Burwood-Taylor joins us to talk about the service and the publication. James West: Louisa, thank you for joining us today. Louisa Burwood-Taylor: Thank you for having me. James West: Louisa, why don't we start with an overview of your role at AgFunder News and your background, and what does AgFunder News actually do? Louisa Burwood-Taylor: Great, well, I'm a financial journalist by background, and I've covered a range of financial markets from European structured bonds in London to Asia's equity capital markets from Hong Kong, institutional investment as well at the FT Group. So I've moved around quite a bit. Related James West: Wow. That's diversity. Louisa Burwood-Taylor: Yes, exactly. And then I moved back to the U.K. in 2014. I got a job with a private equity industry media company called PEI, and they were launching an agriculture investment focused title, so that was amazing timing for me, especially as the private ag investment marketplace was really starting to grow and develop at that time. I mean, it's been incredible growth with more and more players, an increasing number of professionals, funds, investors, looking at this space. And last July I joined AgFunder, which is an online investment marketplace for agriculture technology. It helps agriculture technology startups raise funding. And they have a new service which had gained incredible traction over a 12-month period, and Rob Leclerc, the CEO, asked me to come over and head that up for them. And we've seen incredible growth again over the last nine months. And AgFunder News focuses on reporting the intersection of agriculture, technology, and investment; so the leading industry news source for this space, looking at all the investments that happen, all the startup funding, venture capital investors involved in the space...we speak to people in the industry, we speak to farmers, find out what agriculture technologies they're adopting. And then we also collect data and we have a biannual report on the investment activity that's going into agtech. James West: That's fantastic. So what are some of the areas that you're seeing where technology, as it is applied to agriculture, is making great inroads? Louisa Burwood-Taylor: Yeah, so I think one of the areas that's got the most amount of attention and excitement from investors, entrepreneurs and farmers, and the media as well, is mostly around this idea of precision agriculture. We reported on $660 million investment into precision agriculture start-ups. And so these range from drones companies, satellite imagery companies, soil sensors, farm management software, robotics, irrigation technologies, the list goes on. A lot of it's around collecting data as well. And the whole premise is to help farmers grow more with less, hopefully more sustainably, and you're monitoring growing conditions, you're creating prescriptions for your inputs like water, fertilizer and pesticides. James West: I see. So we talked to a drone company last week called Deveron, and they told us about their technology, their drones, which basically help farmers achieve that: do more with less. So are you seeing lots of companies in the drone space that are applying technology to agriculture? And if so, how do they do that exactly? Louisa Burwood-Taylor: Yes, absolutely. Drones, I mean, they were one of our most popular investment sub-sectors for the year last year, and attracted nearly $400 million worth of investment. And most of them are taking images of the farmland. So they're sometimes using different filters or applying it to different indices to capture crop health issues; they're also just as a general monitoring service for farmers. And there's different ways that farmers can be using them. They can be buying their own and launching their own and using that, or there are drone services that actually go, a farmer will employ to come onto his land and help them maybe solve a specific issue. There have been a few question marks about how effective drones are for agriculture today. I think there are some developments needed in terms of some of the cameras and the sensors that are on the drones; maybe you need to offer a bit more prescriptive detail. I think some of the farmers we've spoken to say it's a lot of time taken to launch a drone, and once you've launched the drone and set the flight plan, then it comes back and there's time taken processing the images, then you need to actually know what you're looking at on the images. So it requires your advisors, and I think sometimes maybe the information is not quick enough - you know, they're not getting it quick enough to actually make some active decisions there and then, and hopefully prevent some of the issues that might be happening in a field, such as a pest infestation. So having said that, we are seeing some startups that are trying to solve some of these issues I mentioned. James West: Right. So are - the other company we had as a guest, Deveron UAS - they provide drone reconnaissance for farmers as a service. Would you say that that dearth of sophistication in the interpretive side is an opportunity for companies like Deveron? Louisa Burwood-Taylor: Yes, absolutely. I think so. Especially if they're a more established player, then they will have a lot more flight time with agricultural clients, and will have a better idea of exactly what it is that they're looking for from a service like that. James West: Okay. So of all the companies that you've been covering at AgFunder News, what are some of the most exciting things that you've seen? Louisa Burwood-Taylor: I think one of the areas that is not necessarily spoken about as much or read about as much, is on the biologicals side, and on the biotech side. I think, you know, drones and robotics and everything is a lot more sexy, but what I would like to see spoken about more and covered more is this idea of biological inputs, gene editing technologies - I think there's a lot more that could be done around improving soil health. I think that's been a massive problem in recent times; I think last year was the year of soils, I think people have realized that soil biodiversity is a challenge that we need to look at. So I think looking at some of the technologies that are looking to help improve those with less use of chemicals, I think, is a very important and exciting space. James West: Are there any companies that come to mind at the top of your head? Louisa Burwood-Taylor: I wouldn't want to name any companies just at this time. James West: OK, great. So then what does the landscape look for, for agtech and ag-related projects? What does it look like now relative to one, two, five years ago? Louisa Burwood-Taylor: So about - in 2013, which was when I was first getting into the space, in agriculture technology specifically, there was under $1 billion worth of investment, and then last year we recorded $4.6 billion worth of investment. So that's huge exponential growth. I think as a sector of interest for entrepreneurs, it's really, really gathered pace, which is excellent. So we're getting entrepreneurs from other parts of the technology world coming into agriculture and trying to apply their experience and knowledge to this sector, which is very exciting. James West: Sure. So of all the companies that you're seeing and the money that you're seeing flowing out of the $4.6 billion, which are the sectors or the sub-sectors receiving most of that financial attention? Louisa Burwood-Taylor: Right. So in our definition of agtech, we include all the technologies that are looking to disrupt the food chain from farm to fork. So we have one sector which you might not necessarily associate as much with the farm, but it's food e-commerce and food delivery. So you know all those kind of e-grocery companies that are cutting out your regular grocery store; so food e-commerce raised a huge amount of money last year, about $1.6 billion. We think that's a sector that's overheated and we question the unit economics on some of those start-ups, but that was a place where a huge number of venture capital firms put a huge amount of money behind last year. So that was interesting. And then besides that, it was irrigation and water technology investment. I think there's a huge realization that water is very limited globally, and that we need to do more to think about how we're managing water. So technologies around prescriptive irrigation, water monitoring technologies, yeah, they picked up quite a lot of attention too. James West: So do you see the focus from investors more or less uniform along the same sub-sectors in North America, or let's say the Eastern Hemisphere relative to the Western Hemisphere? Or is there a different level of focus based on the hemispheric differentiation? Louisa Burwood-Taylor: Well, I mean, the vast majority of investment is going on in the U.S. You have a lot of agtech start-ups coming from other parts of the world and moving to the U.S. to capture that interest, to hopefully expand across the U.S. first, and then move on to other parts of the world geographically. So I don't think there's necessarily a trend for specific types of technology in different parts of the world. James West: Fantastic, Louisa. Now how do we find agtech news on the Internet? Louisa Burwood-Taylor: You go to AgFunderNews.com. James West: OK! Louisa, it's been so nice to talk to you. We're going to come back to you in a quarter's time or so and see how things have evolved in our space, and I thank you so much for your time today. Louisa Burwood-Taylor: Thank you so much for having me!"}, {"title": "SAP Vehicle Insights Drives the Digital Transformation of Connected Vehicles", "article": "Source: SAP - Press Release/Statement: Headline: SAP Vehicle Insights Drives the Digital Transformation of Connected Vehicles WALLDORF -- SAP SE (NYSE: SAP) has introduced SAP Vehicle Insights, an application that offers a variety of services to manage connected vehicles, including basic data analytics that can be used for fleet analytics, vehicle diagnostics and mobility-as-a-service scenarios, pushing live mobility to the next level.

John Molenhuis, OMAFRA business analysis and cost of production program lead, told Ontario Farmer by phone that the latest Survey of Ontario Custom Farm Work Rates was completed at the end of 2015. The survey, which is distributed every three years, was mailed out to 600 addresses in Ontario. Two hundred and twenty responses were returned. The majority of the questions were the same on the 2015 survey when compared to the 2012 version but Molenhuis said a new precision agriculture section was added this time around. Results of the survey showed that custom farm work rates have risen 8.5 per cent over the past three years, a normal increase when considering historical numbers. \"There weren't really any major shifts in the new data set,\" Molenhuis said. \"Custom rates tend to tick along and go up about $1-$3 per acre.\" The number of custom operators who responded to the survey showed noticeable change, however. Molenhuis said the same survey sent out in 1994 returned 772 responses, over 500 more than the 2015 numbers. The trend of fewer operators is related to the trend of fewer farms. Molenhuis said the number of farms is going down but size is going up and larger operators can justify purchasing their own equipment. This is certainly true for planting and combining, he said, as farmers don't want to be waiting around for the custom operator to arrive. Regionality plays a role in how much custom operators charge for their services. For example, Western Ontario has lower rates when compared to Eastern and Nor thern Ontario. Molenhuis said that's due to supply and demand. There are more custom operators to choose from in Western Ontario versus Eastern and Nor thern Ontario. At the same time, custom operators in the latter two regions have to travel further distances between farms so that can up the cost. External factors can impact the price of custom farm work as well. The price of fuel is a big one and changes on a yearly, if not more frequent, basis. Molenhuis said when fuel prices spiked in 2008 many custom operators began adding a fuel surcharge to their already established base rate. \"The fuel price increase snuck up on a lot of people that year,\" he said. When it comes to longerterm external factors, Molenhuis pointed to the exchange rate. He said the price of equipment jumped 20-25 per cent from 2012 to 2015 on the exchange rate alone. This means certain custom operators might have raised their prices to cover their cost of production. Both farmers and custom operators can use the results of OMAFRA's survey to enhance their business making decisions. If a farmer is looking to add a bit of custom work to his or her operation, the survey numbers of fer a star t ing point. The data can also help producers who are trying to decide on adding a new crop to the mix. \"They can use the custom rates as their machinery costs and see where profitability sits,\" said Molenhuis. Or the survey can present the price difference between purchasing a new piece of equipment and continuing to hire out. Custom operators who are new to the game can use the survey rates to set their initial pricing. \"They want to cover their costs and be fair on what they charge the farmer so it gives them a guide to what the current market offers,\" Molenhuis continued. A full copy of the 2015 Survey of Ontario Custom Farm Work Rates can be found online on OMAFRA's website. The next survey will be completed in 2018."}, {"title": "Farmers Edge; Precision Agriculture Pioneer, Farmers Edge, Forms Partnership with Leading Equipment Dealer Moody's Equipment to Expand Precision Ag Technology Availability across Western Canada", "article": "2016 JUN 16 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Agriculture Week -- Farmers Edge(TM), a global leader in precision agriculture and independent data management solutions, announced it has partnered with Moody's Equipment, the leading agriculture equipment and shortlines dealer in Alberta and Saskatchewan.

I am trying to put more volunteer time into working with our industry to encourage research to fill knowledge gaps we have and to document and organize older research that has relevance to today's world. One of our initiatives is to conduct sessions for ranchers on what the latest research tells us about issues we are confronting. We held a half-day session with a number of researchers in advance of the meetings. The turnout for our research forum was extremely encouraging. Our industry leaders want knowledge. One main speaker spoke on animal welfare initiatives going back decades. \"Animals should have a reasonably good life for their entire life.' That about defines what animal care/welfare is about. When castrating, disbudding horns, or branding we need to take care to mitigate the pain to young cattle. Drugs that can be administered orally or by injections exist for use by ranchers. The reduction of pain and discomfort, apart from being the right thing to do for the animal, is good for the marketing of our cattle and results is greater growth and health of the animals. Most people using pain mitigation say that the calves are up on their feet and continuing gaining much more quickly, returning to normal. So the cost of the medications pays for itself. Anyone interested can view a video on the Beef Cattle Research Council website. This is the emerging law: The Beef Cattle Code of Practice. The other major topic reported on, was the status of carbon sequestration under different pasture management practices. Much has been written about agricultural practices that release carbon into the atmosphere: cultivation, animals giving off gases, burning of fossil fuel etc. One of the mitigation strategies is to sequester more carbon in the soil by encouraging range and pasture soil health. For a measure of importance of range practices consider this: grasslands store 34 per cent of terrestrial carbon, while forests store 39 per cent. In addition to the satellite remote sensing of stored carbon, researchers use a hand held multispectral radiometer that measures carbon in the soil by sensing the colour of the range plants with 79 per cent accuracy. Now researchers are putting cameras and other devices on drones so much more ground can be measured. We know the agriculture industry uses GPS to calibrate the application of seed and fertilizer when farming (precision farming). Now range managers can use drones to monitor range condition. There is a relationship between how much carbon is stored and how much soil moisture there is. For example in the upper grasslands (cooler and wetter) there is more soil carbon. We think that if there is more soil moisture by litter retention and irrigation that more can be stored on the lower (drier) grasslands. Another interesting finding is that with an intermediate level of biomass on grasslands, there is the most species richness (biodiversity). Interesting stuff David Zirnhelt is a member of the Cariboo Cattlemen's Association and chair of the advisory committee for the Applied Sustainable Ranching program which started at Thompson Rivers University in Williams Lake this January.

All currency amounts are expressed in U.S. dollars. During the fourth quarter of 2015, AgJunction successfully completed a merger with Novariant Inc., strengthening its position within the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) precision guidance and machine control markets. AgJunction's consolidated 2016 first-quarter results are presented as a combined entity; however, the comparative first quarter ended March 31, 2015, does not include Novariant's operations. For the three months ended March 31, 2016, the company reported revenue of $15.5-million, a 28-per-cent increase from $12.1-million in the first quarter of 2015. Total revenue in the Americas for the first quarter was $7.5-million, up 49-per-cent year over year due largely to additional sales resulting from the acquisition of Novariant. Sales in Asia Pacific (Apac) increased $1.1-million or 58 per cent from the first quarter of 2015, of which $700,000 relates to the acquisition of Novariant. Combined, sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) slightly decreased 3 per cent from the first quarter of 2015 to $5.0-million, reflecting market conditions. The Americas represented 48 per cent of total revenues in the first quarter of 2016 compared with 41 per cent a year ago. EMEA represented 33 per cent of total first-quarter revenues and APAC 19 per cent, as compared with 43 per cent and 16 per cent in the first quarter of 2015, respectively. \"We are pleased to report continued pickup in demand in the Americas from the aftermarket dealers as well as our added reseller (VAR) customer base in North America and EMEA during the first quarter,\" said Dave Vaughn, chief executive officer of AgJunction. \"We believe the continued headwinds faced by the equipment manufactures resulting in slower new equipment sales is helping customers that purchased machines four or five years ago to go ahead and put steering technology onto the machines that they had hoped to sell last year. \"Despite these headwinds, AgJunction continues working with our OEM partners on integration solutions, and has identified and is pursuing regional pockets of opportunity, and views the overall long-term fundamentals of the global agriculture markets to be compelling. Drivers for agricultural growth include population growth, limited arable land, the need for increased output, and a relatively low global penetration of precision agriculture technologies such as [global navigation satellite system] and automated steering. \"Operationally we are on course to complete our major internal integration projects,\" added Mr. Vaughn. \"Our global team is actively executing on our ambitions of being the world's leading supplier of automated steering and machine control technology for precision agriculture.\" Gross margins were $6.7-million for the quarter, up by $1.2-million from gross margins of $5.5-million for the first quarter of 2015. Gross margins, as a percentage of revenue, were 43 per cent in 2016 compared with 46 per cent in 2015. The usage of the remaining $300,000 fair value writeup of Novariant inventory due to purchase accounting rules reduced gross margin by two percentage points in the first quarter. Total operating expenses were $6.4-million, or 41.4 per cent of revenue, in the first quarter, up $1.5-million or 31 per cent from $4.9-million, or 40.4 per cent of revenue, in the first quarter of 2015. Sales and marketing expenses were $1.9-million, up 27 per cent, or $400,000, from $1.5-million in the first quarter of 2015, with the increase due to the acquisition of Novariant. Research and development expenditures of $1.9-million for the quarter increased from $1.5-million in the first quarter of 2015, representing an increase of $400,000 or 27 per cent. Of this increase, approximately $300,000 relates to amortization of the $11.7-million technology-related intangible purchased in the acquisition of Novariant. The remaining $100,000 relates to an increase in compensation costs also associated with the acquisition of Novariant. General and administrative expenses for first quarter of 2016 were $2.5-million compared with $1.9-million in the first quarter of 2015, representing an increase of $600,000 or 32 per cent due to the acquisition of Novariant. For the first quarter ended March 31, 2016, the company reported net income of $200,000, or nil per share (basic and diluted), compared with net income from continuing operations of $500,000, or one cent per share (basic and diluted), in the first quarter of 2015.

The program - which doles out $200,000 in grants for projects that protect surface water and groundwater quality - had stopped allowing septic projects in 2011. Julia Robinson, from the city's environmental services department, said it was taken out because the program became overburdened with requests. It's inclusion will have a cap of $20,000 to allow for a mix of projects, she said. The septic grants are maxed at $1,000 or a 50 per cent work share if it's under $1,000, Robinson said. West Carleton Coun. Eli El-Chantiry asked if residents had been made aware of the addition. \"Many people were upset when it was removed and would like to take advantage of it,\" he said. \"I would like to see rural affairs promote this.\" A rejig of the program last year also included the approval to use the surplus from previous to fund additional projects. Residents can apply as long as they live in any rural property in Ottawa. They have to have the grant approved before they start work. Robinson said there were 52 applications this year, for a total of $194,744. There were 57 projects approved in 2015 - for a total of $185,000 in city money and $188,000 from landowners. Robinson said 37 projects are already completed and the majority of applications were under stream stabilization. Applications can be made under: * Manure storage and treatment, * Wash water treatment, * Precision farming plans, * Erosion control, * Cover crops"}, {"title": "Symposium tackles Golden Horseshoe's ag identity", "article": "NIAGARA-ON-THE-LAKE - A hub is only as useful as the wheel it supports. In the case of agriculture in the Golden Horseshoe, the Town of Lincoln has positioned itself as the hub, and on Friday it reached out to strengthen the bonds that will make its official designation as a Centre of Excellence for Agriculture a success. Teaming up with Niagara College, town officials held a symposium entitled \"The Road to Defining a Centre of Excellence for Agriculture and Food Serving Niagara and Beyond.\" The symposium brought politicians, town planners and agricultural advocates from around the Niagara region and beyond together to discuss Lincoln's designation and how it can be beneficial in the broader Niagara context. Considering Lincoln's designation as a Centre of Excellence for Agriculture is a first of its kind in the region it's perhaps not surprising that innovation was a major theme at Friday's symposium. Representatives from the Vineland Research and Innovation Centre, Grape Growers of Ontario, Niagara College and Golden Horseshoe Food and Farming Alliance spoke of the various technological and other innovations being undertaken throughout the region. \"Agricultural innovation sustains our species,\" said Jim Brandle, CEO of VRIC. \"It's not a better cell phone or a better car, this is how we stay alive.\" With the global population soaring Brandle said the world's farmers will have to do more with less in the coming decades. At VRIC, researchers have developed products like the Crazee Mite, a new pest-control method for greenhouses. \"It's a brand new agent for controlling aphids and mealybugs,\" he said, adding the mite also happens to be a native of St. Catharines. With Lincoln having such a strong horticultural base, Brandle said it's also time to bring automation to that sector. While grain farmers and dairy operators can maintain huge operations with low labour costs, horticulture farmers continue to rely on temporary and migrant farm workers and the overhead that goes with it. Debbie Zimmerman, CEO of the Grape Growers of Ontario, also pointed to the innovation of vineyards in her sector. She pointed to Brock University's Vine Alert program, which alerts grape growers when temperatures drop to dangerous levels. It's specific to location and grape variety, providing growers with precise information on when to turn on their wind machines. \"Since having Vine Alert these crop losses have been reduced dramatically,\" she said. For others, innovation wasn't just about new technology, but new ways to tell their stories. Al Brezina, innovation program director at Food and Beverage Ontario, talked about the importance of promoting the industry. \"In any day you can pick up the paper and see a story on the auto sector, but you probably won't see a story on food and beverage,\" he said. However, given the sector brings in $40 billion in revenues annually, Brezina said it is a huge economic driver. And the symposium is about more than just agriculture, said Lincoln's CAO Mike Kirkopoulos. \"It is as much about agriculture as it is about job creation, research, creating complete communities as well as supporting agriculture through research and development,\" he said. \"We need to look at the community through a rural lens,\" said Lincoln Mayor Sandra Easton. \"Normal farming practices must be considered in all our decisions.\" Sidebar: What the other speakers had to say Janet Horner, executive director for Golden Horseshoe Food and Farming Alliance: Much of the work of GHFFA is breaking down the barriers between municipalities, levels of government and organizations. Horner pointed to the agricultural mapping tools the organization has developed and is now shared between staff at the provincial and municipal levels. Horner said the Golden Horseshoe's food and farming cluster is the third largest of its kind in North America. Kim Reep, regional economic development advisor with the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs: \"Hello, I'm from the government and we're here to help,\" she said, to much applause from those in attendance. Reep went over some of the programs the provincial government has undertaken to help those in the food and farming sector innovate and develop. Those programs include the Rural Economic Development program, wine and grape strategy, local food fund and a business retention and expansion program in Northumberland County. Evan Acs, economic development officer with the City of Port Colborne: innovations can present both opportunities and challenges. Acs outlined the city's transition from Carbohydrate Valley to its new role within the food processing sector. As health concerns about high fructose corn syrup led to lowering consumer demand Port Colborne had to reposition itself when former major employer Ingredion (previously Casco) pulled out of the city. \"We now focus on other food processing opportunities,\" he said. Those other opportunities include Jungbunzlauer, a global company that manufactures citric acid, special salts and sweeteners and other products from renewable raw materials, poultry processors Pinty's and the city's various grain elevators and terminals. Gregor MacLean, research project manager for Niagara College's Agriculture and Environment Innovation Centre: researchers at the college are eager to collaborate with local farmers. His department has been hard at work developing useful precision agriculture tools that need real world test sites. \"The Centre for Excellence in Agriculture helps us connect with people,\" he said. Don Cyr, professor of finance and former dean of the Goodman School of Business at Brock University: Issues the university has researched include social licence, the need to present straightforward answers to questions such as genetically modified organisms and climate change, and promotion of Canadian food and beverages globally. Cyr said there are great opportunities for Canadian food producers to help feed the burgeoning Chinese middle class, and Niagara's already strong relationship with China can make the region a leader when it comes to those opportunities."}, {"title": "UR UrtheCast's Deimos-1 transmits imagery to UrthePlatform", "article": "UrtheCast Corp (TSX:UR) Shares Issued 102,919,717 Last Close 5/6/2016 $1.16 Monday May 09 2016 - News Release Mr. Wade Larson reports DEIMOS-1 DATA OF THE CONTIGUOUS UNITED STATES, CLOUD-FREE, EVERY MONTH, NOW FLOWING TO THE URTHEPLATFORM For the first time, newly collected imagery from UrtheCast Corp.'s Deimos-1 satellite is flowing to the company's on-line platform, known as the UrthePlatform, shortly after acquisition.

Now celebrating its fifth year under the theme \"Made in Africa\", IPA is the premier innovation initiative on the African continent, offering a grand share prize of US$150 000 and incentives to spur growth and prosperity in Africa through home-grown solutions. \"In the past five years, I've seen innovation grow from a mere buzzword to a sturdy path for African growth in multi-disciplinary industries across the continent. As Africans, we have the talent, potential and clout to solve our own problems with ingenuity too, and IPA is testimony of this,\" said Pauline Mujawamariya Koelbl, IPA Director at the helm of this initiative since its launch in 2011. The IPA has seen tremendous growth in applications and increasing interest from both innovators and innovation enablers over the years. To date, IPA has attracted more than 6 000 innovators from 50 African countries, making it a truly Pan African initiative. IPA 2016 attracted a record 3 600 plus innovators and received 985 successful submissions from 46 African countries. African ingenuity this year showcases new breakthroughs in malaria and other public health burdens, smart solutions for farmers and dynamic energy initiatives. AIF will host the IPA 2016: Made in Africa awards ceremony and its first ever Innovation Ecosystems Connector on 22 and 23 June 2016 in Gaborone, Botswana. This premier innovation event has been endorsed by H.E. Lieutenant General Seretse Khama Ian Khama, the President of Botswana, who will preside at the Awards Ceremony. Collaborating partners include the Ministry of Infrastructure, Science and Technology (MIST), and the Botswana Innovation Hub (BIH). Visit our event website to learn more about planned activities and partnership opportunities Listed below are the top 10 IPA 2016 nominees. Prior to the final announcement at a special gala ceremony on 23 June 2016 at the Gaborone International Conference Centre (GICC), the expert panel of IPA judges will once again deliberate through live pitching sessions and one-on-ones with each nominee to select the top three winners. For fuller details of the 10 nominees, their innovations and related images, please see Tackling malaria and other public health burdens Dr. Eddy Agbo, Nigeria: Urine Test for Malaria (UMT) Urine Test for Malaria (UMT) is a rapid non-blood diagnostic medical device that can diagnose malaria in less than 25 minutes. Africa has the highest number of malaria cases worldwide; more often than not, when fever is detected, anti-malaria medication is administered. However, the inability to quickly diagnose and commence malaria treatment can lead to various complications including kidney failure, build-up of lung fluid, aplastic anaemia and even death. UMT uses a dip-stick with accurate results in just 25 minutes. The technology detects malaria parasite proteins in the patient's urine with fever due to malaria. The UMT is simple and affordable, and a potential game changer in managing malaria across Africa. Dr Eddy Agbo is a molecular bio-technologist from Nigeria, and Chairman/CEO of Fyodor Biotechnologies, promoters of UMT. Eddy has a PhD in Molecular Genetics from Utrecht University in Netherlands and a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine from University of Ibadan, Nigeria. Prior to founding Fyodor, he held a senior research position at John Hopkins University, USA. Valentin Agon, Benin: Api-Palu Api-Palu is an anti-malaria drug treatment developed out of natural plant extract. It is significantly cheaper than available anti-malarial drugs, and has great inhibitory effects on 3D7 strains of plasmodium falciparum the causative agent of malaria. Sub-Saharan Africa is home to 88% of malaria cases and 90% of malaria deaths reported globally (WHO: 2015) with some African governments spending up to 40% of their public health budgets on malaria treatment. Api-Palu manifests as a fast rate of malaria parasite clearance from the blood following short term treatment, with relatively lower doses. It is available in tablets, capsules or syrup. The drug has been approved in Benin, Burkina Faso, Tchad, and Central Africa Republic because of its therapeutic and non-toxic effects. Dr Valentin Agon is from Benin and specialises in alternative medicine; he has received a doctorate for his research in this field. Valentin has been the recipient of several awards - both for his work on alternative medicine and promoting innovation and entrepreneurship in Africa. Dr. Imogen Wright, South Africa: Exatype Exatype is a software solution that enables healthcare workers to determine HIV positive patients' responsiveness to ARV drug treatment. According to WHO, 71% of people living with HIV/AIDS reside in Africa. Until now, governments' response has been to ensure access to treatment for all. However, a growing number of people on ARVs are resistant to drug regimens, leading to failure of the therapy, exacerbating the continent's HIV/AIDS burden. Exatype processes the highly complex data produced by advanced \"next-generation\" DNA sequencing of the HIV DNA in a patient's blood. Through a simple report, it detects drugs that are resistant to the patient, then highlights the need to avoid these to ensure successful treatment. Exatype has the potential to contribute towards effectively managing HIV/AIDS in Africa, and also holds promise in helping detect drug resistance for other disease burdens such as Tuberculosis (TB) and malaria. Dr. Imogen Wright is a South African scientist who holds a first-class degree in physics and computer science from Rhodes University, a Masters in Theoretical Physics from Canada's Perimeter Institute and a PhD from the University of the Western Cape. Dr. Kit Vaughan, South Africa: Aceso Aceso is an imaging technology, capable of performing full-field digital mammography and automated breast ultrasound at the same time, dramatically improving breast cancer detection. Annually, there are more than half a million cancer deaths in Africa and these numbers are expected to double in the next three decades. If diagnosed early enough, the cancer can be treated successfully. However, because 40% of women have dense tissue, their cancers cannot be seen on X-ray. Furthermore, a false negative finding can have devastating consequences. Aceso is a single device that can acquire dual-modality images - full-field digital mammography and automated breast ultrasound - at the same time. This world first system is protected by international patents and has been successfully tested in two separate clinical trials with 120 women. Kit Vaughan is the CEO of CapeRay Medical. He has a post-doctoral fellowship in orthopaedic engineering from Oxford University, was a professor at the University of Virginia, and was the Hyman Goldberg Chair in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Cape Town (UCT). Kit is a Fellow of the International Academy for Medical and Biological Engineering. Design architecture and learning platforms Dr. Youssef Rashed, Egypt: The Plate Package (PLPAK) The Plate Package (PLPAK) is a robust software solution that assesses the architecture of building plans or technical drawings, determining structural integrity of the end design. PLPAK applies the boundary element based method to analyse and view practical design on building foundations and slabs. This enables engineers to represent building slabs over sophisticated foundation models easily, building information modelling techniques and eliminating human error. With the rapid growth of African cities, there is increased demand for infrastructural developments to support the growing population. The infrastructure system in Africa, especially building architecture, tends to go untested due to huge associated costs in verifying structure integrity, and can lead to the collapse of buildings with many deaths. PLPAK addresses this through its low-cost, easy to use but world class tool. Dr. Youssef Rashed graduated with an MSc degree from Cairo University, Egypt and received his PhD from the University of Wales, United Kingdom in 1997. He is currently a professor of structural engineering at Cairo University and the Deputy Secretary General of the Supreme Council of Universities in Egypt. Godwin Benson, Nigeria: Tuteria Tuteria is an innovative peer-to-peer learning online platform that allows people who want to learn any skill, whether formal or informal, to connect with anyone else in proximity who is offering that skill. For instance, a student needing math skills can connect online with someone in their vicinity offering remedial classes in mathematics. The tutors and the learners form an online community that connects them, and once a fit is established, they meet offline for practical exchange. Both tutors and learners are thoroughly vetted to ensure safety, accountability and a quality learning experience. Globally, conventional methods of education and learning are transitioning from centralized to distributed, and from standardized to personalized. Such trends have resulted in better learning outcomes. Tuteria fits in well with this model, and has been highly recommended by the IPA judges for the African continent. Godwin holds a first-class honours systems engineering degree from the University of Lagos in Nigeria and was best engineering Student and 3rd Best Overall Student in the entire graduating set. He worked briefly at ExxonMobil as an Onsite Support Engineer, and also at Deloitte Nigeria as an Information Security Associate before developing Tuteria. Smart farming solutions Olufemi Odeleye, Nigeria: The Tryctor The Tryctor is a mini tractor modelled on the motorcycle. By attaching various farming implements, it can carry out similar operations as a conventional tractor to a smaller scale. Farming for most small scale farmers in the continent is tough, laborious and characterized by low productivity. Small scale farmers are constrained by the costs involved in switching to mechanized agriculture and use of heavy equipment. However, through inspired alterations to a motorcycle's engine, gearing system and chassis, this innovation has made it possible to mechanize agriculture in Africa for small scale farmers in a way that was previously inaccessible. Additionally, the Tryctor is easy to use and cheaper to maintain as 60% of its parts and components are locally sourced. The IPA judges were captivated by the clever adaptation of a motorized solution that is ubiquitous in Africa, largely for transportation to a solution for mechanized farming for small scale farmers. Femi Odeleye is an automobile designer with more than 18 years of experience in design and engineering from both Africa and Europe. He obtained a BSc in Mathematics and Statistics from the University of Lagos, Nigeria and a BA in Automobile Design from Coventry University, UK. He worked for the automotive industry in the UK before returning to Nigeria to work on the Tryctor. Samuel Rigu, Kenya: Safi Sarvi Organics Safi Sarvi Organics is a low-cost fertilizer made from purely organic products and waste from farm harvests, designed to improve yields for farmers by up to 30%. Rural farmers in sub-Saharan Africa pay huge costs for fertilizer, which is often produced abroad and imported. Owing to such high costs farmers can only afford the cheap, synthetic, and acidulated fertilizer varieties. In many areas where the soil is inherently acidic, use of acidulated fertilizers can lead to long-term soil degradation and yield loss, at about four percent per year. Safi Sarvi costs the same as traditional fertilizers, can reverse farmers' soil degradation and lead to improved yield and income. The product uses biochar-based fertilizer which can counteract soil acidity, retaining nutrients and moisture in the soil. Additionally, the carbon-rich fertilizer removes carbon from the atmosphere by at least 2.2 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per acre of farm per year. Samuel Rigu graduated with a degree in Agribusiness from the University of Nairobi in Kenya, and had previously founded two agribusiness companies. In 2013, inspired by visiting colleagues from MIT, Samuel co-founded Safi Organics. Dynamic energy initiatives Andre Nel, South Africa: Green Tower Green Tower is an off-grid water heating and air conditioning solution based on solar power that uses advanced thermos-dynamics to create up to 90% savings in electricity consumption. Water heating and air conditioning systems can account up to 60% of energy consumption in a home or building. There are a number of heating and cooling systems in the market, but few that have demonstrated consistency in efficiencies regardless of weather conditions. The Green Tower improves efficiency of a solar heat pump with solar thermal collectors, low pressure storage tanks and heat exchangers. With Africa's middle class rapidly growing and demand for energy outstripping supply, this initiative has the potential for large scale roll out. Green Tower can conserve limited energy resources, diverting them from heating and cooling systems to more productive industries. Andre Nel has an M.Eng degree (electronics and software) from the University of Pretoria in South Africa and has been registered as Professional Engineer since 1991. Andre is passionate about energy efficiency and renewable energy, and has been developing solutions for the Green Economy since 2007. He is a recipient of several awards. Johan Theron, South Africa: PowerGuard PowerGuard enables consumers to determine the maximum amount of power supply required for daily operations. Consumers can thus reduce their power demand, especially during peak times, leading to a more efficient power supply, and helping to reduce power cuts. PowerGuard addresses electricity fluctuations, and power delivery and supply challenges by reducing the peaks, relieving pressure on the electricity network. Consumers can set their own maximum peak power usage needs. This technology substantially reduces load shedding and power rationing, diverting power to more productive industries. Africa faces a high demand for grid power, but with limited resources and an aging infrastructure, the existence of a smart grid can help reduce the pressure on existing infrastructure while moving the continent slowly towards renewable energy. South African Johan Theron has a National Diploma for Technicians in Electronic Engineering. He has been involved in a number of ventures in the electronics industry dating back to the 70s and has seen a number of his inventions becoming industry standards. He has also been recipient of a number of innovation awards. Walter Fust, Chairman of the AIF Board was impressed by the level of submissions for IPA 2016: \"As we celebrate the five year IPA journey, our mission to engage, inspire and transform is evident in the IPA process - from the growing registrations, to the level of talent and ingenuity we see in the nominees, as well as the enthusiasm from our expert judges in seeing these innovations at work to solve some of Africa's intractable challenges. Now while we await announcement of the winner, we call on all innovation enablers to join hands with us to unlock the potential of these nominees.\" Distributed by APO (African Press Organization) on behalf of African Innovation Foundation (AIF)."}, {"title": "Press Release: Deimos-1 Data of the Contiguous United States, Cloud-Free, Every Month, Now Flowing to the UrthePlatform", "article": "Deimos-1 Data of the Contiguous United States, Cloud-Free, Every Month, Now Flowing to the UrthePlatform PR Newswire VANCOUVER, May 9, 2016 VANCOUVER, May 9, 2016 /PRNewswire/ - UrtheCast Corp.

Alec Ross's highly readable The Industries of the Future is really about the world of the future and how innovations are creating industries that will make or break societies and, indeed, entire countries. The author's clear, wide-ranging analysis will reach anyone -- parent, student, teacher, employee, business leader, entrepreneur -- concerned about securing a place in an increasingly changeable world. Ross brings a global perspective after four years (and 41 countries) as senior adviser for innovation for Hillary Clinton when she was U.S. Secretary of State. He profiles several soon-to-be trillion-dollar industries, most already hurtling toward mainstream: robotics, genomics, digital money and big data analytics. Businesses that don't adapt will perish, he states bluntly. Taxi companies and small hotel chains are already losing to Uber and Airbnb. Banks that still think they're repositories of money instead of data companies will succumb to digital systems. Whatever the future of Bitcoin, the blockchain technology behind it -- essentially a huge public ledger -- will prevail. What about careers? \"If any college student asked me what career would most assure 50 years of steady, well-paying employment,\" writes Ross, a father of three young children, \"I would respond, 'Cybersecurity.'\" What if you want to be a doctor? Then you'll need to learn about nanorobots to treat disease. Lawyer? Technology will replace you in straightforward transactions such as real estate. Translator? A machine will do it faster. Farmer? Then you better use precision agriculture if you want to compete. What about learning Mandarin? Maybe, but only after you've learned a more important language: code. Ross covers the usual big players (China, Japan, South Korea, Germany, India, Silicon Valley) but also cites the surprising emergence of Estonia and, soon, Rwanda as knowledge-based economies. Canada gets three mentions, all negative: the Nortel fiasco, our flirtation with MintChip digital money, and our tendency to have our intellectual property ripped off. Only those nations that empower women will thrive, Ross writes -- ironically, interviews with men dominate the book. Near the end we briefly meet two women, a Pakistani entrepreneur and an Estonian inventor, but I would have liked to hear from more female innovators. In his section on genomics, Ross doesn't even mention that the revolutionary gene-editing technology was co-discovered by two women. Innovations will continue to change the world in breathtaking ways. The Industries of the Future does an impressive balancing act of cautioning us about the peril while exciting us about the promise.

Building on the electrical current work that Nikola Tesla first experimented with in the late 19th century, Dr. Thundat and his 30-member team have developed single-wire technology to power sensors, and many other things besides. The new technology, which only requires one wire to power a device rather than the traditional two, has helped catapult his team's work with sensors to another level. \"One of the reasons a lot of the sensors we were working with in Tennessee did not mature is because of the battery,\" he says. \"We have really small sensors, the size of a pill, but the battery is 10 times bigger and it has a limited lifetime ... It doesn't work.\" But the new technology, for which a patent is currently pending, went even further than that as the team members found they didn't even need the single wire. \"It started out being on a single wire, but we very quickly found out that you could do it over surfaces,\" says Charles van Neste, who has worked with Dr. Thundat since 2004. \"Once you can do things over surfaces, then the capabilities just go through the roof because surfaces are everywhere.\" The possibilities that this new technology, which is officially termed \"quasi-wireless capacitive power transfer,\" are almost endless, both in industry such as the oil sands, and beyond. \"People have always been limited by two wires,\" says Dr. Thundat, \"and if we can do it with one wire or one surface ... you can actually power your cellphone if you leave it anywhere in your house ... or leave your laptop on the table and it automatically powers.\" Dr. Thundat's team is of the firm belief that it will speed our transformation into a community of smart cities and smart homes. This could mean, for instance, powering a home by putting lights wherever you want without the need of plugs, Dr. Van Neste says. \"I think it's going to be a transformative technology because it can basically change how we do things, how we deliver electricity.\" In the oil sands, the new technology offers the possibility of using the power transfer through the ground to heat the bitumen so it can be pumped out, rather than using the normal method of forcing steam deep underground to do the same thing. This method would save both water and money. The technology also allows the by-product tailings ponds, containing a mixture of water, sand, silt, clay and bitumen residue, to settle faster and allow for quicker reclamation of the materials. Unfortunately, it's not yet ready for use in the real world. \"We have done that in the lab scale but we haven't gone into the field yet,\" says Dr. Thundat. \"It needs a lot more power than we can do in the lab.\" That technology will also have an impact on industries such as agriculture, which rely on operating on a large scale over vast areas of land. \"It's under review right now where we are actually able to energize the soil in a localized area, so that has applications for all kinds of stuff,\" Dr. Van Neste says. For instance, it offers the possibility of precision agriculture, where, instead of having to crop dust an entire field because of an outbreak in one location, the sensors, no longer tied to batteries or wires, will be able to pinpoint the location and have robots take care of it. Dr. Thundat is also part of a team using his sensor technology to help detect the Zika virus. The sensors are being tailored so that the coating on the microcantilevers attaches itself to molecules of the virus, and though he says that the work \"is coming along very well,\" it's still not ready for public release as yet. \"Basically you want to make sure that what you're detecting is 100-per-cent Zika virus,\" he says.

(TSE: AGU) - UPDATED 5 MAY 2016", "article": "LATEST FINANCIAL ANNOUNCEMENT Agrium Inc. (TSE: AGU) Agrium's Solid First Quarter Results Driven by Strong Operating Performance TUESDAY, MAY 03, 2016 CALGARY, AB--(Marketwired - May 03, 2016) - Agrium Inc. (TSX: AGU) (NYSE: AGU) announced today its 2016 first quarter earnings results, with net earnings attributable to equity holders of Agrium of $2-million ($0.02 diluted earnings per share) compared to $12-million ($0.08 diluted earnings per share) in the first quarter of 2015. The reduction in net earnings was driven by weaker selling prices across all nutrients. This was largely offset by excellent results achieved from our Retail operations and strong Wholesale operational performance. Highlights: First quarter adjusted net earnings were $7-million or $0.05 per share (see page 2 for adjusted net earnings reconciliation)1. Retail achieved the second highest EBITDA2 for a first quarter, with strong margins across all major product lines. International Retail delivered strong results, with South America achieving record first quarter EBITDA, and Australia reaching record first quarter in local currency. Wholesale continues to achieve impressive operational performance. This quarter, nitrogen margins remained strong despite much lower benchmark prices. Agrium acquired 27 Retail locations through acquisitions in Canada and the U.S., adding expected annual incremental EBITDA of over $11-million. We achieved a 6 percent reduction in consolidated selling, general and administrative costs compared to the same period last year, demonstrating the ongoing results of our Operational Excellence initiative. 2016 annual guidance range has been revised to $5.25 to $6.25 diluted earnings per share due to the weak outlook for nutrient prices (see page 4 for guidance assumptions and further details). \"Agrium's first quarter results once again highlight the resilience of our business model,\" commented Chuck Magro, Agrium's President and CEO. \"Our Retail business achieved impressive first quarter EBITDA, with strong margins across all major product lines. Our Wholesale business unit continued to demonstrate excellent operating performance and capitalized on our extensive competitive advantages,\" added Mr. Magro. First quarter effective tax rate of 29 percent used for adjusted net earnings and per share calculations. These are non-IFRS measures which represent net earnings adjusted for certain income (expenses) that are considered to be non-operational in nature. We believe these measures provide meaningful comparison to the earnings of other companies by eliminating share-based payments expense (recovery), gains (losses) on foreign exchange and related gains (losses) on non-qualifying derivative hedges and significant non-operating, non-recurring items. These should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS and may not be directly comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Earnings (loss) from continuing operations before finance costs, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. MARKET OUTLOOK Agricultural & Crop Input Markets U.S. grower margins and grower sentiment have improved over the past month. This was a result of U.S. new crop corn futures having increased by approximately 5 percent from the lows at the beginning of April, while new crop soybean prices have increased by 16 percent since early March and are now at the highest level since December 2014. As a result, growers' prospective 2016 cash margins are up from 2015 levels, the first year-over-year improvement in two and four years respectively. The United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Prospective Plantings report estimated that U.S. growers intend to plant 93.6 million acres of corn, which would be an increase of 5.6 million acres or about 6 percent from 2015 levels. Agrium believes corn acreage expansion this year will be closer to 5 percent, as soybean prices have strengthened in response to damaging rains during harvest in Argentina. According to the most recent USDA forecasts, U.S. acreage of corn, soybean and cotton could increase by over 6 million acres, supporting crop input and services demand in 2016. However, in Canada it is expected that pea and lentil acreage will expand by almost 2 million acres, which could negatively impact Western Canadian demand for nitrogen this year. The spring season across North America began early, which tends to support higher acreage levels, as well as the premium for North American crop nutrient prices. This has been most evident on nitrogen products. It also tends to bring forward timing of crop protection product applications. In Western Canada, there are some regional concerns about dryness as precipitation has been below normal the past two months. The value of the U.S. dollar has weakened relative to most other global currencies since the beginning of 2016, but non-U.S. currency values still remain weak on a historic basis. A relatively weak currency shields non-U.S. growers from the impact of low global crop prices and has supported relatively high crop acreage outside of the U.S. This is primarily why Brazil had such a strong acreage of second crop corn this year which supported stronger than expected crop nutrient shipments in Brazil to start 2016. Nitrogen Outlook North American nitrogen prices increased beginning in February 2016, driven by a relatively early start to the spring application season, combined with relatively low volumes of offshore imports. In January to February 2016, U.S. offshore imports of urea were down close to 40 percent compared to the same period of 2015. Due to the poor 2015 fall application season in the U.S. and the high corn acreage intentions for 2016 projected by the USDA, U.S. spring nitrogen applications are expected to be historically high. Nitrogen projects in North America are expected to continue to ramp up in 2016, which is expected to keep buyers tentative entering the fill season in the second half of the year. Chinese urea exports were down by 1.5 million tonnes in first quarter of 2016 from Q1 2015 levels due to strong domestic demand in China and low export urea prices to begin 2016. Chinese urea production levels in the first quarter of 2016 were relatively flat to the same period of 2015, but did decline about 10 percent from the high levels in the fourth quarter of 2015. Indian urea imports were lower in the first quarter of 2016 than they were a year ago. However, India recently called a tender for imports for its 2016/17 year. While imports are expected to decline from record 2015 levels, they are expected to be historically high, particularly if the monsoon season is above-average, as projected by the India Meteorological Department. Potash Outlook A number of factors combined to pressure the North American potash market in the first quarter including: the poor fall application season, which created a bottleneck in the supply chain with potash being stored in warehouses rather applied in the fall;; and above-average offshore imports of potash. While first quarter 2016 North American offshore imports of potash were down close to 50 percent from 2015 levels, they were still above any other year since 2011. U.S. potash prices are below other global import levels, which are expected to continue to pressure imports relative to 2015 levels. Brazilian potash demand has been a positive surprise to start 2016, with first quarter imports up over 20 percent from the first quarter of 2015. The uncertainty over the Brazilian political and economic situation will be a source of uncertainty for the remainder of 2016. China has yet to sign 2016 potash supply agreements, which continues to add uncertainty to the global potash market. Chinese import volumes will be an important driver of the potash market in the second half of 2016. The Indian government announced modest changes to the Nutrient Based Subsidy (NBS) for potash in 2016/17, which improves the import economics and should support improved import demand in the second half of 2016. Phosphate Outlook North American phosphate demand is projected to be relatively strong in the spring of 2016 due to the poor fall application season and relative stability in prices, which have increased from the January 2016 lows. Chinese phosphate exports have declined compared to 2015 levels, in part because of lower import demand from India. Similar to potash, the changes in the NBS for phosphate in India appear positive for second half diammonium phosphate demand, but most analysts expect reduced demand in 2016 from 2015 levels. 2016 ANNUAL GUIDANCE Based on our Market Outlook, Agrium expects to achieve annual diluted earnings per share of $5.25 to $6.25 in 2016 compared to our previous estimate of $5.50 to $7.00. We have lowered the guidance range due to a challenging pricing environment for all nutrients and expectations for a stronger Canadian dollar, partially offset by lower natural gas costs and continued strong performance by our Retail business. We are issuing earnings guidance of $4.00 to $4.30 diluted earnings per share for the first half of 2016. We have reduced our estimate of potash production to 2.3 to 2.4 million tonnes. Retail crop nutrient sales tonnes for 2016 are now expected to be from 9.8 million to 10.3 million tonnes. The slight widening of the range from our previous estimate is due to a forecasted increase in U.S. planted corn acres. Our estimates for the Canada/U.S. foreign exchange rate and NYMEX for 2016 have been updated based on current market conditions. This guidance and updated additional measures and related assumptions are summarized in the table below. Guidance excludes the impact of share-based payments expense (recovery), gains (losses) on foreign exchange and non-qualifying derivative hedges and significant non-operating, non-recurring items. Volumetric and earnings estimates assume normal seasonal growing and harvest patterns in the geographies where Agrium operates. 2016 ANNUAL GUIDANCE RANGE AND ASSUMPTIONS  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Unless otherwise noted, all financial information in this Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is prepared using accounting policies in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and is presented in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 - Interim Financial Reporting.

In respect of Forward-Looking Statements, please refer to the section titled \"Forward-Looking Statements\" in this MD&A. 2016 First Quarter Operating Results CONSOLIDATED NET EARNINGS Financial Overview  Retail's sales and gross profit increased for the first quarter of 2016 compared to the same period last year primarily due to higher crop protection product and seed sales from early spring application season and increased corn acreage. This was coupled with better margin rates on our major product lines due to effective price management, change in product mix and higher proprietary product sales. Wholesale sales and gross profit decreased compared to the first quarter last year primarily due to lower realized selling prices, which were consistent with benchmark prices and the scale back of our Purchase for Resale business. This was partially offset by the increase in potash sales volumes due to higher utilization rates in the first quarter of 2016. Expenses General and administrative expenses decreased by $12-million (18 percent) for the first quarter compared to the same period last year as a result of reduced payroll and office expenses related to our ongoing Operational Excellence program. Share-based payments expense was lower by $41-million compared to first quarter of last year primarily due to a decrease in Agrium's share price in the first quarter of 2016.  Effective Tax Rate The effective tax rate of 29 percent for the first quarter of 2016 was higher compared to the effective tax rate of 26 percent for the same period last year due to the increase in the Alberta provincial statutory tax rate and the tax treatment of losses on derivative financial instruments. Retail reported record first quarter sales and the second highest first quarter gross profit and EBITDA in history. The strong results were due to strong margins across our major product offerings and lower operating costs, an early start to the spring application season in the U.S. and record results in our South American operations. Total Retail selling expenses as a percentage of sales decreased by 1 percent compared to the same period in the prior year due to ongoing network optimization and the impact of currency valuations in our international businesses. U.S. operations experienced strong demand this quarter for all major crop inputs, supported by missed fall applications in 2015 due to poor weather, the early spring season this year and grower intentions to expand acreage of crop input intensive crops such as corn and cotton in 2016. Our Canadian business experienced a relatively slow first quarter which is historically its quietest period during the year, while the second quarter is traditionally the busiest. Internationally, South American EBITDA increase of $7-million was a significant improvement compared to the same period last year as a result of favorable growing conditions and improved agricultural policies in Argentina. Australia reported record Australia dollar EBITDA due to strong demand for crop protection, seed and other services but were slightly below last year on a U.S. dollar basis. Retail sales and gross profit by product line  Crop nutrients Total crop nutrient sales were 8 percent lower compared to the same period last year due to lower global prices across all nutrients. Total crop nutrient volumes were 4 percent higher this quarter across our Retail operations compared to the same period last year. Volumes were 15 percent higher in the U.S. due to an early spring application season and 9 percent higher in South America due to favorable weather conditions. In Canada and Australia, growers were conservative given the uncertainty over nutrient and agricultural markets as well as dry conditions in some areas. Total crop nutrient gross profit increased 6 percent due to a combination of higher-value product mix, including continued growth of our higher-margin proprietary nutritional products, increased nutrient volumes and higher margins per tonne for nutrients. Gross profit as a percentage of sales rose from 14 percent in the first quarter of 2015 to 16 percent this quarter. Crop protection products Total crop protection sales were up 5 percent this quarter as North American growers took advantage of the favorable weather to apply herbicides to control weeds, which were prevalent due to the early spring and wet weather last fall which limited post-harvest herbicide applications. In Australia, sales were higher compared to the same period last year due to early rains in the western growing regions and increased sales of proprietary products, despite competitive pricing pressure on glyphosate and herbicides. Crop protection margins as a percentage of sales increased 1 percent, primarily due to higher-margin product mix this quarter. Proprietary crop protection product sales as a percentage of total crop protection sales increased 3 percent compared to the same period in the prior year. Seed Seed sales were up 22 percent this quarter compared to the same period last year, primarily due to the expected increase in 2016 planted acreage for corn and cotton in the U.S. and the early planting window. Total seed margins as a percentage of sales increased 1 percent compared to the same period in the prior year due to seed sales mix and strong sales of higher-margin proprietary product seed. The proportion of proprietary seed sales was 3 percent higher than in the first quarter of 2015 and margins for proprietary seed were also higher year-over-year. Merchandise Merchandise sales decreased 18 percent compared to the same period last year primarily as a result of lower fuel pricing and demand in Canada, and lower animal health sales in Australia. Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased 2 percent this quarter, primarily due to a reduction in the lower-margin Canadian fuel business compared to the prior year. Services and other Sales for services and other was up 17 percent this quarter, due mainly to the early spring application season in the U.S. and higher real estate and livestock marketing revenue in Australia. Wholesale Three months ended March 31,  Nitrogen Nitrogen gross profit was down 34 percent compared to the same period last year predominately due to significantly lower global benchmark nitrogen prices, which were partially offset by lower cost of production. Sales volumes were slightly lower than the same period last year, as Western Canadian dealers were slow to commit to nitrogen purchases early in the season. However demand in the U.S. was strong due to the early start to the spring application season, which supported increased ammonia sales volumes. Realized selling prices per tonne were down 18 percent compared to the same period last year due to weaker global market conditions impacting benchmark nitrogen prices. Cost of product sold per tonne was 8 percent lower than the same period last year due to lower natural gas prices and lower fixed costs per tonne during the quarter. Natural gas prices: North American indices and North American Agrium prices  Potash Potash gross profit doubled compared to the same period last year. The reduction in realized selling price this quarter was offset by lower cost of product sold per tonne and significantly higher sales volumes given that the same period last year was impacted by the ramp-up of our Vanscoy potash mine expansion. Sales volumes increased by 271,000 tonnes compared to the same period last year and by 28,000 tonnes compared to the first quarter of 2014. 2014 is a more comparable period given the Vanscoy ramp-up was underway in the first quarter of 2015, which impacted available sales volumes. Realized selling prices have contracted sharply over the past year, with international sales prices down 22 percent and an even larger decline in North American markets. Cost of product sold per tonne was 48 percent lower than the same period last year and 12 percent lower than the first quarter of 2014. The lower costs are predominately due to the higher production volumes associated with the completion of our Vanscoy mine expansion and the weaker Canadian dollar. Phosphate Phosphate gross profit was 56 percent lower than the same period last year, due to a combination of lower benchmark selling prices, lower sales volumes and a slight increase in cost of product sold on a per-tonne basis relative to the same period last year. Sales volumes were 22 percent lower than the same period last year due to slow spring demand in Canada and the Western U.S., as dealers in these regions delayed purchasing due to higher supply in the market. Wholesale Other Wholesale Other: gross profit breakdown  Gross profit from Wholesale Other was down 38 percent over the same quarter last year. This was predominately due to lower realized sales prices for ammonium sulfate and ESN, in line with other nitrogen products, and lower sales volumes partly related to the scale back in our product purchased for resale operations. Expenses Wholesale expenses decreased by $6-million (15 percent) after adjusting for a $38-million gain on the sale of non-core purchase for resale terminals that was included in the results from the same period last year. Other EBITDA for our Other non-operating business unit for the first quarter of 2016 had a net expense of $18-million, compared to a net expense of $88-million for the first quarter of 2015. The variance was primarily due to the following: $41-million lower share-based payments expense due to a decrease in our share price in the first quarter of 2016 $20-million lower gross profit elimination expense primarily due to lower margin per tonne on inter-segment inventory held at the end of the first quarter of 2016 $6-million (19 percent) lower general and administrative expenses due to ongoing benefits from our Operational Excellence program and the lower Canadian dollar FINANCIAL CONDITION The following are changes to working capital on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for the three months ended March 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Agrium generally expects that it will be able to meet its working capital requirements, capital resource needs and shareholder returns through a variety of sources, including available cash on hand, cash provided by operations, short-term borrowings from the issuance of commercial paper, and borrowings from our credit facilities, as well as long-term debt and equity capacity from the capital markets. As of March 31, 2016, we have sufficient current assets to meet our current liabilities. Summary of Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Below is a summary of our cash provided by or used in operating, investing, and financing activities as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:  Our investing capital expenditures decreased in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the same period last year due to the ramp-up of our Vanscoy potash facility in the first quarter of 2015 combined with decreased spending for the Borger project. We expect Agrium's capital expenditures for the remaining three quarters of 2016 to approximate $600-million to $700-million. We anticipate that we will be able to finance the announced projects through a combination of cash provided from operating activities and existing credit facilities. Short-term Debt Our short-term debt of $629-million at March 31, 2016 is outlined in note 6 of our Summarized Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our short-term debt decreased by $206-million during the three months ended March 31, 2016, which in turn contributed to an increase in our unutilized short-term financing capacity to $2.2-billion at March 31, 2016. Capital Management Our revolving credit facilities require that we maintain specific interest coverage and debt-to-capital ratios, as well as other non-financial covenants as defined in our credit agreements. We were in compliance with all covenants at March 31, 2016. Our ability to comply with these covenants has not changed since December 31, 2015. SHARE REPURCHASES We are allowed to purchase for cancellation, on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) or New York Stock Exchange an aggregate of 6,908,450 common shares (5 percent) of our outstanding shares. Repurchases may be made under a Normal Course Issuer Bid (NCIB) approved by the TSX until February 18, 2017. The actual number of shares purchased will be at Agrium's discretion and will depend on market conditions, share prices, Agrium's cash position and other factors. There were no shares repurchased for the three months ended March 31, 2016 or the period from April 1, 2016 to May 3, 2016. Shareholders can obtain a copy of the NCIB notice submitted to the TSX from Agrium without charge upon request. OUTSTANDING SHARE DATA Agrium had 138,175,400 outstanding shares at April 29, 2016.  The agricultural products business is seasonal. Consequently, year-over-year comparisons are more appropriate than quarter-over-quarter comparisons. Crop input sales are primarily concentrated in the spring and fall crop input application seasons. Crop nutrient inventories are normally accumulated leading up to each application season. Our cash collections from accounts receivables generally occur after the application season is complete, and our customer prepayments are concentrated in December and January. NON-IFRS FINANCIAL MEASURES Financial measures that are not specified, defined or determined under IFRS are non-IFRS measures unless they are presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Accordingly, we have not identified any non-IFRS financial measures. We presented EBITDA in our 2015 annual consolidated financial statements and accordingly, it is not a non-IFRS measure. Effective January 1, 2016, management no longer considers \"Adjusted EBITDA\" in evaluating our business performance and expects to focus more on our other key earnings measures. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES We prepare our financial statements in accordance with IFRS, which requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates in applying accounting policies. For further information on the Company's critical accounting estimates, refer to the section \"Critical Accounting Estimates\" in our 2015 annual MD&A, which is contained in our 2015 Annual Report. Since the date of our 2015 annual MD&A, there have not been any material changes to our critical accounting estimates.

THE INDUSTRY Mining Facts Minerals and metals are the building blocks of the computers and smartphones we rely on, of the vehicles and public transit that get us places, of the buildings where we live and work, and of green technologies that help make the world a more sustainable place. Just as we as individuals depend on mining to support our daily lives, Canada relies on the industry to keep the economy humming. Mining is one of Canada's most important economic sectors and a major job creator. A major employer: Approximately 380,000 people across Canada work in the mining and mineral processing industries. Mining is the largest private sector employer of Aboriginal peoples in Canada on a proportional basis, and employment is poised to increase. Canada has one of the largest mining supply sectors globally with more than 3,400 companies supplying engineering, geotechnical, environmental, financial and other services to mining operations. Those who work in mining enjoy the highest wages and salaries of all industrial sectors in Canada with an average annual pay exceeding $110,000, which surpassed the average earnings of workers in forestry, manufacturing, finance and construction by a range of $31,000 to $46,000 for those sectors. An economic engine: Mining contributed $54 billion to Canada's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2013. The industry accounted for 19.6% of the value of Canadian goods exports in 2013. Canada's value of mineral production was nearly $43.6 billion in 2013. The mining industry's payments to Canadian federal and provincial governments total $71 billion in taxes and royalties over the last decade (2003-2012). A global leader: Thanks to its rich geology, Canada is one of the largest mining nations in the world producing more than 60 minerals and metals. Canada ranks in the top five countries in the global production of 11 major minerals and metals: First in potash Second in uranium and cobalt Third in aluminum and tungsten Fourth in platinum group metals, sulphur and titanium Fifth in nickel and diamonds 57% of the world's public mining companies are listed on the TSX and TSX-Venture Exchanges. Together, the two exchanges handled 48% of global mining equity transactions in 2013, and accounted for 46% of global mining equity capital for that year. Globally, Canada is recognized for its leadership in safety and sustainability. Mining companies in Canada were the first in the world to develop an externally-verified performance system for sustainable mining practices with the creation of MAC's Towards Sustainable Mining initiative in 2004."}, {"title": "Press Release: Agrium Shareholders Vote in Line With Management's Recommendations for All Resolutions at the Annual Shareholders Meeting", "article": "Agrium Shareholders Vote in Line With Management's Recommendations for All Resolutions at the Annual Shareholders Meeting All Amounts Are Stated In U.S.$ CALGARY, AB--(Marketwired - May 04, 2016) - Agrium Inc.

(TSX:RME, OTCQX:RCKXF) announces 2016 first quarter results", "article": "Rocky Mountain Dealerships Inc. (TSX:RME, OTCQX:RCKXF) announces 2016 first quarter results Canada NewsWire CALGARY, May 2, 2016 CALGARY, May 2, 2016 /CNW/ - Rocky Mountain Dealerships Inc. (hereinafter \"Rocky\") today reported its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. SUMMARY OF THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2016  (1) (--) (See further discussion in \"Non-IFRS Measures\" and \"Reconciliation of Non-IFRS Measures to IFRS\" sections below.) \"In 2015, we successfully implemented a number of cost containment strategies, and, as demonstrated by our results this quarter, these strategies continue to provide meaningful reductions to our fixed cost structure,\" stated Garrett Ganden, President & Chief Executive Officer of Rocky. \"The seasonal nature of Rocky's core business means that our first quarter typically sees lower activity levels. That said, we are pleased with the overall outcome for this quarter, and feel that we are on the right track for 2016. We continue our theme from 2015 of setting the groundwork for future growth. To that end, we amalgamated stores in certain strategic locations, which will allow us to leverage our strength as a consolidator across the prairies to deliver the same level of service and territory management at a lower fixed cost. This contributed in large measure to our ability to deliver consistent profitability, despite a reduction in top line revenues. \"Western Canadian agriculture is a strong market at present. Farmer balance sheets are strong, commodity prices are healthy, and overall grower sentiment is positive. In these favorable market conditions, it will be incumbent on Rocky to show our customers the kind of continuing value proposition we can provide, be it in new and used equipment, product support, or our ancillary services such as precision farming. And in that regard, we feel confident that we have the right team in place to keep Rocky as the safe, dependable equipment partner of choice in Western Canada.\" Rocky Announces Accretive Restructuring of its Industrial Equipment Distribution Rocky announced today that it will be making fundamental changes to its industrial equipment distribution strategy. As part of this restructuring, Rocky will be amalgamating its industrial distribution facilities located in Calgary and Red Deer, Alberta into existing agriculture facilities located in those areas. Commenting on this restructuring, Mr. Ganden noted, \"After careful consideration, and after consulting with our key stakeholders, we have made the decision to effect this accretive restructuring. This change in our distribution model will enhance our current territory coverage, and will eliminate the costs associated with operating and maintaining multiple physical locations in the same trade area. These locations, as well as our two former Edmonton facilities which were also recently amalgamated, have historically incurred annual facility and other administrative costs of approximately $3.0 million, which we expect to discontinue once the amalgamations have been completed during the third quarter of 2016. We expect to incur one-time costs of $2.5 -- $3.0 million in the second and third quarters of this year.\" Quarterly Cash Dividend On May 2, 2016, Rocky's Board of Directors (the \"Board\") approved a quarterly dividend of $0.115 per common share on its outstanding common shares. The common share dividend is payable on June 30, 2016, to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 31, 2016. This dividend is designated by Rocky to be an \"eligible dividend\" for the purposes of the Income Tax Act (Canada) and any similar provincial or territorial legislation. An enhanced dividend tax credit applies to \"eligible dividends\" paid to Canadian residents. Please consult with your own tax advisor for advice with respect to the income tax consequences to you from Rocky designating its dividends as \"eligible dividends.\" Investors are cautioned that quarterly dividends remain subject to approval by Rocky's Board, and that the Board may, at any time, increase, decrease or suspend payment of the dividend.

The people at the controls - University of Regina engineering students Sam Dietrich, Joshua Friedrick and Caleb Friedrick - are metres away, guiding the tractor's path from a laptop. The students have spent months tweaking their design to get it ready for this week's agBOT competition in Rockville, Ind., where they'll finally show offtheir technology as the only Canadian university team. The goal is, pulling a seeder, the tractor will plant corn in a halfmile field. \"We've been putting in 18-hour days, I slept like four hours last night, because we're just working all the time,\" Joshua Friedrick said Friday in a field near Pense. The students - all interested in robotics - are competing against six other teams, including some from top American engineering schools like Ohio State and Purdue. \"It'll be good to see how we stack up against these big schools,\" said Dietrich. Their work began in September with initial proposals and design. They got their 26-horsepower tractor in mid-January. They wrote a ton of code - mostly \"learning as we go,\" said Dietrich. With advice from technologist Dean Kertai, they adapted the tractor and ran tests in Dietrich's garage. It's \"completely different\" to see it working in a field, said Caleb, where \"we draw circles and it drives them\" using GPS. With a keystroke, a seeding area can be determined; the tractor's speed and seed rate can be adjusted; a mission can be adapted or cancelled. After walking through all of that technical stuff, Caleb modestly agreed, \"Yeah, it's pretty good.\" And it's easy to use, in spite of the \"sleek\" technology, said Dietrich. \"It'll do all the planting, everything, all by itself and be able to send feedback back to the user, so the user can see where the seeds were planted and different stats from the tractor,\" said Joshua. This is a small tractor, little bigger than a riding lawn mower - that kept the project \"as low-cost as we could make it,\" said Dietrich. But the technology is scalable - it could be applied to a much larger tractor. It's also multipurpose: Aside from planting crops, \"it could be used in autonomous grain carts or it could be used in cultivating,\" or any other areas of agriculture that aren't currently being automated, said Dietrich. \"Farming, it's an industry that has yet to see a ton of automation,\" said Dietrich, which means this technology \"has profound implications that are kind of hard to even understand what they could be.\" That said, \"Farming itself isn't very simple anymore these days, obviously everyone knows it's becoming quite complex and competitive, there's a lot of precision agriculture going on,\" said Joshua. \"I think farmers are all for things that increase their yield and decrease their time, so I think any farmer would be interested in anything that's going to help them plant better and have more crop,\" said Dietrich. \"If anyone wants to hire us, we'll plant their farm with corn.

(TSX:RME, OTCQX:RCKXF) ANNOUNCES 2016 FIRST QUARTER RESULTS Rocky Mountain Dealerships Inc. has released its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. Summary of the quarter ended March 31, 2016: - The company amalgamated two industrial facilities in Edmonton, Alta., and amalgamated its Bow Island, Alta., agriculture location with the company's Taber and Medicine Hat, Alta., locations. - It completed the construction of its new state-of-the-art facility in Yorkton, Sask. - Used equipment inventory declined by $10.9-million or 3.8 per cent. - Total revenues declined by 14.0 per cent to $189.5-million. - The agriculture segment product support revenues reported a 10th-consecutive quarter of growth versus the comparable period in the prior year, a trend beginning at the inception of the segment. - Gross margin increased to 14.9 per cent, up from 14.3 per cent in the first quarter of 2015. - Gross profit decreased by 10.1 per cent to $28.3-million. - Operating selling, general and administrative costs (1) were reduced by $2.9-million or 11.6 per cent to $22.4-million. - Adjusted diluted earnings per share (1) were two cents as compared with three cents in the first quarter of 2015. - Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (1) declined by $500,000 to $2.7-million. (1) A non-international financial reporting standard \"In 2015, we successfully implemented a number of cost-containment strategies, and, as demonstrated by our results this quarter, these strategies continue to provide meaningful reductions to our fixed-cost structure,\" stated Garrett Ganden, president and chief executive officer of Rocky. \"The seasonal nature of Rocky's core business means that our first quarter typically sees lower activity levels. That said, we are pleased with the overall outcome for this quarter, and feel that we are on the right track for 2016. We continue our theme from 2015 of setting the groundwork for future growth. To that end, we amalgamated stores in certain strategic locations, which will allow us to leverage our strength as a consolidator across the Prairies to deliver the same level of service and territory management at a lower fixed cost. This contributed in large measure to our ability to deliver consistent profitability, despite a reduction in top-line revenues. \"Western Canadian agriculture is a strong market at present. Farmer balance sheets are strong, commodity prices are healthy and overall grower sentiment is positive. In these favourable market conditions, it will be incumbent on Rocky to show our customers the kind of continuing-value proposition we can provide, be it in new and used equipment, product support, or our ancillary services, such as precision farming, and in that regard, we feel confident that we have the right team in place to keep Rocky as the safe, dependable equipment partner of choice in Western Canada.\" Rocky announces accretive restructuring of its industrial equipment distribution Rocky announced today that it will be making fundamental changes to its industrial equipment distribution strategy. As part of this restructuring, Rocky will be amalgamating its industrial distribution facilities located in Calgary and Red Deer, Alta., into existing agriculture facilities located in those areas. Commenting on this restructuring, Mr. Ganden noted: \"After careful consideration, and after consulting with our key stakeholders, we have made the decision to effect this accretive restructuring. This change in our distribution model will enhance our current territory coverage, and will eliminate the costs associated with operating and maintaining multiple physical locations in the same trade area. These locations, as well as our two former Edmonton facilities, which were also recently amalgamated, have historically incurred annual facility and other administrative costs of approximately $3.0-million, which we expect to discontinue once the amalgamations have been completed during the third quarter of 2016. We expect to incur one-time costs of $2.5-million to $3.0-million in the second and third quarters of this year.\" Quarterly cash dividend On May 2, 2016, Rocky's board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of 11.5 cents per common share on its outstanding common shares. The common share dividend is payable on June 30, 2016, to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 31, 2016. This dividend is designated by Rocky to be an eligible dividend for the purposes of the Income Tax Act (Canada) and any similar provincial or territorial legislation. An enhanced dividend tax credit applies to eligible dividends paid to Canadian residents. Please consult with your own tax adviser for advice with respect to the income tax consequences to you from Rocky designating its dividends as eligible dividends. Investors are cautioned that quarterly dividends remain subject to approval by Rocky's board and that the board may, at any time, increase, decrease or suspend payment of the dividend.

It's a nice building, but too small for the number of engineers it needs and the rising production to satisfy global customers of its precision positioning technology. After joining the company in 2009, president and CEO Michael Ritter added space for another 50 staff. Unable to expand further, he went in search of a suitable property and a reputable developer. The Colliers International team of Peter and Justin Mayerchak were brought in and the decision was made to hire Remington Development. An early challenge was that none of the land in Remington's portfolio fit Ritter's needs, which included an unobstructed view from roof to sky with no nearby tall buildings, so his scientists could conduct GPS testing. The search concluded the best option was to build in The District, Melcor's development offCountry Hills Boulevard west of Deerfoot Trail N.E., where a 7.9-acre site was bought by Remington. Designed by IBI Group with interiors by Shearer Design, the almost 200,000-square-foot building will house administration, engineering research and development. Also included is 16,000 square feet of manufacturing floor space that can be more than doubled if the need arises. Ritter said the company dedicates 30 per cent of its annual revenues to research and development in its many endeavours, including automated precision agriculture, driverless vehicles, machine control, military applications and fighting GPS interference on the London skyline. \"In all cases, the need for precision knowledge of position - absolute or relative - is a fundamental capability for successful operations,\" said Peter Soar, business development manager, military and defence. NovAtel is a powerful global brand, yet its logo is rarely seen as it manufactures for others. If you travel by plane, drive a tractor or glance up at a police helicopter you are close to a NovAtel electronic part. Its new building is to be called Hexagon Calgary Campus after the parent company. Hexagon, a Swedish-based firm with a management office in London, England, purchased NovAtel in 2008 and its sister company, Intergraph, in 2010. Ritter, a trained geodesist who joined NovAtel from Trimble Navigation in California, is president of position intelligence for Hexagon. His Calgary operations employ more than 400 staff. Ritter is confident that after managing the huge and complicated move - particularly of its highly technical assembly positions - into Hexagon Calgary Campus, he will be looking to hire another 200, primarily in software engineering.

The Globe and Mail apologizes to Mr. Ausubel. Leapers are heading down the wrong path: Technology is liberating the environment We have new neighbours near our place in the country - bears. Every so often, one shows up and gets his picture in the local paper, the Echo. People swear they've even seen wolves - creatures that were driven out long ago after farmers moved in and chopped down all the trees. At the turn of the last century, the countryside was much less pretty than it is now. The soil was so badly eroded that large parts of the area had turned into sand dunes. But today, nature is making a comeback. Farming has become vastly more productive, and much of the more marginal agricultural land is wild again. The dunes turned into fields, and the fields turned into woods. The odd bear can make a living there - to say nothing of deer, wild turkeys and the various critters that love to feast on my garden. Our countryside is getting greener, because of progress. This is what the green elites of the wealthy North want - I mean you, Avi and Naomi, and your merry band of actors, writers and professors who signed on to the Leap Manifesto. They want to take us back to a romantic world of small-scale, low-yield, subsistence farming that would in fact require far more land and far more labour than we use now. It is the worst prescription for the planet you could possibly imagine. Agriculture has always been the greatest destroyer of nature, and Leap's dream of turning the clock back would spell far more destruction than exists already. The deep hostility of the green elites to technological progress is not just some harmless fantasy. As populations soar in Africa, they are doing grievous harm to its environment and economy - as well as to hundreds of millions of people - through their implacable resistance to genetically modified organisms (GMOs). The poor desperately need access to more nutritious, higher yielding and drought-resistant crops. Is it ethical to deny a hungry child food because of entirely theoretical risks? Greens say yes. The green war against GMOs is a war on the least privileged people on Earth, waged by the most privileged. Technology is saving the environment, not destroying it. Thanks to technology, we are on the brink of a great reversal of land use. Consider this: It's estimated that the world uses 68 per cent less land to produce the same quantity of crops as 50 years ago. We've done this without a massive increase in fertilizer and chemicals. One recent study found that high-yield farmers in the European Union increased their yields by 22 per cent while also reducing their chemical pesticide use by 37 per cent. \"This is the story of precision agriculture, in which we use more bits, not more kilowatts or gal-lons,\" writes Jesse Ausubel, director of the Program for the Human Environment at Rockefeller University. Mr. Ausubel is among a new breed of environmentalists who believe in the power of technology to liberate the environment and \"rewild\" the planet. He argues that we may already have reached \"peak farmland\" - not because we've run out of land, but because farmers are so successful at producing protein and calories. If we can get a grip on food waste, stop producing corn to feed cars, boost yields to the level of the most productive farmers and eat more food that is efficient to produce (such as chicken instead of beef), we could liberate an area the size of India from agricultural production. We may have reached \"peak timber\" too. Tree plantations in warm climates are far more productive than natural forests in cold climates, and are becoming a much bigger source of wood. At the same time, our use of wood is on the decline. These trends mean that the world's biomass is increasing. Progressive environmentalists such as Mr. Ausubel argue that we are reaching the age of the great \"decoupling,\" in which economic growth is no longer automatically tied to more resource consumption. The United States today uses less water than it did in 1970. Air pollution has declined steeply. We may have even reached peak car. And now we have a new gamechanger, in the form of a revolutionary gene-editing tool called CRISPR. This tool (whose name is short for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) offers a new level of speed, precision and versatility, and opens the door to vast new food production improvements. It does so without introducing foreign genes - the source of the objections to GMOs. The U.S. government has said that for this reason, CRISPR-edited crops won't be regulated. As a result of CRISPR, we will tread more lightly on the planet. No doubt the Leapers will fight CRISPR, too. They would rather have the world's billions eating mouldy, stunted potatoes that exhaust the soil and suck up all the water. Before they foist their manifesto on the rest of us, maybe they should try it for themselves."}, {"title": "Podcast: Deveron Unmanned Aerial Systems VP David MacMillan on how drones are transforming agriculture", "article": "Deveron Resources Ltd (CVE:DVR) offers some of the most advanced Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) sensors, analytical software and pilots to help farmers incorporate high-resolution aerial imagery to increase yields and reduce costs all while managing agricultural workflow processes. James West: David, thanks for joining us today. David MacMillan: Thanks for having me, guys. I'm really excited to be here. James West: David, let's start with, what is the value proposition for investors in Deveron UAVs? David MacMillan: Deveron UAVs is really a service based business, so what we're doing is creating a network of UAVs and pilots that are situated across the province and then across Canada, that will be collecting aerial imagery for farmland operators. So really what we're saying is, it's a very complicated space for the average grower to get involved in; we're sifting through all that knowledge and then we are creating a service based business where every other month, we're out on the farm creating data for people and giving them actionable decisions. Related Andrew Krystal: What about macro issues in agriculture, and how that fits in with the technology? David MacMillan: Yeah, I think it's one of these major themes that Silicon Valley has been trying to figure out. In 2014, we saw about $1.5 billion flow into Ag-tech; in 2015, it was 4.9 billion. So the question of how do we solve 10 billion that need to eat, by 2050, is something that's really interesting. And I think at the end of the day, we look at where yields improved last, and that last bump came in the 1960s with chemicals. So now, we really need to figure out how to use technology, and that's directly what drones do. James West: Okay. So your drones specifically are designed to improve the inputs in farmers' decision-making process so that they get better yields, more crops per acre? David MacMillan: Yeah. That's basically the underlying. Right now, the average farmer will look at his field and he applies inputs on a very basic level; it's the same everywhere. We're saying, you should be using imagery to identify what's happening in season and make variability decisions. So rather than putting the same amount of nitrogen down on XY parts of the field, we should be putting maybe more on in parts that need it, and less on in parts that don't. Andrew Krystal: So your customers: big agriculture, who else? David MacMillan: Big Ag is obviously where we're headed; being a startup, we're trying to focus on those that can have the most impact for us. At the end of the day, though, anybody that is in the agriculture business as a service provider, whether that be for nitrogen, chemicals, seeds, can come to us and we can help their users improve the profitability of their field. James West: Interesting. So what is the status of Transport Canada regulations governing commercial deployment of drones in that agricultural space? David MacMillan: To be honest, we've spent a year working on how are we going to be in drones, and Ag was the thing that really jumped up for me because the regulation is less restrictive. When you're looking at flying drones, obviously in a big city like Toronto, there's lots of issues with big buildings and flights... James West: Pigeons. David MacMillan: Pigeons, exactly, peregrine falcons, whatever that might be. But when we go out to the Peterborough area, or Huron County, there's less to deal with. So we have to file, and we have to have a special flight operator's certificate, which we have, but the restrictions on when you can fly are a lot less onerous. Andrew Krystal: Let's talk again about sort of the process. The drones go out and they will do, using sensors, a review of the agricultural space, moisture levels, etcetera. How does that data help the farmer? Let's talk about the end user for the drones. David MacMillan: Yeah, so and I think this is a place where the media has done a very bad job of promising the world to growers, and we're sitting here and saying look, drones are the future, but right now, they're used as a way to improve your efficiency in terms of crop scouting. Farmers nowadays are operating larger amounts of acres than they ever have before; nobody walks their field anymore. So what you do is, you fly the drone and we get all these images and they're stitched together, and we can see a big overview of the field, and now the guy can go out directly to these problem spot areas rather than looking at random. So that's the first targeting. Andrew Krystal: For fertilizer distribution and moisture? David MacMillan: That's where it's going. Soil moisture is something where the sensors haven't caught up yet; you can do a little bit of that with vineyards and viticulture, and that's something we're looking at as well, but predominantly it's more, how can we apply nitrogen in a better way? How can we apply fertilizer in a better way? And the basic thing that a censor gives you right now is NDVI imaging. It's nothing new, it's been around since the 1970s, but we're also working with multi-spectral imaging. So science is really excited about these different bandwidths and what we're going to see. And really Deveron's proposition this year is, collection of data; working with farmers on establishing these kinds of big problems that they're associated with, whether it be disease, fertility, fungicide applications, and really figuring out that value proposition as we go forward. James West: So are you - have clients now? You're doing this now for farmers? David MacMillan: Yeah, so Deveron acquired Eagle Scout Imaging. Eagle Scout Imaging was the most active service provider in Ontario last year. There's some guys out West that probably would compare with us in size, but I think what's really unique about us now is that we're building an enterprise to solve enterprise issues. When you look at some of the cooperatives that are based in Ontario, these guys manage 500,000, 600,000 acres, so for an individual who has one drone to go out, keep up to date with all the sensors, all the analytics that's happening in the world, it's just not feasible. When the growers come to us and say hey, I've got fields all over the province, can you help me out? That's what Deveron can do. We have pilots situated all around the province. James West: Okay. So now, how does it make money? What's the revenue model work like? David MacMillan: Very basic revenue model, just as everybody in agriculture buys everything on a per-acre basis, so that's how we sell it. So basically it's like we go out, and a farmer has a field of 100 acres or 10,000 acres or he's got 1,000 acres, and we will price it accordingly on that. James West: Oh, okay. Great. David MacMillan: And that model, they don't just get the flight, they get all the actionable data that we output from the end of it. Andrew Krystal: You guys making money now? David MacMillan: Yeah, we made money last year in 2014, and then this year is about scaling up one guy with one drone who is situated in one area of Ontario to bring it across the province. Andrew Krystal: How much will Deveron be worth five years from now? David MacMillan: Five years from now? I don't know. You can start looking at EBITDA multiples of a drone service company that's doing millions of acres. We're really excited about it, and I think the big thing is that this isn't some new harebrained idea; this is happening in France. France has been probably the leading company in terms of drone regulation, so companies have been operating since 2013, and I've been talking with them, and it's absolutely amazing what they're doing. France has about 6 million acres under management, and I think there's guys doing upwards of 2 million acres. So the market is really moving; it's real, and it's really about how are the sensors and analytics going to develop, and that's where - I mean, we were in San Francisco three weeks ago, and it is mind-blowing. You have Stanford PhDs in biomedical imagery working on agriculture now. And these guys have no way to get to a local market. So agriculture is very local-based, and Norm Lamothe, who's our head of agriculture, runs his own family farm in Peterborough, he's been buying inputs from people for the last five years, so we are getting in to see people that don't want to see anybody, usually. James West: Oh, okay. So you - they've actually got a farmer in the mix. That's a good idea. David MacMillan: Yeah, I mean, it's me here obviously thinking about how big drones are going to be, but it's solving agriculture's big issue, and I'm learning as much as I can. We spent a year developing this business, so I've obviously through osmosis learned about it, but it's obviously Norm driving the farming end of things, and I'm helping with the business development. Andrew Krystal: So the sky's the limit because drone technology is increasing tremendously. David MacMillan: It is crazy what you can do. Even last year, when you looked at NDVI imaging and plant health, was basically where it was at; now, we're getting to plant stand counting, where we can fly over a vineyard and tell them exactly what their potential yield is going to be. We're looking at thermal imaging, we're looking at multi-spectral, hyper-spectral imaging, so it's really the sky's the limit. And I think what's really exciting about it is, a lot of these programmers and analytics companies that are based in San Francisco or in Europe, none of them were farmers. So they haven't had data. So now we're going down and saying hey, guys, are you interested in working with a company that might do 100,000 acres or 500,000 acres this year? Oh, all of a sudden, what's the value of agriculture data? What's that database going to be worth? So we're really excited about that, and I think it is, it really feels transformational to me as a new market. James West: Okay. Versus what can be accomplished today, you've already listed quite a number of things, what is the future of drone agricultural technology? David MacMillan: I think the real future is this idea of nitrogen management, and obviously there's the environmental side of that, where we want to be using less nitrogen in how we produce crops. But when you look at the average corn farmer in Ontario or in Canada, they might spend $200 an acre on nitrogen, and it's costing them $700 an acre to produce corn. So it's a huge input cost, and if we can redistribute the way we use it, it has a really big influence on, at the end of the day, the farmer's pocketbook. So that's what we're really excited about, and then obviously, we've talked about the disease, the fungicide applications. It's mostly an input-driven play of really saying, rather than just putting it down as you always have, why don't we look at using data and technology to help make better decisions? James West: Interesting. Andrew Krystal: So we've got drone manufacturer, drone application, software, hardware, drone applications. I mean, this sector's big. James West: Yeah. So then, how soon do you see it until drones are everywhere in agriculture, you can't contemplate being a real farmer without a drone? How soon till that's a reality? David MacMillan: I really think it's probably not that far off. I think we're going to see improvements in sensors, and even from what we see drones for right now with imagery, there might be all sorts of other things that they're doing in terms of the internet of things flying over and collecting data that's been put in sensors in the ground. There's all sorts of weather data that's going on that might tie back in to the drone being a scout that's talking to the farmer; all this stuff is possible. So I don't know, it's one of those things where I was at a conference called Farms.com Precision Agriculture in January, and there's a bunch of leaders from the country talking about it, and they'd say, in any respect to different types of technology, or precision Ag, as it's called, we probably have adoption rates of 25 per cent, 30 per cent, in varying parts of the country. Imagery maybe plays a 12.5 per cent to 20 per cent role in the average farmer's decision. So we've gotten over the role of tinkerers; it's now about getting growers the opportunity to use it. Andrew Krystal: Well, even yield projections, if you have a really bad weather system in, they're going to want to do damage surveys just like in WWII they did bombing surveys. David MacMillan: Yeah, it's funny. You start talking to people in agriculture about, well, I have this network; we're building a network of drone pilots and collectors of data, the world's your oyster, start thinking about it. And now, once we start getting it in everybody's hands and let the farmers drive the decision-making and, 'Hey, what about this? What about that?' That's what's really exciting for us. Andrew Krystal: So even if it's not nitrogen, you may want someone to take a look at a vineyard after a bad frost, right? David MacMillan: Yeah, absolutely, and irrigation is another big one. Managing all these input costs. I had a call with someone in Italy, oddly enough, two weeks ago, and he said 'we have this big region in Italy that produces cherries, and it's really important to monitor what's going on with them on a weekly basis.' Or, we were talking to a grower in southern Ontario who grows tomatoes, and you think oh, is that a big industry? They put fertilizer down on tomatoes every week, and they just do it because it's like insurance of it not dying. So we're doing some pilot studies with guys like that this year to say okay, let's fly the drone every week. Collect that data. And then if we can save you spraying fertilizer maybe just one week a year, already that's a win. And we're working with all the universities that are looking at doing stuff with drones. So it's really exciting; it's going to be huge. But it's going to take some companies to kind of work with people to establish the value proposition over and above kind of where we're at with scouting. Andrew Krystal: What percentage do you think, on average, the drone agricultural application affects yields? 20 per cent, 30 per cent? In terms of both efficiencies, in terms of saving money on fertilizer use, and protecting against problems, whether it's... David MacMillan: Okay, well, so some of the stuff we've seen out of France, which is really the first place that's been publishing numbers on it, we're seeing sort of 20 per cent improvements in input costs. Yields is a whole other beast, because I mean, if you ask a farmer, there's 256 million variables that go into... Andrew Krystal: But that's next. David MacMillan: But that's next. Andrew Krystal: So input costs you're nailing down now, and then yield would be maybe the next frontier. David MacMillan: Absolutely, and I think at the end of the day, what's really great about it, there's an amazing company that was based in Manitoba called Farmers' Edge. They just raised $56 million from Kleiner Perkins, and they track all sorts of other data to help make farmers more profitable. So this trend of where technology is coming in farming is real, and we think imagery is probably not the end-all answer, it's not the next Google, but it's going to play a very important cornerstone in helping guys run their businesses more efficiently. James West: All right, that's a great first interview, David. Let's leave it there for now; we'll come back to you in a few quarters and see how you're making out. Thank you so much for joining us today. David MacMillan: Yeah, thank you so much, James.

He recommends that dramatic changes be made in how livestock are raised and how people eat. Animal production needs to be far less energy intensive and people need to consume less meat, he said. Livestock currently consume 43 per cent of foods that could otherwise be eaten by people, according to statistics cited by Sage. In addition, they contribute to 18 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. With ruminants, Sage recommends a return to pasture-based systems that allow farmers to broaden their rotations, better recycle nutrients and, in some situations, sequester carbon. Changes will not come without major societal and agricultural adjustment and the pol it ical will, driven by an increasingly concerned populace, to implement them. As the director of sustainabi l ity and shared value with Maple Leaf Foods, Tim Faveri works for a company that would be impacted if Sage's vision for the future were to be implemented. Faveri said responsible consumption is attached to 15 per cent of grocery store food sales and the sector is growing. It's a $120 billion market in the US and a $400 billion market worldwide. \"Corporate responsibility is not just about being green. It's about being clear,\" he said. \"If a company does not communicate clearly, consumers will just assume the worse.\" Like a growing number of companies, Maple Leaf is looking ser iously at how animals are raised and their environmental impact. Company decisions affecting farms include a move to reduce antibiotic use and move 35,000 sows to open house systems by 2017. Maple Leaf has also set a goal to reduce its waste, water and emissions by 50 per cent in another 10 years. Univer sity of Guelph economist Sylvain Charlebois, like Faver and Sage, emphasized the inf luence consumers are having on the agriculture and food industry. \"More and more people want to know where their food is coming from, how it was made and they want the food industry to be accountable,\" he said. \"It's no longer just about feeding people. It's about giving them some informat ion about the food system.\" Charlebois said a growing number of consumers are connecting the food they eat and such issues as the environment, climate change, animal welfare and the importance of local production. While they are not always cognizant of the all the facts, he said they're interested and emerging technologies, such as mobile devices that identify food through nuclear magnetic resonance or even DNA, will help them learn more. Food fraud is a large concern globally. For instance, it's been estimated recently that Canadians annually buy $3.6 billion in foods that they think are from Italy but are not, Charlebois said. \"It's this type of development that will force everyone along the food chain to be self disciplined,\" he said. Middlesex County dairy farmer Andrew Campbell talked about his efforts over the past couple years to increa se consumer awareness of modern agricultural practices. \"This idea of bui lding trust is one issue we don't think about enough,\" he said. \"At the end of the day what consumers want is to take some food home for their families and feel good about it and not feel scared. .. Farmers tend to get busy and don't necessarily step back to look at what impact they're having over the long term.\" Campbel l encourages farmers to freely share their practices with interested consumers. He's done it himself through on-line websites including one site where daily photographs from his farm were posted."}, {"title": "Partnerships Through the agX Platform Brings Increased Efficiency in Soil Fertility", "article": "STILLWATER, OK --(Marketwired - April 14, 2016) - SST Software and Servi-Tech announce an application program interface (API) connection through the agX Platform to streamline data processing and seamlessly integrate with other agricultural services. Servi-Tech is the largest crop consulting and agronomic service company in the nation, providing agronomic services to more than 1,900 producers across seven states. The crop consulting division has approximately 1 million acres under contract. Using the newest agricultural technology, Servi-Tech strives to make the most efficient use of their crop production resources. With the new agX Platform API integration, Servi-Tech will be able to streamline internal processes of orders submitted from SST Summit or SST Sirrus. Through the new functionality created, Servi-Tech will be able to bar code soil sample bags to automate the process and more efficiently deliver data to the SST server. The agX API integration allows the two companies to efficiently transfer data securely so producers can get the information they need, when they need it. \"The integration of Streamline with the agX platform will help Servi-Tech Laboratory and SST customers drastically increase efficiency with automated soil data delivery,\" said Ryan Meister, Director of Technology Development with Servi-Tech. \"With this update, Servi-Tech Laboratories delivers soil results directly to the soil sampling operation within SST's system.\" Soil sampling is essential to effective soil fertility planning and management. Samples reflect the overall fertility of the field so subsequent recommendations can be made in an efficient, precise manner. Utilizing these results, producers can adequately supply the proper nutrients needed for plant production by applying the right inputs to maintain or improve the physical, chemical and biological condition of the soil. Collaboration through the agX Platform has allowed Servi-Tech's agronomy precision solutions team and SST's advanced geospatial tools to come together to provide a more dynamic service for producers. \"Precise agronomic applications are important to SST users,\" said Matt Waits, SST Software CEO. \"Servi-Tech's expertise and use of current technologies, research and science combined with SST's in-field mobility geospatial tools, advanced data processing and multi-year analysis capabilities creates a progressive opportunity for the ag community that will help growers optimize their inputs and outputs.\" SST Software was one of the first companies in what is commonly referred to as precision farming and today manages more than 100 million acres of geospatial farm data. SST's tools allow ag service providers to site-specifically collect, analyze and manage data on crop production fields. SST's holistic ecosystem is built upon a strong foundation of five key essentials that helps end users optimize and scale their geospatial data needs. Location, standardization, automation, centralization and communication are the SST essentials present to sustain a quality, enterprise level precision ag program.

If you tried to open the site, the only thing you would see was a pop-up message reading in part, \"The web page is on the list of websites with potentially dangerous content.\" This is a conference organized by the Canada Grains Council that included technical and policy presentations by the likes of the Flax Council of Canada, Pulse Canada and some of the largest agri-food companies in North America. As one conference organizer said of the contents of the website, \"It couldn't be more benign.\" One rumour was the site had been hacked or disrupted by mischief-makers looking to poke Monsanto in the eye. After all, Monsanto is the most obvious and easiest target for anyone dissatisfied with the industrialization of food production and the introduction of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) into mainstream crop production. Monsanto is the leader of the \"frankenfood\" sector. It is the probably the corporate entity that most often gets the adjective \"evil\" attached to it. It's also a corporate entity with US$15 billion in revenue last year and US$2.3 billion in profits, which was down from the year before. Jesus Madrazo, a Monsanto executive based at its St. Louis headquarters was at the conference. His title with the company is global corporate engagement lead. For the past 21/2 years, his job has been to show the world Monsanto is not evil and to help effect a shift in corporate culture at the company. \"Two and a half years ago we realized we needed to do things differently at Monsanto,\" Madrazo said in an interview. \"We spend a lot of time talking to the same people at the same tables, and we realized we missed recognizing a growing interest from consumers at large about food and how the food is produced and how it gets to the table.\" Madrazo peppers his conversation with references to technology and innovation as the driving force behind the work the company does. He regularly makes the point demographers predict the world's population will increase by 2.5 billion people by 2050, and Monsanto is working to create the means by which to feed that growing cohort by then. He didn't make reference to it, but a couple of years ago a former Google executive, David Friedberg, who founded a precision farming business Monsanto bought for $1 billion, penned a love letter of sorts to the company as a response to the emotional backlash he received from his family, friends and associates for selling to Monsanto. \"Calling a company evil is easy. And if you do it enough times it can become the \"reality\" - because reality is just the most common perception,\" he wrote. \"Perhaps Monsanto should have adopted the mantra... introduced at Google in 2000 - \"don't be evil.\" Just saying that was their mantra has helped Google countless times avoid the evil designation that so many people have tried to hurl their way over the years. It has worked... Google sues more of its customers each year than Monsanto does? Google spends three times as much as Monsanto on federal lobbying?\" That's not necessarily a proof against evilness, but it does underline an interesting dynamic. Among other things, Madrazo told the conference the company is committed to becoming carbon-neutral by 2021, and this year, Winnipeg-based Monsanto Canada was named one of the country's best diversity employers. Madrazo said the company is acknowledging its \"evil\" reputation and getting out there and facing it head-on. It is not about to forsake its profit motive, but considering the manner in which its products are used - to produce food - it has the material available to create a pretty strong narrative. Of course it will be seen by some as self-serving when he references the company's foray into precision farming and the kind of role it will eventually play in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. (Madrazo said by achieving carbon-neutral corn production in the U.S. Midwest alone, it is estimated it will save about 230 million barrels of oil per year, equivalent to about two weeks consumption of oil in the U.S.) This year marks the 20th anniversary of the introduction of Monsanto's first GMO, a herbicide-resistant soybean seed. The debate about the relative safety of GMOs will likely carry on for many years to come. But time is likely on Monsanto's side because the more time that passes without conclusive evidence it is harmful, the less evil Monsanto will become. martin.cash@freepress.mb.ca"}, {"title": "Agrium Announces 2016 Quarterly Earnings Conference Call Dates", "article": "CALGARY, AB --(Marketwired - April 12, 2016) - Agrium Inc.

With an emerging space such as agriculture technology, or agtech, there are few players, both on the investment and product development side, a situation that has left small businesses looking beyond niche investors to attract dollars. Silicon Valley heavyweight Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers, for example, recently participated in a $58 million round for Winnipeg-based agtech firm Farmers Edge. The money changing hands in this sector is adding up. Global investments in food and agriculture technology startups nearly doubled in 2015 from a year earlier to $4.6 billion, the latest AgTech Investing Report noted. \"We're big believers that innovation and venture should be available for companies in Canada that come from sectors and spaces beyond the conventional areas of venture of ICT, clean tech and health care,\" said Alison Nankivell, vice-president for funds and co-investments at BDC Capital. \" the market isn't well understood enough to see a critical mass of early stage agtech funds. We'd love to see more in the market.\" Even with Canada's competitive advantage in resource-based sectors such as agriculture, innovation among startups is sparse; the lion's share of research tends to happen in academic institutions, or in the research labs of global companies such as Syngenta, Monsanto or Dow Chemicals. Canadian startups that have had early success have exited early on, like Winnipeg-based nutrient producer Wolf Trax, which was acquired two years ago for $95 million. While innovation used to be associated more with concocting formulas for potent fertilizers and pesticides, or genetics tinkering, farmers are increasingly using technology to collect data from the field and are analyzing it to help them optimize growing conditions. Farmers Edge takes such an approach, utilizing devices that plug into motorized farm equipment. Those devices capture real-time data, everything from the amount of fuel burned to the quantity of fertilizer applied. This intelligence allows farmers to take better care of their crops and reduce expenditures. The company goes head to head with much larger competitors in the U.S. Midwest, but president and chief executive Wade Barnes said the company is eager to explore market opportunities elsewhere on the continent and in countries including Brazil, Australia and Russia. \"I firmly believe that datadriven decisions will change agriculture,\" Barnes said. \"The connection with Kleiner helped us understand how to take that Silicon Valley understanding of technology and create that hybrid with what we were doing at a farm level.\" The market isn't well understood enough to see a critical mass of early stage agtech funds. We'd love to see more in the market Quebec-based Hortau, which has offices in the U.S., offers farmers a way to monitor how much water crops are getting. It can mean huge cost savings for droughtstricken regions such as California, Hortau's biggest market, and elsewhere in the United States, where the value of fruit and nuts production - what most of Hortau's clients cultivate - reached nearly $30 billion nationwide in 2014. While it wouldn't disclose a dollar figure, Hortau said revenue is growing 50 per cent year over year. \"The main thing we're accomplishing with our system is boosting productivity,\" said Jocelyn Boudreau, cofounder and CEO of Hortau. \"It's all about using real-time information, high-precision data to grow a better crop.\" Canada accounts for less than a fifth of Hortau's business, and despite the value of fruit and vegetable production here reaching $1.9 billion in 2015, the U.S. remains its priority for the time being. Louis Gosselin, a strawberry farmer near Ile d'Orleans, Que., since 1980, feeds data from his field to his office computer. Hortau's system has changed his field irrigation pattern according to conditions - now in shorter spurts at a higher frequency throughout the day - instead of relying on constant daily intervals. \"If we don't use this system, it's probably a lot of work to look at each field a couple times per day,\" said Gosselin, who has used Hortau's technology for 12 years. The end result should be, in theory, less stress on the crop and higher yields. This sort of precision agriculture was expensive in the past and farmers were skeptical that it added value, Barnes said, adding farmers are now realizing that they need to depend on more than their intuition to compete. \"As farms go from 1,000 acres to 5,000 acres to 20,000 acres, they need to scale their management skills across lots of acres,\" Barnes said. Software that crunches numbers is only part of the precision agriculture solution, said Aki Georgacacos, managing partner at Avrio Capital, an agtech venture capital firm that recently announced the closing of a $110 million fund. The foundational elements, such as sensors and hardware, are needed to help data flow, he said. \"In agriculture, the chain needs to come together in an integrated approach and that's where most of the focus is today,\" said Georgacacos, whose firm, along with BDC Capital, was part of Hortau's $10 million financing round announced in February.

We have significantly reduced carbon emissions and we continue to reduce them further each and every year. Prairie innovation and technology have led this effort, and it's been exported around the world. Conservation and sustainability are essential to profitability, so we live it. The recent Paris Agreement has led to talk of a national policy on carbon pricing, with the goal of reducing emissions. Provincial policy mechanisms are also being discussed, including carbon taxes or cap and trade systems. It's largely been major greenhouse gas emitters - coal and oilsands producers - who've been the focus to this point, especially on questions around practical implementation of a carbon pricing scheme. Growers are already achieving this desired policy outcome of government by reducing carbon emissions, but we're now concerned what carbon pricing will mean for our farms. If growers - and food, in turn - are going to get hit with carbon taxes on our fuel, fertilizer and key farm inputs, it would be a perverse way of recognizing the major GHG reductions grain farmers in Western Canada have already accomplished, and continue to realize. Decision makers need to take the debits and credits - the outcomes - into account when determining a fair carbon pricing system. On a life cycle basis, prairie grain farmers are close to - or already are - producing net zero carbon emissions by extracting carbon from the atmosphere and sequestering it in plants for the purpose of producing food; this while producing more food today on less land than in the past. There have been considerable energy efficiency gains made in tractors, trucks, and combines - many such innovations found by great agricultural equipment manufacturers here on the prairies. Cleaner engines today, and we've only begun with more electric and on-farm renewable fuels and energy for tomorrow. Our grandparents used to plow up the soil, but with precision farming today, growers now practise reduced or entirely no-till farming. Fuel use is cut because you're not passing through the field to plow the soil or apply pesticides again and again, as in the past. No-till has additional benefits in drier areas where less irrigation is needed, further enhancing fuel savings and soil conservation. Agronomy has vastly improved, as growers now employ diverse cropping rotations, and better fertilizer practices. Plant science innovations are remarkable. Productivity gains and yield advances with reduced inputs in wheat and canola - as just two examples - are impressive. This is happening because of advances in genetics and plant breeding, modern plant protection products, and improved soil health through agronomy. Again, much of this is driven by homegrown prairie crop science innovators. New crop varieties developed through modern breeding techniques see further reduced tillage, with crops growing in drought conditions, meaning even greater GHG sequestration and soil conservation. A recent CropLife Canada study (The Value of Plant Science Innovations to Canadians) quantifies these significant contributions farmers have made in major environmental footprint reductions, noting: \"Since 1990, the reductions in tillage owing to the use of plant science innovations have resulted in a 3.8 fold increase in carbon sequestration in cultivated land, reducing greenhouse gases (GHGs) by about 4 million tonnes per year. Decreases in summerfallow add another 5.2 million tonnes of GHG reductions through carbon sequestration.\" As farmers, we're producing more food on less land, and we're continuing to reduce GHGs further, including reductions of diesel fuel use approaching 200 million litres each and every year. Canada's GHGs are steadily increasing, but in the grain growing sector they're clearly decreasing. When determining carbon pricing schemes, governments need to consider the good news environmental outcomes that western grain growers are already contributing. It would be a perverse policy decision to punish innovative growers who are already achieving the desired outcome of government: reducing carbon emissions.

This work represents the generosity and work of volunteers in the Flamborough-Ancaster area. S.H.A.R.E. Agriculture Foundation is an effective small Canadian charity organization started 40 years ago by Ontario farmers from Halton and Peel to support impoverished rural communities in developing countries. SHARE stands for Sending Help and Resources Everywhere. Projects are in poor, isolated rural communities where the projects will have the greatest impact. S.H.A.R.E. is based on the principle of a \"hand-up\" rather than a \"hand-out\"; projects increase a community's capacity to care for itself. S.H.A.R.E. does not have staff but works through effective partners who can manage projects. Hundreds of small projects have been completed over the years. S.H.A.R.E. has funded seeds and tools for market gardens, shade houses and irrigation equipment, goats, chickens and cattle. Farm production has been improved by funding agriculture technicians who teach small scale farmers how to make organic fertilizers, rotate crops and diversify production. S.H.A.R.E. has also funded programs that build capacity and well-being such as an adult literacy programs in which over 4,000 adults have learned to read and write and a youth skills training program to stem youth migration and gang activity in Honduras and El Salvador. S.H.A.R.E. is also funding projects in Guatemala, Haiti, Belize, Bolivia, and the poorest area of Brazil.

Silver Wheaton Corp. (TSE: SLW) - Silver Wheaton Announces Closing of The Early Deposit Precious Metals Purchase Agreement With Panoro Minerals - 21/3/2016 VANCOUVER, March 21, 2016 /CNW/ - Silver Wheaton Corp. (\"Silver Wheaton\" or the \"Company\") (TSX:SLW) (NYSE:SLW) is pleased to announce that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Silver Wheaton (Caymans) Ltd. (\"SWC\"), has entered into a definitive Early Deposit Precious Metals Purchase Agreement (the \"Cotabambas Early Deposit Agreement\") with Panoro Minerals Ltd. and its wholly owned subsidiary Panoro Trading (Cayman) Ltd. (\"Panoro\") in respect of the Cotabambas project located in Peru. SWC will be entitled to purchase 100% of the silver production and 25% of the gold production from the Cotabambas project until 90 million silver equivalent ounces attributable to SWC have been delivered, at which point the stream would drop to 66.67% of silver production and 16.67% of gold production for the life of mine. Under the Cotabambas Early Deposit Agreement, SWC will pay a total cash consideration of US$140 million plus an ongoing production payment of the lesser of: i) US$5.90 for each silver ounce and US$450 for each gold ounce (both subject to a 1% annual inflation adjustment starting in the fourth year after the completion test is satisfied) and ii) the prevailing market price. Once certain conditions have been met, SWC will advance US$14 million to Panoro, spread over up to nine years.

Latest Research Overview of Geothermal Energy Resources in Quebec (Canada) Mining Enviroments Jasmin Raymond, Rene Therrien, Ferri Hassani Abstract Rising energy costs, as well as environmental concerns, are driving engineering innovation to reduce energy consumption while remaining competitive, diversify energy supplies and reduce carbon emissions. In that context, geothermal energy represents an alternative to common energy sources. Low-temperature geothermal energy associated with mine sites is gaining acceptance as an economically attractive option for both active mines and nearby communities. Recent studies assessing the geothermal potential of various mining environments have shown promising results. These studies assessed closed and active underground mines as well as flooded open pits and mine waste dumps. Various ground source heat pump designs exist for these systems to exchange geothermal energy using either ground, surface or close-loop water. Different types of mining environments therefore host significant geothermal resources that are readily exploitable with today's technologies. Research and demonstration projects undertaken in the province of Quebec have illustrated the benefits associated with the exploitation of geothermal energy in mining environments. For example, the geothermal energy extraction potential of the flooded underground Gaspe Mines, near Murdochville in eastern Quebec, was estimated at 765 kW. This sustainable ground load is calculated for a pumping rate of 0.049 m3 /s, mwith a production temperature of 6.7 degC and a return temperature of 3 degC. In another project, a surface water heat pump system using water flooding a quarry was developed at Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville in southern Quebec. The system is used to heat and cool 36 apartments in a condominium complex, having a total surface of 6 039 m2 . Research also began at the South dump of the Doyon Mine in the Abitibi region of Quebec to evaluate the technical feasibility of geothermal energy exchange at mine waste dumps. Thermal energy resources contained in the South Dump and the underlying basement are estimated at 1,678,417 GJ from temperature profiles measured in 2007. Additional feasibility studies that recently started at flooded underground mines of British-Colombia, Ontario and the Northwest Territories indicate substantial energy savings. Canada is blessed with abundant natural resources; it hosts a large number of active and closed mines and it is therefore a prime target for developing geothermal energy associated with mine sites. Several research initiatives are expected to further contribute to develop geothermal energy in Canadian mining environments. The Industry Mining Facts Minerals and metals are the building blocks of the computers and smartphones we rely on, of the vehicles and public transit that get us places, of the buildings where we live and work, and of green technologies that help make the world a more sustainable place. Just as we as individuals depend on mining to support our daily lives, Canada relies on the industry to keep the economy humming. Mining is one of Canada's most important economic sectors and a major job creator. A major employer: Approximately 380,000 people across Canada work in the mining and mineral processing industries. Mining is the largest private sector employer of Aboriginal peoples in Canada on a proportional basis, and employment is poised to increase. Canada has one of the largest mining supply sectors globally with more than 3,400 companies supplying engineering, geotechnical, environmental, financial and other services to mining operations. Those who work in mining enjoy the highest wages and salaries of all industrial sectors in Canada with an average annual pay exceeding $110,000, which surpassed the average earnings of workers in forestry, manufacturing, finance and construction by a range of $31,000 to $46,000 for those sectors. An economic engine: Mining contributed $54 billion to Canada's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2013. The industry accounted for 19.6% of the value of Canadian goods exports in 2013. Canada's value of mineral production was nearly $43.6 billion in 2013. The mining industry's payments to Canadian federal and provincial governments total $71 billion in taxes and royalties over the last decade (2003-2012). A global leader: Thanks to its rich geology, Canada is one of the largest mining nations in the world producing more than 60 minerals and metals. Canada ranks in the top five countries in the global production of 11 major minerals and metals: First in potash Second in uranium and cobalt Third in aluminum and tungsten Fourth in platinum group metals, sulphur and titanium Fifth in nickel and diamonds 57% of the world's public mining companies are listed on the TSX and TSX-Venture Exchanges. Together, the two exchanges handled 48% of global mining equity transactions in 2013, and accounted for 46% of global mining equity capital for that year. Globally, Canada is recognized for its leadership in safety and sustainability. Mining companies in Canada were the first in the world to develop an externally-verified performance system for sustainable mining practices with the creation of MAC's Towards Sustainable Mining initiative in 2004. Leading Companies Agnico Eagle Mines Limited Agnico Eagle's mission is to run a high quality, easy to understand business, that generates superior long-term per share returns for our shareholders, creates a great place to work for our employees, and that is a leading contributor to the well-being of the communities in which we operate. Agnico Eagle Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Results - Strong Operational Performance Yields Record Annual Production; Updated Amaruq Mineral Resources and Initial Mineral Resources Declared at El Barqueno and the Sisar Zone at Kittila February 10, 2016 Stock Symbol: AEM (NYSE and TSX) (All amounts expressed in U.S. dollars (\"$\" or \"US$\") unless otherwise noted) TORONTO, Feb. 10, 2016 /PRNewswire/ - Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (NYSE:AEM, TSX:AEM) (\"Agnico Eagle\" or the \"Company\") today reported a quarterly net loss of $15.5 million, or a net loss of $0.07 per share for the fourth quarter of 2015. This result includes a non-cash foreign currency translation loss on deferred tax liabilities of $8.6 million ($0.04 per share), various mark-to-market adjustment losses of $5.0 million ($0.02 per share), unrealized losses on financial instruments of $3.3 million ($0.01 per share), non-cash foreign currency translation losses of $1.3 million ($0.01 per share), non-cash stock option expense of $3.6 million ($0.02 per share) and non-recurring gains of $2.4 million ($0.01). Excluding these items would result in adjusted net income of $3.9 million ($0.02 per share) for the fourth quarter of 2015. In the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company reported a net loss of $21.3 million or a net loss of $0.10 per share. Fourth quarter 2015 cash provided by operating activities was $140.7 million ($112.6 million before changes in non-cash components of working capital), this compares to cash provided by operating activities of $164.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 ($151.6 million before changes in non-cash components of working capital). The decrease in cash flow before changes in working capital during the current period was largely due to a tax adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2015. \"In 2015, our operations continued to perform well, which allowed us to do better on both our production and cost guidance for the fourth consecutive year. Despite a volatile gold price environment, we doubled our exploration spending, continued to advance our pipeline of development projects, and reduced our net debt by approximately $190 million,\" said Sean Boyd, Agnico Eagle's Chief Executive Officer. \"Over the next three years, we are forecasting stable annual production and costs, which should allow us to continue to invest in our existing mines, maintain funding levels at our key exploration projects, advance our development pipeline in Nunavut at a steady and measured pace and maintain our history of continuous dividend payments to shareholders,\" added Mr. Boyd. Fourth quarter and full year 2015 highlights include: Guidance exceeded for fourth consecutive year - Payable production1 in 2015 was 1,671,340 ounces of gold at total cash costs2 per ounce on a by-product basis of $567, compared to guidance of 1,650,000 ounces at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $600. All-in sustaining costs per ounce3 (\"AISC\") on a by-product basis for 2015 were $810, compared to guidance of $850 per ounce Stable production and costs expected through 2018 - Average annual production from 2016 to 2018 is forecast to be approximately 1.53 million ounces of gold. Production for 2016 is forecast to be between 1.525 and 1.565 million ounces of gold with total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of between $590 and $630 per ounce. AISC for 2016 are forecast to be between $850 and $890 per ounce. Costs were calculated using a US$/C$ exchange rate of 1.30, EURO$/US$ exchange rate of 1.10 and a US$/MXP exchange rate of 16.00 Increased gold reserve grades at key mines, significant increase in year-end 2015 gold resources, slight decline in gold reserves after mining depletion - Gold reserve grades increased at the LaRonde, Canadian Malartic, Goldex and La India mines. Measured and indicated mineral resources were up 1%, while inferred mineral resources increased by 23%. Mineral reserves declined by only 5% (0.9 million ounces) to 19.1 million ounces due to mine depletion of approximately 1.8 million ounces Gold resources increased by 67% at Amaruq - Inferred mineral resources at Amaruq now total 3.3 million ounces (16.9 million tonnes grading 6.05 grams per tonne (\"g/t\") gold). The 2016 Phase 1 drill program (approximately 75,000 metres) is now underway with a focus on expanding and upgrading mineral resources and outlining a second open pit deposit Initial inferred gold resources declared at El Barqueno and the Sisar Zone at Kittilla - At El Barqueno, initial inferred mineral resources are estimated to be 0.61 million ounces (19.7 million tonnes grading 0.96 g/t gold), while at Kittila the recently discovered Sisar Zone contains inferred mineral resources of 0.65 million ounces (3.4 million tonnes grading 5.91 g/t gold) Moderate 2016 capital spending preserves production optionality in Nunavut - Expenditures at Amaruq are designed to expand and upgrade the gold resources and outline a second source of open pit ore for the project. Planned spending levels at Meliadine for 2016 are expected to be sufficient to keep critical path elements moving forward. However, decreased spending as compared with previous internal forecasts is expected to delay the potential project start-up by approximately one year to 2020 Improved financial flexibility - In 2015, net debt was reduced by $190 million, further strengthening the Company's investment grade balance sheet A quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share declared New Three-Year Guidance Plan - Stable Production and Cost Profile The Company is announcing its production and cost guidance for 2016 through 2018. The Company expects average annual production of approximately 1.53 million ounces of gold over the next three years with a stable cost profile. Highlights from the new production and cost guidance for 2016 through 2018 include: In 2016, payable production is expected to be between 1.525 million and 1.565 million ounces of gold. Total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis in 2016 are expected to be between $590 and $630 using a US$/C$ exchange rate assumption of 1.30. Previous guidance for 2016 (from the February 2015 forecast) was 1.60 million ounces. The change from previous guidance is primarily due to the expansion of the Vault pit, which increased overall production from Meadowbank but deferred ounces from 2016 to 2017 and 2018, thereby extending the mine life Consolidated AISC for 2016 are expected to be between $850 and $890 per ounce. In 2017 and 2018, the Company's goal is to reduce AISC below this range The estimated production level in 2017 is currently forecast to be approximately 1.55 million ounces of gold (up from 1.50 million ounces in its February 2015 forecast), while production in 2018 is forecast to be approximately 1.50 million ounces of gold. However, the Company is evaluating potential optimizations and opportunities (none of which have yet been approved for construction) at a number of existing operations to further enhance the production profile in 2018 and beyond. These include: LaRonde optimization potential Bousquet Zone 5 Lapa Zone 8 - Upper mine and Zulapa 7 - Deep 2 Zone Goldex optimization potential Increased throughput from Deep Zone 1 Potential for accelerated development of Deep Zone 2 Potential development of the Akasaba West satellite deposit Kittila optimization potential Upper Rimpi Zone development Potential development of the new Sisar Zone Mexican optimization potential Satellite zones at Pinos Altos and Creston Mascota Potential to expand reserves at La India Development Pipeline Expected to Provide Further Production Growth in 2019 and Beyond The Amaruq and Meliadine projects in Nunavut, the El Barqueno project in Mexico, the Odyssey Zone and near pit/underground opportunities at Canadian Malartic (these opportunities are near or below the existing mining infrastructure) and a possible expansion of the LaRonde mine at depth have the potential to further add to the Company's production profile in 2019 and beyond. Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Financial and Production Highlights In the fourth quarter of 2015, strong operational performance continued at the Company's mines. Payable production in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 422,328 ounces of gold compared to 387,535 ounces in the fourth quarter of 2014. A detailed description of the production and cost performance of each mine is set out below. Total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis for the fourth quarter of 2015 were $547 compared to $662 per ounce for the fourth quarter 2014. The decrease in total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis in the fourth quarter of 2015 is mainly due to higher production levels at the LaRonde, Canadian Malartic, Meadowbank, Kittila, Pinos Altos and Creston Mascota mines and favourable foreign exchange rates. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the average value of the Canadian dollar, Euro and Mexican Peso were 10%, 7%, and 17% lower, respectively, than the Company's 2015 currency price assumptions (see February 11, 2015 news release). For the full year 2015, the Company recorded net income of $24.6 million, or $0.11 per share. In 2014, Agnico Eagle recorded net income of $83.0 million, or $0.43 per share. Compared with the prior year, 2015 earnings were affected by lower realized gold and silver prices (down 8% and 14%, respectively, period over period) and increased exploration expenses (up 97%, period over period). In 2015, exploration drilling yielded a significant increase in inferred mineral resources at the Amaruq project in Nunavut, an initial inferred mineral resource at the El Barqueno project in Mexico and a maiden inferred mineral resource at the Sisar Zone at Kittila. The decrease in realized gold and silver prices and increase in exploration expenses were partially offset by higher gold production and favourable foreign exchange rates. For the full year 2015, cash provided by operating activities was $616.2 million ($660.0 million before changes in non-cash components of working capital). This represents a decrease over 2014, when cash provided by operating activities totalled $668.3 million ($624.4 million before changes in non-cash components of working capital). The decrease was primarily due to increased inventory positions. For the fourth consecutive year, Agnico Eagle has reported annual gold production in excess of annual guidance. The Company's payable production for the full year 2015 was 1,671,340 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $567, compared to guidance of 1,650,000 ounces at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $590 to $610. In 2014, full year production was 1,429,288 ounces at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $637. The improvement in gold production in 2015 was a result of strong operating results from all of the mines, particularly Canadian Malartic as a result of the full year inclusion of production, LaRonde as a result of the higher grades from mining in more gold rich areas of the lower areas of the mine (below the 215 level), Goldex due to better productivity, increased throughput at Kittila from the ramp up of the mill expansion, increased stacking capacity at La India, and higher grades from Pinos Altos. The decrease in total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis in 2015 was primarily due to higher gold production for 2015, strong cost control initiatives at all of the mines and the positive effect of foreign exchange rates. For the full year 2015, the average value of the Canadian dollar, Euro and Mexican Peso were 5%, 4%, and 18% lower, respectively than the Company's 2015 currency price assumptions (see February 11, 2015 news release). AISC for 2015 on a by-product basis was $810 per ounce, which is below the previous 2015 guidance between $840 and $860 per ounce. The lower AISC is primarily due to lower than forecast total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis in 2015 and a reduction in sustaining capital expenditures through a strong emphasis on sustaining capital expenditure controls. Quarterly Dividend Declared Agnico Eagle's Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.08 per common share, payable on March 15, 2016 to shareholders of record as of March 1, 2016. Agnico Eagle has now declared a cash dividend every year since 1983. Liquidity - Existing Cash and Credit Facility Provide Flexibility Cash and cash equivalents and short term investments decreased to $131.6 million at December 31, 2015, from the September 30, 2015 balance of $208.1 million partly as a result of using cash to repay outstanding balances on the Company's credit facility. The outstanding balance on the Company's $1.2 billion credit facility was reduced from $350 million at September 30, 2015 to $265 million at December 31, 2015, resulting in availability under its credit lines of approximately $935 million, not including the $300 million accordion facility. Total capital expenditures made by the Company in the fourth quarter of 2015 were $133.0 million, including $22.2 million at Meliadine, $20.0 million at Pinos Altos, $18.0 million at Meadowbank, $18.0 million at Kittila, $16.7 million at LaRonde, $13.6 million at Canadian Malartic (50% basis), $13.6 million at Goldex, $7.9 million at La India, $2.6 million at Creston Mascota and $1.0 million at Lapa. Total capital expenditures for the full year 2015 were $449.8 million including $67.3 million at LaRonde, $66.7 million at Meliadine, $65.2 million at Meadowbank, $61.8 million at Pinos Altos, $56.4 million at Kittila, $48.8 million at Goldex, $43.4 million at Canadian Malartic (50% basis), $23.4 million at La India, $6.5 million at Lapa and $4.2 million at Creston Mascota. Total sustaining capital expenditures made by the Company in the fourth quarter of 2015 were $90.4 million, including $18.0 million at Meadowbank, $16.7 million at LaRonde, $15.1 million at Kittila, $13.6 million at Canadian Malartic (50% basis), $11.4 million at Pinos Altos, $7.9 million at La India, $4.1 million at Goldex, $2.6 million at Creston Mascota and $1.0 million at Lapa. Total sustaining capital expenditures for the full year 2015 were $305.1 million including $67.3 million at LaRonde, $65.2 million at Meadowbank, $45.7 million at Kittila, $41.6 million at Canadian Malartic (50% basis), $35.5 million at Pinos Altos, $23.4 million at La India, $15.7 million at Goldex, $6.5 million at Lapa, and $4.2 million at Creston Mascota. Three-Year Guidance Plan Outlines a Stable Production and Cost Profile The Company is announcing its production and cost guidance for 2016 through 2018. The Company expects average annual production of approximately 1.53 million ounces over the next three years with a stable cost profile. Various internal projects at current operating mines have the potential to add incremental production in 2018, while Amaruq, Meliadine and El Barqueno are expected to add significant production starting in 2019 to 2020. However, the Company continues to take a prudent and measured approach to development while maintaining financial flexibility. In 2016, payable production is expected to be between 1.525 million and 1.565 million ounces of gold. Total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis in 2016 are expected to be in a range from $590 and $630 using a US$/C$ exchange rate assumption of 1.30. Previous production guidance for 2016 (from the February 2015 forecast), was 1.60 million ounces. The change in production compared to the previous 2016 guidance is primarily due to the decision to proceed with the expansion of the Vault pit at Meadowbank (thereby extending the mine life). With the Vault extension, the production forecast at Meadowbank was reduced in 2016, but increased for 2017 and 2018. Consolidated AISC for 2016 are expected to be between $850 and $890 per ounce using a US$/C$ exchange rate assumption of 1.30. Near-term Mine Optimization Projects Could Potentially Enhance 2018 Production Over the next three years (2016 through 2018) annual production is forecast to average approximately 1.53 million ounces. The estimated production level in 2018 is currently forecast to be approximately 1.50 million ounces. However, the Company is evaluating potential optimizations and opportunities (none of which have yet been approved for construction) at a number of existing operations to further enhance the Company's production profile in 2018 and beyond. LaRonde Optimization In 2003, the Company acquired the Bousquet gold property from Barrick Gold. The property adjoins the LaRonde mining complex to the east and hosts the Bousquet Zone 5, which previous operators had partly exploited by open pit. The Company is evaluating the potential to initially mine the Bousquet Zone 5 from a depth of 90 to 330 metres below surface via an underground ramp. This portion of the deposit contains indicated mineral resources of approximately 566,000 ounces of gold (9.3 million tonnes grading 1.90 g/t gold) and inferred gold mineral resources of approximately 109,000 ounces of gold (1.47 million tonnes grading 2.31 g/t gold). The mining method is likely to be similar to that employed at Goldex, and processing could utilize excess capacity from the Lapa circuit at LaRonde. Dewatering of the old pit is underway and permit applications to collect a bulk sample will be submitted shortly. An internal technical study is expected to be completed by the end of 2016. At the Lapa mine two areas (Zone 8 East - Upper mine and the Zulapa 7- Deep 2 Zone) have been identified through exploration (see Lapa mine discussion) as areas that could potentially support future mining activity. Further exploration and internal studies are underway to look at synergies with other production opportunities such as the Bousquet Zone 5. In addition, Canadian Malartic Corporation (\"CMC\", owned 50% by Agnico Eagle and 50% by Yamana Gold Inc. \"Yamana\") is continuing to explore the Pandora project, which adjoins the Lapa mine to the west (for additional details see the Canadian Malartic section of this news release). Should the exploration efforts be successful, Pandora could potentially have synergies with the other opportunities currently being evaluated at the Lapa mine. Goldex Optimization At present, the Goldex mill has about 25% excess capacity (rated capacity is 8,000 tpd, but forecast to process approximately 6,400 tpd in 2016). As such, the Company is evaluating opportunities to potentially increase throughput from the Deep 1 Zone, and the potential to mine a portion of the Deep 2 Zone. These opportunities, and the potential development of the Akasaba West deposit (see below), could enhance production levels or extend the current mine life and reduce operating costs. In January 2014, Agnico Eagle acquired the Akasaba West gold-copper deposit from Alexandria Minerals. Located less than 30 km from Goldex, the Akasaba West deposit could create flexibility and synergies for the Company's operations in the Abitibi region by utilizing extra milling capacity at both Goldex and LaRonde, while reducing overall costs. Akasaba West currently hosts a probable mineral reserve of 141,000 ounces of gold and 24,557 tonnes of copper (4.76 million tonnes grading 0.92 g/t gold and 0.52% copper). Permitting and technical studies are ongoing with the goal of moving the project towards a production decision in late 2016 or early 2017. Kittila Optimization Previous drilling on the Rimpi Zone at Kittila has outlined a significant zone of mineralization with potentially wider widths and better grades than those currently being mined. The main underground ramp at Kittila is being extended to reach the Rimpi Zone, and it is also providing further underground drill access to test for additional depth extensions of the Rimpi, Suuri, Roura and the newly discovered Sisar mineralized zones. In addition, a surface ramp is being driven into the Rimpi Zone (now at a depth of 190 metres below surface) for production purposes and to provide a second egress for the Suuri ramp system. It will serve as the main haulage route from the deeper portions of both Rimpi and Suuri and potentially the Sisar Zone. In 2015, a new sub-parallel zone of mineralization (Sisar Zone) was recognized by exploration drilling from the underground ramp being driven towards the deeper portion of the Rimpi Zone. Additional drilling through year-end 2015 continued to yield favourable results (see Kittila mine discussion in this news release) at Sisar, and an initial inferred mineral resource of approximately 651,000 ounces of gold (3.4 million tonnes grading 5.91 g/t gold) has been announced (see \"Detailed Mineral Reserve and Mineral Resource Data (as at December 31, 2015)\" below). In 2016, additional drilling is planned to infill and further expands the Sisar mineralization. Given that the Sisar Zone is located approximately 200 metres directly east of the exploration ramp (at a depth of approximately 800 metres below surface), Sisar could potentially provide an additional source of underground ore to the Kittila mill with relatively little additional underground development. With the potential for higher mill capacity (approximately 20%) through ongoing optimization, development of the Rimpi and Sisar zones could result in increased future production levels and reduced operating costs at Kittila. Mexican Opportunities At Pinos Altos and Creston Mascota, the Company continues to evaluate the sequencing of additional satellite zones, which could provide additional ore to the Pinos Altos complex. This drill data is being incorporated into preliminary studies along with metallurgical testing and geotechnical data in order to better optimize the development potential of remaining satellite resources including Sinter and Bravo. During 2015, higher grade mineralization was encountered at the bottom of the Creston Mascota pit. Work is underway to understand the potential impact of this mineralization on the pit design and production planning. At La India, additional drilling was carried out in 2015 with a focus on extending mineralization in the Main Zone and the La India Zone, and conversion of sulfide mineralization into mineral reserves and mineral resources. In addition, drilling was also carried out on a portion of the El Realito property. The 2015 exploration program and new ore model resulted in a 28% increase in mineral reserves, and a 21% increase in measured and indicated mineral resources (see \"Detailed Mineral Reserve and Mineral Resource Data (as at December 31, 2015)\" below). The Company is looking at near pit potential for further mineral reserve expansion and will consider opportunities to increase production at La India based on the success of that program. Development/Expansion Projects in the Abitibi, Nunavut and Mexico Expected to Provide Longer-term Growth Opportunities beyond 2019 The expansion and development projects set out below, which have not yet been approved for construction, have the potential to add to the Company's production profile in 2019 and beyond. Amaruq - Expanding the Mineral Resource Base and Locating a Second Open Pit Deposit is the Key Focus in 2016 The 100% owned Amaruq property consists of 114,760 hectares of Inuit and federal crown land. Agnico Eagle acquired its initial interest in April 2013 pursuant to a mineral exploration agreement with Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated. In 2015, a $37.7 million exploration program (378 drill holes totalling approximately 108,000 metres) was carried out at the Amaruq project, which is located approximately 50 kilometres northwest of the Meadowbank mine in Nunavut. A large portion of last year's drill program was focused on the Whale Tail Zone, where drilling has outlined up to five mineralized lenses along a strike length of 2.3 kilometres and to a depth of up to 600 metres below surface. Mineralization at Whale Tail remains open in all directions. Significant mineralization has also been outlined in the IVR area. As a result of the 2015 exploration program, the inferred mineral resource at Amaruq increased by approximately 67% compared to the inferred mineral resource of 2.0 million ounces of gold (see the Company's August 19, 2015 news release for comparison) to 3.3 million ounces of gold (16.9 million tonnes grading 6.05 g/t gold) at December 31, 2015 (for additional details see the mineral reserve and mineral resource discussion in this news release). The first phase of a planned 75,000 metre drill program (costing approximately $19 million) began with two drills in early February 2016. The goals of this program are to infill and expand the known mineral resource areas and test other favourable targets (for additional details see the exploration section below). A mineral resource update is expected in the second half of 2016. In late 2015, the Company received approvals for the construction of an all-weather access road linking the Amaruq access site to the Meadowbank mine. In 2016 the Company expects to carry out additional engineering and begin road preparation from the Vault pit at Meadowbank. The Company expects to ultimately develop Amaruq as a satellite operation to Meadowbank, with the potential to begin production in 2019. Given that the initial mineral resource grade at Amaruq is well in excess of the mineral reserve grade at Meadowbank, the Company believes that there is good potential for Amaruq to have similar annual output to Meadowbank in its peak production years. Permitting activities and engineering studies for the construction of an initial open pit mine and an underground exploration ramp at Amaruq are ongoing. Meliadine - Moderate 2016 Capital Expenditures Preserves Production Optionality Located near Rankin Inlet, Nunavut, Canada, the Meliadine project was acquired in July 2010, and is one of Agnico Eagle's largest gold projects in terms of mineral resources. The Company owns 100% of the 111,757 hectare property. The updated technical study for Meliadine released last year (see March 12, 2015 news release) forecast average annual production of approximately 350,000 ounces at a life-of-mine total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of approximately $531 over a nine-year mine life. The study used a gold price of C$1,495 per ounce (as compared to a current spot price of approximately C$1,657 per ounce on February 8, 2016). The technical study was based on extracting only the 3.3 million ounces of gold in proven and probable mineral reserves at December 31, 2014 (13.9 million tonnes of ore grading 7.44 g/t gold), which is all contained in the Tiriganiaq and Wesmeg deposits. At December 31, 2015, the Meliadine property hosted 3.4 million ounces of proven and probable mineral reserves (14.5 million tonnes of ore grading 7.32 g/t gold), 3.31 million ounces of measured and indicated mineral resources (20.8 million tonnes of ore grading 4.95 g/t gold), and 3.55 million ounces of inferred mineral resources (14.7 million tonnes of ore grading 7.51 g/t gold). In addition, there are numerous other known gold occurrences in the 80-kilometre-long greenstone belt that require further evaluation. The capital budget for 2016 is $96 million with activities focused on further underground development (approximately 3,000 metres), detailed engineering and procurement, construction of essential surface infrastructure and acquisition of a used camp facility. The goal of the 2016 capital program is to ensure that the project remains on track for a potential 2020 production start-up, which is approximately a one year delay from previous expectations. Internal studies are ongoing to evaluate the potential to extract additional ounces of gold from the Tiriganiaq and Wesmeg/Normeg deposits that could potentially extend the mine life, increase annual production and improve the project economics and the after-tax internal rate of return. These studies are expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2016. On October 5, 2015, the Nunavut Water Board issued the permit (License B) for Meliadine pre-development work. License A, which is required for production activities, is expected to be granted in the second quarter of 2016. The timing of future capital expenditures on the Meliadine project beyond 2016 and the determination of whether to build a mine at Meliadine are subject to approval by Agnico Eagle's Board of Directors which will be based on prevailing market conditions and outcomes of the various potential scenarios being evaluated. El Barqueno - Initial Mineral Resource Announced, Significant Drilling Planned in 2016 The El Barqueno property in Jalisco State, Mexico covers a land position with known strike extent for mineralization larger than both the La India and Pinos Altos properties combined. Previous property owners outlined several mineralized zones through surface exploration and diamond drilling. In 2015, the Company completed approximately 69,500 metres of drilling at a cost of $17 million on the El Barqueno property. The primary focus of the 2015 program was to define the limits of the Azteca-Zapoteca, Angostura and Pena de Oro prospects, and delineate an initial mineral resource estimate for these deposits. Several other prospects were also under evaluation. Based on the 2015 exploration results and previous work programs, the Company has estimated initial total inferred in-pit mineral resources of approximately 0.61 million ounces (19.7 million tonnes grading 0.96 g/t gold) from the Azteca-Zapoteca, Angostura and Pena de Oro areas to open-pit mineable depths. An additional 11,000 metres of drilling has been completed since the estimation of the inferred mineral resource. Further details on the El Barqueno inferred mineral resource can be found in \"Detailed Mineral Reserve and Mineral Resource Data (as at December 31, 2015)\" below. In 2016, Agnico Eagle plans to carry out a $13 million exploration program to further expand and infill the known mineral resource areas and evaluate other prospective targets such as: Olmeca, Zapote, Mixteca, El Rayo, and Pilarica. At present there are 14 drills operating on the project. While it is too early to estimate the full extent of the mineral resources and the number of deposits with economic potential at El Barqueno, the Company has the experience of developing cost-efficient mining operations in Mexico and increasing their size through successful exploration as well as metallurgical innovation. This body of knowledge will be applied as El Barqueno continues to be explored and studied. Agnico Eagle believes that El Barqueno ultimately has the potential to be developed into a series of open pits utilizing heap leach processing, similar to the Creston Mascota and La India mines. Conceptual design studies and additional metallurgical testing are underway at El Barqueno with a goal of potentially starting operations in 2019. Canadian Malartic - Odyssey Zone and Near Pit Opportunities Could Provide Future Production Upside At the Canadian Malartic mine (owned 50% by Agnico Eagle and 50% by Yamana), exploration programs are planned to evaluate a number of near pit/underground targets at the mine and further define the extent of the mineralization at the Odyssey Zone (which is located to the east of the Canadian Malartic open pit). Both of these opportunities could provide new potential sources of ore for the Canadian Malartic mill. In 2016, the Canadian Malartic block model will be reviewed to further define the potential of a number of near pit/underground targets and a 60,000 metre drill program has been proposed to further evaluate the extent of the mineralization at Odyssey. For additional details on these opportunities, see the Canadian Malartic section of this news release. LaRonde - Studies Ongoing to Evaluate Potential to Mine Below a Depth of 3.1 Kilometres Studies are continuing to assess the potential to extend the mineral reserves and carry out mining activities between the 311 and 371 levels at LaRonde. At present, the mineral reserves extend to the 311 level, which is 3.1 kilometres below the surface. Drilling is ongoing to further expand the known mineral resource between the 311 and 341 levels. Additional holes are also being drilled to evaluate the extent of the mineralization down to the 371 level (a depth of 3.7 kilometres below the surface). In 2016, the focus of drilling will be on mineral resource expansion and mineral resource to mineral reserve conversion in the western portion of the LaRonde orebody. 2016 Exploration Program and Budget - Main Focus on Amaruq, El Barqueno and the Sisar Zone at Kittila A large component of the 2016 exploration program will be focused on the Amaruq project near the Meadowbank mine in Nunavut, the El Barqueno project in Jalisco State, Mexico and the Sisar Zone at the Kittila mine in Finland. These exploration programs are designed to infill and expand known deposits and test other favourable target areas. The goal is to delineate mineral reserves and mineral resources that can supplement the Company's existing production profile. The 2016 Amaruq drill program commenced earlier this month with two drills testing targets in the Mammoth Lake area. Eventually the Company expects to have eight to ten drills operating with a focus on infilling and expanding the known mineralized zones, testing other nearby targets with a focus on developing a second source of open pit ore and further evaluation of regional target areas. The initial 2016 exploration program contemplates approximately 75,000 metres of drilling with a budget of approximately $19 million. The 2016 program also includes engineering studies and permitting activities for the construction of an initial open pit mine and an underground exploration ramp. Exploration expenditures at El Barqueno in 2016 are budgeted at $13 million for mineral resource development, conversion and regional exploration. There are currently 14 drills on the property working to define the limits of the known prospects and test new target areas such as: Olmeca, Zapote, Mixteca, El Rayo, and Pilarica. El Barqueno's gold-silver deposits could potentially be developed into a series of open pits utilizing heap leach processing, similar to Creston Mascota and the La India mines. In 2016, approximately $5 million will be spent on further deep drilling at Kittila (which includes the Sisar Zone). The goal of this program is to expand and upgrade the mineral resources and evaluate the potential to possibly develop the Sisar Zone as a new mining horizon at Kittila. Depreciation Guidance Agnico Eagle expects its 2016 depreciation and amortization expense to be in the range of $630 to $660 million. General & Administrative Cost Guidance Agnico Eagle expects 2016 general and administration expense to be between $70 and $80 million, excluding share based compensation. In 2016, share based compensation is expected to be between $20 and $25 million including stock option expense (which is a non-cash item) of between $18 and $22 million, which is consistent with previous years. Please see the supplemental financial data section of the Financial and Operating Database on the Company's website for additional historical financial data. Tax Guidance for 2016 For 2016, the jurisdictional tax rates are expected to be: Canada - 40% to 50% Mexico - 35% to 40% Finland - 20% The Company's overall tax rate is expected to be between 40% and 45%. Gold Reserves Decrease Slightly to Approximately 19.1M Ounces, Reserve Grade Increased at Key Operations To estimate the 2015 year-end mineral reserves, the Company continued to use conservative assumptions: $1,100/ounce gold and $16/ounce silver, US$/C$, EUR/US$ and US$/MPX exchange rates of 1.16, 1.20 and 14.00, respectively for all mines and projects, other than Lapa, Meadowbank, Creston Mascota and the Santo Nino pit at Pinos Altos. Due to the shorter mine life of these mining operations, the Company used exchange rate assumptions for US$/C$ and US$/MXP of 1.30 and 16.00, respectively (other assumptions unchanged). At year-end 2015, the Company's proven and probable mineral reserves (net of 2015 production) totaled 251 million tonnes of ore grading 2.37 g/t gold, containing approximately 19.1 million ounces of gold. This is a decrease of approximately 0.9 million ounces of gold (5%) compared with a year earlier. The decrease in the Company's mineral reserves is largely due to the 1,671,340 ounces of payable gold production in 2015 (1,910,000 ounces of in-situ gold mined), partially offset by successful conversion of measured and indicated mineral resources to mineral reserves at several operations. Highlights from the December 31, 2015 Mineral Reserve Statement include: Increased mineral reserve grades at LaRonde (5.31 g/t gold versus 5.20 g/t gold), Canadian Malartic (1.08 g/t gold versus 1.06 g/t gold), Goldex (1.61 g/t gold versus 1.49 g/t gold), and La India (0.90 g/t gold versus 0.85 g/t gold) At Goldex, the mineral reserves almost doubled to 668,000 ounces of gold with an 8% increase in the mineral reserve grade At the Akasaba project, initial mineral reserves of 141,000 ounces of gold are reported (4.8 million tonnes grading 0.92 g/t gold and 0.52% copper) At La India, the mineral reserves increased by 28% (188,000 ounces) to 867,000 ounces of gold (30.0 million tonnes of ore grading 0.90 g/t gold and 4.23 g/t silver) Comparison of assumptions used to estimate mineral reserves and the gold price in local currencies in 2013, 2014 and 2015 The Company's overall mineral reserve gold grade has decreased slightly to 2.37 g/t from 2.40 g/t. This is the result of a reduction in the cut-off grades at each operation because of a slight increase of the assumed gold price when converted to local currencies (shown in the table above). Agnico Eagle has one of the highest mineral reserve grades among its North American peers. In the Northern Business, gold contained in mineral reserves decreased by 726,000 ounces (4%) in 2015; during the year this business segment produced 1,319,301 ounces of gold (1,451,000 ounces of in-situ gold mined). The largest mineral reserve increase in the Northern Business was at the Goldex mine, where the amount contained in mineral reserves increased by 328,000 ounces of gold (96%), year-over-year, to 668,000 ounces of gold, with an 8% increase in the mineral reserve grade to 1.61 g/t gold from 1.49 g/t gold. The increase is largely due to the successful conversion of mineral resources to mineral reserves, mainly in the D Zone as well as in the M and E zones. These are the initial D Zone probable mineral reserves (354,000 ounces of gold in 6.3 million tonnes of ore grading 1.75 g/t gold), related to the approval of mining the Deep 1 project announced in the Company's news release dated July 29, 2015. This increase was offset by the 2015 production of 115,426 ounces of gold (123,000 ounces of in-situ gold mined). At the nearby Akasaba project, initial probable mineral reserves reported are 141,000 ounces of gold (4.8 million tonnes grading 0.92 g/t gold and 0.52% copper), the result of conversion of indicated mineral resources to mineral reserves. Canadian Malartic had the largest decline in mineral reserves; its mineral reserves decreased by 466,000 ounces of gold, mainly due to 2015 gold production of 285,809 ounces (322,000 ounces of in-situ gold mined). The remainder of the decline was due to a slight reduction in the pit shells related to the incorporation of the 5% net smelter return royalty payable to Osisko Gold Royalties Ltd. and the termination of the Gouldie open pit. All numbers shown for Canadian Malartic reflect Agnico Eagle's 50% ownership in the mine. The decrease in the Meadowbank mine's mineral reserves by mine depletion was partially offset by the conversion of mineral resources to mineral reserves for the Vault pit extension, announced in the Company's news release dated July 29, 2015. At Kittila, the mining depletion was partially offset by successful conversion of mineral resources to mineral reserves. In the Southern Business, the gold contained in mineral reserves decreased by approximately 175,000 ounces (7%) in 2015. This business segment had production of 352,039 ounces of gold (459,000 ounces of in-situ gold mined) in 2015. There was a large increase at the La India mine where the gold mineral reserves increased by 28% (188,000 ounces) to 867,000 ounces of gold (30.0 million tonnes of ore grading 0.90 g/t gold and 4.23 g/t silver) compared with a year ago. The mine depletion was more than offset by the addition of new oxide reserves and by conversion of sulphide mineral resources to mineral reserves in the Main pit, the result of successful metallurgical investigations in 2015 and field-proven experience with the North Zone sulphide material. The 304,000-ounce decline in mineral reserves at Pinos Altos was due to 2015 production of 192,974 ounces of gold (205,000 ounces of in-situ gold mined) as well as a change to the Cerro Colorado block model based on information gained from geological mapping and mining development. It is the Company's goal to maintain its global mineral reserves at approximately 10 to 15 times its annual gold production rate. The current mineral reserves are within this range when compared to the Company's projected annual 2016 production rate. In addition to gold, Agnico Eagle's proven and probable mineral reserves include by-product metals of approximately 55 million ounces of silver at the Pinos Altos, LaRonde, La India and Creston Mascota mines (68.2 million tonnes of ore grading an average of 25.0 g/t silver), plus 147,927 tonnes of zinc and 43,357 tonnes of copper at the LaRonde mine (18.2 million tonnes of ore grading 0.81% zinc and 0.24% copper) and 24,557 tonnes of copper at the Akasaba project (4.8 million tonnes grading 0.52% copper). At a gold price of $1,200 per ounce (leaving all other assumptions unchanged), there would be an approximate 5.4% increase in the gold contained in proven and probable mineral reserves. Conversely, using a gold price of $1,000 (leaving all other assumptions unchanged), there would be an estimated 5.4% decrease in the gold contained in proven and probable mineral reserves. Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources Grow by Approximately 1%, While Inferred Mineral Resources Increase by Approximately 23% Highlights from the December 31, 2015 Mineral Resource Statement include: Measured and indicated mineral resources now total approximately 309 million tonnes of ore grading 1.52 g/t gold, or approximately 15.1 million ounces of gold. This represents an increase of approximately 1% over the 2014 estimate Inferred mineral resources total approximately 230 million tonnes of ore grading 2.24 g/t gold, or approximately 16.5 million ounces of gold. This represents an increase of approximately 23% over the 2014 estimate At Amaruq, inferred mineral resources increased by approximately 67% to 3.3 million ounces of gold (16.9 million tonnes grading 6.05 g/t gold) There was a 43% increase (approximately 533,000 ounces of gold) in inferred mineral resources at Kittila, which includes initial mineral resources in the Sisar Zone discovered in 2015 An initial inferred mineral resource of 608,000 ounces of gold and 3.7 million ounces of silver (19.7 million tonnes grading 0.96 g/t gold and 5.78 g/t silver) was estimated at the El Barqueno project in Mexico At Canadian Malartic, the approach of tripling the cut-off grade of the out-pit mineral resources had the effect of removing 343,000 ounces from the measured and indicated mineral resources, leaving 625,000 ounces (12.8 million tonnes of ore grading 1.51 g/t gold) in measured and indicated mineral resources. The same approach resulted in removing 344,000 ounces from the inferred mineral resource base, leaving 213,000 ounces (4.5 million tonnes of ore grading 1.47 g/t gold) of inferred mineral resources. The cut-off grade used for the calculation of mineral resources at Canadian Malartic is now similar to that used at Goldex The Company's measured and indicated mineral resources now total approximately 309 million tonnes of ore grading 1.52 g/t gold, or 15.1 million ounces of gold. This represents approximately a 1% increase in ounces and a slight increase in grade over the December 2014 measured and indicated mineral resource (see the April 30, 2015 news release for comparison). Two of the Kirkland Lake properties of CMC (50% owned by Agnico Eagle) reported increased indicated mineral resources: the Upper Beaver project increased by 179,000 ounces of gold to 901,000 ounces (4.4 million tonnes grading 6.36 g/t gold), while the Amalgamated Kirkland (\"AK\") project reported initial indicated mineral resources of 133,000 ounces of gold (0.63 million tonnes grading 6.51 g/t gold) (these amounts represent Agnico Eagle's 50% interest). Measured and indicated mineral resources at Kittila increased by 198,000 ounces of gold. La India's measured and indicated mineral resources increased by 143,000 ounces of gold. These increases were offset by the successful conversion drilling from inferred mineral resources at several of the operations, particularly Akasaba and Meadowbank. At Canadian Malartic, the gold in all mineral resource categories declined as the result of adjusting the approach to the out-pit material (adjacent to or below the pit outline) throughout the property. The approach of tripling the cut-off grade of the out-pit mineral resources had the effect of removing 343,000 ounces from the measured and indicated mineral resources, leaving 625,000 ounces (12.8 million tonnes of ore grading 1.51 g/t gold) in measured and indicated mineral resources. The same approach resulted in removing 344,000 ounces from the inferred mineral resource base, leaving 213,000 ounces (4.5 million tonnes of ore grading 1.47 g/t gold) of inferred mineral resources. The cut-off grade used for the calculation of mineral resources at Canadian Malartic is now similar to that used at Goldex. All data shown for Canadian Malartic represent Agnico Eagle's 50% ownership. The Company's inferred mineral resources now total 230 million tonnes of ore grading 2.24 g/t, or approximately 16.5 million ounces of gold. This represents an increase of 23% or approximately 3.1 million ounces of gold in inferred mineral resources (see the Company's April 30, 2015 news release for comparison). The largest part of this increase is the significant updated inferred mineral resource of 16.9 million tonnes grading 6.05 g/t gold (approximately 3.3 million ounces of gold) at the higher-grade Amaruq discovery, which is 50 kilometres from the Meadowbank mine in Nunavut. This is an increase of 1.8 million ounces of gold compared with a year ago. Approximately 56% of the Amaruq mineral resources are near-surface. A portion of the 2015 exploration program at Amaruq involved drill testing portions of the Whale Tail deposit from the north to the south to gain a better understanding of the geological controls on the mineralization. This drilling led to the modelling of thicker, but slightly lower grade zones of mineralization, which resulted in a modest decline in the grade of the inferred mineral resources reachable by open pit. As at December 31, 2015, an initial inferred mineral resource of 608,000 ounces of gold and 3.7 million ounces of silver (19.7 million tonnes grading 0.96 g/t gold and 5.78 g/t silver) was estimated at the El Barqueno project in Mexico. This maiden mineral resource consists of inferred mineral resources from the Azteca-Zapoteca, Angostura and Pena de Oro zones based on preliminary open pit designs. Exploration drilling at depth was responsible for a 43% increase (approximately 533,000 ounces of gold) in inferred mineral resources at Kittila, which includes initial mineral resources in the Sisar Zone, which was discovered in 2015. More details about Sisar can be found in the Kittila operations section of this news release. The Upper Beaver and AK properties in the Kirkland Lake area (50% owned by Agnico Eagle) also reported increased inferred mineral resources, the result of new drilling programs on these projects. The Upper Beaver project increased inferred mineral resources by 136,000 ounces of gold to 659,000 ounces (3.45 million tonnes grading 5.94 g/t gold), while the AK project reported initial inferred mineral resources of 203,000 ounces of gold (1.19 million tonnes grading 5.32 g/t gold) (in each case, representing Agnico Eagle's 50% interest). Successful conversion drilling at depth at the Goldex mine resulted in approximately 329,000 ounces of gold from the inferred mineral resource category to mineral reserves. NORTHERN BUSINESS REVIEW ABITIBI REGION, QUEBEC Agnico Eagle is currently Quebec's largest gold producer with a 100% interest in three mines (LaRonde, Goldex and Lapa) and a 50% interest in the Canadian Malartic mine. These mines are located within 50 kilometres of each other, which provides operating synergies and allows for the sharing of technical expertise. LaRonde Mine - Increased Tonnage From Lower Mine Drives Record Quarterly Production The 100% owned LaRonde mine in northwestern Quebec achieved commercial production in 1988. The LaRonde mill processed an average of 6,128 tpd in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared with an average of 5,847 tpd in the corresponding period of 2014. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$94 in the fourth quarter of 2015, lower than the C$97 per tonne experienced in the fourth quarter of 2014. Throughput in the 2014 period was lower and costs were higher due to the ten days of unscheduled shutdown related to a production hoist drive failure at shaft #4 (the internal winze) in December 2014. Milling performance for the full year 2015 was approximately 6,141 tpd, compared to 5,713 tpd in 2014. Throughput in the 2014 period was lower due primarily to the planned shutdowns for the installation of new hoist drives to replace obsolete production and service hoist equipment in the Penna shaft. Minesite costs per tonne for the full year 2015 were approximately C$99, unchanged from C$99 per tonne in 2014. LaRonde's total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis were $510 in the fourth quarter of 2015 on payable production of 73,161 ounces of gold. This compares with the fourth quarter of 2014 when total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis were $590 on production of 59,316 ounces of gold. The decrease in total cash costs per ounce in the 2015 period was largely due to higher production (due to higher gold grades from the lower mine area and the improved recoveries from the CIP circuit) and favourable foreign exchange rates. For the full year 2015, LaRonde's total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis were $590 on gold production of 267,921 ounces. This compares to total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $668 on gold production of 204,652 ounces in 2014. The higher production and lower costs in the 2015 period are primarily due to the reasons outlined above. In 2015, the LaRonde mine also produced approximately 3,501 tonnes of zinc (67% less than in 2014), 0.9 million ounces of silver (28% less than in 2014), and 4,941 tonnes of copper (1% less than in 2014) as by-products to the gold production. These totals are consistent with the change in the metals mix as the mine goes deeper and becomes more gold rich as opposed to zinc/silver rich in the upper levels. In 2016, approximately 89% of production is expected to come from the lower mine area (below the 248 level). In 2015, work was completed on the installation of the coarse ore conveyor system that extends from the 293 level to the crusher on the 280 level. The new conveyor was commissioned in the fourth quarter and a new ore pass and silo designed to feed the conveyor system are expected to be commissioned in the second quarter of 2016. This new conveyor should help improve mining flexibility and reduce congestion in the deeper portions of the mine. Studies are ongoing to assess the potential to extend the mineral reserve base and carry out mining activities between the 311 and 371 levels at LaRonde. At present, the mineral reserve base extends to the 311 level, which is 3.1 kilometres below the surface. In 2015, exploration drilling focused on the eastern portion of the LaRonde orebody down to the 371 level. As underground development progresses to the west, a key exploration focus in 2016 will be drill testing the western portion of the LaRonde orebody from the 311 to the 371 level. The Company is also evaluating the potential to develop and mine the Bousquet Zone 5 on the adjoining Bousquet property. Previous property owners had partly exploited the Bousquet Zone 5 by open pit and underground, and Agnico Eagle is evaluating the potential to initially mine the Bousquet Zone 5 from a depth of 90 to 330 metres below surface via an underground ramp. The mining method is likely to be similar to that employed at Goldex, and processing could utilize excess capacity from the Lapa circuit at LaRonde. Dewatering of the old pit is underway and permit applications to collect a bulk sample will be submitted shortly. An internal technical study is expected to be completed by the end of 2016. Canadian Malartic Mine - Annual Records Set for Ounces Produced and Tonnes Milled In June 2014, Agnico Eagle and Yamana acquired all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Osisko Mining Corporation (\"Osisko\") and created the Partnership. The Partnership owns and operates the Canadian Malartic mine in northwestern Quebec through a joint management committee. Each of Agnico Eagle and Yamana has an indirect 50% ownership interest in the Partnership. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Canadian Malartic mill processed an average of 52,780 tpd (on a 100% basis) compared with an average of 53,232 tpd in the corresponding period of 2014. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$25 (C$21.76 excluding royalties) compared to the C$21 (C$19.32 excluding royalties) per tonne experienced in the fourth quarter of 2014. In the 2015 period, throughput was lower and costs were higher primarily due to a longer than planned mill shutdown in December 2015. During this shutdown additional costs were incurred to repair the eccentric at the crusher and for the alignment of the ring gear at the #2 ball mill. The average stripping ratio in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 1.86 to 1.0. For the full year 2015, the Canadian Malartic mill processed an average of 52,300 tpd compared with an average of 51,248 tpd in 2014 (on a 100% basis). Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$23 (C$20.24 excluding royalties) compared to the C$22 (C$19.76 excluding royalties) per tonne experienced in 2014. The 2014 tonnage and costs are not considered to be representative as they only reflect the period from the acqusition date of June 16 through December 31. For the fourth quarter of 2015, Agnico Eagle's share of production at the Canadian Malartic mine was 72,872 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $606. This compares with the fourth quarter of 2014 when total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis were $684 on production of 66,369 ounces of gold. Production was higher in the 2015 period primarily due to higher grades. Costs in the 2015 period were lower due to lower costs for fuel and explosives, increased production and favourable foreign exchange rates, partially offset by higher shutdown costs for the planned mill maintenance. For the full year 2015, Agnico Eagle's share of production at the Canadian Malartic mine was 285,809 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $596. This is in contrast with production from June 16 to December 31, 2014, which only included 143,008 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $701 from Canadian Malartic. Future Opportunities - Continuing to Look to Further Optimize Operations Since acquiring the mine in June 2014, the Partnership has been looking at a variety of ways to optimize the operations. In parallel with the Barnat permitting (see below), the Partnership is currently working on the permitting necessary for improving the efficiency and environmental performance of the existing mobile crusher. At this point, milling levels are expected to be approximately 53,000 tpd through year-end 2016. Several other opportunities have been identified to further optimize productivity, including: Improvements to SAG mill liners in order to reduce the number of major shutdowns to three from four Higher North Zone performance with the purchase of an additional remote control production back hoe. This should result in higher grade ore being brought to the mill Cost savings opportunities: primarily on explosives and contractors Ongoing continuous improvement projects Ounce reconciliation with the block model continues to be positive (approximately 5% higher) and is an opportunity to provide additional production flexibility going forward. Permitting activities for the Barnat extension and deviation of Highway 117 are continuing on schedule. An Environmental Impact Assessment (\"EIA\") for this project was submitted in February 2015. A second series of questions from the Quebec government was received by the Partnership in December 2015, and final responses were submitted in January 2016. Public hearings are expected to be held later in 2016. Granting of final permits is expected to occur after the completion of the public consultation process. In parallel, the Partnership is currently working on permitting for improving the efficiency and environmental performance of the existing mobile crusher. Odyssey and Near Pit Targets Could Provide Future Production Upside At the Canadian Malartic mine, exploration programs are planned to evaluate a number of near pit/underground targets at the mine and further define the extent of the mineralization at the Odyssey zone (which is located to the east of the Canadian Malartic open pit). Both of these opportunities could provide new potential sources of ore for the Canadian Malartic mill. At Odyssey, 44 holes (a total of 35,870 metres) were drilled in 2015. Exploration to date has outlined two mineralized zones: Odyssey North and Odyssey South. Odyssey North has been traced from a depth of 550 to 1,200 metres below the surface and along approximately 1,500 metres of strike length. Odyssey South is approximately 200 to 550 metres below surface with an approximate strike length of 1,500 metres. Gold occurs along the margins of a porphyry body in both zones. Plan and three dimensional views of the Odyssey mineralization are shown below. [Plan View Showing Odyssey Zones and Near Pit/Underground opportunities at Canadian Malartic] In 2016, the Canadian Malartic block model will be reviewed to further define the potential of the near pit targets and a 60,000 metre drill program has been proposed to further evaluate the extent of the mineralization at Odyssey. CMC Exploration Activities - Pandora and Kirkland Lake are focus areas In addition to joint, indirect ownership of the Canadian Malartic mine, Agnico Eagle and Yamana are also jointly exploring a portfolio of properties in the Kirkland Lake area and the Pandora and Wood-Pandora properties in the Abitibi region of Quebec. Agnico Eagle and Yamana, indirectly through Canadian Malartic Corporation (CMC) each hold a 50% interest in the Kirkland Lake and Pandora properties, while the Wood-Pandora property is a joint venture between Globex Mining Enterprises Inc. (50%) and CMC. In 2015, approximately 960 metres of underground drifting was carried out on the Pandora project from a track drift developed from the Lapa mine. In addition, 34 surface holes (a total of 19,200 metres) and 13 underground holes (a total of approximately 7,900 metres) were drilled to test the C Zone and Branch Zone targets. Results have been encouraging, and additional underground development and 10,400 metres of drilling is planned in 2016. The proposed budget for Pandora in 2016 (100% basis) is approximately C$4.1 million. In Kirkland Lake, a total of approximately C$7.4 million (100%) was spent in 2015. This work included 58 drill holes (a total of 15,140 metres) on the AK, Upper Canada, Skead-MacGregor and Northland properties. In addition, an Airborne Gravity survey was completed. This new drilling has been incorporated into a new mineral resource estimate for the AK property which is included in Agnico Eagle's December 31, 2015 mineral reserve and mineral resource update (see \"Detailed Mineral Reserve and Mineral Resource Data (as at December 31, 2015)\" below). The proposed budget for Kirkland Lake in 2016 (100% basis) is approximately C$5.2 million. This program will include 3,000 metres of drilling and further data compilation. Lapa - Strong 2015 Performance, Limited Mine Life in 2016 but Exploration Could Provide Additional Upside The 100% owned Lapa mine in northwestern Quebec achieved commercial production in May 2009. The Lapa circuit, located at the LaRonde mill, processed an average of 1,478 tpd in the fourth quarter of 2015. This compares with an average of 1,760 tpd in the fourth quarter of 2014. The reduced throughput in the 2015 period was largely due to lower mill availability resulting from electrical and mechanical issues with the Lapa ball mill. Minesite costs per tonne were C$111 in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to the C$109 realized in the fourth quarter of 2014. Costs in the 2015 period were higher due to the reasons above. Milling performance for the full year 2015 was approximately 1,534 tpd compared to 1,750 tpd in 2014. Throughput in the 2015 period was lower primarily due to downtime related to repairs carried out on the Lapa ball mill in the third and fourth quarters. Full-year minesite costs in 2015 were C$117 per tonne, higher than the C$107 in 2014. Costs were higher in 2015 largely due to the reasons outlined above. Payable production in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 19,929 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $620. This compares with the fourth quarter of 2014, when production was 25,611 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $607. In the 2015 period, production was lower and costs were higher due to a combination of lower throughput and lower grades compared to the 2014 period. For the full year 2015, payable production was 90,967 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $590. The prior year production was 92,622 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $667. Production in 2015 was lower due to lower throughput, while costs were lower primarily due to favourable foreign exchange rates. Under the current life of mine plan, Lapa is only expected to operate until early into the fourth quarter of 2016. Two areas (Zone 8 East - Upper mine and the Zulapa 7 - Deep 2 Zone) have been identified through exploration as areas that could potentially support future mining activity post 2017. However, additional exploration is required, and any potential production from these areas would likely require synergies with other production opportunities such as the Bousquet Zone 5 or the Pandora project. The LaRonde mine has now assumed responsibilities for the management and administration of the Lapa mine and progressive transfers of Agnico Eagle personnel from Lapa are now underway throughout the Company. Goldex - Record Underground Ore Hoisting in Q4 2015, Trend Could Continue into 2016 The 100% owned Goldex mine in northwestern Quebec began operation in 2008 but mining operations in the original orebody, the Goldex Extension Zone (\"GEZ\"), were suspended in October 2011. In July 2012, the M and E satellite zones were approved for development. Mining operations resumed on the M and E satellite zones in September 2013. Mining operations at GEZ remain suspended. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Goldex mine had record underground ore hoisting of 7,273 tpd. Although not currently built into the 2016 production forecast, the Company believes that there is potential for continued strong underground performance in 2016. Should this performance be sustainable, the Company will evaluate the potential to increase mill throughput (current mill capacity is approximately 8,000 tpd). The Goldex mill processed an average of 6,213 tpd in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to 6,251 tpd in the fourth quarter of 2014, which was similar to prior-year levels. Minesite costs per tonne were approximately C$31 in the fourth quarter of 2015, lower than the C$34 per tonne experienced in the fourth quarter of 2014. The 2015 decrease in costs over the prior-year period is primarily due to the strong underground performance outlined above. For the full year 2015, the Goldex mill averaged 6,336 tpd, which compares to 5,799 tpd in the corresponding period of 2014. The higher throughput in the 2015 period was largely due to accelerated mining levels compared to the 2014 period. Full-year minesite costs per tonne in 2015 were C$33, the same in 2014. Payable production in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 27,646 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $513. This compares with the fourth quarter of 2014, when production was 29,463 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $583. Production in the 2014 period was higher due to slightly higher grades and marginally more ore processed compared to the 2015 period. Costs were lower in the 2015 period due to lower unit costs and favourable exchange rates as compared to the same period in 2014. For the full year 2015, payable production was 115,426 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $538. The prior year production was 100,433 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $638. Production in 2015 was higher and costs were lower than in 2014 due to higher tonnage, grade and recoveries. Rehabilitation of the surface ramp has been completed which provides increased operational flexibility. This ramp also provides access to the M2 and M5 satellite zones for conversion drilling and development later this year. The exploration ramp into the DX Zone (the top of the Deep Zone) has reached the 120 level, which is the proposed bottom of the Deep 1 development phase. Underground development in the Deep 1 Zone will now shift to excavation of the various sublevels needed for mining development and excavation of the conveyor ramp. Studies are underway to evaluate the potential to increase throughput from the Deep 1 Zone, and the potential to mine a portion of the Deep 2 Zone, both of which could enhance production levels or extend the current mine life at Goldex and reduce operating costs. In January 2014, Agnico Eagle acquired the Akasaba West gold-copper deposit from Alexandria Minerals. Located less than 30 km from Goldex, the Akasaba West deposit could potentially create flexibility and synergies for the Company's operations in the Abitibi region by utilizing extra milling capacity at both Goldex and LaRonde, while reducing overall costs. Permitting and technical studies are ongoing with the goal of moving the project towards a production decision in late 2016 or early 2017. FINLAND AND SWEDEN Agnico Eagle's Kittila mine in Finland is the largest primary gold producer in Europe and hosts the Company's largest mineral reserves. Exploration activities continue to expand the mineral resources and studies are underway to evaluate the potential to cost-effectively increase production. Kittila - Strong Mining Performance in Q4 2015 and Available Mill Capacity Provide Potential for Increased Future Production The 100% owned Kittila mine in northern Finland achieved commercial production in 2009. The focus at Kittila in 2015 was on improving mill reliability. Several projects were carried out in the fourth quarter of 2015 which appear to have improved maintenance performance. With further optimization, the Company believes that there is potential for improved mill availability, which could lead to higher throughput levels (possibly up to 20% higher) in the future. The Kittila mill processed an average of 4,100 tpd in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the 3,980 tpd in the fourth quarter of 2014. The underground performed very well in the fourth quarter resulting in record average daily throughput of 4,750 tpd in December 2015. Minesite costs per tonne at Kittila were approximately EUR80 in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to EUR75 in the fourth quarter of 2014. Costs increased in the fourth quarter of 2015 due to the increased usage of consumables, higher contractor costs and increased underground development costs when compared with the 2014 period. For the full year 2015, the mill processed an average of 4,011 tpd, as compared with 2014 when the mill processed an average of 3,168 tpd. The increase in throughput was a result of the completion of the mill expansion at the end of September 2014. For the full year 2015, the minesite costs per tonne were EUR76, compared to EUR78 in 2014. The slight decrease in minesite costs per tonne in the 2015 period are primarily due to efficiencies related to increased mill capacity. Fourth quarter 2015 payable production at Kittila was 44,279 ounces of gold with total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $747. In the fourth quarter of 2014, the mine produced 43,130 ounces at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $809. The higher production and lower costs in the 2015 period were a result of the completion of the mill expansion which continues to ramp-up to design capacity and favourable exchange rates. For the full year 2015, payable production from Kittila was 177,374 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $709. In 2014, the mine produced 141,742 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $845. The lower production in 2014 was largely due to the planned mill shutdown in September 2014 to tie-in the expansion. The lower total cash costs per ounce in the 2015 period are largely due to increased production and favourable foreign exchange rates. Previous drilling on the Rimpi Zone at Kittila has outlined a significant zone of mineralization with potentially wider widths and better grades than those currently being mined. The main underground ramp at Kittila is being extended to reach the deeper portions of the Rimpi Zone and it is also providing further underground drill access to test for additional depth extensions of the Rimpi, Suuri, Roura and the newly discovered Sisar mineralized zones. In addition, a surface ramp is being driven into the Rimpi Zone (now at a depth of 190 metres below surface) for production purposes and to provide a second egress for the Suuri ramp system. It will serve as the main haulage route from the deeper portions of both Rimpi and Suuri and, potentially, the Sisar Zone. At the Kuotko deposit, located approximately 15 kilometres north of Kittila, approximately 7,300 metre of drilling was completed in 2015. New mineralized zones have been identified outside of the known mineral resource areas. Metallurgical testing is also ongoing and studies are being carried out to assess the viability of mining the deposit as a satellite open pit. In 2015, a new zone of mineralization, known as the Sisar Zone, was discovered by exploration drilling from the underground ramp being driven towards the deeper portion of the Rimpi Zone. The Sisar Zone is located to the east of the main Kittila ore zone, and in close proximity to existing underground infrastructure. The Sisar Zone could potentially provide an additional source of underground ore to the Kittila mill with relatively little additional underground development, should further drilling outline an economic deposit. This new zone is discussed in further detail below. Inferred mineral resources at Kittila as of December 31, 2015 include the initial inferred mineral resources reported for the Sisar zone. As the table below sets out, 37% (approximately 651,000 ounces of gold) of the current inferred resources at Kittila are within the Sisar zone. Note that all of the inferred resources at Kittila, including Sisar, are above 1,400 metres depth. Meliadine - Moderate 2016 Capital Expenditures Preserves Production Optionality Located near Rankin Inlet, Nunavut, Canada, the Meliadine project was acquired in July 2010, and is one of Agnico Eagle's largest gold projects in terms of mineral resources. The Company owns 100% of the 111,757 hectare property. In 2015, capital expenditures at Meliadine were approximately $67 million with a focus on additional ramp development, permitting, camp operation and completion of an updated National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\"NI 43-101\") technical study (see news release dated March 12, 2015). In 2015, approximately 2,084 metres of underground development were completed, with the ramp now extending to a vertical depth of approximately 300 metres below the surface. The technical study was based on extracting only the 3.3 million ounces of gold in proven and probable mineral reserves at December 31, 2014 (13.9 million tonnes of ore grading 7.44 g/t gold), which is all contained in the Tiriganiaq and Wesmeg deposits. At December 31, 2015, the Meliadine property hosted 3.4 million ounces of proven and probable mineral reserves (14.5 million tonnes of ore grading 7.32 g/t gold), 3.31 million ounces of measured and indicated mineral resources (20.78 million tonnes of ore grading 4.95 g/t gold), and 3.55 million ounces of inferred mineral resources (14.71 million tonnes of ore grading 7.51 g/t gold). In addition, there are numerous other known gold occurrences in the 80-kilometre-long greenstone belt that require further evaluation. The updated technical study forecast average annual production of approximately 350,000 ounces at a life-of-mine total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of approximately $531 over a nine year mine life. The study used a gold price of C$1,495 per ounce (as compared to a current spot price of approximately C$1,657 per ounce on February 8, 2016). The capital budget for 2016 is $96 million with activities focused on further underground development (approximately 3,000 metres), detailed engineering and procurement, construction of essential surface infrastructure, and acquisition of a used camp facility. The goal of the 2016 capital program is to ensure that the project remains on track for a potential 2020 production start-up, which is approximately a one year delay from previous expectations. Internal studies are ongoing to evaluate the potential to extract additional ounces of gold from the Tiriganiaq and Wesmeg/Normeg deposits, which could potentially extend the mine life, increase annual production, and improve the project economics and the after-tax internal rate of return. These studies are expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2016. In July 2015, the Kivalliq Inuit Association and Agnico Eagle signed the Inuit Impact Benefit Agreement (\"IIBA\") for the Meliadine gold project. The IIBA addresses protection of Inuit values, culture and language, protection of the land, water and wildlife, provides financial compensation to Inuit over the mine life and contains provision for training, employment and contracting. On October 5, 2015, the Nunavut Water Board issued the permit (License B) for Meliadine pre-development work. License A, which is required for production activities, is expected to be granted in the second quarter of 2016. The timing of future capital expenditures on the Meliadine project beyond 2016 and the determination of whether to build a mine at Meliadine are subject to approval by Agnico Eagle's Board of Directors, which will be based on prevailing market conditions and outcomes of the various potential scenarios being evaluated. Acquisition of New Properties in Nunavut Agnico Eagle is currently studying options and alternatives in Nunavut to capitalize on the large and growing mineral resource in the region. As part of this initiative, the Company has staked in 2015 new claims totaling 68,012 hectares on properties to the west-northwest of the project, on the continuation of the greenstone belt that hosts the Meliadine deposits. In summer 2015, an airborne VTEM magnetic and electromagnetic survey was flown over the new properties. A field crew initiated prospecting and sampling of areas with geophysical signatures typical of iron formation-hosted Archean/Proto-Proterozoic deposits, similar to those recognized at Meadowbank, Amaruq and Meliadine projects. Close to 800 rock samples have been collected from the properties. Initial results have identified a 2-kilometre-long structure from which 21 rock samples returned values above 1.0 g/t gold including seven values in excess of 10.0 g/t gold, with a maximum value of 42.0 g/t gold. The new properties appear to be geologically similar to the Meadowbank, Meliadine and Amaruq projects where the Company's exploration team has demonstrated the effectiveness of a systematic exploration approach and the strong mineral potential of this part of Nunavut. Assembling and analyzing the data collected this summer will assist in preparing a drill program for 2016 to further investigate the higher potential areas on the new properties. SOUTHERN BUSINESS REVIEW Agnico Eagle's Southern Business operations are focused in Mexico. These operations have been the source of growing precious metals production (gold and silver), stable operating costs and strong free cash flow since 2009. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the Mexican operations had record quarterly silver production of approximately 745,000 ounces. Pinos Altos - Shaft Commissioning Scheduled for H1 2016 The 100% owned Pinos Altos mine in northern Mexico achieved commercial production in November 2009. The Pinos Altos mill processed 4,940 tpd in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to 5,466 tpd per day processed in the fourth quarter of 2014. During the fourth quarter of 2015, approximately 146,200 tonnes of ore were stacked on the leach pad at Pinos Altos, compared to 131,000 tonnes in the comparable 2014 period. Mill throughput in the 2015 period was negatively impacted by cold weather conditions and a higher percentage of clay in the ore. Minesite costs per tonne at Pinos Altos were $44 in the fourth quarter of 2015, lower than the $48 in the fourth quarter of 2014. The difference in minesite costs per tonne was largely attributable to variations in the proportion of heap leach ore to milled ore and open pit ore to underground ore and routine fluctuations in the waste to ore stripping ratio in the open pit mines. In addition, the 2015 costs were favourably impacted by lower energy and fuel costs. For the full year 2015, the Pinos Altos mill processed an average of 5,462 tpd, compared to 5,350 tpd processed in 2014. In 2015, approximately 384,700 tonnes of ore were stacked on the leach pad at Pinos Altos, compared to approximately 567,800 tonnes in 2014. Minesite costs per tonne at Pinos Altos for the full year period in 2015 were approximately $45 compared to approximately $48 in 2014, with the difference due to the reasons mentioned above. Payable production in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 44,496 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $417. This compares with production of 40,669 ounces at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $597 in the fourth quarter of 2014. Higher production in 2015 is largely due to higher grades processed compared to the same period last year. The decrease in the year over year total cash costs per ounce is largely due to higher silver production and favourable foreign exchange rates compared to the prior year period. For the full year 2015, Pinos Altos produced 192,974 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $387. This is in contrast to 2014 when the mine produced 171,019 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $533. The higher ounces produced and decrease in the cash costs per ounce on a year-over-year basis is largely due to the reasons mentioned above. The $106 million Pinos Altos shaft sinking project remains on schedule for completion in early 2016, with full commissioning expected during the first half of 2016. When the shaft is completed, it will allow better matching of the future mining capacity with the mill capacity at Pinos Altos once the open pit mining operation begins to wind down as planned over the next several years. Creston Mascota - Record Annual Tonnes Stacked The Creston Mascota heap leach has been operating as a satellite operation to the Pinos Altos mine since late 2010. Approximately 529,000 tonnes of ore were stacked on the Creston Mascota leach pad during the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to approximately 550,800 tonnes stacked in the fourth quarter of 2014. In the 2015 period, crusher throughput was slightly lower due to cold weather conditions which created minor ore handling issues. Minesite costs per tonne at Creston Mascota were $13 in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $14 in the fourth quarter of 2014. Costs were slightly lower in the 2015 period due to lower fuel consumption, favourable fuel price variance and lower equipment rental charges. For the full year 2015, approximately 2,098,800 tonnes of ore were stacked on the Creston Mascota leach pad, compared to approximately 1,793,800 tonnes stacked in the full year 2014. In the 2015 period, additional ore was encountered outside the block model, which resulted in more tonnes being stacked in the first half of the year compared to the 2014 period. Minesite costs per tonne at Creston Mascota were $12 for the full year 2015, compared to $16 in 2014. The increase in tonnes stacked in the 2015 period resulted in lower costs compared to the 2014 period. Payable production at Creston Mascota in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 13,933 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $445. This compares to 12,989 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $556 during the fourth quarter of 2014. Production was higher in the 2015 period due to higher grades. Costs in the 2015 period were lower primarily due to increased production and favourable exchange rates. Payable production for the full year 2015 totaled 54,703 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $430, compared to 47,842 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $578 in 2014. The higher production in 2015 is primarily due to more tonnes stacked at slightly higher grades. Costs were lower in the 2015 period primarily due to more ounces produced and favourable exchange rates. In fourth quarter of 2015, work on the Phase 4 leach pad advanced with construction activities focused on earthworks, drainages, peripheral roads and water diversion channels. Overall, the project is 50% constructed with full completion expected later in 2016. As reported in the Company's July 29, 2015 news release, infill drilling has encountered higher grade mineralization at the Creston Mascota deposit. In the fourth quarter of 2015, five holes totaling approximately 600 metres were completed which showed structural continuity of the mineralization down dip. Work is underway to evaluate the impact of these results on the pit design and production planning. La India - Increased Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources at Year-End 2015 The La India mine in Sonora, Mexico, located approximately 70 kilometres from the Company's Pinos Altos mine, was acquired in November 2011 through the purchase of Grayd Resources Inc., which held a 56,000 hectare land position in the Mulatos gold belt. Commissioning of the mine commenced ahead of schedule in the third quarter of 2014. Design, permitting, construction and start-up of the La India mine were completed within 22 months of the acquisition. In 2014, the mine reported 3,180 ounces of pre-commercial production, and commercial production was declared as at February 1, 2014. Approximately 1,439,500 tonnes of ore were stacked on the La India leach pad during the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to approximately 1,426,700 tonnes stacked in the fourth quarter of 2014. Minesite costs per tonne at La India were $8 in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to $9 in the fourth quarter of 2014. The slightly lower costs in the 2015 period are primarily due to lower costs for fuel, consumables and labour. For the full year 2015, approximately 5,371,400 tonnes of ore were stacked on the La India leach pad compared to approximately 4,773,200 tonnes stacked in the full year 2014. Minesite costs per tonne at La India were $9 for the full year 2015, compared to $8 in 2014. The increase in tonnes stacked in the 2015 period reflects a full year of stacking versus 11 months (the commercial production period) in 2014. Costs were slightly higher due to higher maintenance and contractor costs. Payable production at La India in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 23,432 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $485. This compares to 23,273 ounces at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $496 during the fourth quarter of 2014. Costs were slightly better in the 2015 period due to favourable foreign exchange rates. Payable production for the full year 2015 totaled 104,362 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $436, compared to 75,093 ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce on a by-product basis of $487 in 2014. The higher production in 2015 is primarily due to more ore tonnes stacked compared to the 2014 period. Costs were lower in the 2015 period due to more ounces produced and favourable foreign exchange rates. In the fourth quarter of 2015, construction for the leach pad expansion (earthworks and liner installation) was finished within budget and haul road construction and preparation activities for the start-up of mining at the Main Zone pit were also completed. Additional drilling was carried out at La India in 2015, with a focus on extending mineralization in the Main Zone and the La India Zone and conversion of sulfide mineralization into mineral reserves and mineral resources. In addition, drilling was also carried out on a portion of the El Realito property. The 2015 exploration program resulted in a 28% increase in mineral reserves, and a 21% increase in measured and indicated mineral resources (see \"Detailed Mineral Reserve and Mineral Resource Data (as at December 31, 2015)\" below). With the increased mineral reserves and mineral resources, the Company is undertaking studies consider the potential for expanding production at the mine. El Barqueno - Drilling Continues with a Focus on Mineral Resource Delineation and Defining New Target Areas Agnico Eagle has a 100% interest in the El Barqueno project. The 32,840-hectare property is in the Guachinango gold-silver mining district, Jalisco State, Mexico, approximately 150 kilometres west of the state capital of Guadalajara. It consists of three blocks of land: the original El Barqueno package (El Barqueno I, II and III) acquired from Cayden Resources in November 2014, and two adjacent blocks acquired from Soltoro Limited in June 2015 (El Rayo and El Tecolote). The Company last reported on this project in a news release dated October 28, 2015. The El Barqueno project contains a number of known mineralized zones and several prospects that require further evaluation. The project was a major exploration focus for the Company in 2015, with a total of 279 holes (a total of 69,522 metres) drilled in the $17 million exploration program. Using these results, an initial inferred mineral resource at El Barqueno is being reported in this news release: 19.7 million tonnes grading 0.96 g/t gold and 5.78 g/t silver (containing 608,000 ounces of gold and 3.7 million ounces of silver) at the Azteca-Zapoteca, Angostura and Pena de Oro zones. Exploration expenditures at El Barqueno in 2016 are budgeted at $13 million for mineral resource development, conversion and regional exploration. There are currently 14 drills working to define the limits of the known prospects and test new target areas such as: Olmeca, Zapote, Mixteca, El Rayo and Pilarica. The project's gold-silver deposits could potentially be developed into a series of open pits utilizing heap leach processing, similar to Creston Mascota and the La India mine.

One of the greatest challenges the global community has ever faced is how to sustainably feed a rapidly growing population. This challenge is complex and won't be solved quickly, but we believe we're stronger working together. By collaborating with multiple groups, we build long-term, impactful programs and solutions that we continually learn from and build upon. So that, together, we can feed the world responsibly and improve the lives of future generations. Agrium reports strong fourth quarter results TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 09, 2016 CALGARY, ALBERTA--(Marketwired - Feb. 9, 2016) - ALL AMOUNTS ARE STATED IN U.S.$ Agrium Inc. (TSX:AGU) (NYSE:AGU) announced today 2015 fourth quarter net earnings from continuing operations of $200-million ($1.45 diluted earnings per share), compared to $70-million ($0.46 diluted earnings per share) in the fourth quarter of 2014. The increased net earnings were driven by strong performance from our Wholesale business unit, which achieved reduced cost of production and higher overall sales volumes for all three nutrients. Retail's fourth quarter earnings were also higher than last year, despite the wet weather in the U.S. during the fall application season. On an annual basis, 2015 net earnings from continuing operations were $988-millon ($6.98 diluted earnings per share) compared to $798-millon ($5.51 diluted earnings per share) in 2014. Highlights: Fourth quarter adjusted net earnings of $209-million or $1.52 per share (see page 2 for adjusted net earnings reconciliation)1, the second highest fourth quarter results on record. Our results include an $18-million restructuring expense ($0.10 per share) associated with the portfolio review and cost reduction measures undertaken, which was not included in the adjusted net earnings reconciliation on page 2. Wholesale's fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA2 of $372-million demonstrates improved nitrogen and potash production performance, delivering higher sales volumes and significantly lower production costs. The Canpotex proving run for the Vanscoy expansion was highly successful. We demonstrated our nameplate capacity within a year of mechanical completion, which increased our allocation to 10.3 percent of total Canpotex shipments starting in 2016. Retail EBITDA2 was higher than the same quarter last year as a result of strong year-end rebates for crop protection products and seed as well as lower operating expenses as a result of cost reduction initiatives implemented in 2015. On an annual basis, Retail U.S. normalized comparable store sales was up 2 percent versus a 2 percent decline in 2014. On an annual basis, 2015 free cash flow3 increased to $1.2-billion, or $8.59 per share, compared to $841-million, or $5.85 per share in 2014. Agrium has announced a 2016 annual guidance range of $5.50 to $7.00 diluted earnings per share (see page 3 for further details). \"Agrium achieved a strong finish to 2015, despite lower nutrient prices and challenging commodity markets. A key differentiator for the company was our integrated strategy, which helped provide stability in our earnings. We also benefited from the proactive steps we took to further strengthen the company over the past year, including a renewed focus on execution and controlling our controllables. These benefits flowed through to our bottom line, helped us to generate $8.59 of free cash flow per share and drive increased returns to shareholders, while still investing in future earnings growth,\" commented Chuck Magro, Agrium's President and CEO. Quarter effective tax rate of 20 percent used for adjusted net earnings and per share calculations. These are non-IFRS measures which represent net earnings adjusted for certain income (expenses) that are considered to be non-operational in nature. We believe these measures provide meaningful comparison to the earnings of other companies by eliminating share-based payments expense (recovery), gains (losses) on foreign exchange and related gains (losses) on non-qualifying derivative hedges and significant non-operating, non-recurring items. These should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS and may not be directly comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. EBITDA is earnings (loss) from continuing operations before finance costs, income taxes, depreciation and amortization while Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA before finance costs, income taxes, depreciation and amortization of joint ventures. These are non-IFRS measures. Refer to section \"Non-IFRS Measures\". This is a non-IFRS measure. Refer to section \"Non-IFRS Measures\". \"Nutrient prices have been under pressure globally but we are optimistic we will see a strong spring application season across North America. We remain focused on Operational Excellence and our growth strategy, controlling what we can in order to reduce our cost position, while continuing to optimize and grow our more stable Retail operations,\" added Mr. Magro. MARKET OUTLOOK The macroeconomic environment has continued to be challenging for commodities, resulting in many commodities trading at multi-year lows in early 2016. While agricultural commodities are driven by unique supply and demand fundamentals, prices have not escaped the general negative sentiment toward commodities. In addition to this, the prices of most crops have been pressured by another year of high global crop yields in 2015, allowing the global inventories of many major grains and oilseeds to increase. Furthermore, the strength in the U.S. dollar relative to most other global currencies has increased the competitiveness of non-U.S. growers, which has led to lower than expected U.S. grain and oilseed exports and added pressure on prices. Despite the weak macroeconomic environment, we expect growers within North America and other major agricultural markets will plant historically high crop acreage again in 2016, supporting robust crop input demand. In the U.S., growers are expected to increase overall crop acreage, including a one to three million acre increase in corn area, as significant crop acreage was lost in 2015 due to excess moisture in parts of the U.S. Corn Belt. Outside of the U.S., the weakness in domestic currencies has led to relatively attractive domestic crop prices, which is expected to support planted acreage. Analysts project that North American corn, soybean, cotton and canola acreage could increase in 2016 if weather cooperates, which is supportive of overall seed demand, but like 2015, growers may be more discerning in trait selection to optimize for yield depending on field locations. Crop protection prices are expected to be relatively stable and we expect that lower year-over-year cash rents and significantly lower fuel and crop nutrient prices will provide support for North American crop input expenditures in 2016. Crop nutrient prices have declined over the past few months, driven by a combination of supply and demand factors. The fall application season in the U.S. was expected to be supported by the relatively early end of the harvest season; however the same warm weather that supported a rapid harvest delayed fall ammonia applications because soil temperatures were too high. Following the warm start, the ability of growers to apply nutrients was constrained by persistent wet weather. November 2015 was the wettest November in the U.S. since 1985 and December 2015 was the wettest December on record in addition to being the warmest. The combination of wet and warm weather meant that application equipment could not get into the field to apply crop nutrients, resulting in below-expected fall applications. The lower than expected fall applications left crop nutrient inventories at higher than expected levels throughout the supply chain and pressured prices of all crop nutrients. The combination of expected increase in U.S. corn acreage and the poor fall application season is anticipated to result in strong U.S. crop nutrient demand in the first half of 2016. Based on expected crop acreage, North American crop nutrient demand is expected to increase by 1 to 3 percent in 2015/2016, but phosphate and potash demand may fall below that range as volumes lost due to the poor fall season may not be fully made up in the first half of 2016. Global urea prices have declined significantly below the cost of production of the high-cost Chinese producers. Even so, Chinese urea production has remained surprisingly strong. While Chinese urea production has not declined as much as expected, Chinese urea exports declined by 26 percent year-over-year in the second half of 2015. Chinese urea costs have declined due to lower coal prices and the weakened yuan, but costs have not declined as much as urea prices. As a result of the continued price weakness and increased non-Chinese urea supplies, Chinese urea exports are projected to decline from 2015 levels to between 12.5 and 13.5 million tonnes in 2016. We expect that the combination of poor Chinese urea profitability and strong North American demand will support urea prices entering the spring season. Chinese phosphate supplies have also pressured that market. Chinese diammonium phosphate and monoammonium phosphate exports reached a record 10.6 million tonnes in 2015 and are expected to remain relatively flat in 2016. On the demand side, the Brazilian market for crop nutrients continued to fall short of expectations in late 2015 as credit constraints and the weak value of the Brazilian real pressured demand for all nutrients. Given that these challenges remain, we expect 2016 Brazilian import demand for all products to remain relatively flat to 2015. The below-average Indian monsoon and weak rupee value pressured demand for phosphate and potash in late 2015, while 2015 urea imports set a record, all of which has led to building inventories and the belief that Indian import demand will be relatively low to start 2016. Global potash markets have been under pressure recently due to a combination of factors, including the sizeable shift in global currencies, a build-up of global inventories due to strong shipments earlier in the year, Indian demand impacted by the below average monsoon and buyers delaying purchases due to the current price uncertainty. We anticipate solid potash demand in global markets in 2016, with global shipments expected to come in between 58 to 60 million tonnes in 2016, relative to the 58.5 million tonnes shipped in 2015. We expect macroeconomic challenges in combination with current crop prices to be a risk in 2016. However, the arrival of the Northern Hemisphere's spring application season over the next couple of months is expected to result in improved demand, particularly in light of the poor fall season in the U.S. and the fact declining crop nutrient prices have caused buyers around the world to sit back and wait for stability. We also expect there will be a supply response across all three major nutrients in reaction to current price levels - some of which we have seen already in the form of production cuts and closures. 2016 ANNUAL GUIDANCE Based on our Market Outlook, Agrium expects to achieve annual diluted earnings per share of $5.50 to $7.00 in 2016. We have maintained a range encompassing approximately $300-million of EBITDA variability to reflect the risk and opportunity associated with crop nutrient prices and demand for crop inputs. We are assuming normal spring and fall application seasons, recognizing there is always a risk that inclement weather could affect the timing and duration of each season. Our earnings per share guidance assumes some recovery from current nitrogen prices during the key application seasons. Based on these and other assumptions regarding crop nutrient prices and demand for crop nutrients set out under the heading \"Market Outlook\", we expect Retail EBITDA to be $1.075-billion to $1.175-billion, and Retail nutrient sales volumes to be 9.8 to 10.2 million tonnes in 2016. Based on our expected increase in utilization rate for our nitrogen assets, we anticipate nitrogen production to total 3.5 to 3.7 million tonnes. Agrium has continued its active hedging program for our gas requirements in 2016 as we expect natural gas prices to remain at levels consistent with 2015. Our earnings per share guidance assume NYMEX gas prices will be between $2.05 and $2.85 per MMBtu in 2016. Agrium's expectation for potash production in 2016 includes incremental production from the completed expansion at our Vanscoy mine. We expect to produce between 2.4 and 2.6 million tonnes of potash in 2016. Total capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $800-million to $900-million, of which approximately $500-million to $550-million is expected to be sustaining capital expenditures. Our investing capital program planned for 2016 includes the completion of our Borger brownfield urea expansion. Agrium's annual effective tax rate for 2016 is expected to be 27 to 28 percent, consistent with 2015. This guidance and updated additional measures and related assumptions are summarized in the following table. Guidance excludes the impact of share-based payments expense (recovery), gains (losses) on foreign exchange and related non-qualifying derivative hedges and significant non-operating, non-recurring items.

Realized selling prices, on the other hand, decreased as a result of weaker market conditions. Reduced sales of product purchased for resale contributed to the decrease in sales as Agrium exited non-core, low return portions of this business. Wholesale's gross profit significantly increased due to manufacturing cost efficiencies associated with higher production volumes, reduced overall fixed costs and lower natural gas input costs for the fourth quarter compared to the same periods last year. Retail's sales and gross profit decreased for the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year primarily due to unfavorable weather conditions and the closure of one of our livestock export businesses in Australia. A decrease in gross profit was partially offset by higher rebates received in the fourth quarter of 2015. Expenses General and administrative expenses decreased by $4-million (5 percent) for the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year as a result of reduced payroll and office expenses related to our ongoing Operational Excellence program. Our share-based payments expense was lower by $10-million due primarily to a slight decrease in our share price in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to a share price increase in the fourth quarter of 2014. Other expenses breakdown In the fourth quarter of 2015, other expenses increased by $18-million due to the following: Costs of $18-million were incurred in the implementation of our Operational Excellence initiatives in the current quarter relating primarily to severance and closure costs. We recorded a goodwill impairment of $19-million for our Wholesale Europe operations. We recognized a $17-million gain from the sale of our West Sacramento nitrogen upgrade facility. We had losses of $15-million on natural gas derivatives in the fourth quarter of 2014, which we recorded directly to other expenses. 2015 did not have comparable results, as effective January 1, 2015, we began to designate all of our natural gas derivatives as qualifying hedges for accounting purposes. Related gains or losses are now recorded as part of cost of product sold when we sell the related product, while unrealized gains or losses are recorded in equity. Bad debt recovery of $11-million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014. Effective Tax Rate The effective tax rate on continuing operations of 20 percent for the fourth quarter was higher than the tax rate of (4) percent for the comparative quarter in 2014 due to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax assets in the fourth quarter of 2014. Excluding the recognition of the one-time previously unrecognized tax assets, the effective tax rate would have been 19 percent. BUSINESS SEGMENT PERFORMANCE Retail  Retail sales and gross profit during the quarter were lower than the same period last year due to lower crop input prices and wet weather across the U.S. impacting the fall application season. Total Retail selling expenses decreased by 10 percent compared to the prior year due to lower depreciation and amortization, the impact of currency valuations in our international businesses and cost reduction measures taken across the business in 2015. Total EBITDA increased 10 percent over the fourth quarter of 2014 primarily due to lower selling expenses, strong margins for crop protection products and improved seed results. Regionally, all key geographies performed well. Canada and the U.S. both showed higher fourth quarter EBITDA figures. Australian EBITDA was down slightly compared to the prior year; however, EBIT in Australia increased compared to the prior quarter due to a reduction in depreciation and amortization. Our U.S. Retail business also reported an annual 2 percent increase in normalized comparable store sales versus a decrease of 2 percent in 2014. Crop nutrients Total crop nutrient sales were 13 percent lower compared to the same period last year due to weaker global pricing and lower application volumes due to weather challenges. However, crop nutrient margins per tonne improved, which offset the lower volumes and resulted in only a 1 percent decline in gross profit. Total crop nutrient volumes were 6 percent lower this quarter across our Retail operations compared to the same period last year. Volumes were lower in the U.S. due to excess rain in the fall application window, while in Canada and Australia, growers were conservative given the uncertainty over nutrient and agricultural markets. Total crop nutrient margins increased slightly on a per tonne basis and gross profit as a percentage of sales rose from 16 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014 to 18 percent this quarter reflecting a focus on inventory management. Crop protection products Total crop protection sales were down 2 percent this quarter, as slightly higher sales in North America were offset by lower sales in our International operations. U.S. sales were driven by a strong herbicide application season, while Canadian growers purchased higher volumes ahead of the weakening Canadian dollar. In Australia, sales were lower due to the weakening of the Australian dollar against the U.S. dollar; in local currency, Australian sales were higher in the current quarter. Crop protection margins as a percentage of sales increased 3 percent, primarily due to year-end rebate reconciliation and a higher margin product mix in the current quarter. Proprietary product sales as a percentage of total sales increased 2 percent compared to the same period in the prior year. Seed Seed sales were down 18 percent this quarter compared to the same period last year, primarily due to the significant reduction in planted wheat acres in the U.S. due to wet weather and lower wheat prices. Despite lower sales, seed margins increased 8 percent compared to the prior year due to strong supplier rebates and seed sales mix. Merchandise Merchandise sales decreased compared to the same period last year as a result of lower fuel pricing and demand in Canada and lower animal health and fencing product sales in Australia due to dry conditions. Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased 3 percent this quarter, primarily due to a reduction in the lower-margin Canadian fuel business compared to the prior year. Services and other Sales for services and other was down 35 percent this quarter, due mainly to the closure of one of our livestock export businesses in Australia. Application and other services were down in North America, due to the wet conditions in the U.S. during the fall application season. Wholesale  Wholesale successfully completed its Canpotex proving run for the Vanscoy potash expansion at the end of the fourth quarter, resulting in our annual Canpotex allocation increasing to 10.3 percent in 2016 from 7.3 percent in 2015. Higher operating production rates at our nitrogen facilities also supported increased sales volumes this quarter. Total sales were slightly lower this quarter due to lower global nutrient prices and our decision to sell non-core, lower-return purchase for resale facilities in 2015 related to our asset portfolio review. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $222-million this quarter, and more than doubled compared to the same quarter last year. The increase was primarily due to lower production costs per tonne and higher utilization rates from our potash and nitrogen operations. Nitrogen Nitrogen gross profit increased by 65 percent over the same period last year as a result of higher sales volumes and significantly lower cost of production. Sales volumes increased by 4 percent over the same period last year, driven by stronger urea and ammonia sales volumes. The increase was due to strong demand in our core markets and higher on-stream time at our production facilities, creating additional product availability compared to the same period last year. Sales volumes were partly impacted by a narrow window for ammonia application in the U.S. and lower nitrogen solution sales volumes due to the closure and subsequent sale of our West Sacramento upgrading facility in 2015. Cost of product sold per tonne was 40 percent lower than the same period last year. Operational improvements and higher on-stream time compared to the same period last year decreased fixed costs per tonne, while lower natural gas costs reduced variable costs. The weaker Canadian dollar also reduced operating costs at our Canadian plants. Nitrogen margins were $204 per tonne, a $76 per tonne increase over the same period last year, despite a 12 percent reduction in average selling prices. As of January 1, 2015, we have designated all of our natural gas derivatives as accounting hedges1, with realized gains and losses now recorded to cost of product sold (which also includes transportation and administration costs). In the prior year, unrealized and realized gains and losses on derivatives not designated as hedges were included in other expenses. Potash Potash gross profit this quarter was $113-million higher than the same period last year. The significant increase was due to higher production volumes and lower costs this quarter after the completion of the Vanscoy expansion project as compared to the significant outage in the fourth quarter of 2014 in order to tie-in the expansion, which resulted in a negative gross profit of $50-million. Sales volumes were 637,000 tonnes higher compared to the same period in the prior year. Production volumes this quarter were 691,000 tonnes and the Canpotex proving run was completed successfully before the end of 2015. We expect Agrium's new Canpotex allotment will be 10.3 percent of Canpotex's total annual international shipments. Realized selling prices were lower than the same period last year due to slow spot market demand in both domestic and international markets. Cost of product sold was reduced as a result of cost efficiencies associated with the ramp-up of the Vanscoy expansion compared to the outage last year for the final tie-in of the expansion project. The significant weakening of the Canadian dollar also reduced production costs reported in U.S. dollars. As a result, cash cost of product manufactured continues to improve and was $64 per tonne this quarter compared to $89 per tonne in the third quarter of 2015. Phosphate Sales volumes were slightly higher than last year, while reduced selling prices were largely offset by lower cost of production. As a result, phosphate margin per tonne was only 6 percent lower than the same quarter last year. Phosphate gross profit was unchanged from the prior year. Wholesale Other Gross profit for Wholesale's other product category increased this quarter primarily due to higher ammonium sulfate sales volumes and higher ESN margins resulting from lower cost of product sold. This was partly offset by lower ESN realized selling prices. Expenses Expenses in the current quarter were $13-million lower than the same period last year as a result of lower selling and general administrative expenses and a $17-million gain on sale of the West Sacramento upgrading facility. Partially offsetting this is a $19-million goodwill impairment in our European purchase for resale business resulting from ongoing portfolio review in 2015. Other EBITDA for our Other non-operating business unit for the fourth quarter of 2015 had a net expense of $92-million, compared to a net expense of $78-million for the fourth quarter of 2014. The variance was due to the following: $7-million higher gross profit elimination expense as a result of higher inter-segment inventory held at the end of the fourth quarter of 2015 Increase of $12-million in other expenses of our Other business unit primarily due to costs incurred in implementing our Operational Excellence initiatives including severance and closure costs $10-million lower share-based payments expenses due primarily to a slight decrease in our share price in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to a share price increase in the same period last year NORMAL COURSE ISSUER BID In January 2015, the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) accepted Agrium's notice of intention to make a normal course issuer bid (NCIB) whereby Agrium may purchase up to 7,185,866 common shares on the TSX and New York Stock Exchange from January 26, 2015 to January 25, 2016. In 2015, we purchased for cancellation 5,574,331 shares at an average share price of $100.25 for total consideration of $559-million. No shares were repurchased in 2016 to the date of expiry.

OTHER Barrick Gold Corporation (TSX: ABX) Our vision is the generation of wealth through responsible mining wealth for our owners, our people, and the countries and communities with which we partner. We aim to be the leading mining company focused on gold, growing our cash flow per share by developing and operating high quality assets through disciplined allocation of human and financial capital and operational excellence. Those who founded and first led the company were committed to a culture of partnership and the values underpinning such a culture: trust, transparency, shared responsibility and accountability, and a sense of emotional and financial ownership. The company is returning to its roots as a lean and nimble organization, with minimal bureaucracy. A small head office manages the company with a balance of entrepreneurialism and prudence, focusing on only a few core activities: defining and implementing strategy, allocating human and financial capital, and fulfilling the obligations required of a public company. Leaders at the operational level have greater autonomy, responsibility, and accountability, functioning as business owners. Free from bureaucracy and middle management, they are focused on maximizing free cash flow, and the head office is focused on allocating that cash flow to maximize shareholder returns. Barrick has mining operations in Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile, Dominican Republic, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Saudi Arabia, United States and Zambia. More than 75 percent of the company's gold production comes from the Americas region. Barrick Reports Third Quarter 2015 Results | Growing Free Cash Flow TORONTO, October 28, 2015 The company reported adjusted net earnings of $131 million ($0.11 per share)1and a net loss of $264 million ($0.23 per share) in the third quarter. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $942 million1; EBITDA was $490 million1. Free cash flow was $866 million1, or $256 million excluding proceeds from the Pueblo Viejo streaming transaction. Gold production in the third quarter was 1.66 million ounces at all-in sustaining costs (AISC) of $771 per ounce1 Full-year gold production is expected to be 6.1-6.3 million ounces. Full-year all-in sustaining cost guidance reduced to $830-$870 per ounce from previous range of $840-$880 per ounce. On track to achieve $2 billion in cash flow improvements by end of 2016. Total debt reduced by 15 percent year-to-date, on track to achieve $3 billion debt reduction target. Progressing drilling and feasibility study work to convert resources to reserves over the next five years at Cortez, Goldstrike, Lagunas Norte, Pueblo Viejo, Turquoise Ridge and other sites. Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:ABX)(TSX:ABX) (Barrick or the \"company\") today reported adjusted net earnings of $131 million ($0.11 per share) for the third quarter and a net loss of $264 million ($0.23 per share). Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was$942 million and EBITDA was $490 million. Free cash flow was $866 million, or $256 million excluding the impact of $610 millionin proceeds from the Pueblo Viejo streaming transaction2. Production in the third quarter was in line with expectations at 1.66 million ounces of gold. All-in sustaining costs were $771 per ounce and cash costs were $570 per ounce1. Full-year 2015 gold production is expected to be 6.1-6.3 million ounces at lower all-in sustaining costs of $830-$870 per ounce. Our objective is to grow free cash flow per share from a portfolio of high-quality gold assets through disciplined capital allocation and operational excellence. In support of this objective, we have returned to a leaner, decentralized operating model designed to maximize free cash flow and improve execution. Clear capital allocation criteria, including a 15 percent hurdle rate for all investments, are driving greater financial rigor and stronger returns. The divestment of non-core assets has refocused our portfolio and we have formed vital new strategic partnerships that will drive new opportunities in the future. All of this is driving stronger performance across the business, reflected by two consecutive quarters of positive free cash flow and improved costs. At the same time, we are strengthening our balance sheet and remain on track to reduce debt by $3 billion. This momentum will support our overriding objective of growing free cash flow per share, underpinned by a strong pipeline of organic projects and mine site expansion opportunities in our core regions. STRENGTHENING THE BALANCE SHEET Earlier this year, we set a $3 billion debt reduction target for 2015. We said we would achieve this through the disciplined sale of non-core assets, the formation of new joint ventures and partnerships, and by maximizing free cash flow from our operations. Thus far, we have completed or announced asset sales, joint ventures and partnerships valued at $2.46 billion. We have also generated$282 million in positive free cash flow in the last two quarters despite a lower gold price, reflecting the impact of our efforts to maximize free cash flow across the company. Both asset sales and cash flow improvements have been credit positive, and have resulted in improvements to our debt-to-EBITDA ratio. Achieving our $3 billion debt reduction target will also reduce annual pre-tax interest payments by approximately $140 million. So far this year, total debt has been reduced by 15 percent, from $13.1 billion to $11.2 billion3, significantly reducing our near-term debt repayment obligations. We currently have less than $250 million in debt due before 2018 and approximately $5 billion of our $11.2 billion in outstanding debt matures after 2032. Building on $1.9 billion in repayments already completed this year, we intend to use approximately $1 billion in proceeds from the sale of 50 percent of Zaldivar to reduce debt. The sale is expected to close in the fourth quarter. This would bring total debt repayments to approximately $2.9 billion. We intend to use free cash flow to reach our target of $3 billion. Assuming the completion of $3 billion in repayments, total debt will have been reduced by 23 percent, from $13.1 billion to $10.1 billion. We also expect to announce the outcome of a process for the sale of certain non-core U.S. assets in the fourth quarter. As we move into 2016 and beyond, we will continue to take prudent steps to strengthen our balance sheet, balancing debt repayments with investments in profitable production that will drive growth in free cash flow and EBITDA. Our liquidity position continues to improve, with strong cash flow generation, very modest near-term debt repayment obligations, a$4 billion undrawn credit facility and $3.34 billion in cash on hand at the end of the third quarter. FINANCIAL DISCUSSION Free cash flow increased to $866 million, or $256 million excluding the impact of $610 million in proceeds from the Pueblo Viejo streaming transaction. This compares to $26 million in free cash flow in the second quarter of 2015. Two consecutive quarters of positive free cash flow after a prolonged period of negative free cash flow reflects our driving focus on maximizing free cash flow through greater capital discipline, operational efficiencies and strong cost management. Third quarter 2015 adjusted net earnings were $131 million ($0.11 per share) compared to $222 million ($0.19 per share) in the prior year period. The net loss for the quarter was $264 million ($0.23 per share) compared to net earnings of $125 million ($0.11per share) in the prior year quarter. Lower adjusted net earnings reflect lower realized gold and copper prices and higher depreciation compared to the prior year period, partially offset by increased gold and copper sales. Significant adjusting items for the quarter (net of tax and non-controlling interest effects) include: $455 million in impairment charges primarily related to the reclassification of our Zaldivar mine as held-for-sale; and $29 million in costs arising from the write-down of obsolete supplies inventory; partially offset by $52 million of gains related to the sale of our Cowal mine and 50 percent of our interest in the Porgera mine; and $45 million in unrealized foreign currency translation gains. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $942 million compared to $1.1 billion in the prior year period. On an unadjusted basis, EBITDA was $490 million for the third quarter compared to $1.0 billion in the prior year period. Operating cash flow was $1.26 billion compared to $852 million in the prior year period. Higher operating cash flow in the quarter reflects the impact of $610 million in proceeds from the Pueblo Viejo streaming transaction. OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS AND GUIDANCE Barrick's operations continued to perform in line with expectations for the year, meeting cost and production targets for the third quarter while generating stronger free cash flow. We have tightened our gold production guidance range for 2015, from 6.1-6.4 million ounces to 6.1-6.3 million ounces, reflecting lower anticipated gold production from Acacia Mining plc. All-in sustaining cost guidance for the year has been reduced to $830-$870 per ounce from the previous range of $840-$880 per ounce. Average all-in sustaining costs for our five core mines are now expected to be $700-$725 per ounce in 2015, down from$725-$775 per ounce at the start of this year. These mines are expected to account for about 75 percent of free cash flow from operations and 60-65 percent of production in 2015. Fourth quarter all-in sustaining costs are now expected to be similar to the third quarter while production is expected to be slightly higher, primarily driven by the impact of higher sustaining capital expenditures offset by higher production at Cortez, Pueblo Viejo, Lagunas Norte and Veladero. We expect significantly higher depreciation in the fourth quarter, primarily related to a drawdown in inventory stockpiles at Cortez, Lagunas Norte and Goldstrike and higher sales volumes at Pueblo Viejo. Total copper guidance for 2015 remains unchanged at 480-520 million pounds. Full-year C1 cash costs are now expected to be$1.60-$1.85 per pound5, down from $1.75-$2.00 per pound, driven by currency impacts and improved costs at Lumwana. Cortez The Cortez mine produced 321,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $501 per ounce in the third quarter. Production benefited from higher open pit tonnage and improved underground productivity through the implementation of short interval controls, an initiative identified as part of our Value Realization review for Cortez. Higher production, lower operating costs and lower sustaining capital drove improved all-in sustaining costs. Production in 2015 is now forecast to be 900,000-950,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $675-$725 per ounce. Fourth quarter production at Cortez is expected to be slightly higher than the third quarter, at higher costs. A prefeasibility study for expanded underground mining in an area known as Deep South below currently permitted levels will be completed in late 2015 and results are expected to be disclosed with the company's fourth quarter results. Our Value Realization review at Cortez also identified long-hole stoping as the preferred mining method for the deposit, as compared to the cut-and-fill method previously contemplated for the underground expansion, which could improve the economics of the project. Mineralization in this zone is primarily oxide and higher grade compared to the current underground mine, which is sulfide in nature. The limits of the Lower Zone have not yet been defined, and drilling has indicated the potential for new targets at depth. With a 382-square-mile land package, Cortez remains a highly prospective district for Barrick. Goldstrike The Goldstrike mine contributed 328,000 ounces in the third quarter in line with plan, while all-in sustaining costs of $558 per ounce were better than expected due to lower operating costs and lower sustaining capital. Our innovative thiosulfate (TCM) circuit achieved commercial production in the third quarter, coming in at a capital cost of $610 million. We expect to complete the ramp up of the TCM circuit in the first half of 2016. Goldstrike's production for 2015 is forecast to be 1.00-1.10 million ounces at improved all-in sustaining costs of $650-$700 per ounce. Fourth quarter production is expected to be similar to the third quarter, at slightly higher costs. Exploration at Goldstrike is focused on the underground mine where good potential exists at depth, and we plan to accelerate near-mine development in 2016. During the quarter, we began development of new areas below existing workings at Meikle and Rodeo in order to access deeper reserves which are expected to come into production at the end of 2016. This work will also open up new drilling platforms to better define future potential in these areas. Pueblo Viejo (60 percent) Barrick's 60 percent share of production from Pueblo Viejo for the third quarter was 172,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of$554 per ounce. Production was slightly below plan due to lower gold grades and recoveries from a higher proportion of carbonaceous ore. All-in sustaining costs were impacted by lower silver recoveries associated with a combination of scheduled autoclave maintenance in September, lime boil limitations and unscheduled maintenance on the limestone grinding circuit. Modifications to the lime boil are underway, including the addition of two lime boil tanks which will be operational in November. These additional tanks are expected to improve silver recoveries to the targeted 80 percent level from around 60 percent currently. We continue to forecast attributable production of 625,000-675,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $540-$590 per ounce in 2015. Production is expected to be higher and costs lower in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter on higher grades, improved recoveries and better autoclave availability. At the end of 2014, Pueblo Viejo had approximately six million ounces of gold and 37 million ounces of silver in the measured and indicated resource category (Barrick's 60 percent share)9. A significant portion of these resources are not currently included in reserves due to tailings storage constraints. We have completed a preliminary economic assessment on a plan to remove these constraints to tailings capacity, which if implemented could significantly extend the life of the mine. We expect to complete further engineering work and commission a prefeasibility study in the second half of 2016 to refine the technical and financial analysis for the increase in tailings storage capacity and to confirm whether the measured and indicated resources described above can be brought into reserves. Lagunas Norte The Lagunas Norte mine contributed 108,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $581 per ounce in the third quarter, in line with expectations. Production in 2015 is now anticipated to be 550,000-590,000 ounces at improved all-in sustaining costs of $550-$600 per ounce, with stronger production expected in the fourth quarter driven by improved performance at the Phase Five leach pad. Fourth quarter all-in sustaining costs are expected to be higher than the third quarter, reflecting the sale of higher cost inventory as well as increased sustaining capital for Phase Six leach pad construction. A pre-feasibility study on a plan to extend the mine life by up to 12 years by mining nearly two million ounces of sulfide ore below the existing open pit is on schedule for completion in 2015. Veladero The Veladero mine produced 143,000 ounces of gold in the third quarter at all-in sustaining costs of $914 per ounce. Production was below plan primarily due to lower grades in the Federico Phase Three pit and adverse weather events in August which impacted leach operations. All-in sustaining costs were higher than plan on lower gold ounces sold, timing of sustaining capital and lower silver credits. The addition of reagents to the leach circuit was temporarily halted in September following a valve failure on a pipe carrying processing solution, which led to a discharge to the environment through a diversion channel gate that was open at the time of the incident. Since the incident occurred, our first priority has been the safety of people and the environment. Water samples analyzed by independent third-parties, including the United Nations, have confirmed that there are no risks to the health of downstream communities as a result of this incident. Restrictions on leaching activities were lifted following implementation of additional monitoring and corrective actions. Production guidance for 2015 is unchanged at 575,000-625,000 ounces while all-in sustaining cost guidance has been narrowed to $950-$1,000 per ounce. Fourth quarter production is expected to be higher, at lower all-in sustaining costs driven by better grades, lower capital expenditures and higher silver and inventory credits. Turquoise Ridge (75 percent) The Turquoise Ridge mine contributed 55,000 ounces in the third quarter at all-in sustaining costs of $738 per ounce, in line with expectations. The mine is forecast to produce 175,000-200,000 ounces in 2015 at improved all-in sustaining costs of $750-$800per ounce. Detailed engineering and feasibility work on developing an additional shaft GoC which could bring forward more than one million ounces of production and roughly double output to an average of 500,000 ounces per year (100 percent basis) at all-in sustaining costs of about $625-$675 per ounce GoC is on track to be completed by the end of the year. Work to install additional ventilation capacity has also been initiated. Porgera (47.5 percent) The Porgera mine produced 134,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $986 per ounce, in line with plan. Attributable production in 2015 is now expected to be 400,000-450,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $1,025-$1,125 per ounce, reflecting Barrick's reduced interest following the sale of 50 percent of Barrick (Niugini) Ltd. to Zijin Mining. Recent drought conditions are not expected to have a material impact on production in 2015. We expect to increase our exploration budget at Porgera in 2016 to focus on underground targets which have been identified through a new geological model. Other Mines Barrick's other mines - consisting of Bald Mountain, 50 percent of Round Mountain, Golden Sunlight, Ruby Hill, Hemlo, Cowal, KCGM and Pierina - contributed 298,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $959 per ounce in the third quarter. A sale process is underway for Bald Mountain, Round Mountain, Ruby Hill, Golden Sunlight and the Spring Valley and Hilltop properties, with strong interest received to date. Acacia Mining (63.9 percent) Barrick's share of third quarter production was lower than expected at 104,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $1,195 per ounce due to temporary factors impacting output from Bulyanhulu and Buzwagi. We now expect attributable 2015 production from Acacia to be about 460,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of approximately $1,155 per ounce. Copper Copper production in the third quarter was 140 million pounds at C1 cash costs of $1.53 per pound. For 2015, copper production is anticipated to be 480-520 million pounds at lower C1 cash costs of $1.60-$1.85 per pound, reflecting currency impacts and improved costs at Lumwana. Lumwana contributed 77 million pounds at C1 cash costs of $1.59 per pound in the third quarter, in line with expectations. Power restrictions and potential reductions to smelter capacity in Zambia are not expected to have any material impact on Lumwana's 2015 production guidance. Production is now anticipated to be 260-280 million pounds at lower C1 cash costs of $1.80-$2.00per pound in 2015, reflecting higher grades. Production of 63 million pounds at Zaldivar at C1 cash costs of $1.47 per pound in the third quarter was in line with plan. At Jabal Sayid, first shipments of copper-in-concentrate continue to be anticipated in early 2016. Once the mine reaches full production, average production in the first full five years is expected to be 100 million pounds per year. TARGETING $2 BILLION IN CASH FLOW IMPROVEMENTS This year, we have taken significant actions to improve our business plans, resulting in positive free cash flow for two consecutive quarters. We remain focused on improving productivity and driving down costs to maximize free cash flow from our assets in any gold price environment. In support of this, we are targeting $2 billion in cash flow improvements across the company before the end of 2016, relative to our original internal plans for 2015 and 2016. These improvements are coming from productivity gains and cost reductions across operating expenses, capital spending and corporate overhead. While a majority of these actions will be incorporated into our 2016 plans, the initial outcomes are reflected in improvements to our 2015 guidance. Total capital expenditures for the year are expected to be 20 percent lower than 2014. Combined with reductions in corporate overhead and other operating cost savings, this has allowed us to reduce our 2015 all-in sustaining cost guidance by about $30 per ounce since the start of year, from our original range of $860-$895 per ounce to $830-$870 per ounce in the third quarter. We are now focused on optimizing our 2016 plans, with an emphasis on operating cost and productivity improvements. Our temporary suspension plan for Pascua-Lama has now been approved by the mining authority in Chile. This will enable us to complete the transition to care and maintenance, and should allow us to significantly reduce holding costs at the project in 2016. Implementation of the temporary suspension plan could require adjustments resulting from regulatory and legal actions and weather conditions, which could increase costs associated with the plan. CONVERTING RESOURCES TO RESERVES At the end of 2014, Barrick had 93 million ounces of proven and probable gold reserves and 94 million ounces of measured and indicated gold resources10. At 1.37 grams per tonne, our reserve grade is more than 50 percent higher than the senior peer average11. For more than 20 years, Barrick has maintained an average reserve mine life of between 10 to 20 years with a track record of replacing reserves and resources at our operations. Mine life and production rates at the majority of our mines have far surpassed initial estimates and we continue to identify excellent potential for resource conversion at many of our operations. Of our exploration budget, 65 percent is focused on opportunities at or near our existing operations. Drilling and feasibility study work to convert resources to reserves over the next five years at Cortez, Goldstrike, Lagunas Norte, Pueblo Viejo and Turquoise Ridge are progressing well. In addition, recent drilling at Hemlo and Porgera indicates strong potential for resource additions. We are also working to advance our Goldrush project in Nevada and drilling to define the limits of mineralization at the Alturas project inChile is expected to resume in the fourth quarter, following the South American winter. An illustration of the optionality that exists within our portfolio is the recent drill program at Hemlo. In the first quarter, Barrick completed the acquisition of surface and mineral rights adjacent to the Hemlo property in Ontario from subsidiaries of Newmont Mining. These claims included an area of geological potential adjacent to Barrick's existing underground workings. Barrick is currently undertaking an underground diamond drilling program in this area to evaluate its potential. To date, drilling has encountered a number of high grade intercepts with significant potential. These results highlight the ongoing potential of mineral deposits such as the Hemlo camp, even as they become mature operations. A detailed update on reserves and resources will be provided with the company's fourth quarter results in February 2016.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT ON FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION Certain information contained or incorporated by reference in this Third Quarter 2015 Report, including any information as to our strategy, projects, plans or future financial or operating performance, constitutes \"forward-looking statements\". All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements. The words \"believe\", \"expect\", \"anticipate\", \"contemplate\", \"target\", \"plan\", \"intend\", \"project\", \"continue\", \"budget\", \"estimate\", \"potential\", \"may\", \"will\", \"can\", \"could\" and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. In particular, this Third Quarter Report 2015 contains forward-looking statements with respect to cash flow forecasts, projected capital, operating and exploration expenditures, targeted cost and debt reductions, mine life and production rates, potential mineralization and metal or mineral recoveries, and information pertaining to Barrick's Value Realization project (including potential improvements to financial and operating performance and mine life at Barrick's Cortez, Lagunas Norte and Pueblo Viejo mines that may result from certain Value Realization initiatives). Forward-looking statements are necessarily based upon a number of estimates and assumptions that, while considered reasonable by the company in light of management's experience and perception of current conditions and expected developments, are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies. Known and unknown factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to: fluctuations in the spot and forward price of gold, copper or certain other commodities (such as silver, diesel fuel, natural gas and electricity); the speculative nature of mineral exploration and development; changes in mineral production performance, exploitation and exploration successes; risks associated with the fact that Value Realization initiatives are still in the early stages of evaluation and additional engineering and other analysis is required to fully assess their impact; diminishing quantities or grades of reserves; increased costs, delays, suspensions and technical challenges associated with the construction of capital projects; operating or technical difficulties in connection with mining or development activities, including disruptions in the maintenance or provision of required infrastructure and information technology systems; failure to comply with environmental and health and safety laws and regulations; timing of receipt of, or failure to comply with, necessary permits and approvals; uncertainty whether some or all of the Value Realization initiatives will meet the company's capital allocation objectives; the impact of global liquidity and credit availability on the timing of cash flows and the values of assets and liabilities based on projected future cash flows; adverse changes in our credit ratings; the impact of inflation; fluctuations in the currency markets; changes in U.S. dollar interest rates; risks arising from holding derivative instruments; changes in national and local government legislation, taxation, controls or regulations and/or changes in the administration of laws, policies and practices, expropriation or nationalization of property and political or economic developments in Canada , the United States and other jurisdictions in which the company does or may carry on business in the future; damage to the company's reputation due to the actual or perceived occurrence of any number of events, including negative publicity with respect to the company's handling of environmental matters or dealings with community groups, whether true or not; the possibility that future exploration results will not be consistent with the company's expectations; risks that exploration data may be incomplete and considerable additional work may be required to complete further evaluation, including but not limited to drilling, engineering and socio-economic studies and investment; risk of loss due to acts of war, terrorism, sabotage and civil disturbances; litigation; contests over title to properties, particularly title to undeveloped properties, or over access to water, power and other required infrastructure; business opportunities that may be presented to, or pursued by, the company; our ability to successfully integrate acquisitions or complete divestitures; employee relations; increased costs and risks related to the potential impact of climate change; availability and increased costs associated with mining inputs and labor; and the organization of our previously held African gold operations and properties under a separate listed company. In addition, there are risks and hazards associated with the business of mineral exploration, development and mining, including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, unusual or unexpected formations, pressures, cave-ins, flooding and gold bullion, copper cathode or gold or copper concentrate losses (and the risk of inadequate insurance, or inability to obtain insurance, to cover these risks). Many of these uncertainties and contingencies can affect our actual results and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, us. Readers are cautioned that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. All of the forward-looking statements made in this Third Quarter 2015 Report are qualified by these cautionary statements. Specific reference is made to the most recent Form 40-F/Annual Information Form on file with the SEC and Canadian provincial securities regulatory authorities for a discussion of some of the factors underlying forward-looking statements. The company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law. Cameco Corporation (TSE: CCJ) Cameco is one of the world's largest uranium producers accounting for about 16% of the global production from its mines in Canada, the US and Kazakhstan. Our leading position is backed by about 429 million pounds of proven and probable reserves and extensive resources. Cameco reports fourth quarter and 2015 financial results delivered on annual guidance amid weak market conditions solid uranium segment results, record annual revenue and average realized price owing to a weaker Canadian dollar record annual uranium production on the back of strong results at Cigar Lake write-down of $210 million in the fourth quarter related to our Rabbit Lake operation Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada, February 5, 2016 Cameco (TSX: CCO; NYSE: CCJ) today reported its consolidated financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2015 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). \"In 2015, the company continued to perform well, in the context of the global challenges our industry faces,\" said president and CEO, Tim Gitzel. \"But despite the challenges, we continued to concentrate on the aspects of our business that are within our control, which has led us to once again deliver on, and in some cases exceed, our annual guidance. \"We are still waiting on a market recovery that was expected to come sooner, but we've learned to put those expectations aside and prepare for whatever comes our way. Looking ahead, our strategy is to continue focusing our capital on tier-one assets, because it's those world-class, low-cost mines that will position us to quickly respond when the market calls for more production. And we believe that the question is not 'if' the market will make that call, but 'when', as we continue to see a bright long-term outlook for the nuclear industry.\" FULL YEAR Our net earnings attributable to equity holders (net earnings) in 2015 were $65 million ($0.16 per share diluted) compared to $185 million ($0.47 per share diluted) in 2014, mainly due to: greater losses on foreign exchange derivatives due to the weakening of the Canadian dollar lower tax recoveries, primarily due to the write-off of our deferred tax asset in the US Partially offset by: lower impairment charges ($215 million in 2015; $327 million in 2014) higher earnings in our uranium and fuel services segments due to higher average realized prices higher earnings in our NUKEM segment as a result of higher volumes and average realized price reduction of the provision related to our Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) litigation In addition, in 2014 there were a number of one-time items that contributed to the higher net earnings in 2014 compared to 2015, including: the sale of our interest in Bruce Power Limited Partnership (BPLP) resulting in a $127 million gain in 2014 a favourable settlement of $66 million in 2014 with respect to a dispute regarding a long-term supply contract with a utility customer Partially offset by: payment of an early agreement termination fee of $18 million as a result of the cancellation of our toll conversion agreement with Springfields Fuels Limited (SFL), and $12 million for settlement costs with respect to early redemption of our Series C debentures in 2014 the write-off of $41 million of assets under construction in 2014 as a result of changes made to the scope of a number of projects On an adjusted basis, our earnings were $344 million ($0.87 per share diluted) (non-IFRS measure, see page 8) in 2015 compared to $412 million ($1.04 per share diluted) in 2014. The 17% decrease from 2014 to 2015 resulted from: greater losses on foreign exchange derivatives due to the weakening of the Canadian dollar lower tax recoveries, primarily due to the write-off of our deferred tax asset in the US partially offset by: higher earnings in our uranium and fuel services segments mainly due to a higher average realized price higher earnings from our NUKEM segment mainly due to higher sales volumes and a higher average realized price a reduction of the provision related to our CRA litigation In addition, in 2014 there was a favourable settlement of $66 million with respect to a dispute regarding a long-term supply contract with a utility customer that contributed to the higher adjusted net earnings in 2014 compared to 2015. The impact of the settlement was partially offset by an early termination fee of $18 million incurred as a result of the cancellation of our toll conversion agreement with SFL and settlement costs of $12 million with respect to the early redemption of our Series C debentures in 2014. FOURTH QUARTER In the fourth quarter of 2015, our net loss was $10 million ($(0.03) per share diluted), a decrease of $83 million compared to net earnings of $73 million ($0.18 per share diluted) in 2014, mainly due to: greater losses on foreign exchange derivatives resulting from the weakening of the Canadian dollar lower income tax recovery due to the reduction of our deferred tax asset in the US higher impairment charges in 2015 ($210 million in 2015, $131 million in 2014) Partially offset by: higher uranium gross profits resulting mainly from a higher average realized price and higher sales volumes higher gross profits from our fuel services segment due to a higher average realized price lower exploration expenditures the reduction of our provision related to the CRA litigation In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2014 there was a favourable settlement of $37 million with respect to a dispute regarding a long-term supply contract with a utility customer that contributed to the higher net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to the same period in 2015. The impact of the settlement was partially offset by the write-off of $41 million of assets under construction as a result of changes made to the scope of a number of projects in the fourth quarter of 2014. On an adjusted basis, our earnings this quarter were $151 million ($0.38 per share diluted) compared to $205 million ($0.52 per share diluted) (non-IFRS measure, see page 8) in 2014, mainly due to: a lower income tax recovery primarily due to the reduction of our deferred tax asset in the US partially offset by: higher uranium gross profits resulting mainly from a higher average realized price and higher sales volumes higher gross profits from our fuel services segment mainly due to a higher average realized price lower exploration expenditures the reduction of our provision related to the CRA litigation In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2014 there was a favourable settlement of $37 million with respect to a dispute regarding a long-term supply contract with a utility customer that contributed to the higher adjusted net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to the same period in 2015. Impairment charge on producing assets During the fourth quarter of 2015, we recognized a $210 million impairment charge related to our Rabbit Lake operation. The impairment was due to increased uncertainty around future production sources for the Rabbit Lake mill as a result of the ongoing economic conditions. The amount of the charge was determined as the excess of carrying value over the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of the mill was determined to be $69 million. See note 9 to the financial statements. 2015 market developments As has been the case in recent years, a lot happened over the course of 2015, although the general state of the market did not see much change. Making positive news for nuclear, as usual, was China. Not only did the country continue with its rapid reactor new build program and bring eight reactors online, but Chinese companies also signed agreements with Argentina, Romania and the UK for new reactors, illustrating the country's commitment to nuclear and its intent to become a major international player in the nuclear industry. Undoubtedly, the biggest headline of 2015 was the long-awaited first reactor restarts in Japan. Sendai units 1 and 2 were the first reactors in Japan to restart since 2013, and it is hoped they are the first of many to come. New builds in the UK and US continued to be bright spots for the industry, in addition to a number of reactor life extensions approved in Japan, and the US, with utilities now considering additional extensions that could see reactor lives reaching 80 years. However, these positive developments could not outweigh the more powerful influence of a continued sluggish global economy, geopolitical issues, concerns around growth in China, and flat electricity demand. These more general drivers had help from industry specific factors as well, such as slower new reactor construction, eight reactor shutdowns, the continued high level of inventories held by market participants, and France's policy to reduce nuclear in their energy mix to 50% by 2025 becoming law. In addition, supply performed relatively well, with only minor disruptions and one curtailment, unlike 2014, which saw six projects tempered or curtailed. The end result was a market seemingly indifferent to the commotion of events that occurred throughout the year. CONTRACTING Market contracting activity was modest. Spot volumes were normal, but long-term contracting was well below historical averages and current consumption levels--about half of current annual reactor consumption estimates, similar to 2014. Long- term contracting is a key factor in the timing of market recovery, and its pace will depend on the respective coverage levels, market views and risk appetite of both buyers and sellers. JAPAN The big news in Japan was the restart of Sendai units 1 and 2, which occurred in August and October. In addition, the court injunction against the two Takahama units was overturned in December, 2015, clearing the way for Takahama unit 3 to restart on January 29, 2016, with unit 4 expected to restart later in the first quarter. Ikata unit 3 has also cleared a safety inspection by the Nuclear Regulatory Authority, and four more units are in the final stages of approval. In all, three reactors are now in operation, while 23 remain under evaluation for restart. Over the long term, Japan's energy policy states that nuclear will make up 20 to 22% of the energy mix in the country. The billions of dollars in investment being made by Japan's utilities suggest a high degree of confidence in reactors coming back online and meeting this target; however, public sentiment towards nuclear in Japan remains somewhat uncertain. OTHER REGIONS China's remarkable nuclear growth program remains on track and the UK's plans for new reactor construction continue to move forward. India and South Korea are also among several key regions growing their nuclear generation fleet. In 2015, growth was tangible as 10 reactors came online--double that of 2014. These included the eight noted in China, one in Russia and one in South Korea. And seven more reactors began construction--six in China and one in the UAE, a formerly non-nuclear country with four reactors now under construction. But, to round out the picture, eight units shut down. Five of these were in Japan, plus one in Sweden, one in Germany as part of its phase-out plans, and one in the UK--the last Magnox reactor operating in the world. In addition, there were announcements for future shutdowns in the US, where nuclear struggles to remain competitive in deregulated electricity markets and in the context of low natural gas prices. One event that could have an effect on the future of nuclear in the US and other western countries is the UN Climate Conference COP-21 agreement, finalized in 2015. As a non-GHG emitter, nuclear could play a significant role in achieving climate change prevention goals. Outlook for 2016 Our strategy is to focus on our tier-one assets and profitably produce at a pace aligned with market signals, while maintaining the ability to respond to conditions as they evolve. Our outlook for 2016 reflects the expenditures necessary to help us achieve our strategy. We do not provide an outlook for the items in the table that are marked with a dash. See 2015 Financial results by segment on page 12 for details. 2016 FINANCIAL OUTLOOK We expect consolidated revenue to decrease up to 5% in 2016, based on currently committed sales volumes, due to a planned decrease in uranium and fuel services sales volumes. If we make additional sales with deliveries in 2016, we would expect our revenue outlook to increase. We expect administration costs (not including stock-based compensation) to be 5% to 10% higher compared to 2015 due to increased costs related to the northern collaboration agreements and increased project work. In 2016, we are continuing to negotiate new collaboration agreements with northern communities, which could result in additional one-time payments. Due to the uncertainty of the timing for the potential signing of agreements, the cost is not included in our outlook. If agreements are signed and there is an impact on our administrative costs, we will update our outlook. We expect exploration expenses to be about 15% to 20% higher than they were in 2015 due to increased exploration activity at Cigar Lake. On an adjusted net earnings basis, we expect a tax recovery of 25% to 30% in 2016 from our uranium, fuel services and NUKEM segments. Our consolidated tax rate is a blend of the statutory rates applicable to taxable income earned or tax losses incurred in Canada and in our foreign subsidiaries. We have a global customer base and we have established a marketing and trading structure involving foreign subsidiaries, which entered into various intercompany purchase and sale arrangements, as well as uranium purchase and sale agreements with third parties. Cameco and its subsidiaries made reasonable efforts to put arm's-length transfer pricing arrangements in place, and these arrangements expose the parties to the risks and rewards accruing to them under these contracts. The intercompany contract prices are generally comparable to those established in comparable contracts between arm's-length parties entered into at that time. This year, many of the existing intercompany purchase and sale arrangements in our portfolio expire. We have started to replace these contracts and will continue to put new intercompany arrangements in place, which, as the existing arrangements did, will reflect the market at the time they are signed. As a result, in 2017, we expect our consolidated tax rate will transition to a modest expense, and trend toward a tax expense of approximately 20% over the next five years. The actual effective tax rate will vary from year-to-year, primarily due to the actual distribution of earnings among jurisdictions and the market conditions at the time transactions occur under both our intercompany and third-party purchase and sale arrangements. ROYALTIES We pay royalties on the sale of all uranium extracted at our mines in the province of Saskatchewan. Two types of royalties are paid: Basic royalty: calculated as 5% of gross sales of uranium, less the Saskatchewan resource credit of 0.75%. Profit royalty: a 10% royalty is charged on profit up to and including $22.70/kg U3O8 ($10.30/lb) and a 15% royalty is charged on profit in excess of $22.70/kg U3O8. Profit is determined as revenue less certain operating, exploration, reclamation and capital costs. Both exploration and capital costs are deductible at the discretion of the producer. As a resource corporation in Saskatchewan, we also pay a corporate resource surcharge of 3% of the value of resource sales. During the period from 2013 to 2015, transitional rules for the new profit royalty regime were applied whereby only 50% of capital costs were deductible. The remaining 50% was accumulated and will now be deductible beginning in 2016. In addition, the capital allowance related to Cigar Lake under the previous system was grandfathered and is also now deductible beginning in 2016. Based on the expected application of transitional and grandfathered capital allowance deductions, we anticipate that only the first tier of the profit royalty (10%) will apply in 2016 and 2017. As capital pools are depleted, we expect to also be subject to the top tier of the profit royalty (15%) in 2018. CAPITAL SPENDING We classify capital spending as sustaining, capacity replacement or growth. As a mining company, sustaining capital is the money we spend to keep our facilities running in their present state, which would follow a gradually decreasing production curve, while capacity replacement capital is spent to maintain current production levels at those operations. Growth capital is money we invest to generate incremental production, and for business development. Outlook for investing activities We expect total capital expenditures for uranium and fuel services to decrease by about 11% in 2016. Major sustaining, capacity replacement and growth expenditures in 2016 include: McArthur River/Key Lake - At McArthur River, the largest projects are the expansion of freeze capacity and mine development. Other projects include site facility and equipment purchases. At Key Lake, work will be done to expand capacity in the solvent extraction and crystallization circuits of the mill. US in situ recovery (ISR) - wellfield construction represents the largest portion of our expenditures in the US. Rabbit Lake - At Eagle Point, the largest component is mine development, along with mine equipment upgrades and purchases. At the mill, we plan to optimize tailings capacity and work on various mill facility and equipment replacements. Cigar Lake - Work to expand freezing capacity makes up the largest portion of capital at the Cigar Lake site. We are also paying our share of the costs to modify and expand the McClean Lake mill. We previously expected to spend between $350 million and $400 million in 2017. We now expect to spend between $300 million and $350 million in 2017. Due to the continued market uncertainty, we have reduced growth capital to focus on our tierone properties. This information regarding currently expected capital expenditures for future periods is forward-looking information, and is based upon the assumptions and subject to the material risks discussed on pages 21 and 22. Our actual capital expenditures for future periods may be significantly different. REVENUE, CASH FLOW AND EARNINGS SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS For 2016: An increase of $5 (US) per pound in each of the Ux spot price ($34.65 (US) per pound on February 1, 2016) and the Ux long-term price indicator ($44.00 (US) per pound on January 25, 2016) would change revenue by $72 million and net earnings by $56 million. Conversely, a decrease of $5 (US) per pound would decrease revenue by $69 million and net earnings by $54 million. A one cent change in the value of the Canadian dollar versus the US dollar would change adjusted net earnings by $8 million and cash flow by $1 million, with a decrease in the value of the Canadian dollar versus the US dollar having a positive impact. URANIUM SEGMENT OUTLOOK We expect to produce 30.0 million pounds in 2016 and have commitments under long-term contracts to purchase approximately 9 million pounds. Based on the contracts we have in place, and not including sales between our segments, we expect to deliver between 30 million and 32 million pounds of U3O8 in 2016. We expect the unit cost of sales to be up to 5% higher than in 2015, primarily due to the planned purchases during the year. If we make additional discretionary purchases in 2016 at a cost different than our other sources of supply, then we expect the overall unit cost of sales to be affected. We expect revenue to be up to 5% lower than in 2015 as a result of an expected decrease in deliveries, not including sales between our segments, partially offset by a higher average realized price. In our uranium and fuel services segments, our customers choose when in the year to receive deliveries. As a result, our quarterly delivery patterns and, therefore, our sales volumes and revenue can vary significantly as shown below. We expect the quarterly distribution of uranium deliveries in 2016 to be weighted to the second half of the year. However, not all delivery notices have been received to date and the expected delivery pattern could change. Typically, we receive notices six months in advance of the requested delivery date. PRICE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: URANIUM SEGMENT The following table is not a forecast of prices we expect to receive. The prices we actually realize will be different from the prices shown in the table. It is designed to indicate how the portfolio of long-term contracts we had in place on December 31, 2015 would respond to different spot prices. In other words, we would realize these prices only if the contract portfolio remained the same as it was on December 31, 2015, and none of the assumptions we list below change. We intend to update this table each quarter in our MD&A to reflect deliveries made and changes to our contract portfolio. As a result, we expect the table to change from quarter to quarter. FUEL SERVICES OUTLOOK In 2016, we plan to produce 8 million to 9 million kgU, and we expect sales volumes, not including intersegment sales, to be up to 5% lower than in 2015. Overall revenue is expected to increase by up to 5% as lower sales volumes will be more than offset by an increase in the average realized price. We expect the average unit cost of sales (including D&A) to increase by 10% to 15%; therefore, overall gross profit will decrease as a result. NUKEM OUTLOOK For 2016, NUKEM expects to deliver between 9 million and 10 million pounds of uranium. Total revenue and unit cost of sales, not including intersegment sales, is expected to increase by 5% to 10% compared to 2015; however, the overall gross profit percentage is expected to be slightly lower than 2015 at 4% to 5%. Non-IFRS measures ADJUSTED NET EARNINGS Adjusted net earnings are a measure that does not have a standardized meaning or a consistent basis of calculation under IFRS (non-IFRS measure). We use this measure as a more meaningful way to compare our financial performance from period to period. We believe that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, certain investors use this information to evaluate our performance. Adjusted net earnings are our net earnings attributable to equity holders, adjusted to better reflect the underlying financial performance for the reporting period. The adjusted earnings measure reflects the matching of the net benefits of our hedging program with the inflows of foreign currencies in the applicable reporting period, and adjusted for impairment charges, the write-off of assets, NUKEM inventory write-down, gain on interest in BPLP (after tax), and income taxes on adjustments. Adjusted net earnings are non-standard supplemental information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information prepared according to accounting standards. Other companies may calculate this measure differently, so you may not be able to make a direct comparison to similar measures presented by other companies. To facilitate a better understanding of these measures, the table below reconciles adjusted net earnings with our net earnings for the years ended 2015 and 2014, and three months ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. TRANSFER PRICING DISPUTES We have been reporting on our transfer pricing disputes with CRA since 2008, when it originated, and with the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) since the first quarter of 2015. Below, we discuss the general nature of transfer pricing disputes and, more specifically, the ongoing disputes we have. Transfer pricing is a complex area of tax law, and it is difficult to predict the outcome of cases like ours. However, tax authorities generally test two things: the governance (structure) of the corporate entities involved in the transactions the price at which goods and services are sold by one member of a corporate group to another We have a global customer base and we established a marketing and trading structure involving foreign subsidiaries, including Cameco Europe Limited (CEL), which entered into various intercompany arrangements, including purchase and sale agreements, as well as uranium purchase and sale agreements with third parties. Cameco and its subsidiaries made reasonable efforts to put arm's-length transfer pricing arrangements in place, and these arrangements expose the parties to the risks and rewards accruing to them under these contracts. The intercompany contract prices are generally comparable to those established in comparable contracts between arm's-length parties entered into at that time. For the years 2003 to 2010, CRA has shifted CEL's income (as recalculated by CRA) back to Canada and applied statutory tax rates, interest and instalment penalties, and, from 2007 to 2009, transfer pricing penalties. There has not yet been a decision regarding a transfer pricing penalty for 2010. The IRS also allocated a portion of CEL's income for the years 2009 through 2012 to the US, resulting in such income being taxed in multiple jurisdictions. Taxes of approximately $320 million for the 2003 - 2015 years have already been paid in a jurisdiction outside Canada and the US. Bilateral international tax treaties contain provisions that generally seek to prevent taxation of the same income in both countries. As such, in connection with these disputes, we are considering our options, including remedies under international tax treaties that would limit double taxation; however, there is a risk that we will not be successful in eliminating all potential double taxation. The expected income adjustments under our tax disputes are represented by the amounts claimed by CRA and IRS and are described below. CRA dispute Since 2008, CRA has disputed our corporate structure and the related transfer pricing methodology we used for certain intercompany uranium sale and purchase agreements. To the end of 2014, we received notices of reassessment for our 2003 through 2009 tax returns, and, in the fourth quarter of 2015, we received a notice of reassessment for our 2010 tax year. We have recorded a cumulative tax provision of $50 million (September 30, 2015 - $92 million), where an argument could be made that our transfer price may have fallen outside of an appropriate range of pricing in uranium contracts for the period from 2003 through 2015. We have reduced the provision to reflect management's revised estimate, which takes into account additional contract information. We are confident that we will be successful in our case and continue to believe the ultimate resolution of this matter will not be material to our financial position, results of operations and cash flows in the year(s) of resolution. For the years 2003 through 2010, CRA issued notices of reassessment for approximately $3.4 billion of additional income for Canadian tax purposes, which would result in a related tax expense of about $1.1 billion. CRA has also issued notices of reassessment for transfer pricing penalties for the years 2007 through 2009 in the amount of $229 million. The Canadian income tax rules include provisions that require larger companies like us to remit or otherwise secure 50% of the cash tax plus related interest and penalties at the time of reassessment. To date, under these provisions, after applying elective deductions, we have paid a net amount of $232 million cash. In addition, we have provided $332 million in letters of credit (LC) to secure 50% of the cash taxes and related interest amounts reassessed in 2015. Using the methodology we believe CRA will continue to apply, and including the $3.4 billion already reassessed, we expect to receive notices of reassessment for a total of approximately $7.0 billion of additional income taxable in Canada for the years 2003 through 2015, which would result in a related tax expense of approximately $2.1 billion. As well, CRA may continue to apply transfer pricing penalties to taxation years subsequent to 2009. As a result, we estimate that cash taxes and transfer pricing penalties for these years would be between $1.65 billion and $1.70 billion. In addition, we estimate there would be interest and instalment penalties applied that would be material to us. While in dispute, we would be responsible for remitting or otherwise providing security for 50% of the cash taxes and transfer pricing penalties (between $825 million and $850 million), plus related interest and instalment penalties assessed, which would be material to us. Under the Canadian federal and provincial tax rules, the amount required to be paid or secured each year will depend on the amount of income reassessed in that year and the availability of elective deductions and tax loss carryovers. Recently, the CRA decided to disallow the use of any loss carry-backs for any transfer pricing adjustment, starting with the 2008 tax year. This does not impact the anticipated income tax expense for a particular year, but does impact the timing of any required security or payment. As noted above, for the 2010 tax year, as an alternative to paying cash, we used letters of credit to satisfy our obligations related to the reassessed income tax and related interest amounts. We expect to be able to continue to provide security in the form of letters of credit to satisfy these requirements. The estimated amounts summarized in the table below reflect actual amounts paid or secured and estimated future amounts owing based on the actual and expected reassessments for the years 2003 through 2015, and include the expected timing adjustment for the inability to use any loss carry-backs starting in 2008. We will update this table annually to include the estimated impact of reassessments expected for completed years subsequent to 2015. In light of our view of the likely outcome of the case as described above, we expect to recover the amounts remitted, including the $564 million already paid or otherwise secured to date. We are expecting the trial for the 2003, 2005 and 2006 reassessments to commence during the week of September 26, 2016, with final arguments in April 2017. If this timing is adhered to, we expect to receive a Tax Court decision within six to 18 months after the trial is complete. IRS dispute In the fourth quarter of 2015, we received a Revenue Agents Report (RAR) from the IRS for the tax years 2010 to 2012. Similar to the 2009 RAR received in the first quarter of 2015, the IRS is challenging the transfer pricing used under certain intercompany transactions pertaining to the 2010 to 2012 tax years for certain of our US subsidiaries. The 2009 and 2010 to 2012 RARs list the adjustments proposed by the IRS and calculate the tax and any penalties owing based on the proposed adjustments. The current position of the IRS is that a portion of the non-US income reported under our corporate structure and taxed in nonUS jurisdictions should be recognized and taxed in the US on the basis that: the prices received by our US mining subsidiaries for the sale of uranium to CEL are too low the compensation earned by Cameco Inc., one of our US subsidiaries, is inadequate The proposed adjustments result in an increase in taxable income in the US of approximately $419 million (US) and a corresponding increased income tax expense of approximately $122 million (US) for the 2009 through 2012 taxation years, with interest being charged thereon. In addition, the IRS proposed cumulative penalties of approximately $8 million (US) in respect of the adjustment. We believe that the conclusions of the IRS in the RARs are incorrect and we are contesting them in an administrative appeal, during which we are not required to make any cash payments. Until this matter progresses further, we cannot provide an estimation of the likely timeline for a resolution of the dispute. We believe that the ultimate resolution of this matter will not be material to our financial position, results of operations and cash flows in the year(s) of resolution. Caution about forward-looking information relating to our CRA and IRS tax dispute This discussion of our expectations relating to our tax disputes with CRA and IRS and future tax reassessments by CRA and IRS is forwardlooking information that is based upon the assumptions and subject to the material risks discussed under the heading Caution about forwardlooking information beginning on page 21 and also on the more specific assumptions and risks listed below. Actual outcomes may vary significantly. Assumptions CRA will reassess us for the years 2011 through 2015 using a similar methodology as for the years 2003 through 2010, and the reassessments will be issued on the basis we expect we will be able to apply elective deductions and utilize letters of credit to the extent anticipated CRA will seek to impose transfer pricing penalties (in a manner consistent with penalties charged in the years 2007 through 2009) in addition to interest charges and instalment penalties we will be substantially successful in our dispute with CRA and the cumulative tax provision of $50 million to date will be adequate to satisfy any tax liability resulting from the outcome of the dispute to date IRS may propose adjustments for later years subsequent to 2012 we will be substantially successful in our dispute with IRS Material risks that could cause actual results to differ materially CRA reassesses us for years 2011 through 2015 using a different methodology than for years 2003 through 2010, or we are unable to utilize elective deductions or letters of credit to the extent anticipated, resulting in the required cash payments or security provided to CRA pending the outcome of the dispute being higher than expected the time lag for the reassessments for each year is different than we currently expect we are unsuccessful and the outcomes of our dispute with CRA and/or IRS result in significantly higher cash taxes, interest charges and penalties than the amount of our cumulative tax provision, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial position, results of operations and cash flows cash tax payable increases due to unanticipated adjustments by CRA or IRS not related to transfer pricing IRS proposes adjustments for years 2013 through 2015 using a different methodology than for 2009 through 2012 we are unable to effectively eliminate all double taxation FOURTH QUARTER Production volumes this quarter were 17% higher compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, mainly as a result of higher production from the rampup of Cigar Lake production, offset by lower production at McArthur River/Key Lake, Rabbit Lake and our US ISR operations. See Our operations starting on page 15 for more information. Uranium revenues were up 13% due to a 5% increase in sales volumes, which represents normal quarterly variance in our delivery schedule, and an 8% increase in the average realized price. Average spot and long-term prices decreased, as did our US dollar average realized price due to lower prices under fixedprice contracts, and the mix of market and fixed contracts. However, the effect of foreign exchange resulted in an 8% higher Canadian dollar average realized price than the prior year. In the fourth quarter of 2015, our realized foreign exchange rate was $1.32 compared to $1.12 in the prior year. Total cost of sales (including D&A) increased by 17% ($429 million compared to $366 million in 2014). This was the result of a 12% increase in the average unit cost of sales and a 5% increase in sales volumes. The unit cost of sales increased due to an increase in the volume of material purchased throughout the year at prices higher than our average cost of inventory and an increase in the unit production costs related to the addition of higher cost production from Cigar Lake during rampup. The net effect was a $17 million increase in gross profit for the quarter. FULL YEAR Production volumes in 2015 increased by 22% compared to 2014. Lower production at our US ISR operations was more than offset by the rampup of Cigar Lake production. See Our operations starting on page 15 for more information. Uranium revenues this year were up 5% compared to 2014 due to an increase of 10% in the Canadian dollar average realized price, partially offset by a decrease in sales volumes of 4%. The spot price for uranium averaged $36.55 (US) per pound in 2015, an increase of 10% compared to the 2014 average price of $33.21 (US) per pound; however, our US dollar average realized price was lower mainly due to lower prices under fixed price contracts. The effect of foreign exchange resulted in a higher Canadian dollar average realized price than in the prior year. The realized foreign exchange rate was $1.27 compared to $1.10 in 2014. Total cost of sales (including D&A) increased by 7% ($1.26 billion compared to $1.18 billion in 2014) due to higher unit cost of sales offset by lower sales volumes. The higher unit cost of sales was mainly the result of an increase in the volume of material purchased at prices higher than our average cost of inventory, and an increase in unit production costs related to the addition of higher costs from Cigar Lake during rampup. The net effect was a $6 million increase in gross profit for the year. The following table shows the costs of produced and purchased uranium incurred in the reporting periods (non-IFRS measures see below). These costs do not include selling costs such as royalties, transportation and commissions, nor do they reflect the impact of opening inventories on our reported cost of sales. Cash cost per pound, non-cash cost per pound and total cost per pound for produced and purchased uranium presented in the above table are non-IFRS measures. These measures do not have a standardized meaning or a consistent basis of calculation under IFRS. We use these measures in our assessment of the performance of our uranium business. We believe that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, certain investors use this information to evaluate our performance and ability to generate cash flow. These measures are non-standard supplemental information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared according to accounting standards. These measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under IFRS. Other companies may calculate these measures differently, so you may not be able to make a direct comparison to similar measures presented by other companies. To facilitate a better understanding of these measures, the following table presents a reconciliation of these measures to our unit cost of sales for the years ended 2015 and 2014 and three months ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 as reported in our financial statements. FOURTH QUARTER Total revenue decreased by 21% due to a 39% decrease in sales volumes, partially offset by a 29% increase in average realized price. The total cost of sales (including D&A) decreased by 28% ($78 million compared to $109 million in the fourth quarter of 2014) mainly due to a 39% decrease in sales volumes, partially offset by an increase of 16% in the average unit cost of sales, primarily as a result of the mix of products sold. The net effect was a $5 million increase in gross profit. FULL YEAR Total revenue increased by 4% due to a 19% increase in the realized price, partially offset by a 12% decrease in sales volumes. The total cost of products and services sold (including D&A) decreased by 4% compared to 2014 ($258 million compared to $268 million in 2014), as a 12% decrease in sales volumes was partially offset by a 9% increase in the average unit cost of sales (including D&A). When compared to 2014, the average unit cost of sales was 9% higher due to the mix of fuel services products sold. The net effect was a $23 million increase in gross profit. FOURTH QUARTER NUKEM delivered 3.7 million pounds of uranium, an increase of 0.3 million pounds compared to 2014. NUKEM revenues amounted to $192 million compared to $159 million in 2014 due to an increase in volumes delivered. Gross profit percentage was 3% in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to 2% in the fourth quarter of 2014. The net effect was a $3 million increase in gross profit. FULL YEAR During 2015, NUKEM delivered 10.7 million pounds of uranium, an increase of 2.6 million pounds compared to the previous year due to an increase in market activity. Revenues from NUKEM amounted to $554 million, 59% higher than in 2014 as a result of higher sales volumes and an increase in the average realized price, mainly due to weakening of the Canadian dollar. Gross profit percentage was 8% for 2015, compared to 6% for 2014. The net effect was a $20 million increase in gross profit. Production Outlook We remain focused on taking advantage of the long-term growth we see coming in our industry, while maintaining the ability to respond to market conditions as they evolve. Our strategy is to focus on our tier-one assets and profitably produce at a pace aligned with market signals in order to increase long-term shareholder value. We plan to: ensure continued safe, reliable, low-cost production from our tier-one assets - McArthur River/Key Lake, Cigar Lake and Inkai complete rampup of production at Cigar Lake seek to expand production at McArthur River/Key Lake in conjunction with market signals manage the rest of our sources of supply in a manner that retains the flexibility to respond to market signals and take advantage of value adding opportunities within our own portfolio and the uranium market maintain our low-cost advantage by focusing on execution and operational excellence MCARTHUR RIVER/KEY LAKE Production Production from McArthur River/Key Lake was 19.1 million pounds; our share was 13.3 million pounds. This was 3% lower than our forecast for the year due to unplanned maintenance outages to repair the calciner at Key Lake. Annual production was unchanged from 2014. Licensing and production capacity In 2015, the CNSC approved our application to increase McArthur River's licensed annual production to 25 million pounds (100% basis) to allow flexibility to match the approved Key Lake mill capacity. The licence conditions handbooks for these operations now allow both operations to produce up to 25 million pounds (100% basis) per year. Key Lake extension and McArthur River production expansion In support of our strategy to maintain the flexibility to respond to market conditions as they evolve, we continue to advance projects that are necessary to sustain and increase production when the market signals that additional production is needed. The Key Lake mill began operating in 1983 and we continue to upgrade circuits with new technology to simplify operations and improve environmental performance. The extension project involved increasing our tailings capacity and the mill's nominal annual production rate to closely follow production from the McArthur River mine. As part of the mill upgrades, we continue to construct and commission a new calciner circuit, and expect to begin operating with the new calciner in 2016. The existing calciner circuit will remain in place until operational reliability of the new calciner is achieved. The calciner replacement project was planned in a way that temporarily allows us to use either calciner, which will help to mitigate risks to our production rate during the commissioning phase. In order to increase production at Key Lake, we also need to optimize and expand the solvent extraction and crystallization circuits in the mill (projects planned for 2017). At McArthur River, we must continue to successfully transition into new mine areas through mine development and investment in support infrastructure. We plan to: improve our dewatering system and expand our water treatment capacity as required to mitigate capacity losses, should mine development increase background water volumes expand the concrete distribution systems and batch plant capacity New mining areas New mining zones and increased mine production requires increased freeze capacity and ventilation. In 2015, we continued to upgrade our electrical infrastructure on surface as part of our plan to address these future needs. We advanced groundworks to prepare for the next freeze plant, which is scheduled to begin freezing the south end of the orebody (zone 4) in 2017. We also made changes in shaft 2 to increase air flow, resulting in a 15% to 20% improvement in ventilation capacity. The improved ventilation eliminates the need for a new ventilation shaft to support a higher production rate. Tailings capacity We expect to have sufficient tailings capacity to mill all the known McArthur River mineral reserves and resources, should they be converted to reserves, with additional capacity to toll mill ore from other regional deposits. PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE AT MCARTHUR RIVER/KEY LAKE Production We plan to produce 20.0 million pounds in 2016; our share is 14.0 million pounds. Expansion progress As previously disclosed in our 2012 Technical Report, we plan to reach an annual capacity of 22 million pounds by 2018. The capital required to do so is shown in our 2016 capital spending plan, and in our outlook for investing activities in 2017 and 2018, beginning on page 6. As we increase to 22 million pounds per year, we will optimize the capacity of both the Key Lake mill and McArthur River mine with a view to further increasing production to 25 million pounds per year (100% basis), as market conditions improve. Using this approach, we do not expect significant additional growth capital will be required to increase from annual production of 22 million pounds to an annual rate of 25 million pounds. We expect that this paced approach will allow us to extract maximum value from the operation as the market transitions. Exploration In 2015, underground drilling further delineated the zone A mineral resources. Underground definition drilling of zone B will be conducted in 2016 and 2017 to provide the information required for engineering work to develop more detailed mining plans. CIGAR LAKE Production Total packaged production from Cigar Lake was 11.3 million pounds U3O8; our share was 5.7 million pounds. The operation exceeded our forecast of 10 million pounds (100% basis) as a result of higher productivity and our intention to adjust annual production as necessary, based on our operating experience during rampup. During the year, we: completed commissioning of the equipment required to operate three JBS units at a production scale brought on additional slurry haul trucks to ensure a sufficient quantity of ore slurry can be transported to the McClean Lake mill completed final commissioning of underground processing circuits and updated our production rampup plan based on commissioning experience modified mine and project plans to reflect our decision to exclusively freeze from surface declared commercial production Commercial production Commercial production signals a transition in the accounting treatment for costs incurred at the mine. Cigar Lake met all of the criteria for commercial production, including cycle time and process specifications, in the second quarter of 2015. Therefore, effective May 1, 2015, we began charging all production costs, including depreciation, to inventory and subsequently recognizing them in cost of sales as the product is sold. Underground development As a result of our decision to exclusively use surface freezing going forward, and the resulting change in the mine plan, the bulk of the development and freeze drilling required for mining in 2016 is already complete. We are continuing to plan for future expansion of surface freezing infrastructure in late 2016. McClean Lake mill update Additional estimated expenditures of $50 million (100% basis, our share $25 million) are expected to be required at the McClean Lake mill in 2016, primarily to complete upgrades in the tailings neutralization area in support of the continued rampup to full production of 18 million pounds per year. PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE AT CIGAR LAKE Production In 2016, we expect to produce 16.0 million packaged pounds at Cigar Lake; our share is 8.0 million pounds. In 2016, we also expect to: extend the current surface freeze pad and advance planning for freeze plant infrastructure expansion to support future production advance underground development according to the new mine plan and backfill drifts no longer required for underground freezing operations continue ramping up towards the planned full annual production rate of 18 million pounds (100% basis) in 2017 Exploration We are planning to conduct delineation drilling from surface to confirm and upgrade resources contained in the western portion of the deposit. Approximately 65,000 metres of diamond drilling is planned over a three-year period, starting in 2016, in order to complete a detailed geological and geotechnical interpretation, a resource estimate, and a technical study for the western portion of the deposit. Rampup schedule In 2017, we expect to reach full annual production of 18 million pounds (100% basis, 9 million pounds our share). The McClean Lake mill's operating licence currently has an annual production limit of 13 million pounds. AREVA has submitted an application to the CNSC to increase the mill's licensed annual production limit; our 2016 and 2017 production outlook for Cigar Lake is therefore subject to AREVA securing the regulatory approvals necessary to increase mill production. Labour relations The current collective agreement between AREVA and unionized employees at the McClean Lake operation expires in May 2016. There is risk to our 2016 and 2017 production outlook for Cigar Lake if AREVA is unable to reach an agreement and there is a labour dispute. INKAI Production Total production from Inkai was 5.8 million pounds; our share was 3.4 million pounds. Production was 17% higher than our production in 2014. During 2015, the subsoil use law in Kazakhstan was amended to allow producers to produce within 20% (above or below) their licensed capacity in a year. As a result, Inkai produced 5.8 million pounds in 2015, 11% higher than its licensed capacity. The increase in production was the result of a higher head grade and an increase in wellfield development efficiency compared to 2014. Project funding As of December 31, 2015, Inkai had fully repaid the outstanding loan under our agreement to fund its project development costs related to blocks 1 and 2. In 2015, Inkai paid the remaining $0.8 million (US) in interest on the loan and repaid $55 million (US) of principal. We are currently advancing funds for Inkai's work on block 3 and, as of December 31, 2015, the principal amounted to $148 million (US). Under the loan agreement, Inkai is to repay Cameco from the net sales proceeds from the sale of production from block 3. Production expansion In 2012, we entered into a binding memorandum of agreement (2012 MOA) with our joint venture partner, Kazatomprom, setting out a framework to: increase Inkai's annual production from blocks 1 and 2 to 10.4 million pounds (our share 5.2 million pounds) and sustain it at that level extend the term of Inkai's resource use contract through 2045 Kazatomprom is pursuing a strategic objective to develop uranium processing capacity in Kazakhstan to complement its leading uranium mining operations. Their primary focus is now on uranium refining, which is an intermediate step in the uranium conversion process. A Nuclear Co-operation Agreement between Canada and Kazakhstan is in place, providing the international framework necessary for applying to the two governments for the required licences and permits. We expect to pursue further expansion of production at Inkai at a pace measured to market opportunities. Discussions continue with Kazatomprom. Block 3 exploration In 2015, Inkai completed construction of the test leach facility and began pilot production from test wellfields, as well as advancing work on a preliminary appraisal of the mineral potential of block 3 according to Kazakhstan standards. Block 3 licence extension The block 3 test leach facility is now operational and state commissioning of the test wellfields was accomplished during 2015. Our application for an extension of the block 3 evaluation period is still pending final approval from the Ministry of Energy of the Republic of Kazakhstan. Inkai continues working on the final appraisal of the mineral potential of block 3 according to Kazakhstan standards. Although a number of extensions of the licence term have been granted by Kazakh regulatory authorities in the past, there is no assurance that a further extension will be granted. Without such extension, there is a risk we could lose our rights to block 3, and a risk we will not be compensated for the funds we advanced to Inkai to fund block 3 activities. PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE AT INKAI Production We expect total production from blocks 1 and 2 to be 5.2 million pounds in 2016; our share is 3.0 million pounds. We expect to maintain production at this level until the potential growth plans are finalized with Kazatomprom. Block 3 exploration In 2016, Inkai expects to continue with pilot production from the test leach facility and to continue working on a final appraisal of the mineral potential according to Kazakhstan standards. RABBIT LAKE Production Production this year was unchanged from our 2014 production as a result of planned timing of production stopes, coupled with slightly improved ore grades. Development and production continued at the Eagle Point mine. At the mill, we continued to improve the efficiency of the mill operation schedule. Temporary mining restrictions On December 17, 2015, we announced that underground mining activities at Eagle Point were being restricted due to a rock fall in an inactive area of the mine. As a precautionary measure, non-essential personnel were removed from the mine while the condition of the affected area was evaluated. Mine production was suspended, although milling of previously mined and transported ore continued through to year end. The assessment determined that repairs were necessary to support the ground in the affected area of the mine. The repairs were completed, along with some further assessment of stability in other areas of the mine. The mine was reopened and normal operations resumed on February 3, 2016. PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE AT RABBIT LAKE Production We expect to produce 3.6 million pounds in 2016. The decrease compared to 2015 is the result of the restriction of mining activities at the end of 2015, which extended into 2016. Tailings capacity Under our current licence, we expect to have sufficient tailings capacity to support milling of Eagle Point ore until about late 2017, based upon expected ore tonnage, milling rates and tailings properties. Our plan for fully utilizing the available tailings capacity of the Rabbit Lake In-Pit Tailings Management facility requires regulatory approval in 2016 for which we have submitted the required applications. With these regulatory approvals and after we complete the necessary work on the existing pit, we expect to then have sufficient tailings capacity to support milling of Eagle Point ore until at least 2021 based upon expected ore tonnage, milling rates, and tailings properties. Exploration We plan to continue our underground drilling reserve replacement program in areas of interest north and northeast of the current mine workings in 2016. The drilling will be carried out from underground locations. Reclamation As part of our multi-year site-wide reclamation plan, we spent over $0.7 million in 2015 to reclaim facilities that are no longer in use and plan to spend over $0.5 million in 2016. FUEL SERVICES 2015 UPDATE Production Fuel services produced 9.7 million kgU, 16% lower than 2014. This was a result of our decision to decrease production in response to weak market conditions and the termination of our toll milling agreement with SFL in 2014. Port Hope conversion facility cleanup and modernization (Vision in Motion) The Vision in Motion project is currently in the feasibility stage and will continue with the CNSC licensing process in 2016, which is required to advance the project. Labour relations Approximately 100 unionized employees at Cameco Fuel Manufacturing Inc.'s operations in Port Hope and Cobourg, Ontario accepted a new collective bargaining agreement in the second quarter of 2015. The employees, represented by the United Steelworkers local 14193 agreed to a three-year contract that includes a 7% wage increase over the term of the agreement. The previous contract expired on June 1, 2015. PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE AT FUEL SERVICES Production We have decreased our production target for 2016 to between 8 million and 9 million kgU in response to the continued weak market conditions. Labour relations The current collective bargaining agreement for our unionized employees at the Port Hope conversion facility expires on June 30, 2016. We will commence the bargaining process in early 2016. Regulatory The current operating licence for the Port Hope conversion facility expires in February 2017. The CNSC relicensing process will take place in 2016. Caution about forward-looking information This document includes statements and information about our expectations for the future.

royalty and stream company by both gold revenues and number of gold assets. The Company is gold-focused but also has the largest and most diversified portfolio of royalties and streams by commodity, geography, revenue type and stage of project. The portfolio is actively managed with the aim to maintain over 80% of revenue from precious metals (gold, silver & PGM). The Company does not operate mines, develop projects or conduct exploration. Franco-Nevada's business model is focused on managing and growing its portfolio of royalties and streams. The advantages of this business model are: Market Exposure to the gold price and exploration optionality; Limited exposure to many of the risks associated with operating companies; A free cash-flow business with limited cash calls; A high-margin business that can generate cash through the entire commodity cycle; A scalable and diversified business in which a large number of assets can be managed with a small stable overhead; A forward-looking business in which management focuses on growth opportunities rather than operational or development issues; and A perpetual discovery option over large areas of geologically prospective lands with no cost other than the initial investment. Franco-Nevada's financial results in the short-term are primarily tied to the price of commodities and the amount of production from its portfolio of producing assets. From time to time, financial results are also supplemented by acquisitions of new producing assets. Over the longer-term, results are impacted by the availability of exploration and development capital applied by other companies to advance Franco-Nevada's advanced and exploration assets into production. Franco-Nevada has a long-term focus in making its investments and recognizes it is in a cyclical industry. Franco-Nevada has historically operated by maintaining a strong balance sheet so that it can make investments during commodity cycle downturns. At year-end 2014, Franco-Nevada had $677.8 million in working capital and an undrawn $500.0 million unsecured credit facility. Franco-Nevada's shares are listed on the Toronto and New York stock exchanges under the symbol FNV. An investment in Franco-Nevada's shares is expected to provide investors with yield and more upside than gold ETF without exposure to operating cost inflation. Since its IPO over seven years ago, Franco-Nevada's share price has outperformed the gold price and all relevant gold equity benchmarks. Franco-Nevada Reports Q3 2015 Results and Declares Quarterly Dividend TORONTO, November 11, 2015 - Franco-Nevada Corporation (TSX: FNV; NYSE: FNV) today reported third quarter 2015 financial results realizing 85,637 Gold Equivalent Ounces (\"GEOs\")1 from its mineral assets and $7.8 million in revenue from its oil & gas assets. Net Income and Adjusted Net Income2 were $15.2 million, or $0.10 per share, and $19.4 million, or $0.12 per share, respectively, with Adjusted EBITDA3 being $78.0 million, or $0.50 per share. Prepared in accordance with IFRS and presented in U.S. dollars (unless otherwise noted). \"Franco-Nevada's diversified portfolio continues to perform well,\" said David Harquail, CEO. \"It is significant that these results are before any contributions from our $610 million Antamina silver stream investment which closed in October. We expect to begin recording revenues from the sale of ounces from Antamina in Q4 2015. Also, in November we began funding our gold and silver stream investment in the Cobre Panama project which we expect will be ramping up production in 2018. Franco-Nevada now has net debt of approximately $330 million, an undrawn credit facility of $270 million and remains well-positioned to continue to add to its portfolio.\" Revenues and GEOs by Asset Categories For the third quarter of 2015, revenue was earned 90% from precious metals (83% gold and 7% PGM) and 79% from the Americas (19% U.S., 23% Canada and 37% Latin America). Costs and expenses were impacted by higher depletion expense and costs of sales due to the Candelaria acquisition. Oil & gas production levels were stable with the associated oil & gas revenue decreasing significantly year over year due to lower average oil & gas prices in 2015. Cash provided by operating activities before changes to working capital was $72.4 million. Corporate Updates Antamina: On October 9, 2015, Franco-Nevada closed the previously announced Antamina silver stream with Teck Resources Limited by providing a $610.0 million upfront payment. The payment was funded through a combination of cash on hand and a partial draw of the Company's credit facility. Antamina is expected to contribute between 900,000 to 1,100,000 silver ounces (12,300 to 15,000 GEOs) in Q4 2015. Cobre Panama: Franco-Nevada and First Quantum finalized terms of a replacement precious metals stream agreement on the Cobre Panama project. On November 3, 2015, Franco-Nevada made a $337.9 million initial upfront payment under its $1.0 billion commitment which was funded through cash on hand and proceeds from a partial draw of its credit facility. Credit Facility: Franco-Nevada has entered into an agreement to increase its credit facility to $1.0 billion while maintaining a $250.0 million accordion and extending the maturity to November 2020. Closing is expected to occur prior to the end of November. Portfolio Updates Gold - U.S.: GEOs from U.S. gold assets increased to 14,618 GEOs mainly due to higher production at Goldstrike, Bald Mountain and Gold Quarry, partially offset by lower production at Marigold and fewer ounces under the Fire Creek/Midas fixed deliveries due to a reduction of the monthly ounce obligation in 2015 compared to 2014. Klondex Mines released an updated Mineral Resource estimate for its Midas Mine and Fire Creek project and announced positive drill results from recent underground and surface drilling at its Midas Mine. Gold - Canada: GEOs from Canadian assets decreased in the quarter due to lower production at Hemlo and Sudbury. In Ontario, Lake Shore Gold and Kirkland Lake Gold both announced positive drill results at their respective projects where Franco-Nevada holds various interests. Pretium Resources announced a $540 million construction financing package for its Brucejack project where Franco-Nevada has a 1.2% NSR. At the Phoenix gold project, where Franco-Nevada holds a 2% NSR, Rubicon Minerals announced the temporary suspension of underground activities while it reviews its geological model and develops an implementation plan Gold - Latin America: Candelaria had a strong quarter delivering 19,081 GEOs to Franco-Nevada. During the quarter, Lundin Mining released an updated mine plan for Candelaria which reflected a 26% increase in precious metal production over the next four years. Under the Guadalupe stream agreement, Franco-Nevada funded $4.0 million during the quarter and the final instalment of $8.0 million subsequent to the quarter. Gold - Rest of World: Contributions from Sabodala and Mine Waste Solutions represented approximately 60% of the total GEOs received from Rest of World gold assets for Q3 2015. True Gold announced the commencement of mining at its Karma project and remains on track for gold production at the end of Q1 2016. Franco-Nevada funded $10.4 million in the quarter and $9.7 million subsequent to the quarter under the Karma stream agreement bringing the total funded to $63.4 million. Perseus Mining announced it had signed a Mining Convention with the Ivorian government on its Sissingue project and expects to make a production decision in the fourth quarter of 2015. PGM: PGM GEOs were impacted by declining palladium and platinum prices relative to gold in the quarter. Oil & gas: Revenue from oil & gas assets was $7.8 million in Q3 2015 with similar production levels as Q3 2014. The decrease in revenue is the result of lower average oil & gas prices. On November 6, 2015, Franco-Nevada acquired an additional 0.29% working interest in the Weyburn Unit for C$6.2 million. Dividend Declaration Franco-Nevada is pleased to announce that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.21 per share. The dividend will be paid on December 17, 2015 to shareholders of record on December 3, 2015.

Goldcorp Delivers Strong Free Cash Flow as Third Quarter Gold Production Increases 42% October 29, 2015 (All amounts in $US unless stated otherwise) VANCOUVER, Oct. 29, 2015 /CNW/ - GOLDCORP INC. (TSX: G, NYSE: GG) today reported record third quarter gold production1 of 922,200 ounces, an increase of 42% compared to gold production of 651,700 ounces in the third quarter of 2014. Adjusted quarterly revenues1 were $1.3 billion. Adjusted operating cash flow1,2 was $374 million, compared to $399 million for the third quarter of 2014. Free cash flow3 was $243 million, compared to negative free cash flow of $355 million for the third quarter of 2014. The reported net loss attributable to shareholders of Goldcorp for the quarter was $192 million, or $0.23 per share, compared to a net loss of $44 million, or $0.05 per share, for the third quarter of 2014. The adjusted net loss1,4 was $37 million, or $0.04 per share, compared to adjusted net earnings of $70 million, or $0.09 per share, for the third quarter of 2014. Included in the adjusted net loss is a reduction in the carrying values of inventory stockpiles of $40 million, or $0.05 per share. Third Quarter 2015 Highlights Gold sales1 of 942,600 ounces; gold production of 922,200 ounces. Free cash flow of $243 million before dividends; $168 million after dividends. Revolving credit facility fully repaid. Adjusted revenues of $1.3 billion. All-in sustaining costs1,5 of $848 per ounce. Adjusted operating cash flow of $374 million. Adjusted net loss of $37 million, or $0.04 per share. 2015 production and cost guidance re-confirmed. Announced joint venture (50/50) with Teck Resources Limited (\"Teck\") to combine El Morro and Relincho projects into a single project. \"Our third quarter results highlight the essence of Goldcorp's investment proposition: growing gold production, declining all-in sustaining costs and decreasing capital spending resulting in strong, sustained free cash flow, despite lower metals prices,\" said Chuck Jeannes, Goldcorp President and Chief Executive Officer. \"Record quarterly gold production, successful cost containment efforts and the wind-down of a capital investment program that has brought two high-quality gold mines into commercial production this year contributed to quarterly free cash flow of $243 million. The benefit of managing a strong portfolio of mines was illustrated in the quarter as good results at Penasquito, Cerro Negro and Musselwhite more than offset lower-than-expected production from Eleonore as the mine continues to ramp up. As a result, we remain on track to meet the upper end of our production guidance of between 3.3 and 3.6 million ounces at all-in sustaining costs of between $850 and $900 per ounce. Our focus over the balance of 2015 and into 2016 is on vigilant management of our costs in the current gold price environment, successful replacement of mined gold reserves and the prudent allocation of free cash flow to fortify our already-strong balance sheet and fund the next wave of Goldcorp's promising organic growth opportunities.\" Financial Review Third quarter gold sales were 942,600 ounces at an average realized gold price of $1,114per ounce on production of 922,200 ounces, compared to sales of 641,400 ounces at an average realized gold price of $1,266 per ounce on production of 651,700 ounces for the third quarter of 2014. Silver production totaled 11.3 million ounces compared to 7.8 million ounces in the prior year's third quarter. All-in sustaining costs were $848 per ounce of gold for the third quarter of 2015 compared to $1,066 per ounce in the third quarter of 2014. Excluding non-cash inventory impairments at Los Filos and Penasquito, all-in sustaining costs for the third quarter of 2015 would have been $802 per ounce. Adjusted revenues for the third quarter totaled $1.3 billion. The reported net loss attributable to shareholders of Goldcorp for the third quarter was $192 million, or $0.23 per share, compared to a net loss of $44 million, or $0.05 per share, for the third quarter of 2014. Adjusted net loss for the third quarter totaled $37 million, or $0.04 per share, compared to adjusted net earnings of $70 million, or $0.09 per share, for the third quarter of 2014. The adjusted net loss for the third quarter of 2015 primarily excludes the unrealized losses from the foreign exchange translation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities ($158 million, or $0.19 per share). The adjusted net loss includes the impact of non-cash stock-based compensation expenses which amounted to approximately $14 million, or $0.02 per share, for the quarter. Adjusted operating cash flow for the third quarter was $374 million, compared to $399 million for the third quarter of 2014. Canada At Eleonore in Quebec, third quarter safe gold production totaled 86,700 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $974 per ounce. Production increased over the prior quarter as a result of the expansion of underground mining from two to four horizons, in addition to successful mine optimization initiatives. Stoping productivity and mining flexibility continued to improve, contributing to higher underground mine tonnage quarter over quarter. Throughput during the quarter averaged 6,500 tonnes per day. While recoveries in the third quarter were impacted by the presence of iron sulphides in certain production stopes, metallurgical studies are underway that are expected to minimize the effect on future recoveries. As previously reported on September 8, 2015, initial production stopes at Eleonore are encountering folding and faulting resulting in higher dilution and therefore lower than planned mined grades and gold production. The folding is of varying intensities and is estimated to affect approximately 10% of the overall Eleonore deposit. The Eleonore team continues to work on adjusting stope designs to minimize these impacts. Work on the Eleonore crown pillar pre-feasibility study continued to advance during the third quarter. Major activities included the successful completion of summer field work, underground and surface infrastructure and stope sequencing determination of the dike location, and permitting and stakeholder engagement efforts. The pre-feasibility study is on track to be completed by the end of 2015. Safe gold production at Red Lake in Ontario in the third quarter totaled 77,600 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $1,028 per ounce. Production decreased over the prior quarter as a result of lower grades from remnant pillar mining at the Campbell Complex, the acceleration of development in the Sulphide Zones and lower-than-expected grades in the Footwall Zone. An exploration drift to access the HG Young discovery at depth continued to advance north on the 14 Level at the Campbell Complex. The drift provides a new platform for follow-up drilling down plunge of positive intercepts from the ongoing surface exploration program at HG Young. At Cochenour, exploration drilling continued to assess the core area of the deposit as well as at the tram level, where there have been changes in the orientation of the veins from prior interpretations. Detailed interpretation and analysis is ongoing to support final mine planning and infrastructure. Processing of mill feed from the initial sill-development work was consistent with expectations. Work is ongoing to define the timing of initial stope production and ramp up of Cochenour feed for processing at Red Lake. At Porcupine in Ontario, safe gold production for the third quarter was 71,000 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $882 per ounce. Production decreased over the prior quarter due to lower gold grades, driven primarily by the mining of lower-grade stopes at the Hoyle Pond underground, partially offset by higher tonnage milled as a result of improved mill operations during the quarter. The Hoyle Deep project, which will enable efficient access to lower portions of the Hoyle Pond deposit, continued to progress and remains on track to be fully operational in the first quarter of 2016. At the Hollinger open pit, the environmental control berm was completed in mid-October, enabling mining to take place 24 hours a day. At the Borden project 160 kilometres west of Porcupine, studies are underway to determine the optimization of a combined Borden-Porcupine operation. Options to access the deposit from underground are currently being evaluated in preparation for permit applications. Surface diamond drilling continued during the third quarter with seven drills on site. The current exploration activity in this new gold district remains focused on in-fill drilling with a target to convert a portion of the resources into reserves at the end of 2015. Safe gold production at Musselwhite in Ontario increased over the prior quarter to 71,000 ounces as a result of higher mill throughput and increased grades. Musselwhite's all-in sustaining cost continued to be among the lowest in the portfolio at $697 per ounce. The focus of the exploration program during the third quarter was on reserve replacement. Drilling concluded late in the third quarter on the West Limb zone and the Upper Lynx zone with positive results showing continuity of mineralization in both areas. All critical exploration development for the year is complete. Latin America At Penasquito in Mexico, safe gold production totaled 236,800 ounces for the quarter at an all-in sustaining cost of $467 per ounce. Production was driven primarily by higher gold grades in sulphide as a result of positive model reconciliation. In light of continued strong performance, production at Penasquito will exceed 2015 guidance of between 700,000 and 750,000 ounces. Construction of the Northern Well Field (\"NWF\") remained suspended throughout the third quarter of 2015 due to an illegal blockade by a local community. Penasquito continues to seek a fair resolution of this matter with the community, while taking steps to enforce its contractual rights. Penasquito is also advancing alternatives for completion of the project without crossing through the affected community lands. Contingency planning is ongoing for fresh water supply to the Penasquito mine until the NWF project is operational. The Company believes that there will be timely resolution of this matter to meet the future water needs of Penasquito. The Metallurgical Enhancement Project (\"MEP\") feasibility study continued, which included completion of pilot testing, confirming capital estimates and concentrate marketing studies. The feasibility study remains on schedule to be completed in early 2016. At the Camino Rojo project, ongoing pre-feasibility study work is focused on the evaluation of Camino Rojo as a supplemental source of sulphide feed to the existing Penasquito facility, in addition to a smaller, stand-alone oxide heap leach facility. An update of the geologic model continued during the third quarter and metallurgical testing of sulphide, transition and oxide zones is ongoing. The pre-feasibility study is on track to be completed in 2016. Safe gold production at Los Filos in Mexico for the third quarter of 2015 totaled 70,300 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $1,442 per ounce. Increased production over the prior quarter was a result of higher ore processed. The 2015 exploration program to enhance deeper phases of the El Bermejal pit and extend high grade zones for underground mining was completed. A new life-of-mine plan is progressing with a focus to maximize return on investment in the current lower price metals environment and is expected to be completed by the end of 2015. At Cerro Negro in Argentina, third quarter safe gold production totaled 135,700 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $731 per ounce, driven by the continued strong ramp-up at both the Mariana Central and Eureka mines. Total tonnes milled increased resulting in an average throughput rate of 3,697 tonnes per day for the quarter. Average milling rates for September surpassed the nameplate capacity of 4,000 tonnes per operating day. Exploration in the third quarter continued to focus on surface resource confirmation drilling. The current drilling program is progressing as planned, expanding resources at the Marianas Complex, particularly at the newly-discovered Emilia vein. The Bajo Negro expansion was completed in the third quarter and the results will be included within the year-end resource update. On September 30, 2015, a work stoppage took place at Cerro Negro by miners represented by the Asociacion Obrera Minera Argentina, Province of Santa Cruz. All work activity resumed on October 5, 2015 following the declaration of a mandatory minimum 15-day conciliation period by the Santa Cruz Provincial Secretariat of Labour. Subsequent to the expiration of the conciliation period productive negotiations continue. The Company remains committed to working cooperatively with union representatives and government authorities on a fair and equitable resolution. At the Pueblo Viejo joint venture in the Dominican Republic, Goldcorp's share of third quarter safe gold and silver production totaled 115,000 ounces and 502,700 ounces, respectively, at an all-in sustaining cost of $585 per ounce. Gold production increased over the prior quarter as a result of higher tonnes processed, grades and recoveries. Silver production increased primarily due to higher recoveries. Tonnage processed was higher in the third quarter due to the prior quarter being impacted by autoclave and counter current decantation thickener maintenance. Silver recoveries were higher due to the shut-down of the lime boil tanks during autoclave maintenance in the prior quarter. At El Morro in Chile, an agreement was reached with Teck on August 27, 2015 to combine the El Morro and Relincho projects into a 50/50 joint venture. In addition, an agreement was reached with New Gold to acquire New Gold's 30% interest in the El Morro project for$90 million in cash upon closing, and a 4% gold stream on future gold production from the El Morro property. Closing of both transactions is expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2015. The project will undertake extensive engagement with communities and other stakeholders to help guide the project's development. In combination with community consultation, a pre-feasibility study is expected to commence in mid-2016. 2015 Guidance Outlook The Company today reconfirmed 2015 production guidance, expected to be at the upper-end of between 3.3 and 3.6 million gold ounces. All-in sustaining costs are expected to be between $850 and $900 per gold ounce; $500 and $550 per ounce on a by-product basis; and $625 to $675 per ounce on a co-product basis. Depreciation, depletion and amortization (\"DD&A\") will increase to $450 per gold ounce from the previous guidance of$425 per gold ounce due primarily to production coming from our newer and higher DD&A per ounce sites and additional assets placed in service earlier than anticipated. Capital spending guidance remains unchanged at between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion for 2015. Corporate administration expense guidance, excluding share-based compensation, is expected to be approximately $170 million in 2015. Excluding the impacts of foreign exchange on current and deferred tax assets and liabilities and excluding the dilution and disposition gains on the sale of mining interests and the related taxes, the Company continues to expect an annual effective tax rate on adjusted earnings subject to income tax of 45% in 2015.

Net loss in the fourth quarter of 2015 was $255.5 million, or $1.09 per share, compared to earnings of $43.6 million, or $0.19 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2014, as a result of non-cash after-tax impairment charges of $198.8 million on Constancia and $114.5 million on Rosemont, primarily due to lower copper price expectations. In the fourth quarter of 2015, operating cash flow before change in non-cash working capital increased to $106.3 million from negative $2.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. \"With the successful ramp-up of our new mines in 2015, we delivered sector-leading growth in low-cost copper production, and are well-positioned to weather the current commodity price environment,\" said Alan Hair, president and chief executive officer. \"We have taken specific action already in 2016 to capitalize on mine optimization and sustainable cost reduction opportunities, and have strengthened our liquidity position to ensure that the business is positioned to respond to a volatile metal price environment.\" Net loss and loss per share in the fourth quarter of 2015 were $255.5 million and $1.09, respectively, compared to net profit and earnings per share of $43.6 million and $0.19, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2014. Financial and Operating Results Total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2015 was $336.6 million, $223.9 million higher than the same period in 2014. This increase was primarily due to higher copper, gold and silver sales volumes compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, which was a result of commercial production being achieved at Constancia and significant inventory drawdown. Higher sales volumes were partially offset by lower prices for all metals and the effect of higher treatment and refining charges. Operating cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2015 benefited from an increase in payable copper in concentrate sales volumes and significantly higher precious metal sales volumes compared to the same quarter last year. This resulted from the Constancia mine reaching commercial production in the second quarter of 2015 and sales volumes of most metals in the Manitoba business unit growing as the Lalor mine had its first full year of commercial production. The increase in sales volumes and associated economies of scale more than offset the sharp decline in realized sales prices of all metals compared to the same quarter last year. Net loss and loss per share in the fourth quarter of 2015 were $255.5 million and $1.09, respectively, compared to a net profit and earnings per share of $43.6 million and $0.19, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2014. The loss was due mainly to an after-tax asset and goodwill impairment charge of $313.3 million recorded in the Peru and Arizona business units. Partly offsetting this impact was a $52.1 million increase in gross profit compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 due to the growth in sales volumes discussed above, despite lower realized sales prices and higher depreciation charges. Additionally, there was a $37.0 million gain in the fourth quarter of 2015 arising from the sale of Balmat Holding Corporation.  Attributable to owners of the company. Operating cash flow per share and cash cost per pound of copper produced, net of by-product credits are non-IFRS financial performance measures with no standardized definition under IFRS. For further information and a detailed reconciliation, please see page 7 of this news release. Metal reported in concentrate is prior to deductions associated with smelter contract terms. Credit Facility Amendments Commitments have been received from lenders under Hudbay's two secured credit facilities to consolidate the lender groups and restructure the two facilities. The credit facility restructuring is intended to enhance Hudbay's liquidity position in the current commodity price environment and reflects the transition of the Constancia operation into commercial production. At December 31, 2015, Hudbay had a $400 million revolving credit facility, secured by its Manitoba assets (the \"Canada Facility\") and a $150 million standby credit facility, secured by its Peru assets (the \"Peru Facility\"), collectively referred to as the \"Facilities\". Commitments of $500 million have been received from existing lenders toward the restructured facilities, and syndication is ongoing to bring total commitments to $550 million. Subject to completion of definitive documentation and customary conditions, the Facilities will be structured as follows: Whereas the Canada Facility is currently repayable in full in March 2018 and the Peru Facility is currently repayable in quarterly installments which began in December 2015 and end in September 2018, both Facilities will now be repayable in full in March 2019. As a result, 2016 scheduled principal amortization payments of $53.4 million will be deferred. Both Facilities will be subject to the same set of financial covenants. The financial covenants will require that: Consolidated senior secured debt to EBITDA shall be no more than 3.25:1. Consolidated senior secured debt is defined to include amounts outstanding under the Facilities and any other secured financings. Consolidated EBITDA to interest expense shall be no less than 1.75:1 in 2016 and 2017, and 2.50:1 beginning with the 12 months ending March 31, 2018. Consolidated tangible net worth shall be no less than 75% of Hudbay's tangible net worth at December 31, 2015. The Peru Facility will become revolving in nature and both the Peru Facility and the Canada Facility will bear an interest rate of LIBOR + 4.5%, consistent with the interest rate on the current Canada Facility. The Canada Facility and Peru Facility will continue to be secured by Hudbay's Manitoba and Peru assets, respectively, and will not be cross-collateralized. At December 31, 2015, $50.1 million of letters of credit had been advanced under the Facilities. Including borrowings and letters of credit, a total of $347.1 million was drawn under the Facilities as at December 31, 2015. Closing of the amendments, which is not conditional on any further lender commitments, is expected in March 2016. Cost Reduction Initiatives Following the ramp-up of Hudbay's new mine production in 2015, an extensive review was launched as part of a company-wide efficiency improvement initiative. This ongoing review, combined with cost containment efforts, resulted in expected 2016 capital expenditure and operating cost reductions of more than $100 million, compared to 2016 guidance, with no effect on production guidance. Operating cost savings have been identified which are expected to reduce 2016 operating and general and administrative costs by approximately $55 million. Approximately $15 million relates to lower current prices for commodities such as diesel, propane and steel compared to budget expectations. Another $22 million relates to savings from renegotiated contracts for goods and services, and approximately $18 million relates to other operating efficiencies and lower discretionary spending, including reduced corporate spending. All of the operating cost reductions in 2016 are considered to be sustainable based on current prices for input costs. Planned sustaining capital expenditures in 2016 have been reduced by approximately $50 million, relative to initial guidance of $270 million, with no impact on production guidance. The planned reduction in spending reflects the deferral of a portion of sustaining capital expenditures from 2016 to 2017, and is comprised of $40 million in the Peru business unit and $10 million in the Manitoba business unit. Of the $40 million of reduced spending in Peru in 2016, $19 million relates to the deferral of certain tailings dam construction activities into 2017, and $14 million relates to the deferral of mobile equipment purchases for the development of the Pampacancha satellite deposit. In Manitoba, 2016 capital spending reductions relate partly to expenditures on underground equipment and development at the 777 mine. Planned 2016 Manitoba spending reductions of approximately $15 million are partially offset by approximately $5 million in equipment purchases carried over from 2015. Hudbay's sustaining capital spending in 2017 is expected to be moderately lower than revised 2016 spending of $220 million, as initial spending on the Constancia tailings dam nears completion. Sustaining capital spending in 2018 is expected to be substantially lower than 2016 and 2017 levels with the completion of the initial Constancia tailings dam raise in 2017, and lower capitalized development spending in Manitoba at the 777 and Reed mines based on the current life of mine plans. Capital expenditures related to Pampacancha and Snow Lake enhancements are not included in the sustaining capital estimates. As a result of these initiatives, Hudbay's guidance for capital and operating costs in 2016 have been revised as follows: Revised 2016 Capital Expenditure and Unit Operating Cost Guidance Capital Expenditures 1 Original (Millions) Revised (Millions)  Excludes capitalized interest. Original estimated growth capital estimate for Rosemont related to spending during the first half of 2016; revised estimated spending is for the full year 2016. Reflects combined mine and mill costs per tonne of milled ore. Manitoba operating costs are presented in CAD, and include general and administrative (\"G&A\") costs and cost of ore purchased from joint venture partner at Reed mine. Peru operations combined mine and mill unit costs are presented in USD, include G&A costs and reflect the deduction of expected deferred stripping costs. Rosemont spending of $30 million in 2016 is now expected to occur over the full year, rather than the first six months. This amount is expected to be sufficient to advance a definitive feasibility study and the permitting process, and, upon receipt of permits, complete a mine plan of operations. Peru Operations Review During the fourth quarter of 2015, mining operations continued as planned and cost optimization is underway. Equipment availabilities are within design parameters, and both loading and hauling efficiencies remain consistent with expectations. Optimization of plant performance remains the primary focus, as more is understood about varying ore types. During the fourth quarter of 2015, shipments of copper concentrate from the Constancia mine to the port in Matarani increased with improved trucking capacity, resulting in significant inventory drawdown. The approximate concentrate inventory levels in Peru, including the mine site and port inventories, decreased from 74,000 dmt at the end of the third quarter of 2015, including 65,000 dmt at the mine, to a normal working level of approximately 28,000 dmt at the end of the fourth quarter, including 11,000 dmt at the mine. All of the excess copper concentrate was sold by year-end. Expansion at the port of Matarani is nearing completion, and initial shipments from the new \"Pier F\" facility began in mid-February 2016. Completion of the new facility is expected to alleviate port congestion as other mines ramp-up production. Constancia's production in the first quarter of 2016 is expected to be affected by the planned replacement of the trunnions on both the SAG and ball mills on one of the two grinding circuits. The trunnions were damaged due to a lubrication failure during the commissioning period, and the affected line is expected to be shut down at the end of February to begin an estimated six to eight week outage to replace the trunnions, during which the second grinding circuit should continue to operate normally. In 2015, metal production at Constancia was within the guidance range, and combined operating costs per tonne were below the guidance range. Manitoba Operations Review Ore production at the Manitoba mines for the fourth quarter of 2015 increased by 31% compared to the same period in 2014 primarily as a result of increased production from the main production shaft at the Lalor mine. Production in the fourth quarter of 2014 at the 777 mine was also impacted by an unscheduled two-week shutdown of the production shaft. Copper and gold grades in the fourth quarter of 2015 were lower compared with the grades in the fourth quarter of 2014 by 23% and 12%, respectively, and zinc and silver grades were higher by 46% and 2%, respectively, due to stope sequencing. Unit operating costs for the fourth quarter of 2015 declined by 4% compared to the same period in 2014 as a result of increased production at 777 and reduced operating costs at the Reed mine. Ore processed in Flin Flon in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 13% higher, while ore processed in Snow Lake was 39% higher compared to the same period in 2014 as a result of higher production at 777 and Lalor. Grades varied as a result of normal mine sequencing. Recoveries in Flin Flon were generally consistent in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 with the exception of zinc. Zinc recoveries in 2014 were impacted by lower mine head grades. In Snow Lake, copper, gold, and silver recoveries in the fourth quarter of 2015 were higher by 35%, 10% and 11%, respectively, as a result of achieving steady operations at Lalor and optimization of the copper circuit. Unit costs for the Flin Flon and Snow Lake concentrators decreased by 15% and 22%, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 as a result of increased production. In the fourth quarter of 2015, Manitoba's combined mine/mill unit operating cost decreased by 6%, compared to the same period in 2014, due to increased production. For the fourth quarter of 2015, production of copper and gold remained consistent compared to the same period last year, while zinc and silver increased by 69% and 35%, respectively, as a result of increased production at Lalor and increased zinc and silver grades at both the 777 and Reed mines. In 2015, production of all metals increased compared to 2014 as a result of increased production at Lalor and increased copper grades at Reed. Production of all metals and unit operating costs were within guidance ranges. Impairments During the fourth quarter of 2015, Hudbay recognized an after-tax impairment of $198.8 million ($264.4 million pre-tax) on Constancia goodwill and property, plant and equipment as a result of lower expected copper prices. In addition, a pre-tax and after-tax impairment of $114.5 million was recognized on Rosemont goodwill mainly as a result of lower expected copper prices and an expected delay in the start of construction on the Rosemont project. Engineering and permitting activities at Rosemont are progressing in accordance with expectations. Hudbay remains committed to advancing Rosemont, which is expected to be one of the first new copper projects to be built once copper prices and capital market conditions improve. The impairment analyses for Constancia and Rosemont assumed copper prices of $2.25/lb in 2016 and 2017, increasing to $3.00/lb in 2019 and thereafter. Real discount rates of 8.00% and 9.75% were applied for Constancia and Rosemont, respectively. The underlying operating assumptions in the impairment models were substantially the same as those used in the September 30, 2015 impairment tests. Other Recent Developments Effective January 1, 2016, Alan Hair became President and Chief Executive Officer, replacing David Garofalo, who announced his resignation in early December 2015. Mr. Hair has twenty years of experience with Hudbay and has worked in the mining industry for more than three decades. He previously served as Hudbay's Chief Operating Officer from 2012 to 2015, a role that is now held by Cashel Meagher. Mr. Meagher was previously Vice President, South America Business Unit from 2011 to 2015, where he led the successful construction and ramp-up of the Constancia operation. Hudbay declared a semi-annual dividend of C$0.01 per share on February 24, 2016. The dividend will be paid on March 31, 2016 to shareholders of record as of March 11, 2016. Non-IFRS Financial Performance Measures Operating cash flow per share and cash cost per pound of copper produced are included in this news release because the company believes that, in the case of operating cash flow per share, it helps investors and management to evaluate changes in cash flow while taking into account changes in shares outstanding, and in the case of cash cost per pound of copper produced, it helps investors assess the performance of the company's operations. These measures do not have a meaning prescribed by IFRS and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with IFRS and are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under IFRS. Other companies may calculate these measures differently. Operating cash flow per share The following table presents Hudbay's calculation of operating cash flow per share for the three months and years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014: $000s except shares and per share amounts) Three Months Ended December 31 Year Ended December 31  Operating cash flow per share is before stream deposit and change in non-cash working capital. It is a non-IFRS financial performance measure with no standardized meaning under IFRS. Reconciliation of Cash Cost, After By-product Credits (non-IFRS) to Cost of Sales (IFRS) Cash cost per pound of copper produced (\"cash cost\") is a non-IFRS measure that management uses as a key performance indicator to assess the performance of the company's operations. Hudbay's calculation designates copper as its primary metal of production as it has been, and is expected to be, the largest component of revenues. Two changes have been made to the cash cost calculation beginning with reporting for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015. First, the basis of measurement has been changed from pounds of copper sold to pounds of copper produced. This change has been made to better align the costs of production with copper produced in the same period and reduce the variation in cash cost due to inventory sales timing. Second, royalties have been removed from the cash cost. This change increases consistency between Hudbay's cash cost calculation and industry peers. The calculation is presented in two manners: Cash cost, before by-product credits - This measure is gross of by-product revenues and is a function of the efforts and costs incurred to mine and process all ore mined. However, the measure divides this aggregate cost over only pounds of copper produced, Hudbay's primary metal of production. This measure is generally less volatile from period to period, as it is not affected by changes in the price received for by-product metals. It is, however, significantly affected by the relative mix of copper concentrate and finished zinc production, and an increase in production of zinc metal will tend to result in an increase in cash cost under this measure. Cash cost, net of by-product credits - In order to calculate the cost to produce and sell copper, the net of by-product credits measure subtracts the revenues realized from the sale of the metals other than copper. The by-product revenues from zinc, gold, silver, and molybdenum are significant and are integral to the economics of Hudbay's operations. The economics that support Hudbay's decision to produce and sell copper would be different if the company did not receive revenues from the other significant metals being extracted and processed. This measure provides management and investors with an indication of the minimum copper price consistent with positive operating cash flows and operating margins, assuming that realized by-product metal prices are consistent with those prevailing during the reporting period. It also serves as an important operating statistic that management and investors utilize to measure Hudbay's operating performance versus that of its competitors. However, it is important to understand that if by-product metal prices decline alongside copper prices, the cash cost net of by-product credits would increase, requiring a higher copper price than that reported to maintain positive cash flows and operating margins. The tables below summarize consolidated cash cost in addition to reconciliations between cash cost, after by-product credits, to the most comparable GAAP measures of cost of sales for the three months and years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Cash cost, net of by-product credits per pound of copper produced, may not calculate based on amounts presented in the tables below due to rounding.

Lundin Mining Corporation (LUN: TSX) Lundin Mining is a diversified base metals producer. Our corporate goals include development of a high performance, motivated culture, achieving a safe, productive and healthy work environment, and to conduct our business activities ethically and transparently. Lundin Mining follows an annual reporting cycle and reports its Health, Safety, Environmental and Community performance using the reporting framework of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), including the G3 Guidelines and the Mining and Metals Sector Supplement. FEB 18, 2016 Lundin Mining Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results TORONTO, ONTARIO--(Marketwired - Feb. 18, 2016) - Lundin Mining Corporation (\"Lundin Mining\" or the \"Company\") (TSX:LUN)(OMX:LUMI) today reported positive cash flows of $107.1 million generated from operations in the quarter and $713.9 million for the year, not including the Company's attributable cash flows related to Tenke Fungurume, which aggregated to an additional $32.9 million in 2015. As a result of a significant decline of metal prices, a number of asset impairments were taken which result in a net loss attributable to Lundin shareholders of $377.7 million ($0.52 per share) for the quarter and $294.1 million ($0.41 per share) for the year ended December 31, 2015. Net loss for the quarter and the year included a non-cash, after-tax impairment charge of $278.0 million ($0.39 per share) as short-term metal prices negatively impacted estimated net recoverable values of our operating assets and exploration properties. Mr. Paul Conibear, President and CEO commented, \"For 2015 we are very pleased to have generated the highest cash flow in our Company's history. With all of our operations achieving or exceeding their annual production guidance and continuing to generate robust margins, the Company has been able to further improve its strong financial position despite the current commodity price environment. As we progress through 2016 and beyond, we intend to maintain our focus on consistent high performance of our operations, which are capable of providing positive margins at current metal prices, and disciplined capital investment, contributing to preservation of a healthy balance sheet.\"  Operating earnings is a non-GAAP measure defined as sales, less operating costs (excluding depreciation) and general and administrative costs. Net debt is a non-GAAP measure defined as cash and cash equivalents, less long-term debt and finance leases, before deferred financing fees. Highlights Operational Performance For 2015, all of the Company's operations met or performed better than guidance on production, but financial results were negatively impacted by a lower metal price environment. Aggregate capital spending was well below guidance as a result of proactive spending restraint measures adopted in stages to react to declining metal markets. Candelaria (80%): The Candelaria operations produced, on a 100% basis, 181,040 tonnes of copper, approximately 1,874,000 ounces of silver, and 102,500 ounces of gold in concentrate, with copper and gold production exceeding expectations as a result of higher throughput. Copper cash costs1 of $1.25/lb for the year were lower than full year guidance of $1.35/lb. Eagle (100%): Eagle's operational results were excellent, with both nickel (27,167 tonnes) and copper (24,331 tonnes) production exceeding guidance. Nickel cash costs of $2.02/lb for the year were in-line with guidance of $2.00/lb. Neves-Corvo (100%): Neves-Corvo produced 55,831 tonnes of copper and 61,921 tonnes of zinc for the year ended December 31, 2015. Copper production exceeded the prior year by 9% due to higher average copper head grades and recoveries. Zinc production fell short of the prior year comparable period resulting from lower mill throughput and lower zinc recoveries. Significant improvements were achieved in stabilizing the existing zinc plant resulting in improved recoveries in the fourth quarter. Copper cash costs of $1.63/lb for the year were in-line with our latest full-year guidance ($1.60/lb) and were lower than the prior year of $1.85/lb. Zinkgruvan (100%): Zinc production of 83,451 tonnes at Zinkgruvan was a new record, exceeding prior year production due primarily to record tonnages of ore mined and milled. Lead production of 34,120 tonnes exceeded both expectations and 2014 production. Cash costs for zinc of $0.37/lb were lower than guidance ($0.40/lb) and in-line with the prior year ($0.37/lb). Aguablanca (100%): Aguablanca met production expectations for the year, though current year production of 7,213 tonnes of nickel and 6,221 tonnes of copper were lower than the prior year due to cessation of open pit mining in the first quarter and the suspension of underground mining operations in the third quarter of 2015. Cash costs of $2.72/lb of nickel for 2015 were slightly higher than full year guidance ($2.60/lb) due to the lower by-product credits. Tenke (24%): Tenke operations continue to perform well. Lundin's attributable share of annual production included 48,951 tonnes of copper cathode and 3,843 tonnes of cobalt in hydroxide. The Company's attributable share of sales included 50,826 tonnes of copper at an average realized price of $2.42/lb and 3,809 tonnes of cobalt at an average realized price of $8.21/lb. Tenke operating cash costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $1.21/lb of copper sold, higher than the latest guidance due to lower cobalt by-product credits. Cash distributions received by Lundin Mining in the year from Tenke were $24.6 million, slightly higher than expectations. An additional $8.3 million was received from the Freeport Cobalt operations, for total Tenke related distributions to the Company of $32.9 million for the year. Cash cost/lb of copper, zinc and nickel are non-GAAP measures defined as all cash costs directly attributable to mining operations, less royalties and by-product credits. Financial Performance Operating earnings for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $712.1 million, an increase of $407.8 million in comparison to the $304.3 million reported in 2014. The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of operating results from Candelaria ($383.4 million) and Eagle ($100.1 million) and favourable foreign exchange rates in the EUR and SEK ($74.8 million), partially offset by lower realized metal prices and price adjustments ($173.9 million) from our European operations. Sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $1,701.9 million, an increase of $750.6 million in comparison to the $951.3 million reported in 2014. The increase was mainly due to the inclusion of a full year of operating results from Candelaria ($692.9 million) and Eagle ($236.7 million), partially offset by lower realized metal prices and price adjustments from our European operations. Average London Metal Exchange (\"LME\") metal prices for copper, nickel and zinc were lower (20%, 30%, and 11%, respectively) in comparison to 2014. Operating costs (excluding depreciation) for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $962.7 million, an increase of $343.0 million in comparison to the $619.7 million reported in 2014. The increase was largely due to the inclusion of a full year of operating results from Candelaria and Eagle of $309.5 million and $136.6 million, respectively, partially offset by favourable foreign exchange rates. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $555.0 million, an increase of $346.3 million in comparison to the $208.7 million reported in 2014. The increase was attributable to the inclusion of a full year of operating results from Candelaria and Eagle of $238.2 million and $122.3 million, respectively. Cash flow from operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $713.9 million, an increase of $526.5 million in comparison to the $187.4 million reported in 2014. The increase was attributable to: a full year of operating earnings from Candelaria, net of deferred revenue recognized ($336.5 million), and Eagle ($100.1 million); and changes in non-cash working capital and long-term inventory ($226.6 million); partly offset by lower operating earnings at our European operations ($74.8 million); and higher net income taxes paid ($49.3 million). Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $281.8 million, a decrease of $405.2 million in comparison to net earnings of $123.4 million reported in 2014. Net losses were primarily a result of asset impairments connected to lower metal prices, as cost and production performance at mine operations met or exceeded expectations. Before the impact of impairments (net of tax), net loss for the current year was $3.8 million, compared with net earnings of $155.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Net loss, before asset impairments, was impacted by: net loss at Neves-Corvo and lower net income at Zinkgruvan largely due to lower metal prices ($55.4 million); and net loss at Eagle generated from a full year of operation in a poor economic environment ($32.1 million) and write-down of deferred tax assets ($22.9 million); and lower operating earnings from Aguablanca ($22.0 million), partially due to the suspension of underground mining operations in the third quarter; and full year of interest expense associated with the senior secured notes ($62.8 million); and lower income from investment in Tenke ($63.4 million); partly offset by a full year of operations at Candelaria ($106.9 million). Corporate Highlights On June 2, 2015, the Company announced that exploration drilling near the Eagle Mine had intersected a new zone of high-grade massive and semi-massive nickel-copper sulphide mineralization. On July 23, 2015, the Company announced approval of its Environmental Impact Assessment (\"EIA\") for Candelaria 2030, an initiative which includes a number of enhancements to support current and future operations, primarily the construction of the Los Diques tailings storage facility which represents an important step in extending the life of mine of the Candelaria operation. On July 29, 2015, the Company announced the completion of an updated mine plan and annual sustaining capital cost estimate for Candelaria. The new plan is expected to result in an improved production and operating cost profile over the next four year period. On January 28, 2016, the Company advised local authorities and employees of its intention to permanently close the Aguablanca mine. The closure was originally scheduled for early 2018. The decision to close the Aguablanca mine was due to the significant and sustained decrease in nickel and copper prices. Financial Position and Financing Net debt position at December 31, 2015 was $441.3 million compared to $829.2 million at December 31, 2014. The $387.9 million decrease in net debt during the year was attributable to operating cash flows of $713.9 million and distributions from Tenke and Freeport Cobalt of $32.9 million, partially offset by investments in mineral properties, plant and equipment of $277.7 million and interest paid on the senior secured notes of $77.5 million. The Company has a revolving credit facility available for borrowing up to $350 million. As at December 31, 2015, the Company had no amount drawn on the credit facility. A letter of credit in the amount of $19.4 million (SEK 162 million) is outstanding. Net debt as of February 18, 2016 was approximately $458 million. Outlook Market Conditions The Company is advancing production optimizations, cost savings and cost deferrals that are expected to protect cash flows and profits in 2016 and which are reflected in the guidance outlined below. To the extent that base metals markets improve, spending restraint plans will be re-assessed as certain expenditures and deferrals would be reconsidered in a moderately stronger metal price environment. 2016 Production and Cost Guidance With the exception of Tenke, production and costs guidance remains unchanged from that provided on January 21, 2016 (see news release entitled \"Lundin Mining Announces 2015 Production Results and Provides Operating and Capital Guidance\"). Guidance on Tenke's copper production and cash costs have been updated to reflect the most recent guidance from Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (\"Freeport\").  Cash costs remain dependent upon exchange rates (forecast at EUR/USD:1.10, USD/SEK:8.50, USD/CLP:700) and metal prices (forecast at Cu: $2.05/lb, Ni: $4.15/lb, Zn: $0.70/lb, Pb: $0.70/lb, Au: $1,100/oz, Ag: $15.00/oz). Freeport has provided 2016 sales and cash costs guidance. Tenke's 2016 production is assumed to approximate sales guidance. Tenke's 2016 cash costs assume a cobalt price of $10.00/lb. Commentary on 2016 Production Guidance by Mine Candelaria: Attributable share of Candelaria production is expected to decline modestly from 2015 production levels, which benefited from better rock fragmentation and softer ore. Gold and silver production are expected to remain as significant by-product credits. Eagle: Consistent with original plans, year over year production levels of nickel and copper are expected to gradually decline as the highest grade ore is mined early in the mine plan. Neves-Corvo: Copper production is expected to be maintained above 50,000 tonnes per annum with a significant zinc by-product credit. The zinc expansion project has not been reflected in this outlook. Lead by-products are expected to increase as Lombador zinc ore is mined. Zinkgruvan: Planned expansion activities were initiated in 2015, but are not expected to impact production until the end of 2017. Tenke: Freeport expects 2016 copper cathode sales of 224,500 tonnes, an increase of about 10% over 2015 production. Cobalt sales are expected to remain relatively unchanged at 15,900 tonnes. 2016 Capital Expenditure Guidance Capital expenditures, excluding capitalized interest, are expected to be $220 million (excluding Tenke), lower than the $275 million of capital expenditures in 2015, as part of on-going efforts to defer or reduce non-essential spending as long as base metal prices remain low. Sustaining Capital: Americas: $130 million ($179 million in 2015), consisting of approximately $120 million for Candelaria, of which approximately $35 million is for capitalized stripping activities in the open pit, $70 million for construction of the expanded tailings storage facility project, and $15 million for replacement and rebuild of equipment and infrastructure, and $10 million for Eagle which is predominantly for underground development. Europe: $82 million ($86 million in 2015). Neves-Corvo's $55 million capital spending program includes approximately $20 million for underground development, $12 million for commencement of a water treatment plant, $10 million for replacement and rebuild of equipment and the balance for miscellaneous other sustaining capital investment and small projects. Zinkgruvan is expected to spend approximately $15 million for underground development and $12 million on expanded tailings storage and miscellaneous other sustaining capital investment and small projects. New Investment: $8 million ($10 million in 2015) for a processing plant expansion at Zinkgruvan. Exploration Investment The Company's exploration expenditures (not including Tenke) are expected to be in the range of $40 million in 2016 (2015 - $52 million). The majority of the planned activity is expected to be directed towards near mine targets at Candelaria and Eagle. Tenke The Company estimates its share of sustaining capital funding for 2016 at $25 million ($67 million in 2015). All of Tenke's capital expenditures and exploration programs are expected to be self-funded by cash flow from operations. At current metal prices, the Company believes it is reasonable to expect Lundin Mining's attributable cash distributions to range between $30 to $40 million in 2016, taking into account self-funding of capital and other expenditures such as exploration. Final decisions on capital investments and the amounts and timing of any cash distributions for 2016 are ultimately made by Freeport, the mine's operator.

Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc. (TSE: POT) Who we are PotashCorp is the world's largest fertilizer company by capacity, producing the three primary crop nutrients: potash (K), nitrogen (N) and phosphate (P). We are the world's leading potash producer by capacity and our Canadian operations represent nearly one-fifth of global capacity1. To enhance our global footprint, we also have investments in four potash-related businesses in South America, the Middle East and Asia. With operations and business interests in seven countries, PotashCorp is an international enterprise and plays an important role in helping the world grow the food it needs. What we produce Our potash, phosphate and nitrogen products help provide the primary nutrients that crops need. They are also used to make livestock feeds and industrial goods. Produced from mineral deposits (potash and phosphate) and from the air we breathe (nitrogen), our main products are: potash, in standard and granular grades DAP (diammonium phosphate), MAP (monoammonium phosphate) and phosphoric acid Ammonia and urea Why fertilizer? With world population rising, arable land per person diminishing and demand increasing for higher quality diets that include more fruits and vegetables and protein from crop-fed livestock, the need to maximize the efficiency of farmland has never been greater. Every crop harvested removes nutrients from the soil, which must be replaced to keep soil healthy and productive. Responsible for more than 40 percent of the world's total crop yield, fertilizers feed plants, which help to feed animals and people. Where we serve Our products serve customers throughout the global marketplace from China, the world's most populous nation and largest fertilizer consumer, to India, with its 1.2 billion people. From Latin America an agricultural superpower to the rice and oil palm producing fields of Other Asian countries and the breadbasket markets of North America. Together these five regions account for nearly three-quarters of the world's population and roughly 80 percent of the total fertilizer consumption. Delivering when we're needed As the world's food challenges become more pressing, we're taking an active role in meeting them, investing heavily in our assets to deliver quality product when and where our customers need it. We are adding to our current potash capacity without building a new mine - an advantage as demand is expected to rise. And through our partnerships and investments, we strive to better serve customers in emerging markets. How we do business We hold ourselves to the highest business standards and consider factors beyond financial performance when evaluating our success. Guided by our Core Values, we cultivate mutually beneficial relationships with our communities, customers, employees, investors and other people critical to our success. Acting with a long-term view, we make decisions that consider people and the planet, always looking for opportunities to improve. 28 January 2016 Q4 & Year-End: PotashCorp Reports Full-Year 2015 Earnings of $1.52 per Share Key Highlights Fourth-quarter earnings of $0.24 per share1; full-year total of $1.52 per share Annual cash provided by operating activities of $2.3 billion Indefinite suspension of Picadilly, New Brunswick potash operation in January 2016 Quarterly dividend reduced by 34 percent to $0.25 per share Full-year 2016 guidance of $0.90-$1.20 per share; $0.10-$0.20 for the first quarter CEO Commentary \"Weaker fertilizer prices late in the year reduced our earnings for the quarter, giving rise to a more cautious outlook for all three nutrients as we begin 2016,\" said PotashCorp President and Chief Executive Officer Jochen Tilk. \"Against this backdrop, our focus has been not only to navigate these challenges but to further strengthen our company for the future by: supporting our longstanding potash business model, including matching supply to demand; enhancing our best-in-class assets; and protecting our long-term financial health and flexibility. \"We made the very difficult decisions to suspend potash production in New Brunswick and realign our dividend. These actions are part of our thoughtful and holistic approach to strategically position the company and balance the interests of our shareholders, debtholders, employees and communities who depend on our enduring success. Longer term, we maintain our conviction that the drivers of fertilizer demand - rising global crop production and supportive farmer economics - will support improved market conditions.\" Saskatoon, Saskatchewan - Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc. (PotashCorp) reported fourth-quarter earnings of $0.24 per share ($201 million), bringing earnings for the full year to $1.52 per share ($1.3 billion). These totals for the quarter and full year trailed the $0.49 per share ($407 million) and $1.82 per share ($1.5 billion) earned in the same periods of 2014. Gross margin for the quarter ($386 million) and the year ($2.3 billion) was below 2014 levels ($746 million and $2.6 billion, respectively), due primarily to weaker nitrogen prices and lower potash volumes. Cash from operating activities of $623 million for the quarter and $2.3 billion for the year was below 2014 results by 13 percent and 11 percent, respectively. Quarterly and annual earnings before finance costs, income taxes and depreciation and amortization (EBITDA)2 of $482 million and $2.6 billion, respectively, were also lower than in the comparable periods of 2014. Investments in Arab Potash Company (APC) in Jordan, Israel Chemicals Ltd. (ICL) in Israel and Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile S.A. (SQM) in Chile contributed $27 million to our quarterly earnings, trailing the $31 million generated in the fourth quarter of 2014. Our earnings for the year from these three investments - plus a dividend from Sinofert Holdings Limited (Sinofert) in China - totaled $162 million, below the $210 million earned in 2014, which included a special dividend from ICL. The market value of our investments in these four publicly traded companies was approximately $3.5 billion, or $4 per PotashCorp share, at market close on January 27, 2016. Market Conditions Challenging conditions, including currency weakness relative to the US dollar in emerging markets, continued to weigh on fertilizer markets through the fourth quarter. Cautious buying patterns resulted in deteriorating prices across all three nutrients as the year ended. Global potash shipments for the fourth quarter remained relatively flat compared to 2014, with increased deliveries to China offsetting slightly weaker demand in most other markets. Nitrogen markets continued to feel the effects of falling energy prices. Lower production costs in key producing regions increased competitive supply, which - combined with a weaker-than-normal fall application season in the US and slower demand in Brazil - caused prices for nearly all nitrogen products to trend lower during the quarter. In phosphate, record Chinese exports, seasonally slow demand in India and the US and continued caution in Brazil weighed on prices for solid fertilizers. Prices for feed, industrial, and liquid fertilizer products were more resilient, supported by strong demand and tighter supply. Potash Reduced sales volumes and a softening price environment - particularly in the second half of 2015 - resulted in gross margin of $183 million for the quarter and $1.3 billion for the year, below 2014's comparative totals of $445 million and $1.4 billion, respectively. Sales volumes for both the quarter (down 31 percent) and the year (down 6 percent) trailed those achieved in the same periods of 2014. The most significant decline for both the quarter and full year was in North America, which reflected a pullback in demand from 2014's especially strong levels, as well as increased competition. Offshore, the majority of Canpotex's3 shipments for the quarter were to China (40 percent) and Other Asian markets outside of China and India (30 percent), while Latin America and India accounted for 18 percent and 4 percent, respectively. Our average realized potash price for the quarter was $238 per tonne, down considerably from $284 per tonne in the same period last year, reflecting the declining price environment in 2015. Inventory-related shutdowns at our Saskatchewan mines and the closure of our Penobsquis, New Brunswick operation reduced production volumes and resulted in per-tonne cost of goods sold for the quarter of $132, which was 26 percent higher than in the comparable period in 2014. For the year, per-tonne cost of goods sold of $111 was relatively flat with the previous year as the favorable impact of a weaker Canadian dollar was offset primarily by increased shutdown weeks. Nitrogen In nitrogen, weaker prices had a negative impact on our results for the fourth quarter and the full year. Gross margin of $142 million for the quarter and $706 million for the year trailed results from the same periods in 2014 by 39 percent and 30 percent, respectively. Our US operations accounted for 61 percent of our nitrogen gross margin for the quarter, with Trinidad providing the remainder. Sales volumes of 1.6 million tonnes for the quarter were similar to those in the same period of 2014. Extended expansion-related downtime, coupled with weaker demand, resulted in sales volumes for 2015 of 5.9 million tonnes, down 7 percent from the previous year. Our average realized price of $288 per tonne during the quarter was down significantly from the $405 per tonne achieved in the same period last year as lower energy costs and increased global supply weighed heavily on prices for all nitrogen products. Cost of goods sold for the fourth quarter was $199 per tonne, down 21 percent from 2014, driven largely by lower natural gas costs in the US and Trinidad. Phosphate Gross margin for the quarter totaled $61 million, down slightly from the $67 million earned during the same period last year, due to lower sales volumes and price realizations. For the year, we generated $241 million, up from the $202 million earned in 2014, primarily due to increased prices for liquid fertilizers. For the quarter, sales volumes of 0.8 million tonnes were relatively flat compared to the same period in 2014, while volumes for the year of 2.9 million tonnes trailed 2014, due primarily to the absence of production from the Suwannee River chemical plant. Our average realized phosphate price for the fourth quarter of $522 per tonne was similar to 2014's as improved prices for liquid fertilizers offset declining prices for DAP and MAP. Per-tonne cost of goods sold was $443 for the quarter, similar to last year. Financial Provincial mining and other taxes of $46 million for the quarter were lower than the $82 million in the same period last year, due to weaker potash earnings. For the year, provincial mining and other taxes totaled $310 million, 21 percent more than in 2014 because of a weaker Canadian dollar and changes in the timing of allowable deductions within Saskatchewan's potash taxation regulations. Income tax expense for the fourth quarter ($69 million) and full year ($451 million) was down from the same periods last year due primarily to lower earnings. Potash Market Outlook We expect global potash shipments in the range of 59-62 million tonnes, in line with 2015's total of approximately 60 million tonnes. In North America, lower dealer inventories and significant nutrient requirements following consecutive years of large crops are expected to support growth of potash shipments in 2016 to a range of 9.2-9.7 million tonnes In Latin America, we expect agronomic need and favorable crop economics to keep demand at elevated levels, although credit availability and currency weakness are anticipated to keep growth in this market relatively modest. For the full year, we forecast shipments of 10.8-11.3 million tonnes, slightly above 2015 levels. In China, elevated inventories are likely to keep demand below 2015's record of more than 15.0 million tonnes. We anticipate shipments in the range of 13.5-14.5 million tonnes, with strong consumption trends for bulk blends and compound fertilizers continuing. Demand in India is expected to strengthen in 2016. We forecast deliveries of 4.2-4.7 million tonnes to this market, a slight increase from 2015 when a weak monsoon and currency issues reduced demand late in the year. In Other Asian markets, supportive crop economics and substantial agronomic need are expected to keep demand fairly robust in 2016. We anticipate deliveries in the range of 8.5-8.8 million tonnes, slightly above 2015 levels. Financial Outlook Based on these market factors, we anticipate our 2016 potash sales volumes will be in the range of 8.3-9.1 million tonnes. For the year, we forecast potash gross margin of $0.8-$1.1 billion, down significantly from 2015 as the sharp decline in potash prices through the second half of that year is expected to weigh on margins in 2016. Our guidance reflects the suspension of our Picadilly potash operations announced in mid-January, including favorable impacts on our cost of goods sold of $40-$50 million and reduced capital expenditures of $50 million. The company has concluded that the announced change will not result in any impairment charges although our guidance does reflect approximately $35 million in severance and transition costs expected to be recorded in the first quarter of 2016. In nitrogen, we expect improved operating rates at our US facilities and our recently completed Lima nitrogen expansion to increase our sales volumes in 2016. Despite higher sales volumes and reduced costs from lower natural gas prices, a weaker pricing environment - driven by an increase in competitive supply - is expected to result in considerably lower gross margin. In phosphate, we anticipate weaker market fundamentals will keep prices for most products below 2015 levels, although our historically more stable feed and industrial products are forecast to be less impacted. We expect lower input costs and our focus on improved reliability will reduce costs and increase the amount of product available for sale, which we anticipate will help keep gross margin at a level similar to 2015. Given these considerations, we forecast combined nitrogen and phosphate gross margin will be in the range of $0.7-$0.9 billion in 2016. We estimate provincial mining and other taxes in the range of 22-24 percent of potash gross margin, similar to the 2015 percentage. Based on these factors, we forecast full-year 2016 earnings of $0.90-$1.20 per share, including first-quarter earnings of $0.10-$0.20 per share. Our quarterly guidance reflects the severance and transition charges related to the suspension of production at Picadilly and an expectation of some potash demand being deferred to the second quarter. Other annual guidance numbers - including those noted above - are outlined in the table below. 2016 Guidance  Dividend Our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend of US $0.25 per share payable May 3, 2016 to shareholders of record April 12, 2016. \"We are committed to preserving a strong balance sheet and investment-grade credit rating, but also believe in retaining a competitive dividend. In consideration of these objectives, we have decided to reduce our quarterly dividend by 34 percent,\" said Tilk. \"We believe this level - representing a payout ratio of close to 100 percent of 2016 earnings - remains highly competitive and balances the interests of our many stakeholders, including equity and debtholders.\" Notes All references to per-share amounts pertain to diluted net income per share.

Average cash costs1 in Q3 2015 were $4.26 and $389 per ounce of silver and gold, respectively. On a silver equivalent basis, average cash costs1 decreased to $4.58 compared with $4.59 in Q3 2014. Declared quarterly dividend of $0.05 per common share. On September 18, 2015, the Company announced that it had received TSX approval for a normal course issuer bid (\"NCIB\") of up to 5% of the Company's outstanding Common Shares. To date, the Company has purchased 764,789 shares under the NCIB. On September 24, 2015, the Company announced that it had received Notices of Reassessment from the Canada Revenue Agency (the \"CRA\") for the 2005 to 2010 taxation years (the \"Relevant Taxation Years\"). Subsequent to the quarter, Silver Wheaton filed notices of objection for each of the Relevant Taxation Years. Asset Highlights Salobo had record attributable production of almost 33,000 ounces of gold net to Silver Wheaton in Q3, and the ongoing ramp-up continues to be on track to achieve 100% utilization in Q4 2015. Record attributable production from Penasquito. Record sale volume from San Dimas. Events Subsequent to the Quarter Silver Wheaton agreed to acquire from a subsidiary of Glencore Plc (\"Glencore\") an amount of silver equal to 33.75% of the silver production until delivery of 140 million ounces of silver and 22.5% of the silver production thereafter for the life of mine from the Antamina mine for an upfront cash consideration of US$900 million and ongoing payments of 20% of spot price per silver ounce delivered. \"Silver Wheaton hit record production for a third consecutive quarter, as the company produced 11 million silver equivalent ounces in the third quarter alone. Our cornerstone assets delivered solid results with Penasquito and Salobo setting new production records. With over 32 million ounces produced year to date, we remain well on track to deliver on our original production growth guidance of over 20% in 2015,\" said Randy Smallwood, President and Chief Executive Officer of Silver Wheaton. \"Clearly, not everything has been smooth sailing, as we have also faced persistently low commodity prices, along with the receipt of the Notices of Reassessment from the CRA. I once again want to reiterate our confidence in our structure and that we will vigorously defend our tax filing position; as such, we have filed notices of objections with the CRA in regards to the Reassessments.\" \"While our cornerstone operations have performed exceptionally well, we did take an impairment charge on 777 in the third quarter due to lack of exploration success combined with lower commodity prices. While the low commodity price environment has had its challenges, it has also created some great opportunities. This is clearly evidenced by the announcement of our acquisition of a silver stream on Antamina, one of the lowest cost, largest copper mines in the world. Antamina is an ideal asset for Silver Wheaton, one that readily fits in to our portfolio of top tier assets.\" Financial Review Revenues Revenue was $153.3 million in the third quarter of 2015, on silver equivalent sales of 10.2 million ounces (6.6 million ounces of silver and 48,100 ounces of gold). This represents an 8% decrease from the $165.9 million of revenue generated in the third quarter of 2014 due primarily to a 21% decrease in the average realized silver equivalent price ($15.03 in Q3 2015 compared with $18.98 in Q3 2014), partially offset by a 17% increase in the number of silver equivalent ounces sold. Costs and Expenses Average cash costs1 in the third quarter of 2015 were $4.58 per silver equivalent ounce as compared with $4.59 during the comparable period of 2014. This resulted in a cash operating margin1 of $10.45 per silver equivalent ounce, a reduction of 27% as compared with Q3 2014. The decrease in the cash operating margin was primarily due to a 21% decrease in the average realized silver equivalent price in Q3 2015 compared with Q3 2014. Earnings and Operating Cash Flows Adjusted net earnings1 and cash flow from operations in the third quarter of 2015 were $49.8 million ($0.12 per share) and $99.5 million ($0.25 per share1), compared with $72.6 million ($0.20 per share) and $120.4 million ($0.34 per share1) for the same period in 2014, a decrease of 31% and 17%, respectively. Earnings and cash flow continued to be impacted by lower gold and silver prices. Balance Sheet At September 30, 2015, the Company had approximately $81 million of cash on hand and $647 million outstanding under the Company's $2 billionrevolving term loan. On September 18, 2015 the Company announced it had received TSX approval to purchase up to 20,229,671 common shares (representing 5% of the Company's 404,593,425 total issued and outstanding common shares as of September 11, 2015) over a period of twelve months commencing onSeptember 23, 2015. The NCIB will expire no later than September 22, 2016. During the three months ended September 30, 2015 the Company purchased 119,400 shares under the NCIB at an average price of $12.26 per share. Subsequent to September 30, 2015, the Company purchased an additional 645,389 shares under the NCIB at an average price of $11.86 per share. Asset Impairment On August 8, 2012, the Company entered into an agreement with Hudbay Minerals Inc. (\"Hudbay\") to acquire an amount equal to 100% of the silver and gold production from its currently producing 777 mine, located in Canada, until the end of 2016, and 100% of the silver and 50% of the gold production for the remainder of the mine life. During the third quarter of 2015, the Company's management was informed that as a result of an unsuccessful drilling program at 777, Hudbay's management believes that the mine life for 777 is unlikely to be extended beyond 2020. As a result, during the third quarter of 2015, the estimate of future production from 777 was reduced, with this reduction representing an indicator of impairment related to the 777 silver and gold interests. At September 30, 2015, Silver Wheaton's management estimated that the recoverable amount under the 777 silver and gold interests was$147.5 million, representing its fair value less cost to sell and resulting in an impairment charge of $154.0 million. CRA Audit Update On July 6, 2015, the Company announced that it had received a proposal letter (the \"Proposal\") from the CRA in which the CRA was proposing to reassess Silver Wheaton under the transfer pricing provisions contained in the Income Tax Act (Canada) (the \"Act\"). Subsequent to the issuance of the Proposal, on September 24, 2015, the Company announced that it had received Notices of Reassessment (the \"Reassessments\") from the CRA for the 2005 to 2010 taxation years (the \"Relevant Taxation Years\"). The Reassessments are consistent with the Proposal and seek to increase the Company's income subject to tax in Canada for the Relevant Taxation Years by approximately Cdn$715.3 million which would result in federal and provincial tax of approximately Cdn$201.3 million. In addition, the CRA is seeking to impose transfer pricing penalties of approximately Cdn$71.5 million and interest and other penalties of Cdn$80.6 million for the Relevant Taxation Years. Total tax, interest and penalties sought by the CRA for the Relevant Taxation Years isCdn$353.4 million. The CRA's position in the Reassessments is that the transfer pricing provisions of the Act relating to income earned by the Company's foreign subsidiaries outside of Canada should apply such that the income of Silver Wheaton subject to tax in Canada should be increased by substantially all of the income of the Company's foreign subsidiaries. Management believes that the Company has filed its tax returns and paid applicable taxes in compliance with Canadian tax law, and as a result no amounts have been recorded for any potential liability arising from this matter. Silver Wheaton intends to vigorously defend its tax filing positions. As such, subsequent to September 30, 2015, Silver Wheaton has filed notices of objection for each of the Relevant Taxation Years. The Company will be required to make a deposit of Cdn$176.7 million representing 50% of the reassessed amounts of tax, interest and penalties. Silver Wheaton will seek to post security in the form of a letter of credit for this amount as opposed to a cash deposit. Cash that has been deposited in respect of a reassessment will be refunded, plus interest, if the Company is ultimately successful in challenging that reassessment. Events Subsequent to the Quarter Antamina Subsequent to the quarter, Silver Wheaton, through its wholly owned subsidiary Silver Wheaton (Caymans) Ltd. (\"SWC\"), has agreed to acquire fromAnani Investments Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Glencore plc (\"Glencore\") an amount of silver equal to 33.75% of the silver production until delivery of 140 million ounces of silver and 22.5% of silver production thereafter for the life of mine silver production from the Antamina mine, located in Peru. SWC will pay Glencore cash consideration of US$900 million for the silver stream. In addition, SWC will make ongoing payments of 20% of spot price per silver ounce delivered. The silver stream is effective September 30, 2015, and as a result, production and sales attributable to Silver Wheaton are forecast for the fourth quarter of 2015. Silver production is expected to average 4.7 million ounces per year over the first 20 years. Closing of the transaction is expected to occur prior to the end of November 2015 and is subject to the completion of certain corporate matters and customary conditions. (See Silver Wheaton's November 3, 2015 news release for full details.) Third Quarter Asset Highlights During the third quarter of 2015, attributable silver equivalent production was 11.0 million ounces (6.9 million ounces of silver and 54,500 ounces of gold), representing an increase of 24% compared with the third quarter of 2014. Operational highlights for the quarter ended September 30, 2015, are as follows: Salobo In the third quarter of 2015, Salobo produced a record 32,954 ounces of gold attributable to Silver Wheaton, an increase of approximately 216% relative to the third quarter of 2014. This increase was primarily due to the doubling of the percentage of gold that Silver Wheaton is entitled to and the increased throughput as a result of the expansion to 24 million tonnes per annum, which commenced production in mid-2014. According to Vale's third quarter of 2015 production report, the ramp-up of Salobo was weaker than expected in July and August but recovered in September with capacity utilization exceeding 90%. Salobo is expected to achieve 100% capacity utilization in the fourth quarter. Constancia In the third quarter of 2015, Constancia produced approximately 4,341 ounces of gold and 0.7 million ounces of silver attributable to Silver Wheaton as the mine declared commercial production on April 30, 2015, and it continues to ramp-up as expected. Penasquito In the third quarter of 2015, Penasquito produced a record 2.1 million ounces of silver attributable to Silver Wheaton, an increase of approximately 28% relative to the third quarter of 2014 due to higher grades being mined as substantial mining took place in the heart of the deposit. As disclosed inGoldcorp Inc.'s (\"Goldcorp\") third quarter of 2015 MD&A, construction of the Northern Well Field project remained suspended throughout the third quarter of 2015 due to an illegal blockade by a local community. Penasquito continues to seek a fair resolution of this matter with the community, while taking steps to enforce its contractual rights. Penasquito is also advancing alternatives for completion of the project without crossing through the affected community lands. Goldcorp believes that there will be timely resolution of this matter to meet the future water needs of Penasquito. The Metallurgical Enhancement Project feasibility study remains on schedule to be completed in early 2016. San Dimas In the third quarter of 2015, attributable production from San Dimas was 1.4 million ounces of silver, an increase of approximately 22% relative to the third quarter of 2014.2 This growth was primarily due to increased production as a result of the expansion to 2,500 tonnes per day (tpd), which was completed early in 2014, as well as to the sharing threshold increasing to 6 million ounces3, partially offset by the cessation of Goldcorp's four-year obligation to deliver 1.5 million ounces of silver to the Company on August 6, 2014. Silver sales in the third quarter of 2015 from San Dimas were a record 2.0 million ounces, an increase of 72% relative to the third quarter of 20142, as silver inventories built up in the second quarter of 2014 were subsequently sold. As at September 30, 2015, approximately 0.2 million ounces of cumulative payable silver ounces have been produced at San Dimas but not yet delivered to the Company, representing a decrease of 0.6 million payable silver ounces during the third quarter of 2015. As reported by Primero on July 6, 2015, silver deliveries in the second quarter had been delayed due to the suspension of Primero's import and export licenses in May 2015 by the Mexican customs authorities due to a discrepancy over Primero's address related to its corporate office relocation from Mexico City to Durango, Mexico. As per Primero's August 6, 2015, news release, the import and export license was reinstated and normal course imports and exports resumed, including the sales of all inventoried silver. Finally, as per Primero's third quarter of 2015 MD&A, during the third quarter, Primero achieved key milestones at both the San Dimas mine and the mill, tracking towards the completion of its expansion from 2,500 tpd to 3,000 tpd by the accelerated April 2016 completion date. Primero successfully connected the tunnel between the Sinaloa-Graben and Central mining blocks, providing a critical de-bottlenecking in the flow of machinery through theSan Dimas mine. At the San Dimas mill, Primero has completed the construction of foundations for the new secondary crusher and demolition of the old foundry is well advanced. The installation of the additional tailings pump is now complete and control has been handed over to the operations team. The new tailings filter and thickener are also in the process of fabrication and remain on-schedule for delivery to site in Q1 2016. Sudbury In the third quarter of 2015, attributable gold production from Vale's Sudbury mine was 5,967 ounces, a decrease of approximately 51% relative to the third quarter of 2014. According to Vale's third quarter of 2015 production report, the decrease was primarily due to planned maintenance shutdowns in the Sudbury surface plants in August 2015. As per Vale, key work completed as part of the shutdown encompassed the rebuild of the SAG mill, the overhaul of the acid plant in preparation for the implementation of the AER project (atmospheric emissions reduction project), and the upgrade of the environmental equipment at the Copper Cliff Nickel Refinery. It should also be noted that production in Q3 2014 was at an elevated level, as Vale processed large inventories of feed stock that had built up in Q2 2014 due to planned maintenance of surface facilities. Yauliyacu In the third quarter of 2015, attributable silver production from Yauliyacu was 0.7 million ounces, a decrease of approximately 20% relative to the third quarter of 2014, primarily due to lower grade being mined in the quarter. Barrick In the third quarter of 2015, attributable silver production from Barrick was 0.5 million ounces, an increase of approximately 27% relative to the third quarter of 2014, primarily due to higher grades at the Veladero mine and higher recoveries at the Lagunas Norte mine. 777 In the third quarter of 2015, 777 produced approximately 6,330 ounces of gold and 0.1 million ounces of silver attributable to Silver Wheaton, a decrease of approximately 48% and 37%, respectively, relative to the third quarter of 2014 primarily due to lower throughput and grades. Other Minto: In the third quarter of 2015, attributable gold production from Minto was 4,920 ounces, a decrease of approximately 29% relative to the third quarter of 2014, primarily due to lower grade being mined in the quarter. According to Capstone Mining Corp.'s (\"Capstone\") third quarter production results, the Minto mill processed solely underground and stockpiled ore while transitioning to the next open pit mining area. In addition, Capstone reported that the Yukon Water Board issued the final Water Use Licence on August 5, 2015, and that stripping of the Minto North open pit commenced immediately. Stripping of Minto North is reportedly on schedule for first ore to the mill starting in December 2015, with high grade ore commencing in the second quarter of 2016. Stratoni: In the third quarter of 2015, attributable silver production from Stratoni was 0.1 million ounces, a decrease of approximately 52% relative to the third quarter of 2014, primarily due to lower throughput as a result of fewer production stopes available in the mine as well as a five week suspension of operations in the quarter. As per Eldorado Gold Corporation's (\"Eldorado\") news release dated August 20, 2015, operations at the Stratoni mine were temporarily suspended as a direct result of the revocation by Greece's Ministry of Energy of the technical studies of Eldorado's projects in Halkidiki,Greece. As per Eldorado's news release dated October 5, 2015, mining operations have resumed at Halkidiki. Subsequent to the quarter, the Stratoni silver purchase agreement dated April 23, 2007, was amended in order to incentivize additional exploration and potentially extend the limited remaining mine life of Stratoni. The primary modification is to increase the production price per ounce of silver delivered to SWC over the current fixed price by one of the following amounts: i) US$2.50 if 10,000 meters of drilling is completed outside of the existing ore body and within SWC's defined area of interest (\"Expansion Drilling\"), ii) US$5.00 if 20,000 meters of Expansion Drilling is completed, and iii) US$7.00 if 30,000 meters of Expansion Drilling is completed. Drilling in all three cases must be completed by December 31, 2020, in order for the agreed upon increase in production price to be initiated.4 Produced But Not Yet Delivered 5 As at September 30, 2015, payable silver equivalent ounces produced but not yet delivered to Silver Wheaton by its partners decreased by 0.1 million ounces to approximately 6.3 million silver equivalent payable ounces, as increases at Salobo and Constancia were more than offset by decreases at San Dimas, 777 and Penasquito. Payable ounces produced but not yet delivered to Silver Wheaton are expected to average approximately two to three months of annualized production but may vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of mining operation factors including mine ramp-up, delays in shipments, and so forth. Detailed mine by mine production and sales figures can be found in the Appendix to this press release and in Silver Wheaton's MD&A in the 'Results of Operations and Operational Review' section. Sherritt International Corporation (S: TSX) Sherritt is a world leader in the mining and refining of nickel from lateritic ores with projects and operations in Canada, Cuba and Madagascar. The Corporation is the largest independent energy producer in Cuba, with extensive oil and power operations on the island. Sherritt licenses its proprietary technologies and provides metallurgical services to commercial metals operations worldwide. The Corporation's common shares are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol \"S\". Sherritt is committed to the highest standards of environment, health and safety practices at all of its operations, while making valuable contributions to local communities. Sherritt Announces Q4 and Year End 2015 Results February 10, 2016 TORONTO, ON --(Marketwired - February 10, 2016) - NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION TO UNITED STATES NEWSWIRE SERVICES OR FOR DISSEMINATION IN THE UNITED STATES Sherritt International Corporation (\"Sherritt\" or the \"Corporation\") (TSX: S), a world leader in the mining and refining of nickel from lateritic ores, today reported its financial results for the year ended December 31, 2015. \"This has been a year of profound base metal and oil price weakness, with nickel down 40% and fuel oil down 50% in 2015. Operationally, we were able to mitigate these price declines with increased nickel production, significant year over year cost reductions, and prudent, proactive management of our capital spending,\" said David Pathe, President and CEO, Sherritt International. \"Looking to 2016, a healthy balance sheet and maintaining liquidity remain our top priorities, and we will continue to enforce strict cost discipline and allocate capital judiciously.\" Q4 AND YEAR END HIGHLIGHTS (1)(2)(3) The nickel price erosion continued in the fourth quarter, with LME traded nickel hitting a new low of US$3.70/lb before recovering to US$3.93/lb at year end. At these prices and based on Wood Mackenzie published cash cost estimates (C1) for the year ended December 31, 2015, up to 70% of global nickel production is considered to be underwater on a cash cost basis before sustaining capital and debt service costs. Crude oil prices also hit multi-year lows, with WTI prices ending the year at US$36.60 per barrel, and Gulf Coast Fuel Oil 6 ending the year at US$21.80 per barrel. Preserving cash has been the Corporation's highest priority in the last half of the year, and cost discipline across all operations mitigated cash funding requirements despite the commodity price slide. At year end 2015, the Corporation had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $435.4 million, compared to $373.8 million at the end of Q3 2015. In the fourth quarter, Sherritt drew down an additional $65 million on its credit facilities, which accounted for most of the increased cash position. Adjusting for this drawdown, the cash decrease in the quarter was only approximately $5 million. During the fourth quarter 2015, the challenge period for financial completion expired, confirming that the Ambatovy project financing is now non-recourse to Sherritt and the other partners. Continuing cost discipline paid off in the fourth quarter, with the Moa JV reporting Q4 Net Direct Cash Cost (NDCC) of US$2.90 per pound, the lowest since 2009, and Ambatovy's Q4 NDCC being US$4.07/lb. For the full year, the Moa JV reported NDCC of US$3.88/lb while the Ambatovy JV reported NDCC of US$4.83 per pound. Sherritt's oil production maintained positive margins, with average realized prices of $29.53 per barrel of oil equivalent in Q4 and unit operating costs of $11.64 per barrel on a Gross Working Interest (GWI) basis. For the full year, average realized prices were $38.73 per barrel and unit operating costs were $10.69 per barrel. The Q4 2015 average realized prices were down 40% compared to year ago levels, while on a full year basis, the average realized prices were down 41%. Unit operating costs were stable on a quarterly comparison basis, being down 5% in Q4 2015 compared to the year ago quarter and up 13% for the year compared to 2014. Nickel production was up 8% in Q4 2015 over the prior year quarter, and for the full year was up 14% as the Ambatovy JV ramped up to approximately 80% of design capacity. On a 100% basis, the Metals division produced 80,976 tonnes of finished nickel in 2015. Cobalt production was up 27% in Q4 2015 over Q4 2014, and up 17% on a full year basis to 7,199 tonnes (100% basis). Oil production declined following natural reservoir declines and poor results in the wells drilled on the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) Extension lands. Fourth quarter 2015 Cuban oil production of 17,045 bopd (GWI basis) was down 9% from levels reported a year ago, and on a full year basis, production of 18,257 bopd was down 6% from the 19,456 bopd in 2014. Power production of 226GWh (33 1/3 % basis) in the fourth quarter was up 6% from the comparable quarter of 2014, and on a full year basis, production of 902GWh was also up 6% from the 847 Gwh produced during 2014. Production in 2015 benefited from a full year of power generation from the 150MW Boca de Jaruco Combined Cycle Project which was brought online in February of 2014. All amounts are Canadian dollars unless otherwise indicated. For additional information see the Non-GAAP measures section of this press release. Compared to the same period in the prior year. Shown on Sherritt's attributable share ownership basis. SIGNIFICANT ITEMS In the fourth quarter of 2015, Sherritt reported an impairment expense of $1.6 billion after tax on Ambatovy, consisting of $1.3 billion representing Sherritt's 40% share of Ambatovy's impairment and $0.3 billion from the incremental carrying value of Sherritt's Ambatovy assets, primarily related to mineral rights acquired from Dynatec in 2007. On a 100% base, the recorded impairment expense was US$2.4 billion, and was due to lower forecast nickel prices. This impairment resulted in a breach of the Financial Debt to Equity covenant in our credit facilities, for which waivers were obtained. Ambatovy Financial Completion was announced by press release September 21, 2015. AMBATOVY FUNDING In 2015, Sherritt provided funding to Ambatovy of US$105.6 million. Funding requirements were significantly impacted in the year by principal and interest payments on the Ambatovy Joint Venture Financing. As no funding was provided in Q4, this amount is unchanged from the funding that Sherritt reported at the end of Q3 2015. As a result of achieving financial completion, the US$1.6 billion Ambatovy Joint Venture Financing (balance as at December 31, 2015, 100% basis) became non-recourse to the Ambatovy partners. Pursuant to cash calls due in January, 2016, an additional US$30.0 million was provided to Ambatovy by Sumitomo Corp. and Korea Resources Corp. (KORES). Total cash calls of US$50.0 million were made, with Sherritt not funding its 40% pro-rata share (US$20.0 million). By agreement amongst the partners Sherritt's unfunded amounts remain payable to Ambatovy, with accrued interest. These amounts will be subtracted from future Ambatovy Joint Venture distributions, or may be set off by the Ambatovy Joint Venture against certain other amounts owed to Sherritt. Sherritt also has the option to pay the amounts in cash at any time, at Sherritt's election. Until the funding deficit is cured, and subject to continued discussions with the Ambatovy partners, Sherritt will not be exercising its Ambatovy voting rights. Sherritt determined not to fund further cash calls at this time to preserve liquidity and due to the current structure of the Ambatovy partner loans, which, at current nickel prices, effectively reduce Sherritt's 40% interest in Ambatovy to a 12% economic interest.(1) At this time, Sherritt continues to serve as operator, and constructive discussions are ongoing between partners and senior lenders regarding future funding of Ambatovy and modifications to the existing senior principal amortization. METAL MARKETS Nickel spot prices hit a multi-year low of US$3.70 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2015, and have since traded lower in February. These are price levels not seen since 2003. More significant supply disruptions have started to appear in January, with announced cuts from Votorantim and Mirabela in Brazil, and Panoramic and Mincor in Australia. Coupled with Chinese supply cuts announced in 2015, these cuts could impact 200,000 tonnes of nickel supply in 2016. So far, the LME nickel price has not shown any positive response to the supply cut news, as nickel was one of the worst performers in 2015 and published inventories remain at high levels buffering the impact of any supply disruptions. On the demand side, global stainless demand is estimated to have decreased marginally (by approximately 1.2%) in 2015; however, despite this slowdown, world nickel demand is projected to increase marginally in 2016. High levels of nickel stocks and the strengthening US dollar are factors that may cap price rallies in 2016. Sherritt's Moa JV and Ambatovy JV operations experienced steady demand for their nickel briquettes throughout 2015, despite the negative market sentiment and price decline. Higher nickel grades of stainless steel remain more profitable for steel mills, which is positive for both the Moa and Ambatovy JVs. Moa Joint Venture (50% interest) and Fort Site Adjusted EBITDA of $7.6 million in the fourth quarter was up $5.4 million from the level reported in Q3 2015, despite lower production of finished nickel and lower nickel average realized sales prices. Cost reductions and strong fertilizer sales following their normal seasonal patterns were the main drivers in maintaining Adjusted EBITDA levels that outperformed the weak nickel price environment. Finished nickel production of 4,098 tonnes (50% basis) for the fourth quarter of 2015 was down approximately 5% from production of 4,332 tonnes (50% basis) in the fourth quarter 2014, and down approximately 9% from third quarter production of 4,521 tonnes (50% basis). Moa's operations were negatively impacted late in the third quarter and part of the fourth quarter from unplanned maintenance in High Pressure Acid Leach (HPAL) operations resulting in lower process plant availability. The unplanned maintenance and lower availability was partially attributed to power failures stemming from a newly commissioned national power plant in Moa, which also contributed to premature component failures in the HPAL. Moa has addressed the component failures and taken measures to mitigate the impact of future power disruptions with operations returning to normal by the end of 2015. For the full year, finished nickel production of 16,853 tonnes (50% basis) was up 2% from last year's level. Finished cobalt production of 1,867 tonnes (50% basis) for the full year was up 16% over the prior year, reflecting higher utilization of cobalt-rich feeds. Nickel recovery at Moa has been steady at 89% all year, an improvement over the 87% level recorded for full year 2014. The NDCC of US$2.90 per pound of nickel in the fourth quarter of 2015 was an improvement of 35% (US$1.54 per pound) from the fourth quarter of 2014, and the lowest reported since the third quarter of 2009. The Moa JV continues to demonstrate that it is a world class laterite asset and is well positioned to meet our long term objective of being in the lowest quartile of nickel producers on a C1 basis as the fourth quarter 2015 was well within that target based on latest published data from Wood Mackenzie. For the full year, the Moa JV reported an average NDCC of US$3.88 per pound of nickel, down 22% (US$1.11/lb) from the previous year. In addition to cost reductions realized as a result of lower fuel oil and energy prices, a weaker Canadian dollar relative to the US dollar, and lower third party feed costs, efforts to focus on controllable costs have paid off. Capital spending of $20.5 million in the quarter and $64.1 million year to date is lower than its comparable quarter of 2014, but higher for the year than 2014, due to the once in 10 year planned maintenance shutdown at Fort Saskatchewan in the second quarter of 2015, and a weaker Canadian dollar, along with the expansion capital spent on the construction of the 2,000 tonne per day acid plant which is on track for full operation in the second half of 2016. Full year capital spending of $64.1 million was $10.9 million less than the guidance provided at the end of the third quarter of 2015, with the difference being carried over to the 2016 capital spending estimate coupled with deferrals in response to continual weakness in commodity markets. This year, Sherritt expects capital spending of US$38 million, covering Sherritt's 50% share of the Moa JV and capex required in the Fort Site fertilizer and utilities operations. The capital spending includes completion of the Moa JV acid plant, which has been financed by a Cuban financial institution. Ambatovy Joint Venture (40% interest) Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter was negative $(9.5) million during the quarter compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $ (7.5) million in the same quarter last year. Nickel reference prices averaged US$4.27/lb in the quarter, compared to US$7.17/lb in the same quarter a year ago, and down 11% from the US$4.78/lb average reference price in Q3 this year. Despite the profound slide in nickel prices, higher production and a significantly improved NDCC have mitigated the losses in the quarter. For the full year, Adjusted EBITDA of $ (9.4) million compares with $ (5.5) million last year. During the quarter, finished nickel production was 4885 tonnes (40% basis), down 6% from the Q3 2015 record production, but an improvement of 23% over last year. Finished cobalt production of 386 tonnes (40% basis) was up 39% from its level in the same quarter of 2014, and very close to the 392 tonnes cobalt produced in the third quarter. For the year, Ambatovy performed at close to 80% of design capacity, and twice achieved the \"90 for 90\" production test performance that was necessary to satisfy the financial completion criteria. The test required operating at 90% of design capacity for 90 days within a 100 day continuous period. While production and efficiency milestones were set and achieved in 2015, during the fourth quarter, Sherritt also received confirmation that finished nickel briquettes from Ambatovy qualified for delivery to London Metal Exchange (LME) warehouses. This recognition demonstrates the technical and metallurgical capabilities that Sherritt has contributed as operator during Ambatovy's ramp-up. LME delivery status allows Ambatovy or its customers the flexibility and commercial advantage of delivering nickel product to LME warehouses where logistics benefits exist or to mitigate short term variance in customer demand. LME certification should also have a positive impact on pricing. Ambatovy nickel was sold at an average realized price of $5.52/lb in the quarter (approximately US$4.14/lb at the quarterly average exchange rate), demonstrating that pricing is not suffering from discounting, and is approaching Moa JV average realized prices. The NDCC of nickel was US$4.07 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2015, continuing the strong decreasing trend achieved for each quarter this year, starting from US$5.74 per pound in Q1. Ambatovy is also demonstrating its potential to move into the lowest quartile of industry cash costs. Costs have responded positively to increased production as the operation has ramped up, improvements in maintenance costs and headcount, and falling input commodity prices. For example, autoclave turnaround times had been reduced from 42 days to 21 by the end of the year. In 2016, a two week total plant shutdown is scheduled for Q3, to complete inspections of pressure vessels in accordance with statutory engineering codes, and to carry out major opportune maintenance in various areas of the plant. Capital spending in 2015 was $23.8 million, which was approximately $11.2 million less than the guidance provided in Q3 2015. In 2016, capital spending is estimated to be US$25 million, which includes the continued build-up of mining fleet to support the mine plan, further mine development works including sediment control dam construction, and ongoing tailings dam expansion works. AMBATOVY FUNDING In 2015, Sherritt provided funding to Ambatovy of US$105.6 million. Funding requirements were significantly impacted in the year by principal and interest payments on the Ambatovy Joint Venture Financing. This amount is unchanged from the funding that Sherritt reported at the end of Q3 2015. As a result of achieving financial completion, the US$ 1.6 billion Ambatovy Joint Venture Financing (balance as at December 31, 2015, 100% basis) became non-recourse to the Ambatovy partners. Pursuant to cash calls due in January, 2016, an additional US$30.0 million was provided to Ambatovy by Sumitomo Corp. and Korea Resources Corp. (KORES). Total cash calls of US$50.0 million were made, with Sherritt not funding its 40% pro-rata share (US$20.0 million). By agreement amongst the partners Sherritt's unfunded amounts remain payable to Ambatovy, with accrued interest. These amounts will be subtracted from future Ambatovy Joint Venture distributions, or may be set off by the Ambatovy Joint Venture against certain other amounts owed to Sherritt. Sherritt also has the option to pay the amounts in cash at any time, at Sherritt's election. Until the funding deficit is cured, and subject to continued discussions with the Ambatovy partners, Sherritt will not be exercising its Ambatovy voting rights. Sherritt determined not to fund further cash calls at this time to preserve liquidity and due to the current structure of the Ambatovy partner loans, which, at current nickel prices, effectively reduce Sherritt's 40% interest in Ambatovy to a 12% economic interest.(1) At this time, Sherritt continues to serve as operator, and constructive discussions are ongoing between partners and senior lenders regarding future funding of Ambatovy and modifications to the existing senior principal amortization. Adjusted EBITDA of $9.7 million was 63% ($16.6 million) lower in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year period, with the average reference price for Gulf Fuel Oil 6 falling 52% from its year ago levels. The WTI and Fuel Oil 6 prices have continued to deteriorate since year end, with Gulf Coast Fuel Oil 6 now trading in a range of US$18 - US$21 per barrel in January of 2016. Fourth quarter GWI oil production in Cuba of 17,045 bopd was down 9% from the same quarter a year ago following natural reservoir declines and lower than expected production from the PSC Extension wells drilled earlier in 2015. Fourth quarter NWI oil production in Cuba of 10,145 bopd increased by 3% over the same quarter in 2014 despite the decrease in Cuban GWI oil production. This trend was also evident in the year over year comparison, with GWI oil production in Cuba down 6% for the full year, while net working interest production was up 1%. Cost recovery oil production in Cuba for both the quarter and the full year increased compared to 2014 because of lower oil prices. The allocation of cost recovery barrels in any particular period is limited to a fixed percentage of GWI volumes within each cost pool. Unit operating costs in Cuba increased by 9% ($0.88 per barrel) to $10.82 (GWI basis) for the fourth quarter (up 11% on a full year basis to $9.53 per barrel). This increase in unit operating costs is mainly attributable to lower than expected production combined with a weaker Canadian dollar, offset to some degree by lower workover costs. Quarterly free cash flow of $23.3 million was considerably higher than quarterly Adjusted EBITDA, benefiting from the collection of overdue receivables and limited capital spending. Although overdue receivables are still above normal levels at year end, approximately $48.8 million was collected during the quarter, and a schedule of payments has been agreed with the Cuban agency that shows receivables returning to current by year end 2016. In the third quarter of 2015, an impairment expense of $80.6 million ($0.27 per share) was recorded on Cuban and Spain oil assets in the quarter. The lower oil price forecast, combined with drilling results on the PSC extension that were below expectations, are the reasons for the impairment. Depletion, depreciation and amortization charges in the last quarter of 2015 were reduced accordingly, with Q4 depletion, depreciation and amortization charges of $10.9 million being $6.7 million lower than the Q4 2014 depletion, depreciation and amortization charges of $17.6 million. On a year to date basis, capital spending of $54.5 million is down 17% year over year, as further drilling was stopped in Q3 on the Extension areas after poor drilling results. Although the decision was made to stop further development within the PSC Extension areas, new capital spending is necessary to offset declines in existing production. The outlook for 2016 Cuban oil production of 14,500 bopd (GWI basis) is 21% lower than 2015 production, anticipating continuing natural reservoir declines, and no further drilling planned on the existing PSCs. The original PSCs expire in 2017 and 2018, with future production dependent on the ability to develop new prospective areas within the Cuban oil partnership. Drilling activity for 2016 is focused on the preparation and drilling of Block 10, where Sherritt has budgeted to drill two wells. Block 10 is one of two new PSC's which Sherritt signed in 2014 with the Cuban agency, covering 261 square kilometres for a 25-year term. Sherritt originally held Block 10 in the Bay of Cardenas, and drilled one well in June 1994. The well was drilled using an offshore drilling rig, and produced a discovery which tested at 3,750 barrels of oil per day. Since then, significant advances in horizontal drilling technology have made new drilling from onshore a viable prospect. Power Quarterly Adjusted EBITDA increased by 2% from Q4 2014 levels, while on a full year basis, Adjusted EBITDA was up 21%. Higher gas availability led to higher production, with Sherritt's share being 902 GWh for the full year. Production included the first full year of production from the 150MW Boca de Jaruco Combined Cycle Project, which was brought online effective February 2, 2014. The average-realized price of electricity was also higher for the quarter and for the full year period compared to 2014, mainly because of a weaker Canadian dollar. Operating costs increased by 48% ($11.06 per MWh) in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year period, with most of the increase being in non-base costs. These are mainly maintenance expenditures on the Boca de Jaruco and Puerto Escondido facilities. Operating costs fluctuate from a quarter to quarter basis with the timing of maintenance performed on gas and steam turbines. The weaker Canadian dollar also contributed to higher unit operating costs on both a three month and full year basis, as the Canadian dollar weakened from levels of approximately $1.14 in Q4 last year to $1.34 in Q4 of 2015, a change of 18%. Higher depletion, depreciation, and amortization expenses in both the quarter and the year compared to 2014 reflect the impact of a change in residual value estimate of the Varadero facility in Q1 2015, as well as the Canadian dollar decline. Free cash flow generation of $4.4 million in the quarter included a $2.8 million payment of interest on the Energas conditional sales agreement ($37.9 million year to date). Principal repayments of $7.9 million in the quarter were also received ($33.7 million year to date). OUTLOOK 2016 PRODUCTION AND CAPITAL SPENDING GUIDANCE In 2016, Sherritt has made certain modifications to how guidance is presented. For example, nickel and cobalt production expectations will continue to be published and reconciled to production guidance, but mixed sulphide production will not be part of the production guidance. This change was implemented recognizing that external stakeholders are focused on finished metal production with mixed sulphide production guidance having less utility. Secondly, capital spending estimates are being presented in US dollar denominated ranges, with the Canadian dollar estimate being presented for ease of comparison. The Canadian dollar estimate has been converted using the 2016 forecast conversion rate $1.36. This change in presentation is intended to align with Sherritt's capital budgeting practices, and to mitigate the change to capital that arises from translation to the Canadian dollar reporting currency. In 2015, capital spending revisions were generally explained in terms of their US dollar movement, as the fall in the Canadian dollar offset larger downward revisions to capital spending as the year progressed. This year, the presentation in US dollars and reporting against spending projections in US dollars is intended to mitigate the impacts of currency exchange volatility. Capital projects in the Metals business are generally US dollar expenditures, while in Oil & Gas, the expenditures are roughly 50% Canadian dollar denominated and 50% US dollar denominated. Production volumes and spending on capital 2015 guidance Actual 2015 December 31 2016 guidance  Spending is 50% of US$expenditures for Moa JV and 100% expenditures for Fort Site fertilizer and utilities Production Volumes Sherritt expects 2016 production to increase at Ambatovy, despite the planned once in three year maintenance shutdown of operations scheduled for Q3 2016. Production at Moa and in the power operations is expected to remain steady, with a decline in Oil & Gas, reflecting natural reservoir declines and no further drilling activity on existing PSC's. The original PSC wells are scheduled to revert to Cuban ownership in 2017 and 2018. Longer term, new production in Oil & Gas is expected to come from the drilling of Block 10, where the drill program will progress at a pace driven by prudent capital spending, and the objective of running the business units to be cash flow neutral. Capital Spending Capital spending (excluding Corporate) in 2015 was approximately $147 million, up 39% from 2014 capex of approximately $106 million, but down 21% from guidance provided at the end of Q3 2015. Approximately US$12 million ($16.3 million) has been carried over to 2016 estimated capital spending of US$107 million. In the Moa JV, 2016 estimated capital spending is consistent with 2015 levels adjusting for carry-forwards. The acid plant construction at the Moa JV is nearing 75% completion at January 31, 2016, and is on track to be operating in the second half of 2016. Counting US$40.4 million spent (100% basis) from the construction re-start in 2013 to the end of 2015 and an additional estimated US$24.6 million (included in the 2016 capital spending estimate), the construction completion cost (since resuming construction in 2013) is forecast at approximately US$65 million which is in line with the 2013 approved budget and is being 100% financed by a Cuban leading institution. Ambatovy capital spending is similar to what was originally estimated for 2015. Oil and gas estimated capital spending is focused on the preparation and drilling of Block 10. Block 10 is covered by one of the two new PSC's which Sherritt signed in 2014 with the Cuban agency, encompassing 261 square kilometres in the Bay of Cardenas for a 25-year term. Sherritt originally held Block 10 and completed a drill hole on the block in June 1994. Sherritt drilled one well, using an offshore drilling rig, which produced a discovery which tested at 3,750 barrels of oil per day. Since then, significant advances in horizontal drilling technology have made new drilling from onshore a viable prospect. Power capital spending is forecast to be US$1 million (Sherritt's 33 1/3% share) in 2016. In addition, the cost to construct a new pipeline to increase gas availability is estimated at US$4 million (Sherritt's share) with construction starting and finishing in 2016. NON-GAAP MEASURES The Corporation uses combined results, Adjusted EBITDA, average-realized price, unit operating cost, and adjusted operating cash flow to monitor the performance of the Corporation and its operating divisions and believes these measures enable investors and analysts to compare the Corporation's financial performance with its competitors and evaluate the results of its underlying business. These measures do not have a standard definition under IFRS and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. As these measures do not have a standardized meaning, they may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other companies.

Teck Reports Unaudited Fourth Quarter Results For 2015 Vancouver, BC - Teck Resources Limited (TSX: TCK.A and TCK.B, NYSE: TCK) (\"Teck\") reported unaudited annual adjusted profit attributable to shareholders of $188 million, or $0.33 per share, compared with $452 million, or $0.78 per share in 2014. Fourth quarter adjusted profit attributable to shareholders was $16 million, or $0.03 per share, compared with $116 million, or $0.20 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2014. Total non-cash after-tax impairment charges for 2015 amounted to $2.7 billion, of which $536 million was taken in the fourth quarter. \"We were pleased with our operating performance in 2015, meeting our guidance, reducing our costs and raising nearly $1 billion through two streaming transactions to strengthen our balance sheet,\" said Don Lindsay, President and CEO. \"However, the commodity cycle continues to provide us with a very challenging environment such that our near-term priorities are to keep all of our operations cash flow positive, meet our commitment to Fort Hills with internal sources of funds, evaluate options to further strengthen our liquidity and maintain a strong financial position by ending the year without drawing on our lines of credit.\" Highlights and Significant Items Annual adjusted profit attributable to shareholders was $188 million, or $0.33 per share. Fourth quarter adjusted profit attributable to shareholders was $16 million, or $0.03 per share. Gross profit before depreciation and amortization in 2015 was $2.6 billion compared with $2.9 billion in 2014. Gross profit before depreciation and amortization was $614 million in the fourth quarter compared with $757 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Cash flow from operations, before working capital changes, was $1.7 billion in 2015 compared with $2.0 billion last year. Cash flow from operations, before working capital changes, was $428 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with $491 million a year ago. The loss attributable to shareholders was $459 million in the fourth quarter compared with a profit of $129 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Our quarterly loss included impairment charges of $736 million on a pre-tax basis, including $45 million on our steelmaking coal assets, $93 million on copper and $598 million on the Fort Hills oil sand project resulting in a $536 million after-tax charge. For 2015, total pre-tax asset impairment charges were $3.6 billion and $2.7 billion on an after-tax basis. Adjusted EBITDA for 2015 (not including the non-cash impairment charges) was $2.0 billion compared with $2.4 billion in 2014. Our liquidity remains strong with a cash balance of $1.8 billion at February 10, and US$3.0 billion available under our revolving credit facility which matures in 2020. Construction of the Fort Hills oil sands project is more than 50% complete and progressing substantially on schedule and on budget. As at February 10, our remaining cash funding to complete the project is $1.2 billion. We received a payment of $789 million (US$610 million) for the sale of a silver stream linked to our share of the Antamina mine. Cash unit production costs were reduced at all of our operations in 2015 compared with a year ago as a result of the highly focused efforts on our cost reduction program and lower diesel prices. We have reached agreements with the majority of our steelmaking coal customers for the first quarter of 2016, based on a quarterly benchmark of US$81 per tonne for the highest quality product, and we expect total sales in the first quarter, including spot sales, to be at least 5.5 million tonnes of steelmaking coal. We were recognized as one of the Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations for the fourth consecutive year by media and investment research company Corporate Knights. Operating highlights in 2015 included: all our operating mines, with the exception of Quebrada Blanca and Pend Oreille, remained cash positive in the fourth quarter and for 2015, we achieved record annual production at Trail for refined zinc and silver, and we achieved record annual mill throughput at Antamina. If we meet our full year guidance for production, costs and capital expenditures, assuming current commodity prices and exchange rates and no unusual transactions or events, we should complete 2016 with at least $500 million in cash without any material change in our overall U.S. dollar debt level.

Turqoise Hill Resources Ltd. (TSE: TRQ) Turquoise Hill Resources (TRQ: TSX, NYSE & NASDAQ) is an international mining company with copper-gold and coal mines in the Asia Pacific region. Principal assets: A 66% interest in Oyu Tolgoi, one of the world's largest copper-gold-silver mines now producing and shipping concentrate to customers in China. A 22.63% interest in established Mongolian coal miner SouthGobi Resources (SGQ: TSX, 1878: HK). Turquoise Hill announces financial results and review of operations for 2015 VANCOUVER, CANADA - Turquoise Hill Resources today announced its financial results for the year ended December 31, 2015. All figures are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated. HIGHLIGHTS Oyu Tolgoi achieved an excellent safety performance for 2015 with an All Injury Frequency Rate of 0.33 per 200,000 hours worked. In May 2015, the Oyu Tolgoi Underground Mine Development and Financing Plan was signed addressing key outstanding shareholder matters and setting out long-term funding of the project. In August 2015, Oyu Tolgoi filed revised schedules for the statutory feasibility study with the Mongolian Minerals Council. In December 2015, Oyu Tolgoi signed a $4.4 billion project financing facility provided by a syndicate of international financial institutions, export credit agencies and 15 commercial banks. Underground pre-start activities are underway in parallel with an update to the feasibility study capital estimate, which is expected to be complete in Q1'16. Turquoise Hill continues to expect approval of the updated 2016 feasibility study and notice to proceed decisions by the various boards for underground construction in Q2'16. Oyu Tolgoi recorded revenue of $1.6 billion in 2015 on record concentrate sales of 819,800 tonnes reflecting higher concentrate sales volumes partially offset by lower copper and gold prices. In Q4'15, Oyu Tolgoi recorded revenue of $355.6 million on concentrate sales of 236,200 tonnes reflecting lower copper and gold prices combined with lower sales of metal in concentrate. Turquoise Hill generated operating cash flow before interest and taxes of $650.5 million in 2015. In 2015, cash operating costs1 at Oyu Tolgoi were $962.6 million including $59.9 million in non-recurring charges for the May 18 underground agreement and underground early works expensed. For 2015, Oyu Tolgoi generated C11 costs of $0.57 per pound of copper and all-in sustaining costs1 of $1.37 per pound of copper, a decrease of 50.0% and 29.7% respectively over 2014. Capital expenditure on a cash basis for 2015 was $116.2 million, primarily attributed to sustaining activities. For 2015, Oyu Tolgoi's second full year of production, the mine operated at record levels Productivity improvements in the concentrator implemented throughout 2015 led to throughput exceeding nameplate capacity by year end and increasing by 23.9% over 2014. For Q4'15, concentrator throughput increased 8.5% over Q3'15 reaching an all-time quarterly high. In 2015, copper production of 202,200 tonnes exceeded the Company's guidance and annual gold production of 653,000 ounces met guidance. Compared to 2014, 2015 mined production increased 19.3%, concentrate production increased 39.9%, copper production increased 36.3% and gold production increased 10.9%. Oyu Tolgoi is expected to produce 175,000 to 195,000 tonnes of copper and 210,000 to 260,000 ounces of gold in concentrates for 2016. Sales contracts have been signed for approximately 90% of Oyu Tolgoi's expected 2016 concentrate production. In September 2015, Oyu Tolgoi surpassed 1.5 million tonnes of concentrate shipped. Turquoise Hill's cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2015 were approximately $1.3 billion. FINANCIAL RESULTS In 2015, the Company recorded net income attributable to owners of Turquoise Hill of $313.3 million or $0.16 per share compared with net income of $26.9 million or $0.01 per share in 2014, an increase of $286.4 million. The increase is mainly attributable to a $210.2 million non-cash impairment charge recorded in 2014 on reclassification of SouthGobi to assets held for sale, and a deferred tax asset of $165.0 million recognized in 2015, partially offset by adjustments for inventory write-down of $103.2 million. Operating cash flows before interest and taxes in 2015 were $650.5 million compared with $718.5 million in 2014, reflecting the impact of lower commodity prices on sales revenue, offset by the continued production and delivery cost improvements and effective working capital management. Capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment was $116.2 million on a cash basis in 2015, primarily attributed to sustaining capital activities. Turquoise Hill's cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2015 were approximately $1.3 billion. OYU TOLGOI COPPER-GOLD MINE The Oyu Tolgoi mine is approximately 550 kilometres south of Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia's capital city, and 80 kilometres north of the Mongolia-China border. Mineralization on the property consists of porphyry-style copper, gold, silver and molybdenum contained in a linear structural trend (the Oyu Tolgoi Trend) that has a strike length extending over 26 kilometres. Mineral resources have been identified in a series of deposits throughout this trend. They include, from south to north, the Heruga Deposit, the Southern Oyu deposits (Southwest Oyu, South Oyu, Wedge and Central Oyu) and the Hugo Dummett deposits (Hugo South, Hugo North and Hugo North Extension). The Oyu Tolgoi mine has initially been developed as an open-pit operation. A copper concentrator plant, with related facilities and necessary infrastructure to support a nominal throughput of 100,000 tonnes of ore per day, has been constructed to process ore mined from the Southern Oyu open pit. Long term development plans for Oyu Tolgoi are based on a 95,000-tonne-per-day underground block-cave mine. In August 2013, development of the underground mine was suspended pending resolution of matters with the Government of Mongolia. On May 18, 2015, Turquoise Hill, the Government of Mongolia and Rio Tinto signed the Oyu Tolgoi Underground Mine Development and Financing Plan, which addressed key outstanding shareholder matters and set out an agreed basis for the funding of the project. Oyu Tolgoi Underground Mine Development and Financing Plan On May 18, 2015, Turquoise Hill, the Government of Mongolia and Rio Tinto signed the Oyu Tolgoi Underground Mine Development and Financing Plan (Underground Plan), which addressed key outstanding shareholder matters and set out an agreed basis for the funding of the project. The Underground Plan confirmed the project cost for Oyu Tolgoi's initial construction and development and reinforced the principles set out in the Investment Agreement and the Amended and Restated Shareholders Agreement (ARSHA). The agreements addressed key outstanding matters including the following specific items: tax matters, the 2% net smelter royalty, sales royalty calculation and management services payments. The agreements also addressed the sourcing of power for Oyu Tolgoi from within Mongolia. The overall value impact for the Company in connection with the agreements is less than 2% of the value of the reserve case of $7.4 billion presented in the 2014 Oyu Tolgoi Technical Report. The components of the variance are outlined in the following paragraphs. In 2003, Turquoise Hill acquired a 2% net smelter royalty from BHP Billiton. The enforceability of the royalty was challenged by the Assistant General Prosecutor of Mongolia under Mongolian law. The Company determined, as part of the Underground Plan negotiated, that it would not contest its right to receive payment and consequently recognized a charge of $36.8 million in Q2'15 for write-off of the original royalty acquisition cost. In June 2014, Oyu Tolgoi LLC received a Tax Act (Tax Assessment) from the Mongolian Tax Authority as a result of a general tax audit for the period 2010 through 2012. Oyu Tolgoi appealed the assessment and in September 2014 received a response reducing the amount of tax, interest and penalties claimed to be payable, from approximately $127.0 million to approximately $30.0 million. In a separate agreement with the Government of Mongolia, Oyu Tolgoi agreed, without accepting liability and without creating a precedent, to pay the amount of the determination by way of settlement to resolve the tax matter. A final charge of $22.1 million has been recognized in Q2'15 for settlement of amounts not previously paid or provided for in relation to the Tax Assessment. The parties agreed that Oyu Tolgoi's 5% sales royalty paid to the Government of Mongolia will be calculated on gross revenues by not allowing deductions for the costs of processing, freight differentials, penalties or payables. Oyu Tolgoi recalculated royalties payable accordingly since the commencement of sales and submitted an additional amount payable in Q2'15 of approximately $17.1 million to the Government, which includes approximately $14.5 million on previous years' sales. Notwithstanding the terms of the ARSHA, the parties agreed that in calculating the Management Services Payment (MSP), the rate applied to capital costs of the underground development will be 3% instead of 6%, as provided by the ARSHA. The MSP rate on operating cost and capital related to current operations remains at 6%. In accordance with the ARSHA, 50% of the MSP is payable to Turquoise Hill and 50% to Rio Tinto. Turquoise Hill continues to work with Oyu Tolgoi LLC on possible support of Oyu Tolgoi LLC's obligations under a potential power purchase arrangement from the Tavan Tolgoi power plant project. Signing of project finance On December 14, 2015, Oyu Tolgoi signed a $4.4 billion project finance facility, one of the largest in the mining industry. The facility was provided by a syndicate of international financial institutions and export credit agencies representing the governments of Canada, the United States and Australia, along with 15 commercial banks. The project finance facility will be funded by Export Development Canada, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Finance Corporation, the Export-Import Bank of the United States, the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation of Australia and commercial lenders comprising BNP Paribas, ANZ, ING, Societe Generale Corporate & Investment Banking, Sumitomo Mitsui, Standard Chartered Bank, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Credit Agricole, Intesa Sanpaolo, National Australia Bank, Natixis, HSBC, The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UJF, KfW IPEX-Bank and Nederlandse Financierings-Maatschappij voor Ontwikkelingslanden. The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) provided political risk insurance for the commercial banks. Turquoise Hill, Rio Tinto and Oyu Tolgoi continue to work towards completing the 2016 feasibility study, including the updated capital estimate and securing all necessary permits for the development of the underground mine. Once these steps have been completed and subject to the boards of Turquoise Hill, Rio Tinto and Oyu Tolgoi approving a formal 'notice to proceed' (Notice to Proceed), the full $4.4 billion facility will be drawn down by Oyu Tolgoi subject to satisfaction of certain conditions precedent typical for a financing of this nature. Net proceeds from the project finance facility (Net PF Proceeds), after fees and taxes, are anticipated to be approximately $4.1 billion. The Net PF Proceeds will be used by Oyu Tolgoi to pay down shareholder loans payable to Turquoise Hill. The Net PF Proceeds will be available to be re-drawn by Oyu Tolgoi for the development of the underground mine. As part of the project finance agreements, Rio Tinto has agreed to provide a guarantee, known as the completion support undertaking, in favour of the project finance lenders. In consideration for providing completion support, and as contemplated by previous agreements, Oyu Tolgoi and Turquoise Hill have agreed to pay Rio Tinto an annual completion support fee equal to 2.5% of the amounts drawn under the facility, of which 1.9% is payable by Oyu Tolgoi and 0.6% is payable by Turquoise Hill. The annual completion support fee will apply to funding used for facility fees and taxes at initial drawdown as well as amounts used to fund development. The obligation to pay a completion support fee will terminate on the date Rio Tinto's completion support obligations to the project lenders terminate. Following successful fulfilment of the completion tests outlined in the project finance facility, the Rio Tinto completion support undertaking will terminate and the facility interest rates will shift to post-completion rates. The project financing facility provides for interest only payments for the first five years and is then structured on a stepped amortization schedule for the remaining life of the facility. The parties to the project finance facility have agreed to a debt cap of $6.0 billion for Oyu Tolgoi, providing the option for an additional $1.6 billion of supplemental debt in the future. In its capacity as project sponsor, Turquoise Hill will enter into a guarantee, known as the sponsor debt service undertaking, with Rio Tinto, the project lenders and agents representing such lenders (Sponsor DSU). Under the Sponsor DSU, Turquoise Hill guarantees to the finance parties payment of principal, interest and fees owed by Oyu Tolgoi to the senior lenders under the project financing payable prior to completion. The obligations of Turquoise Hill under the Sponsor DSU terminate upon the earliest of (i) completion of the project, (ii) the termination of the Sponsor DSU as a result of the occurrence of certain force majeure circumstances (described in the agreements as suspensive events), and (iii) the date on which all senior debt obligations have been irrevocably and unconditionally paid or discharged and the commitments have terminated or expired. The provisions contained in the Company Financing Support Agreement, including those referred to below, are broadly in line with the principles and provisions established under the Memorandum of Agreement between Turquoise Hill and Rio Tinto entered into in 2012: Under the Company Financing Support Agreement, in the event a fact or circumstance occurs which affects or could reasonably be expected to affect Turquoise Hill's ability to meet its obligations under the Sponsor DSU or give rise to an event of default or completion default under the project finance agreements, Rio Tinto shall have the right to require that Turquoise Hill effect an equity contribution by way of private placement of Turquoise Hill shares to Rio Tinto or a rights offering similar in form and structure to the rights offering which closed in January 2014. Turquoise Hill will also have the right to propose an alternative financing proposal to Rio Tinto which, depending on the nature of such proposal, may require Rio Tinto's consent. The parties have agreed that the aggregate amount of any such funding mechanisms shall not exceed 25% of Turquoise Hill's market capitalization as of the date of the Company Financing Support Agreement. Any such transaction shall also be subject to applicable securities laws. The Company Financing Support Agreement also contains certain restrictions relating to the conduct of the Company's business and operations and to the implementation of certain corporate transactions until the later of (i) the date Rio Tinto's completion support obligations terminate, (ii) the date that all senior loan advances under the project finance agreements are repaid in full, and (iii) the date that all subordinated debt advances by Rio Tinto have been repaid in full, which shall be deemed to be the date on which Rio Tinto's completion support obligations terminate if, as of such date, the aggregate amount of subordinated debt advances by Rio Tinto has not exceeded $500 million. Under the Oyu Tolgoi Financing Support Agreement, in the event a fact or circumstance occurs which affects or could reasonably be expected to affect Oyu Tolgoi's ability to meet its obligations under the project finance agreements or give rise to an event of default thereunder, Rio Tinto shall have the right to require that Oyu Tolgoi borrow funds from Rio Tinto (or an affiliate thereof) by way of a senior debt advance or a subordinated debt advance, or borrow funds from a third party senior lender. The proceeds of any such advances shall be used to repay amounts due and owing to the project lenders. Under the Cash Management Services Agreement, Turquoise Hill has appointed 9539549 Canada Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Rio Tinto, as service provider to provide post-drawdown cash management services in connection with the Net PF Proceeds, which shall be placed with 9539549 Canada Inc. and returned to Turquoise Hill as required for purposes of funding the Oyu Tolgoi underground mine. Turquoise Hill is also entitled to the return of any outstanding balance of such managed funds upon the termination of Rio Tinto's completion support obligations. RTIH has agreed to guarantee the obligations of the service provider under this agreement. Preparation for underground development Following the filing of revised schedules for the statutory feasibility study with the Mongolian Minerals Council in August 2015, pre-start activities began in parallel with an update to the capital estimate, which is expected to be complete in Q1'16. Pre-start activities include ramp-up of the owners and EPCM team, re-estimate activities, detailed engineering and early procurement for equipment and materials required for necessary critical works that are key enablers for recommencement of underground lateral development mining activity. Care and maintenance activities have continued for Shaft #1, facilities and mobile equipment. Appointments to key roles in the underground team are well underway, with key staff starting in Q1'16. Turquoise Hill expects the Notice to Proceed decision for underground construction in Q2'16. Prior to the suspension in August 2013, underground lateral development at Hugo North had advanced approximately 16 kilometres off Shaft #1. Sinking of Shaft #2, the primary operations access and initial production hoisting shaft, had reached a depth of 1,168 metres below surface, 91% of its final depth of 1,284 metres. The 96 metre-high Shaft #2 concrete headframe has been constructed. Sinking of Shaft #5, a dedicated exhaust ventilation shaft, had reached a depth of 208 metres, 17% of its final depth of 1,174 metres. Surface facilities, including offices, mine dry, and workshop, are in place to support initial pre-production development and construction. Full-year 2015 and Q4'15 performance Safety continues to be a major focus throughout Oyu Tolgoi's operations and the mine's management is committed to reducing risk and injury. Oyu Tolgoi achieved an excellent safety performance for 2015 with an All Injury Frequency Rate of 0.33 per 200,000 hours worked. Oyu Tolgoi Key Financial Metrics Revenue of $1.6 billion in 2015 decreased 5.8% over 2014 reflecting lower copper and gold prices partially offset by higher volumes of copper-gold concentrate sales. Concentrate sold in 2015 of 819,800 tonnes increased 11.7% over 2014 reaching an all-time annual high. Revenue of $355.6 million in Q4'15 decreased 17.6% over Q3'15 reflecting lower copper and gold prices combined with lower metals in concentrate sales. Fourth quarter concentrate sold of 236,200 tonnes increased 4.5% over Q3'15. Production and delivery costs include primarily the cash costs in inventory sold as well as allocated mine administration costs. Depreciation and depletion includes the depreciation and depletion in inventory sold as well as any depreciation of assets used in the selling and delivery process, including the depreciation of capitalized production phase stripping costs. A charge of $90.9 million was recorded in 2015, within operating expenses, for provision against, and writes off of, non-current ore stockpiles. The charge followed a re-estimation of realizable value to reflect lower copper and gold prices and updated assumptions for timing of processing. Capital expenditure, on a cash basis, for 2015 was $116.2 million (2014: $242.2 million) primarily attributed to sustaining activities, including the tailings storage facility and deferred stripping (2014 included payments relating to 2013 underground development prior to suspension). Total cash operating costs at Oyu Tolgoi in 2015 were $962.6 million inclusive of non-recurring charges following agreement of the Underground Plan (tax settlement: $22.1 million; recalculation of royalties: $14.5 million) and costs relating to underground remobilization and early works expensed ($23.3 million). Throughout 2015, Oyu Tolgoi improved and optimized operations in order to reduce costs across the mine's operation. Following transition to IFRS, the 5% royalty payable to the Government of Mongolia, previously deducted from revenue, is reflected as a cash operating expense, and production phase stripping costs, previously included within cash operating expense, are capitalized where appropriate and depreciated. Please refer to Section 12 - INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS - on page 20 of the MD&A. Oyu Tolgoi's C1 costs in 2015 were $0.57 per pound, compared with $1.14 per pound in 2014. The decrease was mainly due to production volume increases and cost optimization, partly offset by reduced gold and silver credits per pound of copper produced. Oyu Tolgoi's open-pit mine has a high-grade zone containing a large proportion of gold in addition to copper; Turquoise Hill anticipates quarterly fluctuation of C1 costs as the quantity of gold in concentrates sold varies. Oyu Tolgoi's C1 costs in Q4'15 were $0.88 per pound, compared with $0.40 per pound in Q3'15. The increase was mainly due to a drop in gold revenues and lower grades. All-in sustaining costs in 2015 were $1.37 per pound, compared with $1.95 per pound in 2014. The decrease was mainly due to volume increases, cost optimization and operational efficiencies, partly offset by reduced gold and silver credits per pound of copper produced, combined with impact of non-recurring and non-cash items. All-in sustaining costs in Q4'15 were $1.56 per pound, compared with $1.52 per pound in Q3'15. The increase was mainly due to a drop in gold revenues and lower grades. For 2015, Oyu Tolgoi's second full year of production, the mine operated at record levels. Productivity improvements in the concentrator implemented throughout the year led to throughput exceeding nameplate capacity by year end. Copper production for 2015 of 202,200 tonnes exceeded the Company's guidance of 175,000 to 195,000 tonnes and annual gold production of 653,000 ounces met 2015 guidance of 600,000 to 700,000 ounces. Compared to 2014 results, 2015 mined production increased 19.3%, concentrator throughput increased 23.9%, concentrate production increased 39.9%, copper production increased 36.3% and gold production increased 10.9%. For Q4'15, throughput increased 8.5% over Q3'15 reaching an all-time high. Copper production for the quarter increased 2.3% over Q3'15 due to higher volumes offset by lower grades. As a result of mining higher grades from Phase 2 and higher volumes, Q4'15 gold production increased 68.3% over Q3'15. Funding of Oyu Tolgoi by Turquoise Hill In accordance with the ARSHA dated June 8, 2011, Turquoise Hill has funded Oyu Tolgoi's cash requirements beyond internally generated cash flows by a combination of equity investment and shareholder debt. For amounts funded by debt, Oyu Tolgoi must repay such amounts, including accrued interest, before it can pay common share dividends. At December 31, 2015, the aggregate outstanding balance of shareholder loans extended by subsidiaries of the Company to Oyu Tolgoi was $6.9 billion, including accrued interest of $0.8 billion. These loans bear interest at an effective annual rate of LIBOR plus 6.5%. During 2015, Oyu Tolgoi repaid a total amount of $482.0 million with respect to these loans, including accrued interest of $150.3 million. In accordance with the ARSHA, a subsidiary of the Company has funded the common share investments in Oyu Tolgoi on behalf of Erdenes. These funded amounts earn interest at an effective annual rate of LIBOR plus 6.5% and are repayable, by Erdenes to a subsidiary of the Company, via a pledge over Erdenes' share of Oyu Tolgoi common share dividends. Erdenes also has the right to reduce the outstanding balance by making cash payments at any time. As at December 31, 2015, the cumulative amount of such funding was $751.1 million, representing approximately 34% of invested common share equity; unrecognized interest on the funding amounted to $231.1 million. Operational outlook Oyu Tolgoi is expected to produce 175,000 to 195,000 tonnes of copper and 210,000 to 260,000 ounces of gold in concentrates for 2016. Open-pit operations are expected to mine in phases 2, 3 and 6 during the year as well as begin stripping for phase 4. In addition, stockpiled ore is anticipated to be processed during the year. The reduction in gold compared to 2015 is expected to result from mining in lower-grade gold areas and processing lower-grade stockpiled ore. The majority of 2016 gold production is expected in the first half of the year. Operating cash costs for 2016 are expected to be approximately $800 million. The reduction compared to 2015 operating cash costs is mainly related to additional capitalization of phase 4 stripping costs. Capital expenditures for 2016 on a cash-basis, excluding underground development, are expected to be approximately $300 million, of which approximately $280 million relates to sustaining capital. Sustaining capital reflects increased capitalization of phase 4 deferred stripping costs. For underground development, Turquoise Hill will provide capital guidance for 2016 once a final Notice to Proceed decision is confirmed. Sales contracts have been signed for approximately 90% of Oyu Tolgoi's expected 2016 concentrate production. Exploration during 2015 Oyu Tolgoi's exploration program focused on near surface targets using geochemical surveys and detailed ground magnetic surveys to identify porphyry style mineralisation. In December 2015, Turquoise Hill acquired a second exploration licence within 50 kilometers of Oyu Tolgoi. SOUTHGOBI During 2015, the Company pursued a strategy of divesting its holding in SouthGobi, which amounted to 104.8 million shares (47.9%) at January 1, 2015. Sale of 50.4 million shares in SouthGobi to Novel Sunrise Investments Limited (NSI) was completed between April 23 and June 3, 2015 at a price of C$0.35 per share. At December 31, 2015, following dilution of the Company's interest on November 30 as the result of issuance to the China Investment Corporation (CIC) of 11.9 million new SouthGobi shares, and general market sales in accordance with the Company's ongoing divestment strategy, Turquoise Hill owned 49.3 million shares (19.2%). The Company's remaining interest in SouthGobi is recorded as an available for sale investment within financial assets, with a fair value (based on the quoted share price) of $14.5 million at December 31, 2015. See Note 14 to the annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 for more information. CORPORATE ACTIVITIES Statutory feasibility study On March 18, 2015, Oyu Tolgoi filed a statutory feasibility study with the Mongolian Minerals Council. Under Mongolian law, Oyu Tolgoi is required to submit an update to the feasibility study at least every five years. MIGA host country approval signing In September 2015, the Government of Mongolia signed the request of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) for host country approval (HCA) with respect to guarantees to be issued by MIGA in connection with the Oyu Tolgoi project financing. The signing of the HCA was a significant milestone in the project financing timeline. Management changes In September 2015, Turquoise Hill announced the resignation of Stewart Beckman, Senior Vice President, Operations and Technical Development, effective October 1, 2015 due to Mr. Beckman having accepted a new position within Rio Tinto. In January 2016, Turquoise Hill announced the appointment of Brendan Lane as Vice President, Operations and Development effective February 1, 2016. Mr. Lane brings 25-years of industry experience including metallurgical, mine engineering and commercial roles at Rio Tinto, Anglo American and BHP Billiton. NON-GAAP MEASURES The Company's financial results are prepared in accordance with IFRS. In addition, the Company presents and refers to the following measures (non-GAAP measures) which are not defined in IFRS. A description and calculation of these measures is given below, and may differ from equivalent measures provided by other issuers. Cash operating costs This measure comprises Oyu Tolgoi cash operating costs, and is presented in order to provide investors and other stakeholders in the Company with a greater understanding of performance and operations at Oyu Tolgoi. The measure of cash operating costs excludes: depreciation and depletion; exploration and evaluation; charges for asset write-down (including write-down of materials and supplies inventory), and includes management services payments to Rio Tinto, and management services payments to Turquoise Hill which are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements of the Company. C1 cash costs C1 cash costs is a metric representing the cash cost per unit of extracting and processing the Company's principal metal product to a condition in which it may be delivered to customers, net of by-product credits. It is provided in order to support peer group comparability and to provide investors and other stakeholders useful information about the underlying cash costs of Oyu Tolgoi and the impact of by-product credits on the operations' cost structure. C1 cash costs are relevant to understanding the Company's operating profitability and ability to generate cash flow. When calculating costs associated with producing a pound of copper, the Company includes gold and silver revenue credits as the production cost is reduced as a result of selling these by-products. Turquoise Hill's principal metal product is copper, and C1 cash costs are reported for Oyu Tolgoi only. All-in sustaining costs All-in sustaining costs (AISC) is an extended cash based cost metric, providing further information on the aggregate cash, capital and overhead outlay per unit, and is intended to reflect the costs of producing the Company's principal metal product over the life-cycle of its operations. The measure seeks to reflect the full cost of copper production from current operations and as a result development project capital is not included. AISC allows Turquoise Hill to assess the ability of Oyu Tolgoi to support sustaining capital expenditures for future production from the generation of operating cash flows. QUALIFIED PERSON Disclosure of a scientific or technical nature in this MD&A in respect of the Oyu Tolgoi mine was prepared under the supervision of Bernard Peters (responsibility for overall preparation and mineral reserves), B. Eng. (Mining), FAusIMM (201743), employed by OreWin as Technical Director - Mining and Kendall Cole-Rae (responsibility for mineral resources, geology and exploration), B.Sc.
