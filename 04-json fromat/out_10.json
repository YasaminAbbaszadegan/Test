With Mississauga's 12 councillors totalling $95,676 in expenses, Brampton's seven councillors with $35,694 and Caledon's five councillors totalling $74,082, Caledon's average spending per councillor sits at approximately $14,000 per elected representative, with Mississauga averaging $8,000 and Brampton, $5,000. Charitable donations, event tickets and meals were among the next most popular expense claims, after travel to conferences, with $14,066.35 spent on charitable donations and event tickets, and one of Caledon's councillors expensing approximately $3,800 on more than 80 meals. Mayor Allan Thompson took the lead submitting receipts for $6,765.70 for charities and events, according to documents obtained by The Enterprise. Thompson's list includes $1,500 for Silver Sponsorship for Caledon Community Services, $1,000 for the Innis Lake Dance fundraiser for Caledon Meals on Wheels, including $151.96 for another Meals on Wheels fundraiser, $500 for the \"sponsorship of a multicultural festival,\" $750 to the V-Oscars, $500 for Catholic Family Services, $400 for a Peel Federation of Agriculture donation, $150 for the Caledon Parent Child Centre's \"Laugh Out Loud\" event, $250 to the MacVille Public School \"Spread the Net\" donation, $113.42 for a Big Brothers Big Sisters event and more. Ward councillors were also charitable, with similar lists of where they donated taxpayer money. Ward 1 Regional Coun. Barb Shaughnessy gave $90 for two different Peel Federation of Agriculture donations, expensed two tickets to the S.H.A.R.E. Agriculture Foundation Dinner and Dance, $137.50 to Family Transition Place and $125 for a ticket to the Innis Lake Dance. Ward 5 Regional Coun. Annette Groves handed out $137.50 to Family Transition Place as well, and $80 for the S.H.A.R.E. dinner. She sponsored a \"multicultural festival\" for $100 and the Pink Ribbon Event for the same amount in two different years. For two years of the Caledon Meals on Wheels Innis Lake Dance, she expensed three tickets at $375 as well as tickets for a women, wine and wellness event, a business excellence awards, a D.A.R.E. kids annual golf classic, a Chamber of Commerce stars celebration, a heart-to-heart foundation event and her ticket for the Che's Place first gala. Ward 2 Regional Coun. Johanna Downey expensed $137.50 for Family Transition Place, $284.31 for Milk and Cookies with Santa, $250 for Catholic Family Services and $50 for the PFA Farm Family Event before adding $1,500 for silver sponsorship of Caledon Community Services and $1,500 in tickets to the Caledon Community Services Home Holiday Gala, and more than $600 for tickets to a United Way event, a Caledon Heritage Foundation event and a charity golf tournament. Ward 3 and 4 Regional Coun. Jennifer Innis gave $50 to the PFA farm family event, $137.50 to Family Transition Place and $90.40 for the TRCA's Light up the Night, as well as small donations to Catholic Family Services, and the PFA and tickets to women's events and volunteer galas, including $375 in sponsorship of the V-Oscars Award gala. \"I feel that it is very important to support local charities and community organizations that provide valuable and critical service to our residents,\" Innis said about council driven charitable donations. \"In my role as a regional councillor I am often requested to attend events and I am proud to support the good work of organizations such as, the Family Transition Place.\" Thompson said promotion and attendance at community functions and events is a part of the mayor's office, and legitimate expenses are a cost of doing business. \"This is important because these organizations provide critical and needed programs and services to our residents,\" he wrote in an email. \"From time-to-time I use corporate gifts as a way to further acknowledge constituent achievement or as prizes or auction items for community events.\" Many of the councillors' support of events was done by simple attendance and ticket purchase. When it came to expensing their own meals however, one councillor led the way by a wide margin. Ward 5 Regional Coun. Annette Groves expensed more than 86 meals with residents and other councillors, including a \"meal for resident meeting\" a \"meal for traffic concerns on Highway 50\" and a \"meal for problems on roundabout\" as examples of the submitted descriptions. Some of the meal receipts are higher than others ($77.38 expensed on March 28, 2015 for a meal for \"new garbage collection program\", $82.94 on March 13, 2016 for a meal for Bolton summer construction and $352.09 for a Sept. 6, 2016 meal for youth programming services). Some include alcohol ($29.10 expensed for a meal at De Paolo Trattoria with Ward 3 and 4 Regional Coun. Innis on Aug. 11, 2015 to discuss facilitation included a taxpayer funded glass of Pinot Grigio for $7.) But all of them are necessary, Groves said. \"With regards to constituent and stakeholder meetings, I have always prided myself on being accessible to the public and the residents of my ward. Whether this be at their home, or over a coffee or lunch, my approach has consistently been to work closely with the public and to be responsive to their concerns,\" Groves said in an email. Groves expensed a total of approximately $1,200 worth of meals between the beginning of the term in Dec., 2014 to March 31, 2016, with that total growing to $3,790.64 for expenses posted from the beginning of this term to March of 2017."}, {"title": "Braingrid and Ample Organics Announce a Strategic Partnership", "article": "TORONTO, May 23, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Ample Organics Inc., the most widely adopted enterprise seed-to-sale cannabis platform in Canada, and Braingrid Corporation, a provider of affordable, scalable, and rapidly deployable sensor platforms for precision agriculture, today announced a strategic partnership to enhance Ample Organics' customer offering.

U.S. President Donald J. Trump made trade headlines recently when his administration indicated he was considering a draft executive order to withdraw the U.S. from the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Hours later, the White House issued a statement saying this was no longer the case, following calls President Trump had subsequently taken with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto. In the White House statement President Trump agreed \"not to terminate NAFTA at this time\" and indicated his Canadian and Mexican counterparts agreed to enable the renegotiation of the agreement. Trump went on to say he believes \"the end result will make all three countries stronger and better.\" The CCA says the Canadian beef sector is not afraid of NAFTA negotiation or Trump trade positions. The CCA has strong relationships with its U.S. counterparts based on mutually beneficial trade. A renegotiation of NAFTA provides potential opportunity for Canada to address some regulatory issues, according to the CCA. The CCA says it's continuing to advocate Canada use every opportunity to draw attention in the U.S. to the importance of Canada-U.S. trade. The association believes rhetoric about withdrawing from NAFTA is premature and is negotiating posture at most. HOG MARKETS Abnormal price seasonality in U.S. hog markets CME Group reports U.S. hog prices have been eroding since mid-February of this year. Since mid-February, the national weekly average base carcass price for slaughter barrow and gilts has declined by US$12.73 per cwt. as reported by USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service. The normal seasonal price pattern over that time frame is for a rather steady market (like 2016's) to slightly higher. The Lean Hog contract for June delivery peaked during the week of 13 February and then dropped $10.95 to a close for the week of 17 April of $68.33 per cwt. During the last week in April, the June Lean Hog Futures contract rebounded $5.75 per cwt., closing at $74.00. Spot market hog carcass values for the last week in April were calculated by USDA-AMS to be close to $60, so the spread between spot market values and the June futures suggests more than a 20 per cent appreciation in U.S. hog carcass values in the next four to six weeks. Over the same six-week period of 2011-2015, hog carcass prices, basis the national weighted average base price increased by 5 per cent, CME Group says. Last year, U.S. hog carcass values in the same market increased 12 per cent during the comparable six weeks. According to CME Group, U.S. hog slaughter has declined a bit less than is normal since the first of this calendar year. That has contributed to the seasonal price pattern that has developed so far in 2017. As is typical, hog slaughter levels are forecast to drop into summer months, how much of a relative decline occurs is a key driver of the seasonal price rally. In terms of the U.S. meat market, all of the pork primal components of the cutout value tend to post their highest prices in the summer, when supply is lowest. The pork belly was the primal that garnered lots of attention earlier this year as prices spiked up, but it came down quickly. U.S. FARM BANKS INCREASE LENDING Farm banks in the U.S. increased agricultural lending by 5.3 per cent in 2016 and held $103.4 billion in farm loans at the end of the year, according to the American Bankers Association's annual Farm Bank Performance Report. Asset quality remained healthy at the nation's 1,912 farm banks as non-performing loans fell to a prerecession level of 0.54 per cent of total loans. \"We're continuing to see a decline in farm income, but the good news is farm banks are in good shape to assist their farm and ranch customers as the ag economy takes a turn,\" said Brittany Kleinpaste, director, economic policy and research at ABA. \"Banks hold nearly half of all farm loans and will remain an important source of ag credit in good times and bad.\" Kleinpaste said the entire U.S. banking industry -not just farm banks - provides American farmers and ranchers with the credit they need. At the end of 2016, banks held $176 billion in farm and ranch loans. Small and micro loans made up almost half of bank agricultural lending with nearly $75 billion in small and micro farm and ranch loans on the books at the end of 2016. Farm banks continued to build high-quality capital over the year, the report said. Equity capital at farm banks increased 3.7 per cent to $48.4 billion in 2016, while Tier 1 capital increased by $2.6 billion to $45.9 billion. American farm banks have built strong high-quality capital reserves and are well insulated from risks associated with the agricultural sector. In addition, more than 97 per cent of U.S. farm banks were profitable in 2016, with 60 per cent reporting an increase in earnings. FOOD PROCESSING STILL A BRIGHT SPOT Farm Credit Canada reports food processing remains one of the economic bright spots within the Canadian manufacturing sector, Bruce Cochrane writes on The Pig Site. Cochrane says FCC has analyzed the importance of Canada's food and beverage exports to the Canadian economy. The food and beverage sector includes any type of primary farm product that's processed to some degree before being sold domestically or exported. J.P. Gervais, FCC's chief agricultural economist, said the growth of food manufacturing in Canada has outpaced all other manufacturing sectors as well as any other sector of the economy. Gervais made the following comment: \"Really the values depend on what sector we are talking about. \"In some cases we're going to have further processing and then we're able to add a lot of value domestically before the end product has been shipped elsewhere. \"Food manufacturing itself is the largest employer in the manufacturing sector so, when it comes to manufacturing, which has gone through a lot of different challenges since 2008 and 2009 with the global recession, you've seen the manufacturing base in Canada shrink quite a bit. \"Where as, if you look at food manufacturing, we've been resilient through the recession and now since at least two years, the food manufacturing sector has grown quite a bit in Canada, at an amazing pace and that's the result of very strong food demand in the world as well as domestically. \"Everybody gains from having strong; solid performing food manufacturing and that includes producers as well as retailers. \"So the importance of the food manufacturing base for us in Canada is absolutely critical to develop, continue to grow our farming sector as well has having it performing in a retail sector that employs many Canadians.\" Gervais added the pace of growth in food manufacturing in Canada has kept pace with growth in food manufacturing worldwide. He suggests there's potential to keep even more of the commodities produced on Canadian farms within its borders, add value to them and sell them to the world. MONSANTO TERMINATES PRECISION PLANTING SALE AGREEMENT The Climate Corporation, a subsidiary of Monsanto Company, recently announced Monsanto's termination of their agreement with Deere & Company for the acquisition of the Precision Planting LLC equipment business. The agreement was announced in November 2015, and closing has been delayed by the U.S. Department of Justice's concerns with the transaction. The Climate Corporation made the strategic decision nearly 18 months ago to focus its business exclusively on its digital agriculture platform, and that strategy has not changed, a news release says. The company intends to sell the Precision Planting equipment business and has spoken with several third parties that have expressed interest in purchasing it. John Deere also announced their termination of the Digital Ag Connectivity agreement with The Climate Corporation. The Climate Corporation says it remains committed to enabling seamless field data collection from multiple equipment types and software systems into its Climate Field-View digital agriculture platform."}, {"title": "Press Release: AgJunction Reports First Quarter 2017 Earnings Results", "article": "AgJunction Reports First Quarter 2017 Earnings Results Canada NewsWire HIAWATHA, KS, May 10, 2017 HIAWATHA, KS, May 10, 2017 /CNW/ - AgJunction Inc. (TSX: AJX) (\"AgJunction\" or the \"Company\"), a leader in automated steering and machine control technology for precision agriculture, today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. All currency amounts are expressed in U.S. dollars. First Quarter 2017 Financial Summary vs. First Quarter 2016  Management Commentary \"Our first quarter results demonstrate our ability to drive incremental cash flow despite a continued weak global agriculture industry backdrop, \" said Dave Vaughn, president and CEO of AgJunction. \"Our strategic agreement with Hemisphere GNSS during the quarter, as well as an improvement in operating margins and continued effective balance sheet management, drove strong free cash flow generation in the seasonally strongest quarter of our year. \"While sales in the quarter remained down slightly on a year-over-year basis, increased order flow that began in late 2016 continued in our first quarter, resulting in sales that exceeded our expectations. This is reflected in our strong inventory reduction and improved working capital position. \"For the remainder of 2017, we will continue to leverage our strong patent portfolio and improved balance sheet to drive creative business opportunities, while delivering products and technology that best suit our clients' needs. Given this strategy, along with our deep industry expertise, we believe we remain well-positioned to help our customers capitalize on the evolving agriculture market.\" First Quarter 2017 Financial Results Total sales in the first quarter of 2017 decreased to $14.6 million compared to $15.5 million in the first quarter of 2016 due to continued softness in the agriculture market. Gross profit in the first quarter of 2017 increased slightly to $6.8 million compared to $6.7 million in the first quarter of 2016. Gross margin increased to 46.8% compared to 43.1% in the first quarter of 2016. The increase was due to a Novariant inventory fair value step up expense in the year-ago quarter that did not reoccur, as well as lower year-over-year compensation, freight, supplies and variance account costs. Total operating expenses declined 3% to $6.2 million compared to $6.4 million in the first quarter of 2016 due to lower employee compensation costs. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses were 42.6% compared to 41.4% in the first quarter of 2016. Net income in the first quarter increased to $3.6 million or $0.03 per diluted share, compared to $0.2 million or $0.00 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily due to $3.0 million of interest and other income associated with the Company's entry into a strategic agreement with Hemisphere GNSS, Inc. (Hemisphere), a world-class provider of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) technology. AgJunction received a one-time payment of $3.0 million in exchange for releasing Hemisphere from a license restriction that prevented them from selling their GNSS products directly into the global agricultural market. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of 2017 was $4.1 million compared to $0.7 million in the first quarter of 2016. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the first quarter of 2017 totaled $16.0 million compared to $12.9 million at the end of 2016. The increase was primarily driven by the payment from Hemisphere. The Company continues to carry no debt. Working capital was $26.7 million, up from $22.4 million at the end of 2016.

The $1-million grant is a renewal from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council and will allow Mike Duncan and his team to continue working on the Research Crop Portal, a project he started roughly 10 years ago. He described the portal as a tool for people in the agricultural community to use to collect and compile data from precision agriculture. Precision agriculture, or sitespecific farming, is about figuring out which crop will thrive where and why, how much fertilizer it might need over another area on the same field, and other such intricacies of farming. With the help of sensors to collect the data and the portal which the data is fed into, farmers can get a better idea of how to maximize their work. \"This is kind of the perfect tool for walking through that mine field,\" said Duncan of the nitty gritty details of agriculture. When it began, he said the portal was for storing the data, but now the program can help someone in the agricultural industry use that data to improve their farm practices. He said he's a agricultural physicist, not an agronomist, so he doesn't have that same knowledgebase, but he said the team consults agronomists to make sure the tools they are putting into the portal are relevant and useable. In its present research stage, Duncan said there are 40 to 50 farmers using the portal, as well as a few companies and consultants. The Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs is also on board with this tool, he said, and they are collaborating with other colleges as well. The list is growing day-by-day as more people are learning about the technology and its benefits. Duncan said when they receive a call from an interested party, the team gives a walk-through of the program and how to use it to get the best results. He said some farmers are looking for an even more streamlined functionality for which they can just press a button and the program will do all the work - but the project isn't there yet. He did say though, \"I think the technology has an awful lot to offer in how you can farm.\" He said the $1-million grant will allow his team to continue its research and continue to refine the tool. People who are interested in using the Research Crop Portal can call the college at 905-735-2211 and ask for him, he said. lbarton@postmedia.com"}, {"title": "Press Release: Agrium to present at the BMO Capital Markets 12th Annual Farm to Market Conference", "article": "Agrium to present at the BMO Capital Markets 12th Annual Farm to Market Conference CALGARY, AB--(Marketwired - May 02, 2017) - Agrium Inc.

(TSX: AGU) (NYSE: AGU) announced today its 2017 first quarter results, with a net loss to equity holders of Agrium of $11-million ($0.08 diluted loss per share) compared to net earnings to equity holders of $2-million ($0.02 diluted earnings per share) in the first quarter of 2016. The reduction in net earnings was driven primarily by higher natural gas prices and lower phosphate prices relative to the first quarter of 2016. Highlights:  \"The first quarter is the seasonally slowest quarter for our business and the wet weather in March compounded this. The spring application and planting season is now underway and we expect solid first half results, even with the shift in acres this year from corn to soybeans and cotton in the U.S.,\" commented Chuck Magro, Agrium's President and CEO. \"Integration preparations for the pending merger with PotashCorp are progressing well and we remain confident in delivering the $500-million in annual operating synergies and completing the deal by mid-year,\" added Mr. Magro. (1) Effective tax rate of 27.5 percent for the first quarter of 2017 was used for the adjusted net loss, guidance relevant loss and per share calculations. These are non-IFRS measures which represent net earnings (loss) adjusted for certain income (expenses) that are considered to be non-operational in nature. We believe these measures provide meaningful comparison to the earnings (loss) of other companies and our guidance by eliminating share-based payments expense (recovery), gains (losses) on foreign exchange and related gains (losses) on non-qualifying derivative hedges and significant non-operating, non-recurring items. Our guidance is forward-looking information. We present guidance relevant earnings (loss) per share to provide an update to this previously disclosed forward-looking information. These should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS and may not be directly comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.

Market Outlook Agriculture and Crop Input Fundamentals  Nitrogen  Potash  1 May 2017 17:46 ET Press Release: Agrium Reports First Quarter -2- Phosphate  2017 Annual guidance Based on our assumptions set out under the heading \"Market Outlook\", Agrium expects to achieve annual diluted earnings per share of $4.75 to $5.75 in 2017 compared to our previous estimate of $4.50 to $6.00 per share. We have narrowed the range width encompassing approximately $200-million of EBITDA variability. We are issuing earnings guidance of $3.75 to $4.25 diluted earnings per share for the first half of 2017. We maintain our Retail EBITDA range of $1.125-billion to $1.225-billion while our Retail crop nutrient sales volumes are now expected to range between 10.0 million and 10.4 million tonnes in 2017. Based on our utilization rate for our nitrogen assets, we maintain our nitrogen production range of 3.6 million to 3.8 million tonnes.Our earnings per share guidance assumes NYMEX gas prices will be between $3.10 and $3.60 per MMBtu in 2017. Agrium's expectation for potash production in 2017 remains between 2.4 million and 2.8 million tonnes. Total capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $600-million to $700-million, of which approximately $450-million to $500-million is expected to be sustaining capital expenditures. Agrium's annual effective tax rate for 2017 is expected to range between 27 to 29 percent. This guidance and updated additional measures and related assumptions are summarized in the table below. Guidance excludes the impact of share-based payments expense (recovery), gains (losses) on foreign exchange and non-qualifying derivative hedges, and merger related costs.

The variance was primarily due to:  FINANCIAL CONDITION The following are changes to working capital on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Agrium generally expects that it will be able to meet its working capital requirements, capital resource needs and shareholder returns through a variety of sources, including available cash on hand, cash provided by operations, short-term borrowings from the issuance of commercial paper, and borrowings from our credit facilities, as well as long-term debt and equity capacity from the capital markets. As of March 31, 2017, we have sufficient current assets to meet our current liabilities. Summary of Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Below is a summary of our cash provided by or used in operating, investing and financing activities as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:  1 May 2017 17:46 ET Press Release: Agrium Reports First Quarter -6-  (a) This excludes capitalized borrowing costs. (b) This represents business acquisitions and includes acquired working capital; property, plant and equipment; intangibles; goodwill; and investments in associates and joint ventures.  Short-term Debt  Capital Management  OUTSTANDING SHARE DATA Agrium had 138,176,418 outstanding shares at April 28, 2017. At April 28, 2017, the number of shares issuable pursuant to stock options outstanding (issuable assuming full conversion, where each option granted can be exercised for one common share) was approximately 1,381,612.  The agricultural products business is seasonal. Consequently, year-over-year comparisons are more appropriate than quarter-over-quarter comparisons. Crop input sales are primarily concentrated in the spring and fall crop input application seasons. Crop nutrient inventories are normally accumulated leading up to each application season. Our cash collections from accounts receivables generally occur after the application season is complete, and our customer prepayments are concentrated in December and January. NON-IFRS FINANCIAL MEASURES Financial measures that are not specified, defined or determined under IFRS are non-IFRS measures unless they are presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The following table outlines our non-IFRS financial measures, their definitions and why management uses the measures.  1 May 2017 17:46 ET Press Release: Agrium Reports First Quarter -7-  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES We prepare our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with IFRS, which requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates in applying accounting policies.

According to news reporting out of Truro, Canada, by VerticalNews editors, research stated, \"An automated sensing and control system (hardware and software) was developed for real-time spot-application of granular fertilizer in mowed wild blueberry fields. The custom hardware system was incorporated into a commercial pneumatic granular fertilizer spreader.\" Financial supporters for this research include Oxford Frozen Foods, Agri-Futures Nova Scotia Association, Wild Blueberry Producers Association of Nova Scotia, Nova Scotia Department of Agriculture, Technology Development Program. Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Dalhousie University, \"Custom software for the sensing and control system was developed by combining color co-occurrence matrix based texture analysis and g-ratio algorithms in C++ to acquire and process images in real-time to differentiate mowed wild blueberry plants from bare spots and weeds. The performance accuracy of the spot-applicable fertilizer spreader was evaluated both in laboratory simulation and real-time field tests. Simulation results reported that the accuracy of the developed system was 94.9 %. Real-time field tests reported that the system produced acceptable results at ground speeds of 1.6 and 3.2 km h(-1) for the spot-application of fertilizer at target areas (in plant areas only) within the field. Results also indicated that the ground speed of 4.8 km h(-1) was unacceptable, which could be due to blurred images at high speed and surface unevenness of the wild blueberry field.\" According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Spot-application of fertilizer using the modified fertilizer spreader could save fertilizer for the wild blueberry producers.\" Our news journalists report that additional information may be obtained by contacting Q.U.

Summary results The following results are presented on an adjusted basis (1) to include the company's share of its joint venture operations on a proportionate basis, because this is the basis on which management bases its operating decisions and performance. For a reconciliation to the results in accordance with international financial reporting standards (IFRS), refer to the company's management's discussion and analysis (MD&A).  Overall results for Glacier for the year ended Dec. 31, 2016, were encouraging in light of the many challenges faced in the year. Adjusted consolidated EBITDA, including the company's share of its joint venture interests, increased to $32.2-million for the year ended Dec. 31, 2016, compared with $32.1-million in the prior year. Increases in EBITDA were achieved despite significantly reduced revenue and weaker energy and commodity markets in Western Canada, which had an overall effect on Glacier's results. EBITDA growth occurred across a variety of the company's business information divisions. Additionally, the company's community media operations generated EBITDA increases as a result of the successful restructuring of newspaper and printing operations and growth in digital revenue and profitability. Depressed energy and commodity prices continue to weigh on the Western Canadian economy and certain operations of the company. Glacier's energy information business and community media operations, particularly in the Prairies, continue to face challenges. Adjusted consolidated revenue was $236.1-million for the year ended Dec. 31, 2016, compared with $260.0-million in the prior year. Revenue continues to be affected by the maturing community media industry, along with the weak energy and commodity markets. A number of the business information divisions had increased revenue compared with the prior year, including environmental and property information, agricultural information, and financial information. Approximately $7.7-million of the revenue decline was due to the closure of the Printwest printing plant and consolidation. Digital community media revenues have performed well in comparison with traditional community media revenues. During the year ended Dec. 31, 2016, the company completed a rights offering, raising net proceeds of $13.2-million, all of which was used to reduce the company's senior debt. The rights offering was undertaken to reduce financial leverage by paying down bank debt, thereby allowing sufficient free cash flow from operations to be available to support investments in the company's operating businesses and to pay down additional debt as required, from time to time. Operational strategy and focus Glacier's core focus is to operate as an information and marketing solutions company pursuing growth in sectors where the provision of essential information and related services provides high customer utility and value. Through its brands and operations, Glacier serves clients in four business information verticals and through community media operations: - Agricultural information -- Glacier FarmMedia (GFM): Western Producer Publications, Farm Business Communications, Canada's Outdoor Farm Show, Ag In Motion and Weather INnovations Network (WIN); - Energy and mining information -- JuneWarren-Nickle's Energy Group (including CanOils) (JWN), Evaluate Energy, Northern Miner Group and Infomine (50-per-cent interest); - Environmental and property information -- Environmental Risk Information Services (ERIS), Specialty Technical Publishers (STP) and the REW website; - Financial information -- Fundata (50-per-cent interest); - Community media -- local daily and weekly newspapers and related publications, websites and digital products in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec and the United States (including direct, joint venture and other interests). Operational overview Business information Business information's adjusted consolidated revenue decreased to $94.9-million for the year ended Dec. 31, 2016, compared with $96.6-million in the prior year. Declines in energy and mining advertising revenue affected the group over all. Business information's adjusted consolidated EBITDA decreased to $18.4-million for the year ended Dec. 31, 2016, compared with $20.7-million for in the prior year. Excluding the operational losses in energy and mining information, Glacier's business information operations had increased adjusted revenue of 5.8 per cent or $4.5-million over the prior year, and adjusted EBITDA increased 7.0 per cent or $1.4-million over the prior year. Agricultural information Conditions in the agricultural sector remain soft with low commodity prices and increasing industry consolidation. Despite this, certain operations within GFM grew during the year, largely due to two successful outdoor farm demonstration shows held during the year. Combined, the shows experienced significant increases in both the number of exhibitors and attendance, which resulted in significant increases in both revenue and profit. WIN continued a strong growth path aided by the agricultural industry's continuing acceptance of data and precision agriculture technologies. During the year, WIN expanded operations in the European Union and commenced the deployment of a United Kingdom-based weather network for the Food and Environment Research Agency, a U.K. Crown corporation. Energy and mining information Market conditions within both the energy and mining sectors remained very challenging in 2016. The company implemented substantial cost-reduction programs and focused operations. Despite the difficult market conditions, the company continued to invest in key subscription and database products such as the Daily Oil Bulletin, Canoils, Edumine and IntelligenceMine. Revenues in these products have held up relatively better than advertising revenues and will position the company well when the cyclical downturns end. Environmental and property information The environmental and property operations continue to experience solid revenue growth, adding a number of new customers during the year. Operating investments continue to be made to allow ERIS to scale to the next revenue tier and maintain strong product quality. The tangible benefits of these investments, along with increased profits, expect to be realized over the coming year. The REW website, the company's on-line real estate portal, continued to grow rapidly. In 2016, traffic grew by more than 80 per cent compared with the prior year, with visits exceeding 18 million in the year. Improved features and products for customers resulted in a more than doubling of revenues. Financial information Fundata experienced growth through continued investment in new products and offerings. During the year, Fundata successfully launched a new mutual fund point-of-sale compliance offering, landing contracts with two large Canadian financial institutions. Community media Community media's adjusted consolidated revenue decreased to $141.3-million for the year ended Dec. 31, 2016, from $163.4-million in the prior year. Community media's adjusted consolidated EBITDA increased to $21.8-million for the year ended Dec. 31, 2016, from $20.3-million in the prior year. Revenue declines within community media were driven by a combination of planned closures and restructurings, the maturing nature of print advertising, and the effect of continued weak commodity prices in many Western Canadian communities. The total rate of revenue decline was lower in the later months of 2016 than earlier in the year. Additionally, digital community media revenues grew substantially as compared with last year. EBITDA increased in the year as a result of the continued realization of savings from the restructurings implemented throughout 2015 and 2016 and the relatively better revenue picture. In many cases, the restructurings have resulted in improved products for both readers and advertisers as fewer but more substantial editions are published. Financial position At Dec. 31, 2016, senior debt was $43.7-million. During 2016, the company made net repayments of $17.2-million of senior debt, of which a portion came from the issuance of shares pursuant to the rights offering. Subsequent to year-end, the company also repaid $3.1-million of debt, partly from the sale of non-core assets. On an adjusted basis, Glacier's consolidated debt net of cash outstanding before deferred financing charges was 1.68 times trailing 12-month EBITDA as at Dec. 31, 2016. Outlook Near-term uncertainty and market risk continue, especially given the continuing effect of weak energy and commodity market conditions on the Western Canadian economy. Elements of both of the company's segments, business information and community media, will continue to be negatively affected. The company remains confident in the longer-term outlook for the energy and mining information sectors, and a rebound in the mining sector appears to be under way. The company continues to invest in its business information operations that offer, and are demonstrating, substantial growth. These include ERIS, the REW website, STP, Fundata, WIN and the agricultural exhibitions. The company also continues to invest in and improve the value of its energy and mining database and subscription offerings, positioning itself for when the cyclical downturns reverse. Within community media, cost-savings initiatives from substantial restructurings, implemented throughout 2015 and 2016, continue to benefit the bottom line. Just as importantly, many of these restructurings strengthened the businesses by creating more efficient operations with improved offerings for both readers and advertisers. A relatively better revenue picture within a number of the operations provides some evidence of the better offerings. Given the varied outlook, management plans to continue the progress of the last few years in strengthening the company's financial position by further reducing debt. A strengthened balance sheet will mitigate risk while allowing the continuing and planned operational and capital investments. These investments are necessary to continue the strong growth in a number of the company's businesses that are creating real shareholder value. Management would like to thank the entire Glacier staff and its partners for their continued dedication and hard work. The results and continuing transformation and strengthening of the business are due to their efforts. Management would also like to thank the board of directors for its valuable guidance and support over the past year.

Summary results Overall results for GVIC Communications for the year ended Dec. 31, 2016, were encouraging in light of the many challenges faced in the year. Adjusted consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), including the company's share of its joint venture interests, increased to $33.0-million for the year ended Dec. 31, 2016, compared with $32.9-million in the prior year. Increases in EBITDA were achieved despite significantly reduced revenue and weaker energy and commodity markets in Western Canada, which had an overall effect on GVIC's results. EBITDA growth occurred across a variety of the company's business information divisions. Additionally, the company's community media operations generated EBITDA increases as a result of the successful restructuring of newspaper and printing operations and growth in digital revenue and profitability. Depressed energy and commodity prices continue to weigh on the Western Canadian economy and certain operations of the company. GVIC's energy information business and community media operations, particularly in the Prairies, continue to face challenges. Adjusted consolidated revenue was $236.1-million for the year ended Dec. 31, 2016, compared with $260.0-million in the prior year. Revenue continues to be impacted by the maturing community media industry, along with the weak energy and commodity markets. A number of the business information divisions had increased revenue compared with prior year, including environmental and property information, agricultural information, and financial information. Approximately $7.7-million of the revenue decline was due to the closure of the Printwest printing plant and consolidation. Digital community media revenues have performed well in comparison with traditional community media revenues. Operational strategy and focus GVIC's core focus is to operate as an information and marketing solutions company pursuing growth in sectors where the provision of essential information and related services provides high customer utility and value. Through its brands and operations, GVIC serves clients in four business information verticals and through community media operations: - Agricultural information: FarmMedia (GFM): Western Producer Publications, Farm Business Communications, Canada's Outdoor Farm Show, Ag In Motion and Weather INnovations Network (WIN); - Energy and mining information: JuneWarren-Nickle's Energy Group (including CanOils) (JWN), Evaluate Energy, Information Northern Miner Group and Infomine (50 per cent interest); - Environmental and property information: ERIS (environmental risk information services), Specialty Technical Publishers (STP) and the REW website; - Financial information: Fundata (50-per-cent interest); - Community media: local daily and weekly newspapers and related publications, websites, and digital products in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec and the United States (includes direct, joint venture and other interests). Operational overview Business information Business information's adjusted consolidated revenue decreased to $94.9-million for the year ended Dec. 31, 2016, compared with $96.6-million in the prior year. Declines in energy and mining advertising revenue affected the group over all. Business information's adjusted consolidated EBITDA decreased to $18.4-million for the year ended Dec. 31, 2016, compared with $20.7-million for in the prior year. Excluding the operational losses in energy and mining information, GVIC's business information operations had increased adjusted revenue of 5.8 per cent or $4.5-million over the prior year, and adjusted EBITDA increased 7.0 per cent or $1.4-million over the prior year. Agricultural information: - Conditions in the agricultural sector remain soft with low commodity prices and increasing industry consolidation. Despite this, certain operations within GFM grew during the year, largely due to two successful outdoor farm demonstration shows held during the year. Combined, the shows experienced significant increases in both the number of exhibitors and attendance, which resulted in significant increases in both revenue and profit. - WIN continued a strong growth path aided by the agricultural industry's continuing acceptance of data and precision agriculture technologies. During the year, WIN expanded operations in the European Union and commenced the deployment of a weather network, based in the United Kingdom, for the Food and Environment Research Agency, a U.K. Crown corporation. Energy and mining information: - Market conditions within both the energy and mining sectors remained very challenging in 2016. The company implemented substantial cost reduction programs and focused operations. Despite the difficult market conditions, the company continued to invest in key subscription and database products such as the Daily Oil Bulletin, Canoils, Edumine and IntelligenceMine. Revenues in these products have held up relatively better than advertising revenues and will position the company well when the cyclical downturns end. Environmental and property information: - The environmental and property operations continue to experience solid revenue growth, adding a number of new customers during the year. Operating investments continue to be made to allow ERIS to scale to the next revenue tier and maintain strong product quality. The tangible benefits of these investments, along with increased profits, expect to be realized over the coming year. - REW, the company's on-line real estate portal, continued to grow rapidly. Two thousand sixteen traffic grew by more than 80 per cent versus the prior year with visits exceeding 18 million in the year. Improved features and products for customers resulted in a more than doubling of revenues. Financial information: - Fundata experienced growth through continued investment in new products and offerings. During the year, Fundata launched a new mutual fund point-of-sale compliance offering, landing contracts with two large Canadian financial institutions. Community media Community media's adjusted consolidated revenue decreased to $141.3-million for the year ended Dec. 31, 2016, from $163.4-million in the prior year. Community media's adjusted consolidated EBITDA increased to $21.8-million for the year ended Dec. 31, 2016, from $20.3-million in the prior year. - Revenue declines within community media were driven by a combination of planned closure and restructuring, the maturing nature of print advertising and the impact of continued weak commodity prices in many Western Canadian communities. The total rate of revenue decline was lower in the later months of 2016 than earlier in the year. Additionally, digital community media revenues grew substantially as compared with last year. - EBITDA increased in the year as a result of the continued realization of savings from the restructurings implemented throughout 2015 and 2016 and the relatively better revenue picture. In many cases, the restructurings have resulted in improved products for both readers and advertisers as fewer but more substantial editions are published. Financial position At Dec. 31, 2016, senior debt was $43.7-million. During 2016, the company made net repayments of $17.2-million of senior debt. Subsequent to year-end, the company also repaid $3.1-million of debt, partly from the sale of non-core assets. On an adjusted basis, GVIC's consolidated debt net of cash outstanding before deferred financing charges was 2.69 times trailing 12-month EBITDA as at Dec. 31, 2016.  Outlook Near-term uncertainty and market risk continue, especially given the continuing impact of weak energy and commodity market conditions on the Western Canadian economy. Elements of both of the company's segments, business information and community media, will continue to be negatively impacted. The company remains confident in the longer-term outlook for the energy and mining information sectors, and a rebound in the mining sector appears to be under way. The company continues to invest in its business information operations, which offer, and are demonstrating, substantial growth. These include ERIS, REW, STP, Fundata, WIN and the agricultural exhibitions. The company also continues to invest in and improve the value of its energy and mining database and subscription offerings, positioning itself for when the cyclical downturns reverse. Within community media, cost-saving initiatives from substantial restructurings, implemented throughout 2015 and 2016, continue to benefit the bottom line. As importantly, many of these restructurings strengthened the businesses by creating more efficient operations with improved offerings for both readers and advertisers. A relatively better revenue picture within a number of the operations provides some evidence of the better offerings.

About the Company: Glacier Media Inc. is an information & marketing solutions company pursuing growth in sectors where the provision of essential information and related services provides high customer utility and value. Glacier's strategy is implemented through two operational areas: content and marketing solutions; and data, analytics and intelligence. Financial Measures To supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, Glacier uses certain non-IFRS measures that may be different from the performance measures used by other companies. These non-IFRS measures include cash flow from operations (before changes in non-cash operating accounts and non-recurring items), net income attributable to common shareholders before non-recurring items, net income from continuing operation attributable to common shareholders before non-recurring items, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and all 'adjusted' measures which are not alternatives to IFRS financial measures. Management focuses on operating cash flow per share as the primary measure of operating profitability, free cash flow and value. EBITDA per share is also an important measure as the Company has low ongoing capital expenditures and depreciation and amortization largely relates to acquisition goodwill and copyrights and does not represent a corresponding sustaining capital expense. These non-IFRS measures do not have any standardized meanings prescribed by IFRS and accordingly they are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. The adjusted consolidated financial results have been adjusted to include the Company's share of revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities from its joint venture operations on a proportionate accounting basis as this is the basis on which management bases its operating decisions and performance evaluation. IFRS does not allow for the inclusion of the joint ventures on a proportionate basis. These results include additional non-IFRS measures such as EBITDA, cash flow from operations and net income attributable to common shareholders before non-recurring items. The adjusted results are not generally accepted measures of financial performance under IFRS. The Company's method of calculating these financial performance measures may differ from other companies and accordingly, they may not be comparable to measures used by other companies. Refer to the MD&A for a reconciliation of these non-IFRS measures and adjusted results.

Werklund and his partner, Susan Norman, have gifted Olds College with $16M, the largest ever personal donation to an Alberta college or technical institution. The tiered donation will have a total cumulative impact of $32M when all leverage opportunities can be realized. Werklund's donation begins with $2M in cash, supplemented by a matching component where Werklund will provide one dollar for every three raised, up to $4M. The final element is a $10M estate gift that will ensure the sustainability of the institute over time. The donation is designed to incent maximum participation and donations from other individuals, industry and governments. This transformational gift will result in the creation of the Werklund Agriculture Institute (WAI) and will specialize in Smart Agriculture. With a vision to be the  world's premier destination for an integrated agricultural leadership learning experience, the WAI will engage students, researchers and industry in smart and sustainable agriculture and agri-business solutions, leadership and education to contribute to Western Canada's leadership position as an agriculture and food powerhouse. \"Mr. Werklund and Ms. Norman's generous donation will accelerate engagement, innovation and technology adoption within the agriculture and food industry, and open up new agriculture enterprise in Alberta and around the world,\" commented Olds College president, Dr. H.J (Tom) Thompson.

On Oct. 15, 2015, AgJunction successfully completed a merger with Novariant Inc., strengthening its position within the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) precision guidance and machine control markets. AgJunction's consolidated fourth quarter and full-year 2016 results are presented as a combined entity. However, the comparative fourth quarter of 2015 includes only partial contribution from Novariant's operations. Fourth quarter 2016 financial summary versus fourth quarter 2015: - Total sales were $8.2-million, compared with $11.6-million. - Gross margin increased to 35.1 per cent, compared with 23.7 per cent. - Net loss was $2.9-million or two cents per share, compared with $9.9-million or nine cents per share. - Adjusted EBITDA (net income before interest and other loss (income), income tax, depreciation, and amortization) was negative $2.4-million, compared with negative $4.5-million. Full-year 2016 financial summary versus full-year 2015: - Total sales were $42.3-million, compared with $39.0-million. - Gross margin increased to 39.1 per cent, compared with 38.0 per cent. - Net loss was $18.2-million or 15 cents per share, compared with $9.1-million or 11 cents per share. - Adjusted EBITDA was negative $4.9-million, compared with negative $2.9-million. Management commentary \"Our fourth quarter and full-year results reflect the weakness in the global agriculture industry,\" said Dave Vaughn, president and chief executive officer of AgJunction. \"We are using this slowdown as an opportunity to reconfigure the company to best serve the needs of our global customer base so that we are ready with the right products when the market inevitably recovers. In fact, we have assembled a dedicated team to answer the demand from global platform producers for vehicle-specific, AgJunction-engineered after-market retrofit kits, and this effort is showing early success with several OEM prospects. \"Our partners continued to integrate our technology 'behind the scenes' in the fourth quarter. For example, one of our top OEM customers adopted our new terminal hardware and integrated our latest innovative software functionality on an assortment of their automatic steering systems. Adoption of this software functionality allows both our customers and AgJunction to expand into emerging markets. \"Looking to 2017, we will continue to focus on delivering products and technology that best suit our clients' needs in both today's market and in the long term. We will also continue to utilize our strong patent portfolio to drive creative new business opportunities as we have done with our recent agreement with Reichhardt GmbH. Given our deep industry experience, innovative product development and strong IP, all supported by our strong balance sheet, we believe we are well positioned to help our customers both today and into the future.\" Fourth quarter 2016 financial results Total sales in the fourth quarter decreased to $8.2-million, compared with $11.6-million in the fourth quarter of 2015, due to continued softening in the agriculture market. Gross profit in the fourth quarter increased slightly to $2.9-million, compared with $2.8-million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Gross margin increased to 35.1 per cent, compared with 23.7 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2015. The fourth quarter of 2015 included one-time reserves of $700,000 relating to inventory designated for early market removal, as well as $600,000 in additional expenses related to fair value increases of Novariant inventory. Total operating expenses declined 27 per cent to $5.7-million, compared with $7.8-million in the fourth quarter of 2015, due to the rationalization of the company's work force since the Novariant acquisition. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses were 69.3 per cent, compared with 66.6 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2015. Net loss in the fourth quarter of 2016 was $2.9-million or two cents per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $9.9-million or nine cents per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter was negative $2.4-million, compared with negative $4.5-million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the fourth quarter totalled $12.9-million, compared with $13.0-million at the end of 2015. The company continues to carry no debt. Working capital was $22.4-million, down slightly from $26.7-million at the end of 2015. Full-year 2016 financial results Total sales in 2016 increased 8 per cent to $42.3-million, compared with $39.0-million in 2015. The increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of Novariant. Gross profit was $16.5-million, compared with $14.8-million in 2015. Gross margin was 39.1 per cent, compared with 38.0 per cent in 2015. The increase in margin was primarily due to fewer overall inventory writedowns on a year-over-year basis and an inventory step-up in 2015 associated with the acquisition of Novariant. Total operating expenses in 2016 increased to $23.4-million, compared with $20.6-million in 2015, due to the full-year impact of Novariant's operations in 2016. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses increased to 55.4 per cent, compared with 52.7 per cent in 2015, due primarily to sales and marketing costs associated with regional expansion and additions to the global customer care team. Net loss in 2016 was $18.2-million or 15 cents per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $9.1-million or 11 cents per diluted share in 2015. Net loss in 2016 included an $11.3-million goodwill impairment. Excluding this non-cash charge, net loss in 2016 was $6.9-million or six cents per share.

Patent Issued for Method of Using a Particulate Material Delivery System to Pneumatically Dispense Seed Product (USPTO 9585305)", "article": "2017 MAR 20 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Journal of Engineering -- A patent by the inventors Henry, James W. (Saskatoon, CA); Stuart, Graham D. (Saskatoon, CA); Wolowski, Evan J. B. (Saskatton, CA); Petruic, Matthew G. (Saskatoon, CA), filed on July 17, 2015, was published online on March 7, 2017, according to news reporting originating from Alexandria, Virginia, by VerticalNews correspondents. Patent number 9585305 is assigned to CNH Industrial Canada, Ltd. (Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, CA). The following quote was obtained by the news editors from the background information supplied by the inventors: \"Modern large acreage seeding implements pneumatically deliver seed, fertilizer, and/or other product to fields. An example is an air cart and an air drill that are pulled together behind a tractor to deliver product. Different seeding styles can be implemented by using different openers on the air drills. Knife, ribbon band, ribbon band sweep, double-shoot, and disk openers can be used for different seeding styles that can open correspondingly different styles of furrows to receive the seed. The air cart pneumatically conveys seed to the air drill for delivery into the furrow(s). Air carts include one or more storage compartments that hold product(s), each of which has an associated metering box. The metering box divides product(s) from the associated storage compartment(s) into equal sections for delivery of equal product volumes. The equally divided product(s) is entrained in an airflow established by a fan and delivered through manifolds and distribution lines that direct the product from the air cart, to the air drill, and to the field being planted with seed.\" In addition to the background information obtained for this patent, VerticalNews journalists also obtained the inventors' summary information for this patent: \"The present invention is directed to a particulate material delivery system that allows for variable rate sectional control while delivering particulate material to an agricultural field. The system may be incorporated with air carts and air drills, and that includes a metering system having multiple metering units that are independently controllable. This may allow for individual controlling product delivery rates through metering units so as to independently control the delivery rate(s) to each of multiple secondary distribution headers or manifolds, which may allow for sectional control of product delivery from the air drill. \"According to one aspect of the present invention, a particulate material delivery system is provided that may include an air cart and a planter that are towable behind a tractor. A metering system of the particulate material delivery system receives a product from the air cart and delivers the product to the planter for distribution to the ground, such as an agricultural field. The metering system may include multiple metering units that receive separate portions of the product from the air cart. Multiple prime movers may drive the multiple metering units. A controller is connected to and individually controls the multiple prime movers such that distribution rates of the multiple metering units can be varied independently of each other. The multiple prime movers may be electric motors. \"According to another aspect, each of the multiple metering units may include a metering roller, and a shaft that supports and rotates the metering roller. The electric motors may directly drive ends of the shafts that support the metering roller. \"According to another aspect, each of the multiple metering units may include a metering roller having an external gear at an outer circumferential surface thereof. Each electric motor may directly drive the external gear of a respective metering roller. \"According to another aspect, each of the multiple metering units may include a metering roller having an internal gear at an inner circumferential surface thereof. Each electric motor ma directly drive the internal gear of a respective metering roller. \"According to another aspect, an airflow characteristic of an airflow that entrains the product may be controlled based on a delivery rate of at least one of the multiple metering units for pneumatically conveying product from the multiple metering units toward multiple opener units of the drill. The delivery rate of the product to multiple locations of the agricultural field may be individually controlled by controlling the delivery rate of product through each of the multiple metering units and controlling the airflow characteristic. This may allow for providing a particulate material delivery system that provides delivery consistency and control without requiring singulation-type equipment such as row-unit planters, which may provide a relatively simple and cost-effective air-seeder-type particulate material delivery system with a high amount of delivery accuracy. This may allow for delivery rate variability at secondary headers or manifolds of a single drill which allows for site specific precision farming. This may also allow for relatively more application precision by way of variable rate sectional control of a drill as compared to typical drills that each typically allows for delivery rate variability of only the whole drill. \"Other aspects, objects, features, and advantages of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description and accompanying drawings. It should be understood, however, that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating preferred embodiments of the present invention, are given by way of illustration and not of limitation. Many changes and modifications may be made within the scope of the present invention without departing from the spirit thereof and the invention includes all such modifications.\" Keywords for this news article include: Agricultural, CNH Industrial Canada Ltd.

Knowing the global population will reach 9.5 billion in 2050, \"we're looking at how to maximize our productivity on these less productive lands and doing so in a manner that is not harmful to the environment,\" Brian Gray, assistant deputy minister for science and technology told the Senate agriculture committee. Increasing productivity of all land is one of four strategic objectives of the department's researchers. The work is being conducted in concert with the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the chief scientists of the agriculture departments of the G20 countries. \"We're still early days, because I think we've had four years, but we're identifying the biggest threats and opportunities facing the G20 countries in agriculture,\" he said. \"We look not so much at pooling money and putting it in one basket but collaborating on research where we're twinning funding. We're already working on this. We want to align our scientists with their scientists, whether in government or academia.\" A common theme in the committee's study of farmland ownership is the loss of the Class 1, 2 and 3 soils to urbanization and the addition of more Class 5 and 6 soils to the faming base. Allan Howard, Manager of the Agroclimate, Geomatics and Earth Observation Division, said the department's land use and soils data \"indicates that farmland is being lost to urban expansion in Canada every year, with much of this occurring in Ontario, Quebec, Prince Edward Island and British Columbia, where the majority of Canada's best farmland is found.\" Meanwhile land coming into agriculture tends to be Class 4 and 5. The department is looking at whether climate change is making some land of use to agriculture, he said. Research will be conducted on what the land across the country might be like by mid-century. \"There is certainly land coming into production that was not farmed 20 or 30 years.\" One example is grapes for wine production. \"There are a lot of wineries in the Okanagan, and they are looking to find areas where they can expand. \"The questions we have to ask are how much land is going to go from marginal and improved to be class 1, 2 or 3,\" he said. \"How much of the unsuitable land will become marginal land? How much of our prime land is going to lose productivity as a result of climate change? It may not be strictly because of things like drought. It could be extreme heat stress, pests or a number of things; so there are a number of questions we need to be aware of and still need to answer. I would say we're at the very early stages.\" Research scientist Ted Huffman said, monitoring land-use changes isdifficultbecauseithappensat it at \"isolated locations here and there across the country.\" New information systems show about 3,000 hectares of farmland per year being urbanized between 1990 and 2010, almost half of it in Ontario. At the same time, about 2,000 hectares of forest is converted to agricultural use across the country each year. \"The major contributor there is Alberta, 800 to about 900 hectares per year, followed by Quebec at about 400 hectares per year, Saskatchewan, 500 hectares per year,\" he said. Natural Resources Canada is developing a Federal Geospatial Platform to use satellite data on alllandusesinCanada land Canada, he said. This could assist the federal and provincial governments in establishing a standard land use policies and designations. Gray said the department is working to keep pace with new farming technology advances, such as precision farming. They \"are creating an increased demand for evidence based decision making at finer and finer scales, down to subfield levels beyond what is possible from the current soils database. \"In order to address this need, we have initiated discussions with the provinces, universities and private sectors about a common integrated approach to increase the resolution of our soils data, he said. His department \"is currently conducting research to develop nationally consistent farm-field level soil data using a new approach called predictive soil mapping.\" It should produce more detailed soil maps at significantly reduced costs over the traditional field survey based approach. Soil data only informs about the suitability of land for cropping purposes, not what is currently happening on the land base."}, {"title": "Press Release: AgJunction Sets Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2016 Conference Call for Friday, March 24, 2017 at 11:00 a.m. ET", "article": "AgJunction Sets Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2016 Conference Call for Friday, March 24, 2017 at 11:00 a.m. ET PR Newswire HIAWATHA, KS, March 9, 2017 HIAWATHA, KS, March 9, 2017 /PRNewswire/ - AgJunction Inc.

But it's a pleasure to have Chuck Magro here, Chuck has been with Agrium for eight years, he's had a variety of roles, sales, corporate developments, operations, he's had the CEO role for the last few years. He previously had a very successful career at NOVA Chemicals , so it's a pleasure to have you here, Chuck and we'll pass it over to you. CHUCK MAGRO, CEO, AGRIUM, INC.: Thanks, Steve. Hi, everyone. So if I'm the last one before alcohol, I'll be fairly quick here. I was thinking maybe you should get a drink first, because that would be more entertaining, but I'm not sure you'll pay attention. So it's great to be here. What I thought I'd do today is just take a couple of minutes, probably 15 minutes or so, talk about Agrium 's business, I'll give you an update on the current Ag market, how we see the spring season and then wrap up with just our priorities for 2017 and talk a little bit about the merger with PotashCorp . There is our forward-looking statement. Let's start with an overview of our Company. So most of you know Agrium , I hope. We're an agricultural inputs company. We are integrated, we go right from production of fertilizer right through to the retail distribution to the farm gate. We are fairly unique in that manner. We have a diversified Ag portfolio and we are either producing and/or selling all the major fertilizers, crop chemistry and seed and we're one of the largest Precision Ag players out there today. So we basically provide all the products and services that a grower needs to maximize their yield. This slide gives you a quick snapshot of our North American footprint, it's pretty important because, it's about 80% of our revenue and earnings. And you can see that there is a combination of our production businesses with our retail distribution assets. And this picture really is what makes Agrium unique in the Ag inputs space. The retail business is the Premier Ag retail business literally in the world. We have operations in Canada, the US, Australia and South America, about 1,500 facilities operating in seven countries. We purchase about 10 million tons of fertilizer, $4.5 billion of crop chemistry, $1.5 billion of seed and have our own Proprietary Chemicals and Specialty Nutrition product, we call them Loveland Products. The wholesale production business, 11 million tons of NP&K, very high quality asset, and we benefit from strong global competitive advantages across most of these product line, especially in Western Canada where we have quite a natural gas advantage. The highly complementary nature of our production and distribution businesses is what sets us apart. This integration allows us to really deliver resilient earnings and strong free cash flow. It's also allowed us to have a leading and sustainable dividend across the cycle, even in these market conditions. I'll switch gears now, talk a little bit about the market and what we're seeing. In the US, we had a relatively normal harvest with very strong crop yields once again, really three years in a row above trend yields. We also saw a solid nutrient removal as a result of that in the United States and somewhat in Canada. And for the fall application in the US, we also saw very good application rates for P&K. In Western Canada, it was slightly a different story. We had a delayed harvest activities because of the early snowfall, and so we really didn't get a lot of ammonia down in the fall in Western Canada. And we're seeing that now with a very strong demand outlook for Western Canada and in our order book, both in wholesale and in retail. When I look at the Ag market, overall, I'd still say that the fundamentals are still challenging, but there are some reasons to be cautiously optimistic. Crop prices, for example are stable and slightly higher than last year, in fact. And our business in retail, we saw very strong prepay across North America. And prepay, we use as a bit of a barometer to indicate future farmer spending intentions with us and that was actually up year-over-year, which is really good news. And then as you can see in this chart here, farmer cash margins are actually expected to improve slightly this year, which would be the first time actually in three years, which we find that to be a very good time. Crop prices remain very affordable, you can see in this chart, which is fertilizer prices as a percentage of revenue for major crops like corn are well below the five-year average. In fact, on this basis, nutrients are the most affordable they've been since 2010, which we think bodes well for fertilizer demand this spring. Moving to fertilizer prices, and nitrogen, urea prices have improved after falling to unsustainably low levels. Chinese urea production costs increased last year and we saw exports drop off significantly and that's what led to the recent rally we've seen in benchmark nitrogen prices. Now once the spring is complete, we do see the potential for seasonal weakness in nitrogen as well as probably some dislocation in some premium as the North American market has to absorb some of the new capacity coming online, most likely in the second half of the year. However, longer term, we are very constructive on nitrogen as the global supply demand we believe will continue to tighten in 2018, 2019. In potash, we're seeing firm demand for supply for potash right around the world in terms of the first half of the year and it's been quite strong actually since the second half of the year. We expect demand globally to grow 5% up from the 59 million tons we saw last year. So the market is continuing to grow, which is very, very helpful. And for this -- after the spring season, really it's going to depend on a few things, the timing and the rate at which the new capacity comes online, the timing of new contracts with our international buyers and of course, the global growth rate, will it continue. So those are some of the key factors that will determine how long the strength in potash will continue. I'll talk now a little bit more about our operations. I'll start with wholesale, so this is a world-class production business, I've mentioned the 11 million tons of capacity, both low cost and have really attractive end market competitive advantages. And I think an important thing to note is after many years of capacity expansion and capital spending, now our capital program and wholesale is just -- it's almost complete, it will be complete actually at the end of this first quarter. And in recent years, we've added now 600,000 tons of nitrogen at our Borger, Texas plant and then 1 million tons of potash capacity at Vanscoy. Included in the wholesale 11 million tons is about 5 million tons of nitrogen in North America. It's a very high margin nitrogen business, it's backstopped by low cost natural gas, especially in western Canada where we have the ACOG gas advantage. And this chart actually shows the cash cost of production for urea compared to some of the high cost producers. The market today is fitting basically at the high cost production cost curve and you can see on the far left there that our gas position at $2 an MMBtu is very, very attractive. And that is a substantial cost advantage even compared to our North American NYMEX peers. So I think that it really demonstrates how strong our nitrogen business is from a cost perspective, especially in Western Canada. And when you take that cost advantage and then you look at the end-market pricing advantage that we have and especially, if you consider that four out of our five plants are located in Western Canada, you can see there's a healthy uplift to pricing because of our logistical advantage in having our production up in Western Canada. In fact in Q4, we had the highest margins among our North American peers by a very wide margin. So the combination of low cost gas, end market logistics advantage makes our nitrogen business as the strong cash generator. In potash, as I've mentioned, we've completed the 1 million ton capacity expansion, which brings Vanscoy's total capacity to 3 million tons. This will lower our cash cost of production to below $70 a ton, ensuring that these assets are highly competitive globally and among the highest quality in the world. And we expect to generate meaningful earnings and cash flow from the investments going forward. On to retail. As I mentioned, really an unparalleled Ag retail business. You can see that the business is very, very large, over $12 billion in revenue, $2.8 billion in gross profit with a strong exposure to a very diversified crops as well as you can see on the chart, we've grown the business quite steadily through a combination of both acquisition and organic growth. And one of the key growth levers that we have is really our proprietary products business. And this is a great business for us because it has very high margins compared to the margins we get by buying and reselling third-party products. Our proprietary products portfolio continues to grow and add significant value to the bottom line. This includes our Loveland Crop Protection and Specialty Nutritional products, as well as our proprietary seed brand. We now have over 250 brands in the portfolio, so it has grown quite a bit. And as we made solid progress growing the brands in 2016, the proprietary products actually have increase to 15% of our overall retail sales. A little bit now on how we've been managing the downturn in the commodity cycle and controlling our controllables. In wholesale, we've continued to drive out cost and increased our reliability across the business. Our cash cost of production in 2016 for both urea and potash were well below our public targets that we laid out last year. So we've made just great progress in the last two years. Last year in 2016, we actually set record production for both nitrogen and our potash businesses, and if you take on top of that we also removed $60 million of fixed costs out of our wholesale business in a relatively short period of time. In retail, we've also worked on cutting costs, optimizing our network and improving our profitability. We've made excellent progress in optimizing the network in 2016, closing over 60 facilities. Collectively, these changes have allowed us to take out another $70 million of fixed cost out of the retail business. And as a result, our cash operating coverage ratio improved by 1% to 61% and our EBITDA margin now reached an impressive 9.3%. We also set a record EBITDA margin for our United States retail business at 10.4%. So we've made really good progress towards our 2020 stated target. In fact growing retail remains a strategic priority for us and we have multiple pathways underway right now to continue to grow. Of course, we've talked about growing by M&A, we call this our tuck-in program, but we are also building Greenfield locations now in some select high-value markets. We're also focused on organic growth by optimizing the network further and by achieving even deeper penetration of our proprietary products. And finally, we just introduced a new business, the Agrium Financial Services business, which will be another catalyst for growth in the retail portfolio. As I mentioned, our tuck-in program, it's a big part of our growth strategy. We've -- since 2010, we've been a very active consolidator, rolling up the Ag retail space, especially in Canada and the United States and we had an exceptional year last year where we had a record 76 acquisitions, acquiring about $500 million of annual revenue. And these acquisitions typically are highly accretive and a significant source of value creation. And looking ahead, our pipeline remains very solid for 2017. Everything we do at Agrium is to drive shareholder value. Specifically, we are focused on building an integrated platform that delivers stable and free cash flow. In recent years, we've invested in low-cost, high-quality capacity in our wholesale business as well as we've allocated significant capital to grow our retail business and consolidate the space to drive the integration and stability of the overall portfolio. We've also spent a significant amount of time and energy working on our base business and hopefully I've shown some of those results today. And now that the CapEx program is behind us, if you look and you take a step back at our business, we have this uniquely integrated Ag business that can maintain a very strong balance sheet, pursue profitable growth and be a leader in returning capital to shareholders. I think it's a great story and will only be enhanced with the PotashCorp merger. When I look at the merger, this is truly a unique, and I think transformational opportunity for Agrium , the PotashCorp and for both sets of shareholder. When you look at the combination of the two companies, the strategic fit is very strong and the industrial logic, very, very sound. We will create the world's largest integrated crop inputs provider, we will have a very strong balance sheet with the financial strength to continue to grow the Company and still a lot of ability to return capital to shareholders. Now, we've committed to $500 million of annual operating synergies that are well within our control, this represents very significant value creation with no help from the market. So when I step back and I look at the big picture, this is the right deal at the right time with the right partner. In terms of a quick update, we obviously have received a very strong endorsement from both sets of shareholders. With our vote in November, our integration planning with PotashCorp is well underway and I'm very pleased with the progress. We have received regulatory clearance from Brazil and Russia, we still expect to close the transaction mid-year in 2017. So with that, I'll turn it over to either Steve or you, for some questions. Questions and Answers STEVE BYRNE : Anybody have questions for Chuck? We have one up here. Let me just open it up while waiting on this one, Chuck. Your retail business in the US, I think have some market share, maybe shy of 20% or close to 20%, where would you like that to be in another 10 years? CHUCK MAGRO: That's right. Steve, so it's 19% so the market share in the US. And if you look at the jurisdictions that the retail business is operating under the US is our most profitable, it's our largest business, but it has the lowest market share. In fact, Western Canada, the market share would be close to 30% and similar numbers in Australia and in Argentina. So we'd like to continue to grow the US retail business. We think sort of a mid-term target would be in that 25% range to get to up say, from 19% to 25%. We think we can do that through the programs that we have underway right now. And if we were able to do that, I think we would create just a tremendous amount of value. We continue to see opportunities right now in the pipeline that are very, very attractive. Last year we -- I mentioned the record, but we also bought, two of those acquisitions had 16 to 20 facilities in them. So they're more mid-size acquisitions, and we're starting to see more and more of those become available here in the US. STEVE BYRNE : Is there a size where the value proposition starts to erode in terms of either your private label positioning or density, is there a point where it doesn't make sense to go much further? CHUCK MAGRO: I think one day we will reach that limit, but certainly in the other jurisdictions, we're sort of in that 30% range and we haven't come across any deep concerns there. The United States, we talk about it as one market, but really in regions we will have market share that's slightly higher than that and some we'll be quite well under-penetrated. So we use that as a broad kind of barometer to get across the US, but there's some areas that are in the Corn Belt, in real corn country that we're actually underrepresented, which we would like to grow certain areas more readily. But I don't think we have the limitations that you've described, I don't think we're anywhere near that. So I'd say we have a lot of freedom to get to those kind of market shares certainly in the next period of time. UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Chuck, doubtless you read the recent Wall Street Journal article about the disintermediation of these products. Can you just speak about that threat and I'm guessing that you believe for a variety of reasons the -- a modest threat that you will manage just fine, but can you point to the evidence at hand for the sustainability of your bricks and mortar retail model? CHUCK MAGRO: Yes, it's a great question and we saw the article, we know the parties involved, they're not foreign to us at all, we've had some discussion, we have a relationship with them. Ultimately, the Agrium retail model or in general, the retail model has to create value for the grower. And we believe we do that not only by providing commodities to the farm gate, which is important and the distribution of physical commodities will need to happen no matter how they buy them. So there's always going to be an element of value creation by getting fertilizer, seed and chemistry to the farm gate. But our business is much more than that today. Our business really has to deal with having -- today, we have about 3,000 agronomists working in the fields every day as independent crop advisor, helping growers sort through all the decisions that they need to make to maximize yield. And we don't think that that relationship and that structure is going to change at all. Now, there is a place for digital agriculture and for e-commerce, but we believe that that would be supplemented in any form by having independent advice for the growers to help them maximize crop production. So we don't see it as a threat necessarily, it's another way, I think for growers to get information, which we think and believe it's healthy for growers. But I believe that the model that we have, where we move a lot of bulk commodities to the farm gate (inaudible) we're able to give them every advice, service and actually do a lot of the application with our own equipment, our own fleet of trucks and spreading equipment, I think there is real value for growers by having that kind of service offering for them. So to be determined, we're watching it closely, but certainly, we think that our model is well and healthy. UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Just continuing down that line of thinking, this Precision Ag program you have, you keep bolting on more modules onto this special on package, would you say the value proposition to you, to Agrium is that it drives revenue because of the services that it generates, whether it's variable rate application or soil sampling or whatever, where do you think it drives customer loyalty? CHUCK MAGRO: Yes, I think answer is both. So what we're finding with the Precision Ag platform is it's sort of the mechanism to do -- to have the relationship. Of course, once you have four years, five years of yield and kind of fertilizer and crop chemistry data in the system, it's more sticky, growers won't want to switch once they have all that commitment that they've made on one platform. So there is an element of loyalty and retention. The average age of the farmer is 58 in the United States, so the younger farmer likes to have that technology on their mobile device. They can communicate with us through the system and they can get help from a crop consultant when they need it. It's also allowing us to have fewer crop consultants and handle larger farms and more farms because a lot of the communication and information and analytics are actually in the Precision Ag software. So that's I think a wave of the future. I think ultimately you will not be an Ag retailer without a platform like this. That's probably some of the reason why we're seeing an acceleration in some of the acquisitions on, some of the smaller Ag retailers as they don't have $10 million or $20 million or $50 million to develop their own platform. And the way the market is going is it's going to be certainly a cost of doing business and a cost of entry for Ag retailers. And I think that part of the value proposition that we offer, I think is a great (inaudible) to this notion of just having price transparency and an e-commerce platform. Our e-commerce platform is really the Precision Ag software backstopped by our agronomy. STEVE BYRNE : You showed that map where your footprint is in the retail and you talked about bolting on x number of new retail facilities. Drilling down into their retail business, do you think that you have more opportunity to grow private label chemistry or seeds and you need some acquisitions to be able to do that? CHUCK MAGRO: Our proprietary product is one of the reasons why we set a record of EBITDA in 2016 in the US and had such a strong margin performance across the Company. We think we have invested over $100 million over the last five years in buying or getting access to proprietary technology. And we would continue to look for other acquisitions and investments and even commercial relationships that keep bolstering up our portfolio, because we think that it's a real important part of our growth strategy in trying to optimize the overall network. I don't think you'll ever see us and we think that I guess Steve, to answer your question directly, we can increase the percentage of our current shelves with our proprietary products. But it is a balancing act, because we get incentives from the third-party providers to grow their market share and sell their products. So we're constantly and we have a team of people with sophisticated analytics balancing what we need to sell to maximize our earnings. So the end game isn't just to drive our proprietary product sales for the sake of doing that, it's maximizing our earnings. And right now, last year we got -- we were able to grow our proprietary products percentage, but we also hit the right target for our third-party providers and that's why when you look at our margins for overall, they were up was a combination of our rebate and our proprietary portfolio and that's the balancing act that we're constantly working through. STEVE BYRNE : Your private label seed business is primarily corn and beans, would you be interested in expanding that into other crops if any forced divestitures of seed brands were available? CHUCK MAGRO: Well, right now, we have our own genetics for cotton, for canola and for rice. And then our private label, we do license trades from the majors and we brand them under the Dyna-Gro brand and you're right, it's primarily for corn and for beans. We would be interested in expanding both of those. So it's really a current consolidation wave that's underway. If there is some genetics that came available that are not mainstream, broad acre heavy R&D, where retail had a large market share, so rice is the perfect example. We acquired the genetics for rice, but we have a really high market share of rice acres in the southern part of the US and there's not a lot of R&D left to do, that made an awful lot of sense for us. So on the fringes, we would absolutely do that all day long. If there is more technology or R&D that's required, we would have no interest in that. We're not an R&D company, we're a company that wants to buy these products and services that can differentiate ourselves, but take them directly to market through our channel. And so we'll look at everything that comes available, but we're going to be highly selective, because it has to fit with our strategy, we have no desire to get into heavy investment cost for research and development or even to maintain our technology portfolio, that's not our business. STEVE BYRNE : And would that comment also hold in chemistry? CHUCK MAGRO: Yes, chemistry, so the Loveland Products chemistry, primarily majority of it is really products that are off patent and we've specialized them, we've added some things that are unique to them. But we don't do a tremendous -- we do some, but I'd call it product development, not R&D. So products that are commercially viable today that would fit into that portfolio, we would absolutely be interested. But again, we don't want to go beyond bringing those products to market in terms of having to maintain technology portfolio. So on a chemistry decision, we would look at, are they market ready, do they fit with our existing products, and can we get some synergy by moving a larger percentage of them through our channel. STEVE BYRNE : But versus having a supply agreement with a producer for a particular molecule and then you have the ability to have own private label brand, would you want to have the intellectual property for a molecule to yourself? CHUCK MAGRO: Not necessarily. So the way we think about it, Steve is that we service the grower -- all kinds of the different growers. Some growers want the brand, they want the technology from a third-party. Typically, we're quite comfortable having to buy and resell relationship with that product. Then there's a proprietary product that's not quite a generic, but there is a specialty product, a formulated product of some type, that we would have interested in. And then the generics, if we have a cost position we would take that, but many times we don't. And so we bring in third-party through that as well. And so we think our sweet spot is just in the formulated off-patent areas. Having our own technology will require further investments to maintain the leadership position in that technology and that's not what we want to spend our dollars on. STEVE BYRNE : Part of the rationale with the merger with PotashCorp is to take some of that wholesale potash capacity and push it through your own retail channel. You sell more potash through retail than you produce on wholesale. Was it an option to do that with the tons coming out of the legacy [mine] as an alternative? CHUCK MAGRO: Yes. Actually the driving factor for the Agrium PotashCorp merger has to do with integration of nitrogen and phosphate. Vanscoy itself can service our retail potash needs. So there is very little synergy related to having more capacity from a potash perspective for our retail channel. The value creation will be in saving logistics and distribution cost, streamlining the entire supply chain, which is very large and reducing the overall cost from NP&K right through to the farm gate. So there is very little actual value from having more potash capacity from an integration perspective, but more from nitrogen and phosphate. STEVE BYRNE : And on the phosphate side, is that longer term opportunity in Redwater viable, have you got some alternatives source of rock? CHUCK MAGRO: Talking about from the merger perspective? STEVE BYRNE : Yes. CHUCK MAGRO: Yes. So about $80 million out of the $500 million of synergies is going to come from phosphate. Today most of you know, we buy imported rock from Morocco and then we bring it into Western Canada and we relay to Redwater. So the synergy has to do with using PotashCorp 's rock and asset capability in Florida and North Carolina, exiting our contracts with Morocco and getting backward integrated with Phosrock again and bringing that up to Redwater and saving the price really that we were paying for the Moroccan rock. And we were -- before we bought the Moroccan rock, we were actually integrated Agrium , we used a rock source out of Kapuskasing, Ontario. We did rail it 3,000 kilometers and when we lost the economic viability of that mine, we have to go to a third-party, we lost about $70 a ton and we believe we'll regain that by integrating with the PotashCorp asset. STEVE BYRNE : And on the nitrogen side of the house, is that longer term advantage that you have up in Alberta, is that sustainable longer term and where is the synergy on the nitrogen side? CHUCK MAGRO: The synergy is for the deal on nitrogen are not in Western Canada, they're in the southern part of the US. So right now, PotashCorp produces nitrogen and there's a couple levels of synergies, right? We have some railcars that literally pass each other in the night and now we'll be able to service our retail customers by keeping tons closer to home and saving expensive distribution costs, because now will have more production in the southeast of the US and so we'll be able to prevent some logistics costs. The other driving factor is, PotashCorp uses the industrial nitrogen markets quite a bit and we'll be able to move some of that nitrogen into our retail channel on an Ag basis and keep those tons closer to home, saving logistics cost that way as well. So that's the exciting part for the deal is really optimizing the North American supply chain that we have, both of them are huge, I'll give you just a couple more data point. So the warehouses, we have a combined, almost 400 warehouses, some of them are literally across the street from one another and we'll be able to take out a percentage of those and optimize our distribution points. And I think that there is the lot of value creation through the supply chain even that way. Our rail fleet combine 15,000 railcars and we both have surplus railcars for redundancies and we'll be able to trim the rail fleet reducing costs as well. So it's almost endless when you look at putting these two supply chains together and how we can squeeze out the efficiencies. And since we announced the deal, we've been working on this, now for another two months or three months and I'd say that I'm actually more encouraged about the $500 million annual synergy target than I was even in November. UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Your calculations on margin per acre on major row crops looks like you had a higher margin in corn an bean, which I think is maybe a reversal from only a couple of months ago. Has your outlook for acreage shifts also changed for this upcoming planting season? CHUCK MAGRO: Yes, that's great, Jim. We still think corn will be in the 90 million acres to 92 million acres. We're getting more optimistic that maybe it's closer to the 92 million acres. It's going to depend, if we have a slightly early spring, which who knows if that will actually happen, then you could see even more corn acres come into the play, because if they have more time typically, they'll plant corn. But right now, I think our best view of the markets are 90 million acres to 92 million acres. I think what we're seeing though is, there's strong optimism for the first half of the year at the farm level. Margins are, I mentioned our prepay, which is up year-over-year. Lower fertilizer prices helped. And I think there is a strong positive sentiment about a lower tax cuts for farmers that are causing farmers to have a little bit more positive sentiment than we've seen even in the November of last year. So we like the mood of 2017, at least the spring. And we think certainly our order book is showing that we're going to have a real solid first half of the year, both in wholesale but in retail as well. We did get more moisture in California. And there's going to -- we believe another 3 million acres of broad acre crops that are going to be put into production. Now, in the last two years or three years, California went early because it was dry. California most likely will be a little later, but overall, I think it's going to be better because there's going to be more production. And that's a very key market for us where we have a strong market presence. So net-net-net we like how 2017 is shaping up. UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: And based on your outlook for perhaps maybe a little more corn than you were thinking only a few months ago, do you think that there is maybe some catch-up necessary in amount of nitrogen that needs to get put down that maybe didn't go down in the fall, growers may have hedged thinking can maybe they're going to plant more beans. Where do you think we are in the amount of nitrogen that will be applied for this first half versus how much you've already sold? CHUCK MAGRO: We believe there could be some upside to the nitrogen applications because of that. Certainly in Western Canada, we didn't get a lot of nitrogen down and that's a high margin business for us than our retail business in Western Canada and so we're expecting a very good spring for nitrogen applications. And then you're exactly right, in the southern part of the US, right now, where we are rolling in the south, we're seeing excellent applications and really good orders. So we'll see, it's still a little early to get overly optimistic, but there is more upside I think than there is downside when we look at certainly the planning that we've looked at so far. STEVE BYRNE : And would you say weakness in pricing here recently is the result of (inaudible) coming on stream, maybe, and [Weaver] coming on stream and yet there is so more demand to come? CHUCK MAGRO: Yes. The weakness I think, it's there, but it's quite small. When I look at kind of the drivers, you've got China this time of year operating best report, 50%, exports last month were 200,000 tons, last year they were over 1 million tons at this time and we -- China was running in the [70s] in terms of on-stream time. So I think that nitrogen supply demand, I believe that the new capacity will come online, but I'm not sure it's going to impact the spring. There might be some consideration that's why maybe we saw a little bit of price reduction, but I think generally what we think is that there's going to be more strength going into the second quarter for nitrogen unless China does something different and then the seasonal softness will come in the second half of the year. But I actually think the first half of the year you're going to see -- could even see a little bit more strengthening in nitrogen pricing. STEVE BYRNE : Okay. I think we're about out of time.

On the northwest side of a canvas structure, which 19 years ago housed hogs, sits our seeder, a 30-foot hoe drill. I will remove the tarp that has been protecting it since last May. I will grease it and otherwise get it ready for the field. It's an old piece of machinery. It works. It works well. But it won't work forever. Our small farm will need to replace this implement at some point. Tractors are more powerful and more expensive than they used to be. Implements the same. A farmer can spend north of $750,000 on a combine and more than $500,000 on a tractor. And then there's tillage equipment, spraying equipment, trucks, grain storage and more tractors. The sudden need to replace machinery due to catastrophic loss could end a farm. Tornadoes and other natural disasters have closed the doors of many local operations. This is partially due to formidably high replacement values, but also to blame is the changing face of agriculture in Canada. There are fewer farms than there were. Between 2006 and 2011, Statistics Canada reported a loss of 23,643 farms, which means there are fewer farmers managing larger farms. Equipment manufacturers have noticed this trend and have adapted production lines to service large-scale farms, leaving small operations no choice but to buy used, potentially outmoded equipment, or purchase new equipment that is under-utilized on only a few acres. And in the dollars and cents vocation of farming, buying horsepower you don't need is a noticeable waste of money. The realities of a small-scale farm, say, under 2,000 acres, is that the agronomic advantages of being able to use more precise, more efficient equipment will be out of reach for quite some time. The public should care about this. Precision agriculture has the ability to bend public trust toward the positive. And the industry needs that. It needs you on board. According to the first page of AgDealer.com results under the Planting/Seeding category, I could purchase a used 60-foot air drill for US$169,500. For me to buy this now, a new farmer facing expensive land purchases, would be crippling if not impossible. I'm not alone. Many farmers are finding themselves needing new equipment, but are unable to pencil out the costs. In Manitoba, and, arguably, Western Canada, the buzzword is collaboration, a concept being applied to individual farms, commodity groups, industry, as well as government. There's a growing understanding that in order for the ag sector in Canada to excel, all agriculturerelated groups are going to have to work together. My farm started when Jacob Banman purchased a quartersection (160 acres) for one dollar under the Dominion Lands Act in the late 1800s. Since then, the farm has grown and adapted to that growth, purchasing equipment as needed. But this operation, like others its size, is no longer one of many. It's one of a few. This is a challenge, given that the industries servicing us farmers are more likely to appeal to the many. Some of the farms in my area have started to purchase equipment in groups, increasing their ability to purchase more advanced machinery. And this trend toward working together is taking hold in more areas than machinery sales. On the surface, the compromise is ownership. Older generations cling to it and fear its loss when words like \"collaboration\" are uttered. I don't blame them. My gut reaction isn't far off. The only difference is that I have a few years of farming ahead of me and, from where I'm sitting now, collaboration is not just feel-goodery, it's what we need to do to survive. The history of agriculture in Canada is a story of people working together to tackle adverse conditions. The concept is not new. When my father nearly lost his life in a motor vehicle accident in the '80s, the community of Winkler, Man., came together to harvest our crops and finish our fieldwork for the growing season. They worked together. Every year, my neighbours help me with some aspect of farm life, and I do the same. Farmers can seem staunchly independent, but, even among the most stubborn, there is the implicit understanding that what we do would not be possible alone. Our seeder has a few more crop years left in it. This I am sure of. The trick is maintenance, but that's for another time. For now, let's all find new and interesting ways to work together."}, {"title": "Deveron Completes Over 500 Commercial Flights in 2016 Plans Western Canada Expansion for 2017", "article": "Sydney - Tuesday - February 28: (RWE) - Deveron UAS Corp, is pleased to report that the company has completed over 500 commercial, incident free, drone flights in 2016, clearly establishing Deveron as North America's leading drone-based data provider to the agricultural industry. The company is adding to its team in western Canada and will be able to provide drone data solutions throughout the 2017 grow season to customers in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba - a potential market of 50 million acres. According to PwC, the commercial drone industry is reported to be $127 billion, with agriculture making up $32.4 billion.

Economic development initiatives in support of local food producers have broadened beyond the direct marketing of crops and livestock products to recognize a role for digital technology in agriculture and food. Named among the international Intelligent Community Forum's top seven for 2017 and still in the running for top spot in June, Grey received recognition citing, among other things, the county's crucial role in assembling a plan to install fibre optic internet throughout 350 communities of southwestern Ontario. Canadian federal and Ontario provincial governments announced$90 million each in funding for the $281 million proposal of the Western Ontario Wardens Caucus. SWIFT - short for SouthWest Integrated Fibre Technology - includes at least two former Grey County employees, interim executive director Geoff Hogan and communications director Ashleigh Weeden. Connections for agriculture, which remains the Grey County economy's single largest sector, have been part of the SWIFT proposal since it began. Modern farmers rely increasingly on digital technology in the field and in livestock barns, not to mention offices. In a recent interview, Bruce County Federation of Agriculture president Les Nichols underlined the need for universal high-speed communications in agriculture and in the region's small towns. He endorsed the SWIFT project. \"We're in an age where highspeed internet is a pretty basic requirement of doing business,\" Nichols said. \"From an agriculture point of view, obviously, the type of technology we're starting to use with precision agriculture and computerized robots milking cows, etc., the internet is very much a necessity at the agricultural level if we're to keep moving forward.\". Ag 4.0, a conference and tour organized by county economic development officials in Meaford late last year, highlighted digital innovations for agriculture and for computer consulting businesses seeking broader agricultural applications and clients. For Philly Markowitz, the county's local food specialist, Ag 4.0 represented an expansion of her role and that of the municipality beyond the local food domain. As a result, Markowitz has begun to explore ways of broadening the reach of local producers and processors to reach provincial and international markets. \"We do have producers in Grey County who are local producers who are meeting the needs in the local market, but who are also poised to distribute their product regionally and are looking to export,\" she said. \"We want to be working with them; that's part of the shift,\" she said. \"We're looking at food and farm businesses that are of various sizes and wanting to grow and expand and trying to connect them with the resources and expertise they need.\" Similarly, after a year in the business of boosting the volume of local food consumed in local households through online ordering and a system of pickup and delivery, the Owen Sound-based Eat Local Grey Bruce Cooperative has also begun exploring broader horizons. \"The role of Eat Local is, yes, it's simpler access to healthy food for our local community,\" manager Thorsten Arnold said. \"But it's also an incubator for growing farmers into. .. a very cautious wholesaler role,\" he said. In its busiest weeks, the co-op moved $9,000 worth of food through 150 orders, assembling products from 35 member producers for distribution among a consumer membership base of 600 people. With 15 producers waiting to join and a subscriber base of 1,000 for the Eat Local newsletter, the co-op is close to profitability, Arnold said. A drop in orders because some customers live elsewhere in winter and a recent software switch forced by a contractor's unforeseen decision to cease business complicated the co-operative's year-end, Arnold said. However, a new software system has begun working and the group remains committed to the service it provides. Arnold, a market gardener and consultant, has also become aware of the potential for significant growth that could come from connecting local growers with consumers elsewhere who share a commitment to the alternative food sources his growers represent. Organizational gaps remain, however, between small scale Grey-Bruce growers and the potential of Greater Toronto Area sales. Others have tried and failed with similar group distribution schemes. Arnold cites insufficient meat processing capacity and excessive food safety requirements as obstacles for area livestock growers, hwo otherwise have the willingness and capacity to expand. Popular demand for local food in southern Ontario's urban centres has generated a cadre of purveyors and wholesalers eager for new sources of supply, Arnold said. \"They have a real issue getting suppliers; but they don't want to deal with hundreds of individuals. They want one organization to deal with and Eat Local could grow to be that organization,\" Arnold said. Recent adjustments at the Grey County economic development department under a new director, Savanna Myers, also provide new supports for agriculture. They include the recent move to Grey County of former Owen Sound city economic development officer Steve Furness, who brings with him a long-term project to maintain and enhance city harbour facilities used mainly for storage and shipping of agricultural commodities. \"We're looking at the fact that agriculture is still our number one economic driver in terms of GDP,\" Markowitz said. \"More people are moving off the farm, but that doesn't mean there aren't great jobs in farming. The new jobs in farming could be tech jobs. They could be software or hardware development or they could be in crop triage with drones. There's a lot of opportunity in agriculture.\""}, {"title": "Deveron Completes Over 500 Commercial Flights in 2016 Plans Western Canada Expansion for 2017", "article": "TORONTO, ONTARIO--(Marketwired - Feb. 27, 2017) - Deveron UAS Corp.

In South Africa, it would control about 30% of both markets. Already today, Monsanto is one of two companies in South Africa that employs 80% of the private sector breeders in maize and 100% of the breeders in soybean and sunflower breeders. \" - African Centre for Biodiversity The dominance of giant agribusiness multinational companies in the supply of seeds and chemicals is not new, whether at the national level in both developing and developing countries or on a global scale. The vast influence of these companies is felt in policies imposed on national governments damaging to small farmers as well as to the environment and human health, as well as in control of pricing for agricultural inputs. Recent years, however, have seen a further escalation of mergers which is accelerating concentration in the industry, of which the merger of Bayer and Monsanto is currently under review by national regulatory agencies in South Africa and other countries. This new report highlights the negative consequences of this trend, particularly for smallholder farmers. The Bayer-Monsanto merger: Implications for South Africa's agricultural future and its smallholder farmers February 2017 About This Paper This paper explores the likely implications of an approved BayerMonsanto merger for the South African agricultural system. It outlines the trend of consolidation occurring within the seed and agrochemical industries, provides a background to the merger, criticises the rationale given for the merger by Bayer and Monsanto and outlines concerns should the merger be approved in South Africa. These concerns focus on the implications for South African farmers, smallholder farmers in particular. The paper argues that further consolidation of an already corporate- controlled seed sector is not needed and that it undermines the emergence of an alternative system that would support smallholder farmers in contributing to food security in an egalitarian agricultural economy. Key Findings Context The proposed Bayer-Monsanto merger takes place in a context of megamergers: China National Chemical Corporation (ChemChina)- Syngenta; DuPont-Dow. If approved, just three corporations would control about 60% of the global patented seed market and 64% of the agrochemical market. If the Bayer-Monsanto merger is approved, the new merged company will control almost 30% of the global commercial seed market and 25% of the agrochemical market - making it the world's largest supplier of seeds and chemicals. In South Africa, it would control about 30% of both markets. Already today, Monsanto is one of two companies in South Africa that employs 80% of the private sector breeders in maize and 100% of the breeders in soybean and sunflower breeders. The merger will need to be approved by regulatory authorities in more than 30 countries. Authorities are viewing the merger activities in totality to assess possible implications for the market, farmers and consumers. They will look at whether reduced competition will lead to reduced innovation, lowered spending on research and development and implications for increased input costs and reduced choice for farmers and other consumers (although the market is already significantly consolidated). Merger activity is being driven by the global economic downturn and reduced demand for products by farmers because of low commodity prices. It is also driven by the desire to reduce operational costs, particularly for research and development processes, and to access proprietary knowledge enclosed in intellectual property rights, such as patents. The merger and acquisition trend is supported by the historically low interest rates (close to zero) being offered in the United States, the Euro zone, Japan and the United Kingdom. Both Bayer and Monsanto are already engaged in big data projects in the agricultural sector. Bayer notes that one of its prime reasons for acquiring Monsanto is because it owns The Climate Corporation, which has the most powerful data science engine and the most extensive field research network. In addition, Monsanto has its foot in several important Genome Editing initiatives: it owns one of the two existing CRISPR licenses and has started two joint ventures on precision agriculture with the agrotech giants CNH and AGCO. Both companies would benefit from sharing patents on genetically modified crops and existing network and distribution models as they both plan to expand into the African market, with a particular focus on smallholder farmers. Bayer has been in the plant genetic engineering arena since the early 2000s and holds more patents on transgenic plant traits (206) than Monsanto (119) in the European Union). Having access to each other's proprietary knowledge would provide them with significant cost savings, particularly as the biotech industry shifts towards using CRISPR genome editing technology, which revolutionises transgenic interventions through the rewriting of whole DNA-sequences, but is not yet subject to a comparable degree of regulatory oversight as the first generation of genetic engineering. Both traits and germplasm is needed to remain competitive in this market. South Africa is the most important African market for both companies in terms of sales and for providing a base for African expansion. The recent request by GrainSA, Agbiz Grain, the South African National Seed Organization (SANSOR) and the Agricultural Research Council for a breeding and technology levy to be imposed on winter cereals in South Africa - with the possibility of expanding this to other crops - would effectively mean that public resources would be used to collect royalty payments for these companies. Both Bayer and Monsanto sit on industry representative bodies, giving them a significant degree of influence on the industry - a combined company would enjoy benefits of greater influence. Implications The merger between Bayer Crop Science and Monsanto would have possible implications for the agricultural sector and the food system in South Africa: It would further reduce the competition within the South African seed sector. Evidence from the US seed market shows that mergers of this size will change key parameters of the seed market. BayerMonsanto' s dominant market position will be further enhanced, as will both companies' control over traits-germplasm-crop protection products in the country. Quite contrary to the claims of Bayer and Monsanto managers, the merger is likely to decrease the amount of investment and the range of innovations. This paper argues that the potential merger must be analysed in the larger context of a rapid privatisation of research and development. A particularly important tool of the potential Bayer-Monsanto seed giant would be the instrument of licensing rights, and increased pressure on farmers through the collection of levies is expected. Serious impacts are anticipated for farmers and food consumers alike. For farmers, evidence from the last few years at both the South African seed market and the US seed market shows that a further increase in seed prices is very likely. The choice of available inputs will further decrease. Given the high amount of sunk costs that particularly Monsanto invested in the development of partly unsuccessful genetically modified organisms, there is a threat that the South African market will be used as a strategic point from where to 'dump' old genetically modified (GM) technologies onto the African market. On the other hand, available micro data from households in South Africa show how any price increase in staple food prices might affect the income poor. An indirect effect on food prices from the merger cannot be excluded. A closer look at the drivers of the Bayer- Monsanto merger reveals that the 'efficiency argument' put forward by the corporations might lead to a benefit to their shareholders, but cannot be expected to spill over to external groups, such as farmers and food consumers. ... Seed and Agrochemical Markets Global agricultural input markets (seed, fertiliser, crop protection products, farm machinery and agri-tech markets) are already significantly consolidated, having experienced a series of horizontal and vertical mergers and acquisitions over the past two decades (Figure 1). The global and regional seed market In 1994, the four biggest seed companies controlled 21% of the global market (AgriPortal, 2016); today just ten companies own about 65% of the world's proprietary seed (seed registered for legal protection) for major crops (Wattnem, 2016). It must be noted that in Africa 65-100% of seed used by smallholder farmers is farmer-saved and exchanged (varies by crop and geography) (Wattnem, 2016). The global commercial seed market has an estimated value of about US$53 billion and is expected to grow to US$113 billion by 2020 (Marketsandmarkets, 2016) with the African market contributing less than 2% to the current value (CTA, 2015). This presents a potentially lucrative market, but many obstacles have to be overcome to carry out a sustainably profitable business. Some of the bigger ones include lack of infrastructure, specialised knowledge, institutional arrangements and political bureaucracy. The genetically modified seed market was worth US$15.6 billion in 2011 and is expected to grow to US$30.2 billion in 2018 (AGPRO, 2013). However, a recent market report notes that conventional seeds are expected to be the fastest growing segment of total seed sales (Marketsandmarkets, 2016). ... Africa presents an untapped market but with very slow processes of regulatory and institutional development to allow GM crops to be grown. In the meantime, market expansion will be based on conventional certified seed and agrochemicals. Maize and horticulture are the two biggest seed markets on the African continent, with the maize market valued at about US$500 million and horticulture at US$250 million; most seed company activity takes place in this space (ACB, 2015). There is more recent interest in commercialisation of legume seed on the continent. The South African seed market South Africa has a dominant commercial seed industry, which is primarily geared to serving the needs of large-scale commercial farmers, with a dominant focus on hybrid, improved and genetically modified seed (DAFF, 2015). South Africa's marginal smallholder farmers also rely on commercial seed as a significant source of planting material, especially for maize and horticulture, although indigenous crops and farmer seed varieties are also used. Multinational corporations dominate the seed industry: Pioneer HiBred /Pannar, Sakata, Monsanto and Syngenta (GrainSA, 2015). ... The value of the South African seed market was estimated at R5.62 billion in 2012/13 (TASAI, 2015). The focus of both Bayer and Monsanto is on commodity crops: maize, sunflower, soybean, cotton and wheat. The value of the seed market in grain and oilseed was about R3.9 billion (about US$285 million) for the 2014/15 production season (GrainSA, 2015). ... Maize dominates the national variety list - there are 546 maize varieties on the official list; 308 are protected by plant breeders' rights and 162 are genetically modified (TASAI, 2015). There are 41 genetically modified soybean varieties on the list and 35 non- genetically modified ones, including 19 with plant breeders' rights protection (TASAI, 2015). Monsanto and DuPont/Pioneer Hi-Bred/Pannar own at least 85% of the seed business for the big commodity crops - maize, soybean (the second largest agronomic crop in the country) and sunflower. There is intense competition between them (TASAI, 2015). DuPont is planning to merge with Dow, which puts pressure on Monsanto to increase its scale to continue competing in seed and agrochemical markets. Bayer's strength is in agrochemicals, although it has a small seed footprint in South Africa. Bayer introduced its cotton seed to South Africa in 2014 and a new canola seed variety in 2015 (Breytenbach, 2015). It reportedly introduced these new varieties into South Africa in response to a direct call from farmers asking for alternative products (Breytenbach, 2015). Syngenta, Monsanto, Pannar-Du Pont Pioneer and Dow form SANSOR's committee on genetically modified organisms (SANSOR, 2016). Any activity that is likely to increase Monsanto's influence in this market in South Africa is significant given the extent of genetically modified maize planted, the country's staple food crop. The global and regional agrochemical market The global agrochemical market is estimated to be worth about US$33.4 billion (Macaskill, 2016) with the African market valued at around US$1.1 billion (R15-20 billion) in 2014 (Odendaal, 2014). The agrochemical market is dominated by Monsanto (US$15 billion), Syngenta (US$13.4 billion), Bayer (US$10.4 billion), DuPont (US$9.8 billion), Dow (with sales of US$6.38 billion in 2015) and BASF (US$5.8 billion); Chinese-owned ChemChina doesn't make divisional sales figures available, but total sale figures for all divisions (of which agrochemicals is just one) were US$45 billion in 2015 (Alessi, 2016). The South African agrochemical market South Africa uses more agrochemicals than any other African country, mostly for grain crop production (PR Newswire, 2015), yet it comprises less than 2% of the global market (Macaskill, 2016). South African farmers spent R2.3 billion on agrochemicals in the 2014/15 season (GrainSA, 2015). The South African agrochemicals market is estimated to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 4.5% by 2020 (PR Newswire, 2015). Major agrochemical companies operating in the country range from Bayer Cropscience and Syngenta to Adama, Dow Agrosciences, Philagro South Africa, BASF South Africa, Sipcam, Monsanto and Chemtura Corporation (GrainSA, 2015). Companies such as Bayer, Syngenta SA, Dow, DuPont and Monsanto South Africa sit on the executive council of CropLife SA, an industry representative body (CropLife SA, 2016). Bayer and Monsanto in South Africa Both Bayer and Monsanto are major manufacturers of agrochemicals, seeds and genetically modified seed (Court, 2016). Company confidentiality makes it difficult to ascertain market-specific market shares for any company. Bayer Crop Science in South Africa Most of Bayer's African sales are generated in South Africa, and a key part of Bayer's strategic focus for its business in southern Africa is 'expanding our seed footprint - especially for soyabeans and wheat - through further acquisitions, in-licensing agreements and partnerships' (Bayer, 2016). It owns a manufacturing plant in South Africa, has established a maize competency centre in KwaZuluNatal (Bayer Crop Science, 2016e) and has opened its first African SeedGrowth Centre near Johannesburg (one of 16 in the world) (Bayer, 2016c). The Centre will train seed company production staff, support seed companies in upscaling processes, act as a base for research in optimising seed treatment technologies and demonstrate how Bayer's equipment works (Bayer, 2016c). It is focusing on both the large-scale commercial and small-scale farming sectors. In March 2016 Bayer launched its 'Committed to the Future Pledge' at the South African Grain Congress, in which it promised to continue to invest more than 10% of turnover into developing new compounds (it should be noted that this is their core business and so does not qualify as an added benefit for South Africa). It also promised to invest in further initiatives, like its Bayer Forward Farms project, a knowledge platform that facilitates the sharing of knowledge between selected farms and the combined expertise of the broader industry (Bayer, 2016d). It is also actively pursuing the small-scale farming market. Bayer uses demonstration farms and training centres set up by organisations, such as the United States farm machinery giant AGCO to showcase its inputs (Maritz, 2016). It is involved in other projects like this in South Africa, Ghana, Ethiopia and Morocco (Maritz, 2016). ... Monsanto in South Africa Monsanto is a pioneer of genetic modification of agricultural crops (ACB, 2005) and the largest maize seed company in the country by sales (DAFF, 2015); it also supplies 90% of soybean planted commercially in South Africa (ACB, 2016). It has been operating in South Africa since 1968 and has licensed its genetic modification technology to other seed companies operating in the domestic market. In the late 1990s it purchased domestic seed companies Sensako and Carnia, thereby taking up a major stake in local seed and grain markets (ACB, 2005). Monsanto sells seed for alfalfa, canola, corn, cotton, sorghum, soybean, sugarbeets and wheat (Stucke and Grunes, 2016). Monsanto's purchase of global seed company Seminis gave it ownership of plant breeders' rights to a range of South African vegetable seed varieties (ACB, 2005) and access to germplasm. The Sensako purchase gave Monsanto about 45% of the South African agrochemical market for field crops (ACB, 2015b). In November 2016 Monsanto opened its renovated breeding centre in Petit near Benoni, South Africa (Van Wyngaardt, 2016). The 300 hectare plant breeding farm uses imported and local germplasm to establish new breeding crosses (Van Wyngaardt, 2016). Monsanto also pursues the small-scale farming sector through projects, such as Water Efficient Maize for Africa (WEMA) (Monsanto, n.d.[2]). ... ACB has extensively critiqued this programme for its use of Monsanto's genetically modified drought tolerant maize because the product has not been successful in the United States, and it is inappropriate for smallholder farmers, due to its reliance on the use of synthetic fertilisers and agrochemicals (ACB, 2015a). The project, which is supposedly meant to benefit small-scale farmers, leads them onto a technological treadmill with known environmental consequences and one that is difficult to escape. Farmers have drought tolerant varieties of their own, which are freely saved and thus always available and adapted to localised conditions. Genetically modified crops were also trialled in eight African countries in 2015 (SeedWorld, 2016a) with Monsanto's drought tolerant maize from the WEMA project expected to be released in field trials in Tanzania and Mozambique in 2017. ... 2016 - The year of the mega-mergers July 2014: Monsanto tried to buy Syngenta for US$46 billion, but the deal was rejected by shareholders. November 2015: Chinese state-owned ChemChina made a US$43 billion bid for Syngenta, which was accepted by shareholders in February 2016. This was the largest purchase of a foreign firm in Chinese history. ChemChina owns Adama (formerly Maktheshim Agan Industries), the world's seventh largest agrochemical company. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States approved the deal in August 2016 (Bloomberg 2016b), South Africa in September 2016 and Australia in December 2016 (Food Ingredients First, 2016). South Africa attached the condition that Syngenta's formulation plant could not be relocated outside of the country for an undefined period to avoid job losses (CCSA, 2016a). The deal was also approved by the Common Market for East and Southern Africa (COMESA) Competition Commission in September 2016 (Comesa Competition Commission, 2016). The European Commission has requested additional information from both companies and will announce its decision on the ChemChinaSyngenta merger on 12 April 2017 (Produce Business UK, 2017). A possible obstacle to approval is ChemChina's plans to acquire another Chinese state- owned fertiliser company, Sinochem, which was not mentioned in the applications for approval of its acquisition of Syngenta (Noel and Baghdjian, 2016). December 2015: DuPont and Dow announced a merger that will give the combined company an estimated value of US$130 billion. The deal was approved by the COMESA Competition Commission in September 2016 (Comesa Competition Commission, 2016a), but still awaits approval in Australia, the United States, Brazil and South Africa. The deal is being held up by the European Commission, which has launched a full investigation on the basis that insufficient information has been provided (Reuters, 2016a). The Commission will announce its decision on 6 February 2017 (Investopedia, 2016). May 2016: Bayer started the bidding process for Monsanto. The $66 billion bid was accepted in December 2016. If approved, the merged company will be the world's largest seed and agriculture chemicals company. If the merger is not approved by competition regulators, Bayer will pay a US$2 billion termination fee to Monsanto (Begemann, 2016). The European Commission will decide on this merger by 15 March 2017 (European Commission, 2016). It has not yet been submitted to South Africa's regulators. August 2016: Canadian Potash Corp. started negotiations to buy fertiliser producer Agrium for US$30 billion. The deal is expected to close in mid-2017 and will create the largest fertiliser company in the world; it also plans to expand into seeds and crop chemicals (Skerritt and Casey, 2016). BASF has been left out of the scramble to consolidate and may well have to buy up smaller companies, or sell, because it will not have the strength to take on the concentrated power of its competitors (ETC Group, 2016). Or it could benefit from forced divestitures of the mergers. If all the proposed megamergers are approved, these three companies (ChemChina-Syngenta, DuPont-Dow, Bayer-Monsanto) will own and sell about 60% of the world's patented seeds and pesticides/herbicides (AgriPortal, 2016)."}, {"title": "Press Release: AgJunction Enters Into Letter of Intent to License Automated Steering Technology To Reichhardt GmbH", "article": "AgJunction Enters Into Letter of Intent to License Automated Steering Technology To Reichhardt GmbH Canada NewsWire HIAWATHA, KS, Feb. 27, 2017 HIAWATHA, KS, Feb. 27, 2017 /CNW/ - AgJunction, Inc.

According to the President the initiative, together with others in the agric sector is aimed at ensuring all year farming through irrigation farming and also create jobs for the employed youth. He said, this will help curb the upsurge of food imports into the country to improve and maximize agricultural activities in the country as the district assemblies will also be tasked to identify and register progressive farmers in each of the 216 districts starting from the three Northern Regions. Delivering the State of the Nation Address to Parliament, President Akufo-Addo said: \"We have to irrigate our lands and equip farmers with skills needed to make farming a well-paying business. We aim to popularise farming by encouraging many people to take it up as a full- or part-time activity.\" \"A national campaign, Planting for Food will be launched to stimulate this activity. An amount of 125 million Canadian dollars has been secured from Canada to support the initiative. This campaign will be anchored on the pillars that will transform agriculture - the provision of improved seeds, the supply of fertilisers, the provision of dedicated extension services and marketing strategy, and the use of e-agriculture,\" he said. He said that far, too long, our farmers have been left to work by themselves without the necessary support from government. \"To initiate the campaign, the district assemblies will be tasked to identify and register progressive farmers in each of the 216 districts. For too long our farmers have been left to cope by themselves without the necessary support from government. For too long our farmers have been left to the mercy of the weather. We have decided to embark on a programme to provide water to enable all-year farming - we are calling it One-Village-One-Dam policy.\" President Akufo-Addo stated that, agriculture provides the best opportunity to use modern methods to achieve the lives of many within the shortest possible time adding that, \"We have to irrigate our lands and equip farmers with the skills needed to make framing a well-paid business.\" The Canadian Government is set to inject a total of $120m US Dollars (125m Canadian Dollars) into the Planting For Food and Jobs initiative being spearheaded by the Ministry of Food and Agriculture. The agreement for the release of the funds was signed at the Finance Ministry. It forms part of the Modernizing Agriculture in Ghana (MAG) Project which forms part of efforts by government to reverse the declining growth of the agric sector over the past eight years. The Minister of Finance, Dr. Ken Ofori-Atta, signed on behalf of Ghana whilst the Canadian High Commissioner to Ghana, Ms Heather Anne Cameron, signed on behalf of her country. It was also witnessed by the Chief of Staff, Mrs. Frema Opare Addo and the Minister of Food and Agriculture, Hon. Dr. Owusu Afriyie Akoto. The Planting For Food and Jobs is a new policy geared towards the modernization of Ghana's Agriculture and ensure food security for the country. The program will be operating under five main components. These are supply of improved seedlings, provision of fertilizers, extension services, marketing for produce and E-Agriculture. The Canadian government agreed to support the program after series of meetings with Ghana's Minister of Food and Agriculture. The amount the thebftonl;ine.com understands, will be released in five trunches over the next five years and will go into two main components of the program including purchasing and supply of improved seedlings as well as extension services support for beneficiary farmers to be captured under the initiative. Meanwhile, other development partners including the Korean and Israeli Governments have also pledged to support the program which is expected to take off in the coming crop season."}, {"title": "Full Text of Nana Addo's State of the Nation Address. [document]", "article": "Feb 21, 2017 (Ghanaian Chronicle/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- Mr. Speaker, It is good to be back here again in this Chamber, where I spent some 12 memorable years as a Member of Parliament. I recollect with nostalgia the vigorous debates of my days here as a Minority MP, and I have very fond memories of being on the Majority side also. I can see some old faces from my first days here - like the 2nd Deputy Speaker, Hon. Alban Bagbin, whom I came to meet in the House in 1997, and who became a good friend of mine; and Hon Osei Kyei-Mensah-Bonsu, the Majority Leader, with whom I entered Parliament on the same side, at the same time. On December 7th, 2016, the Ghanaian people went to the polls, and voted decisively for change. As a result, today, I am here again in this House, this time as President of the Republic, having secured an emphatic, electoral victory. Mr. Speaker, we have to thank God for His Grace and Favour for a peaceful and smooth transfer of power, in which Ghanaians rose to the occasion, and made our nation the object of world admiration. The Ghanaian people are to be commended for their strong attachment to the principles of democratic accountability. I would like to take this opportunity, Mr Speaker, to express my sincere appreciation to my predecessor, President John Mahama, for his leadership and his role in the transition. His conduct has been a credit to our nation. Mr. Speaker, I am happy to see the presence in this House of two other former Presidents of the Republic, their Excellencies Jerry John Rawlings and John Agyekum Kufuor. I am in the enviable position of being the first Ghanaian leader to be able to draw on the experiences of three living, former Presidents. This should, definitely, enrich my tenure of office. Mr Speaker, I congratulate you on your unanimous election to preside over the affairs of this House. It is a fitting acknowledgement of your distinguished service to our nation. I congratulate also your deputies on their appointments, the 1st Deputy Speaker, a respected member of the House, Hon. Joe Osei Wusu, and 2nd Deputy Speaker, the veteran legislator, Hon. Alban Bagbin. I commend also the Majority Leader, my contemporary in this House, who can now put his extensive experience of Parliament to use as Leader of the House and Minister for Parliamentary Affairs. My compliments go, too, to the new Minority Leader, Hon. Haruna Iddrisu, who announced himself on the national stage when he came here in my last term in the House. It is clear that he has an important future in Ghanaian politics. I want to assure him and the leadership of the House, on both sides, that I will co-operate fully with Parliament to enhance the governance of our nation to be able to do the business of Ghana effectively. Mr. Speaker, I use this occasion to commend the Electoral Commission and its Chairperson, Charlotte Osei, for the conduct of our recent elections, which has received domestic and international acclaim. In the coming years, I hope that our electoral processes will become even more robust, so that free and fair elections become automatic parts of our democratic culture. Mr. Speaker, certain incidents occurred during the transition period that are matters of concern to me, and should be to every Ghanaian, as they marred an otherwise dignified and successful transition. Wrongdoing has no political colour, and I do not subscribe to the lawlessness of political party supporters simply because their party has been elected into office. Mr. Speaker, when those incidents began, I instructed the then Inspector General of Police, John Kudalor, to apply the law, irrespective of political affiliation, to all lawbreakers. This instruction was also carried on to his successor, David Asante Appeatu. Both of them acted upon it, which helped to bring the situation under control. It appears these events were predicated on some concept of equalisation, as they happened in 2009, and were repeated again in 2017. I condemn all such conduct, and I call on all political parties, especially the New Patriotic Party and the National Democratic Congress, to ensure that this is the last time such undignified acts occur during our periods of transition. Mr. Speaker, I come before you, today, in fulfilment of the constitutional obligation that the President of the Republic gives a message to Parliament on the state of the nation at the beginning of Parliament's session. Since my inauguration some six weeks ago as president of our country, I have set to work, putting into place the members of the team who will help me govern. I have heard it said that I am behaving like a man in a hurry. Mr. Speaker, I am, indeed, in a hurry, I am in a great hurry. The times, in which we live, demand that we, all, be in a hurry to deal with the problems we face. I am grateful, therefore, to the Honourable House for the expeditious manner in which my ministerial nominees have been vetted and approved, thus far. I look forward to the House dealing with the rest of the nominees I send, in an equally fast and efficient manner. Now that the processes for the composition of the Council of State have been completed, I shall inaugurate the Council this week, which will enable me to proceed rapidly with the appointments that need to be done in consultation with the Council. The full complement of appointments should be in place by the end of March. Mr. Speaker, the conditions in our country demand that government machinery functions efficiently and at full force, and that nothing is left on autopilot. The conditions demand that all of us, each and every one of us, tackle every task before us with speed and dedication. Mr Speaker, to give a fair account of the state of our nation, I have to give an account of the state of our economy, of our governance and of our national culture and attitudes. This account will highlight some of the fundamental elements of the situation, and will not pretend to be a detailed, sectoral analysis of our condition. I leave that to the budget statement, to be delivered in ten days time. Mr. Speaker, I say nothing new or dramatic, when I tell this Honourable House that the economy of our country is in a bad way. After all, in the run-up to the recent elections, I said so, often and loudly. Some six weeks after taking over the reins of government, it gives me no pleasure to have to say that our worst fears have been confirmed, plus a few additional, unpleasant surprises as well. Mr Speaker, many get quite lost when economists start rattling figures and statistics. I will try not to bore you with a lot of figures, but I hope you will bear with me as I have to put certain essential facts before our country. You would recall that, notwithstanding the fact that the previous government had more than ten times the financial resources than any other government since independence, its management of our economy in the run up to the 2012 presidential and parliamentary elections resulted in a quagmire that necessitated the urgent intervention of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 2014. The IMF programme negotiated was ostensibly to restore fiscal discipline, debt sustainability and increase economic growth. The previous government promised Ghanaians that the reckless public expenditure that characterized the 2012 election year would not be repeated in 2016. Mr. Speaker, the promises to the Ghanaian people were, however, not kept. In fact, virtually all the targets under the IMF programme, as at December 2016, have been missed. Fiscal indiscipline, once again, reared its head in the 2016 election year. Total projected expenditure for 2016 was GHc43.9 billion (26% of GDP), but actual expenditure amounted to GHc50.3 billion (30.2% of GDP). The full facts of the situation have not been put before the Ghanaian people. It appears, from what we are finding out, that some GHc7 billion of arrears and outstanding payments circumvented the very public financial management system that was put in place to prevent such occurrences. These expenditures are being currently audited. Mr. Speaker, at the same time, revenue performance for the year was poor. The total revenue target for our country was GHc37.9 billion (22.7% of GDP), but the actual revenue came in at GHc33.2 billion (19.9% of GDP). Mr. Speaker, the combination of higher expenditures and lower revenues than projected resulted in a significant increase in the budget deficit for 2016. As compared to a target of 5.3% under the IMF programme, the fiscal deficit for 2016 was 9% of GDP on a cash basis and 10.2% of GDP on a commitment basis (that is on the basis of expenditures undertaken but not yet paid for). It should be recalled that, at the time Ghana entered into the IMF programme to restore fiscal discipline, the fiscal deficit was 10.2% of GDP. It is very clear, therefore, that the objectives set out in the programme have not been achieved. Mr. Speaker, the increasing fiscal deficits were financed by increased borrowing. As at the beginning of 2009, Ghana's total debt stock was GHc9.5 billion. By the end of 2016, the debt stock had ballooned to GHc122 billion. Ghana's debt stock now stands at 74% of GDP, after all the previous denials to the contrary. More debt was accumulated by the previous government in the last eight years than all other governments put together since independence! In fact, 92% of Ghana's total debt stock was incurred in the last eight years under the previous government. The interest costs on this debt have also increased and will amount to an estimated GHc14.1 billion in 2017. Mr. Speaker, the reality of the state Ghana's public finances today are quite stark. Today, as a result of policy choices, we find ourselves in a situation where Ghana's total revenue is consumed by three main budgetary lines: wages and salaries, interest payments and amortization and statutory payments. These three items alone account for 99.6% of government revenue. This means that anything else that government has to do outside of these lines will have to be financed by borrowing or aid. After eight years of the previous government, there is practically no fiscal space left. The persistent resort to borrowing for any additional expenditures to meet the aspirations of our people is also not sustainable. We cannot continue this way with our public finances. I will not allow this economy to collapse under my watch. We will reduce significantly the fiscal deficit this year. Mr. Speaker, Ghana's economic growth has also declined dramatically. Notwithstanding the record amount of financial resources at the disposal of the previous government, Ghana's GDP growth in 2016 (including oil) is estimated at 3.6%. This is the lowest GDP growth in about 23 years. Mr. Speaker, Ghana's banking sector has not escaped the economic decline and has become increasingly fragile. Bad loans in the banking sector have risen significantly. Economic and Financial data from the Central Bank show that non-performing loans have risen sharply from 11.2% in May 2015 to 17.3% in December 2016. The recent Asset Quality Review of Banks shows significant vulnerability of banks to current economic conditions, with many exhibiting significant weaknesses. Mr. Speaker, low growth, rising rate of unemployment, high fiscal deficits, high and rising debt, and increased depreciation of the cedi, high cost of food, housing and utilities and high non-performing loans, amongst others, are symptoms of deeper structural problems that will require a range of reforms, beginning immediately and spanning the short, medium and long terms. We are going to have to implement some tough, prudent and innovative policies to get out of this financial cul-de sac and rescue this economy, restore fiscal discipline and debt sustainability as well as increase economic growth. Mr. Speaker, it gives me no joy to tell the story of the economy as it is - as we inherited it. Too much time, energy and resources were spent in the past, in my view, without a deliberate, conscious assessment of their impact on jobs, and whether or not we were spending wisely to improve the lives of the people, communities and businesses. But, I was not elected by the overwhelming majority of the Ghanaian people to complain. I was elected to get things done. I was elected to fix what is broken and my government and I are determined to do just that. At the beginning of March, the Minister for Finance will come to this House to lay out in the national budget the details of our economic policy and the clear roadmap that we have laid out for taking the country out of its current predicament and onto a sustainable path of recovery, jobs creation and prosperity. I am absolute in my confidence that we have the programme, the competence, the commitment, and the goodwill of the people to turn things around. By the Grace of God, we will succeed and I believe this House knows it too. In the immediate term, targeted legislative policy and institutional reforms will have to be undertaken to unleash the suppressed potential of the economy and allow Ghanaian entrepreneurship to rise and thrive, domestically and internationally. For too many young people, unemployment is sadly the reality of the start to their adult life. For years, for generations, it was assumed and guaranteed in this country that the quality of life of every generation would be an improvement on that of their parents. We are now faced with the phenomenon of parents looking on in frustration as their grown-up children remain at home, without the means to strike an independent life by themselves. This generation of Ghanaians dares not be the one to reverse this natural trend. We must create the atmosphere that generates jobs. We must boost the confidence of the private sector to invest in the economy. We must have the courage to start building our future and take the hard decisions that need to be taken to grow our economy. We have no choice but to reduce the budget deficit and cut waste in all sectors of public life. We must complete the formalisation of the economy. The process for a comprehensive national identification system and a property titling system will be completed this year. That will boost confidence in our country and increase investment from nationals and foreigners. Then we will be able to generate jobs. We must boost the confidence of the private sector to invest in the economy. Mr. Speaker, I believe the starting point in turning round our fortunes must be with agriculture. Unfortunately, the state of agriculture in our country right now is not good. Farmers are left on their own. It is not surprising, therefore, that food prices are high and we are having to import almost everything we eat, including vegetables from our Sahelian neighbours. And yet, agriculture provides the best opportunity to use modern methods to change the lives of many, within the shortest possible time. We have to irrigate our lands and equip farmers with the skills needed to make farming a well-paying business. We aim to popularize farming by encouraging many people to take it up as a full or part time activity. A National Campaign, \"PLANTING FOR FOOD AND JOBS\", will be launched to stimulate this activity. An amount of 125 million Canadian dollars has been secured from Canada, a friend of our nation, to support the initiative. This Campaign will be anchored on the pillars that will transform agriculture: the provision of improved seeds, the supply of fertilizers, the provision of dedicated extension services, a marketing strategy and the use of e-Agriculture. To initiate the Campaign, the District Assemblies will be tasked to identify and register progressive farmers in each of the 216 districts. Mr Speaker, for too long our farmers have been left to cope by themselves, without the necessary support from government. For too long, our farmers have been left to the mercy of the vagaries of the weather. We have decided to embark upon a programme to provide water to enable all-year farming. We are calling it the one-village, one-dam policy. It is a programme that I expect will rapidly get the support of the population, and should help to transform food insecurity in our country. The three northern regions, in particular, will benefit from the availability of water to enable all-year farming, so that the enforced yearly migration can be minimized and food production become more predictable. I look forward to an increase in public investment in agriculture, starting from the first budget of my government. We must reverse the unfortunate trend of the past eight years, which saw a regular decrease in public investment in the sector that provides a living for the majority of our people. Mr Speaker, food processing has been the first step towards industrialization in virtually every country, and it is time for us to take it seriously. Not only will it serve to cut down on the wastage of crops during the high season, it will provide more jobs and expand farming business. Food processing will also save time in the preparation and cooking of our local foods, and there will be better control on the hygiene in the process. Mr. Speaker, I look forward to an exciting time in the agricultural sector. Mr. Speaker, if I were to ask each one of you in this Chamber, today, to tell me what the number one problem was in your constituency, I suspect there would be a uniform answer: JOBS. The most critical challenge, inherited by this NPP government, is the very high, unprecedented level of unemployment, particularly among the youth. It is a debilitating and confidence-sapping problem that affects every home. We can argue on what the official rate of unemployment is, but we can all see the desperation of our young people. They want to work, but there are no jobs and some of them are being driven to unacceptable behaviour. We have a veritable time bomb on our hands. To address this challenge, the government is embarking on one of the most comprehensive programmes for industrial transformation ever to be introduced in our country. The key elements of this programme are: restoration and maintenance of a stable macro-economy monetary and fiscal measures which will lead to a reduction in interest rates and a reduction in the tax burden on enterprises provision of reliable, affordable power to enterprises and homes setting up of a stimulus package to support existing Ghanaian industries and improve their competitiveness implementation of the initiative, through public-private partnerships, to establish at least one industrial enterprise in each of the 216 Districts in the \"One District, One Factory\" policy development of strategic anchor initiatives as new pillars of growth for the Ghanaian economy, including the establishment of petrochemical industries; an iron and steel industry; an integrated aluminum industry; the expansion of the domestic production of pharmaceuticals; the establishment of a vehicle assembly and automotive industry; the production of industrial salt; the establishment of garment and textiles enterprises; and the manufacture of machinery, equipment and component parts establishment of a multi-purpose industrial park in each of the ten regions implementation of a comprehensive programme for SME development establishment of an industrial sub-contracting exchange to link large scale companies with SMEs implementation of an aggressive programme for export development, targeting, primarily, regional and continental markets enhancement of domestic retail market infrastructure and the active promotion of the marketing and distribution of domestically produced goods improvement of the business environment through regulatory and other reforms, and establishment of a permanent consultative forum for public-private sector dialogue. We are confident that, through these interventions, significant job opportunities will be opened to Ghanaians across the country. Mr. Speaker, the Takoradi to Paga railway, connecting the Eastern and Western corridors, will be initiated this year to open up our country and provide access to our landlocked neighbours. It will also provide a lot of jobs. Mr Speaker, probably the most difficult problem, that has dogged this nation in the past five years, has been in the energy sector. This has caused havoc in small, medium and large enterprises. It has disrupted families and businesses and brought many organizations to their knees. The most obvious manifestation of the energy problem has earned us notoriety in the world, with the entry into Wikipedia and other dictionaries of the word DUMSOR. It is a phenomenon that has blighted our lives, destroyed appliances and collapsed many companies. The attempts by the previous government to resolve the crisis have led to a gargantuan debt overhang in the sector. We have inherited a heavily indebted energy sector, with the net debt reaching 2.4 billion US dollars as at December 2016. I have to point out the alarming fact that 800 million US dollars of this debt is owed to local banks, which threatens their stability and that of the whole financial sector. Indeed, the huge indebtedness of the energy sector constitutes the single major hurdle to Ghanaians enjoying reliable and affordable electricity supply. Mr Speaker, there has been some improvement in the power supply since November last year, but the challenges facing Ghana's power sector are far from over. The key problem is cost. We produce power from Akosombo at three US cents per kilowatt hour. The marginal price charged for businesses is an effective 42 cents, more than ten times the average tariff in West Africa. This makes it very difficult to start or run a business here and be competitive. The cost of energy destroys businesses large and small. It is the bane of the vulcanizer, the tailor, the dressmaker and the hairdresser, the carpenter and the wayside fitting mechanic. It destroys jobs. It compounds poverty. The current state of the energy situation in our country is unsatisfactory. The problems are enormous, but we must, and we will, confront them. I am proposing a number of policy interventions. We will improve on transparency in tariff setting, and introduce a new tariff policy that will reclassify consumer categories in order to protect lifeline and strategic industrial consumers. We will also reduce significantly some of the levies and taxes on the tariffs. As at the end of 2016, the Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG) had signed 43 Power Purchase Agreements (PPA), whilst a further 23 were under discussion. Government is conducting a review of all the Power Agreements entered into by the previous government in order to prioritise, renegotiate, defer or cancel outright, if necessary, in the national interest. Overall, we have begun to develop a national electricity masterplan, which will also explore the benefits of listing VRA and GRIDCO on the Stock Exchange. Mr. Speaker, my government will enforce the procurement law. We will insist on open and competitive bidding for power capacity procurement. This will not only reduce the cost of power projects and ensure value for money, but will also address the problem of unplanned procurement. Government will encourage increased private sector investment in utility scale solar and wind energy projects, as well as accelerate the development of mini-grid solutions in off-grid and island communities for lighting, irrigation and other economic activities. We will, consequently, review the Renewable Energy Act to provide further incentives to attract the private sector to invest. Mr Speaker, the Ghana Compact II programme has officially come into force. Both parties to the Compact, the Governments of Ghana and United States of America, are committed to complying with their obligations. However, the implementation of Ghana's commitments has faced some challenges due to disagreements between stakeholders, particularly between labour, ECG and the Millennium Development Authority (MiDA). We need further dialogue on the key issues that have generated these disagreements. We are aware that these discussions should be concluded urgently in order to arrive at the decisions that will allow for its implementation. We expect that all stakeholders will discuss these issues dispassionately and transparently, to ensure that all concerns are adequately addressed. Mr. Speaker, the success of all our plans and all our aspirations depends on our ability to educate our young people, and provide the opportunity for lifelong education to the adult population. Mr. Speaker, it is not an original statement, but it is a true statement: education is the key; education holds the key to the rapid development of our country; it holds the key to a better understanding and accommodation with our environment; it equips us with the skills required to deal with the world; education holds the key to the prosperous and happy Ghana we all want and deserve. Luckily, there is consensus amongst us on the need to provide quality education to all of Ghana's children. If I am in a hurry, I am in a hurry to ensure that every child born in this country attends school from Kindergarten to Senior High School; in other words, that is the basic education that each child is required to receive. We intend to reform the basic school curricula with emphasis on literacy, numeracy and creative skills. And just in case there is anyone left in this country who has not heard yet, Free SHS starts with the 2017/2018 entrants into the public SHS. We shall embark upon a vigorous expansion and re-equipping of Technical, Vocational and Agricultural schools and align all TVAET under the Ministry of Education to ensure standardization. The teaching of mathematics and science will take pride of place in all schools, as we aim to make understanding of the scientific basis of life a central plank in our schools. We will, thus, make the use of ICT a central feature of our national life. My government shall place teachers at the centre of quality education, and encourage professionalism among them. There will have to be some legislative reforms to ease some of the bottlenecks at the district level of supervision. By the way, teacher trainee allowances will be restored when the Minister of Finance comes to read the budget. We keep our promises, just as we shall ensure that our sports development is hinged on the revival of school sports. Mr. Speaker, there has been far too much tension in the education sector. It is in everyone's interest that the school experience is a happy one for children, teachers and parents alike. The happy and skilled population that will drive the path to development starts at school. We aim to provide the key to prosperity in our schools. Mr. Speaker, we have to be healthy if we are to make a success of the plans and aspirations we have. The National Health Insurance Scheme remains the best option we have devised to ensure that as many people as possible have access to health care in our clinics and hospitals. The scheme is not in a good state, and there are too many providers that are owed money. They are threatening to opt out and stop offering their services to the most vulnerable in our society. We shall restore the National Health Insurance Scheme to good health. And yes, the Minister for Finance will restore the allowances to trainee nurses in the budget. Mr. Speaker, government will work with Parliament to pass the Affirmative Action Bill to increase women's involvement in decision making at all levels, and enable us achieve our current objective of 30 per cent participation of women in public appointments. Mr. Speaker, the time has come to enforce the Disability Act and ensure its compliance, which will begin with access to public buildings for the physically challenged. The Minister for Local Government will also see to the implementation of the District Integrated Social Services programme for children, families and vulnerable adults. Mr. Speaker, our people can only prosper and flourish in an atmosphere of peace and security. Safeguarding the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the nation is critical for our progress. We will improve the state of combat readiness of our armed forces by improving the logistical infrastructure, and improve the welfare of service men and women and also of veterans. Our armed forces remain one of the best-organized and most professional in Africa. Mr. Speaker, I bring you greetings from The Gambia, where I was a guest last weekend at the inauguration ceremony of President Adama Barrow. Ghana should always take its membership of ECOWAS seriously, as its viability advances our national interest. One of the first issues that came to my attention, as soon as I assumed office, was the request from ECOWAS to send a military contingent from Ghana, as part of the ECOWAS Mission in The Gambia (ECOMIG) to resolve the post-electoral impasse in that country. Senegal was to provide 3,150; Nigeria 509; and Ghana 210 troops. I assented to the request as it involved large issues of regional stability, and the preservation of democracy and rule of law in a member state. Ghana sent 208 troops. The Mission succeeded in creating the necessary environment for the rule of law to be maintained, and for the rightful transfer of authority to the newly elected President. I saw with my own eyes how popular that event has been in the Gambia; and how popular is the ECOWAS mission. Consequently, ECOWAS has now put forward a new mandate which involves reducing the force to one of 500 soldiers, intended to be a stabilisation force. As from yesterday, February 20, Senegal will provide 250, Nigeria 200 and Ghana 50 troops in the force. Presently about 3,000 Ghanaian soldiers are involved in peace keeping operations around the globe. We need to do more to keep their morale high and empower them. We have decided that they should be paid their allowances at post, and not on their return. I am glad to say that this new regime of payment has been applied to the case of The Gambian deployment. Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to be able to inform the House that the outstanding arrears of 13 million US dollars for all peacekeeping personnel have been cleared by my government, and the contingents in the Gambia have been paid all their allowances in full. I have asked the Minister for Defence to come shortly before Parliament and make a statement on the Gambian deployment. There are serious difficulties facing our armed forces that are not unlike those facing other parts of our public sector. Overcrowded and inappropriate accommodation for personnel, inability to pay food and utility bills, and threats from providers to cut supplies; these are the everyday stories in all departments and our armed forces face the same problems. It is a regrettable state of affairs that will not continue under my administration. Mr. Speaker, the police are the first line of security and protection for citizens. We must have an efficient police service that has the confidence and support of the people. I am determined to give whatever support is required from government to ensure that we have the service that the people of Ghana deserve. We must get a more professional police service, where recruitment and training practices are of acceptable international standards. We shall continue recruitment into the police service, with the aim of meeting the U.N ratio of 1 police officer to 500 civilians, and also ensuring gender equity. All of us are agreed on the Ghana we want; a prosperous, united and peaceful country. Some countries have made progress in the economic field and achieved some of the results we desire. I have listened with incredulity, as some amongst us have advocated the harsh methods that appear to have helped some countries achieve rapid progress. Some, amongst us, seem to be flirting with the concept of authoritarianism and romanticising it, as an acceptable price to pay to achieve rapid development. Mr. Speaker, I have an unshakable and undying belief in freedom and the democratic process, and in their capacity to inspire rapid development. Development in freedom should remain our moral anchor. That is the Ghanaian way and that is the Akufo-Addo way. The rule of law should remain our guiding and unbending principle. Those of us in public service should acknowledge that corruption is one of the biggest concerns to the people of Ghana. It is the one subject on which a surprising number of people are willing to tolerate a waiver of due process. This is because, unfortunately, public officials are in danger of losing the confidence of the people in the fight against corruption. There is a perception that all public officials are part of a great scam to defraud the public and that they protect each other. It is in everybody's interest that the fight against corruption is transparent and has the support of the public. Mr Speaker, the office of the Special Prosecutor has been shown to work in other places, and I shall be bringing legislation before the House for its rapid establishment. I am satisfied that the Office will be established in a manner consistent with the Constitution. In like manner, I shall propose for legislation amendments to the current asset declaration regime to make it more effective. Mr Speaker, the people of Ghana have voted for change. All the various arms of government should recognize this strong desire on the part of the people for change. We continue along the path of business as usual at our own risk. Mr Speaker, my personal belief in and adherence to the concept of the separation of powers is well-known, and I do not intend to interfere in any way in the affairs of Parliament or the Judiciary. But I would be failing in my duty if I failed to say what needs to be said. Mr Speaker, all three arms of government, the Executive, the Judiciary and the Legislature need to take cognisance of the clear desire of the people of Ghana for change. All three branches must change the way we do things. I ask this Honourable House to take a candid look at itself and consider changing the way it conducts its business, if needs be. Mr Speaker, there are some areas of our lives in which we can all demonstrate the change for which the people of Ghana have voted: punctuality, sanitation and the care of the environment. Over the years, it has become acceptable practice that official functions invariably start and close late. We invite people to functions for 9am and start at 10am. I have heard some offer the preposterous excuse that there is something cultural about not paying attention to time. Mr Speaker, let us show that we acknowledge that change has, indeed, come by being punctual to functions. I intend to set a personal example. The other area of our lives in which we can and should start making a change is the care of the environment.. We are in danger of destroying our blessed country. Ours is a beautiful country. If we claim to love our country, we must take care of the lands, the trees, the water bodies and the animals. They are part of what makes Ghana. The change we have voted for demands that we adopt better and sustainable sanitation habits, and learn to protect and preserve our environment. Mr. Speaker, there is one subject on my mind that I wish to put before the House for consideration. I believe, in this 60th year of our nation, that the time is ripe for us to establish consensus on some national issues. It is important for us to have a conversation on how we name things that are of national importance to us all. I speak of the seat of the Presidency and Founder's' Day. In my view, it is not right that, 60 years after independence, these matters are still at large. It does not inure to the dignity of the Ghanaian Republic that such matters have become subject to political football. I believe we have to settle these matters once and for all, and in due course, I propose we have a national conversation and dialogue to this effect which, hopefully, will end in legislation that will reflect the national consensus. Mr. Speaker, in a few days' time, we shall mark the 60th anniversary of the independence of our country. Ebenezer, thus far has the Lord brought us. Mr. Speaker, we all know where we want Ghana to be, and we are aware we are not where we want to be or ought to be. We also know of the big dreams of our forefathers to build a self-reliant and self-sustaining nation that would take pride of place amongst the comity of nations. This anniversary provides us with the opportunity to reflect on our past and plan for the future. This is the Ghana we see - a new Ghana. We will put in place policies that will deliver sustainable growth and cut out corruption. We will set upon the path to build a Ghana that is not dependent on charity; a Ghana that is able to look after its people through intelligent management of the resources with which it has been endowed. This is our path, and this path offers a new Ghana. This Ghana will be defined by integrity, sovereignty, a common ethos, discipline, and shared values. It is one where we aim to be masters of our own destiny, where we mobilise our own resources for the future, breaking the shackles of the \"Guggisberg\" colonial economy and a mind-set of dependency, bailouts and extraction. It is an economy where we look past commodities to position ourselves in a global marketplace. It is a country where we focus on trade, not aid, a hand-up, not a hand-out. It is a country with a strong private sector. It is a country that recognises the connectedness of its people and economy to those of its neighbours. This requires a forward-looking vision for our country, enabling us to confront our challenges and embrace our opportunities, not one fastened in the rear-view mirror. It is a Ghana beyond aid. Mr. Speaker, thank you, and may God bless our homeland Ghana and make her great and strong."}, {"title": "Press Release: John Deere to Open Strategic Technology Office at Iowa State University", "article": "John Deere to Open Strategic Technology Office at Iowa State University Canada NewsWire AMES, Iowa, Feb. 21, 2017 AMES, Iowa, Feb. 21, 2017 /CNW/ -- Deere & Company (NYSE: DE) has opened a strategic technology office in the Iowa State University (ISU) Research Park, growing its on-campus presence in recognition of the world-class research, education, and talent development capabilities at Iowa State. \"We are delighted that John Deere is establishing a physical presence at the ISU Research Park,\" said Dr. Steven Leath, president, Iowa State University. \"This is a significant step forward in creating a world-class research park and fortifying our university-industry partnership model to promote top talent and innovation.\" Teams working at the Deere ISU location will focus on developing integrated solutions for John Deere's Agriculture & Turf and Construction & Forestry Divisions.

The reduction in net earnings was driven primarily by lower year-over-year nutrient pricing.

ADJUSTED NET EARNINGS AND GUIDANCE RELEVANT EARNINGS RECONCILIATIONS  MARKET OUTLOOK Agricultural and Crop Input Fundamentals  Nitrogen  9 Feb 2017 18:06 ET Press Release: Agrium Reports In-Line Fourth -2-  Potash  Phosphate  2017 ANNUAL GUIDANCE Based on our assumptions set out under the heading \"Market Outlook\", Agrium expects to achieve annual diluted earnings per share of $4.50 to $6.00 in 2017. We have maintained a range width encompassing approximately $300-million of EBITDA variability to reflect the risk and opportunity associated with crop nutrient prices and demand for crop inputs at this time of year. We are assuming a normal spring and fall application season, recognizing there is always a risk that inclement weather could affect the timing and duration of each season. Our earnings per share guidance assumes some recovery from current nitrogen prices during the key application seasons. Based on these and other assumptions regarding prices and demand for crop nutrients set out under the heading \"Market Outlook\", we expect Retail EBITDA to be $1.125-billion to $1.225-billion, and Retail nutrient sales volumes to range between 10.2 million to 10.6 million tonnes in 2017. Based on our expected increase in utilization rate for our nitrogen assets, we anticipate nitrogen production to total 3.6 to 3.8 million tonnes. Agrium continues its hedging program for gas requirements in 2017 and is monitoring the market to mitigate any upward pressure on prices through near-term hedging. Our earnings per share guidance assumes NYMEX gas prices will be between $3.05 and $3.85 per MMBtu in 2017. Agrium's expectation for potash production in 2017 assumes the full ramp-up of production following the expansion project at our Vanscoy mine. We expect to produce between 2.4 and 2.8 million tonnes of potash in 2017. Total capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $650-million to $750-million, of which approximately $500-million to $550-million is expected to be sustaining capital expenditures. Agrium's annual effective tax rate for 2017 is expected to range between 27 to 29 percent. This guidance and updated additional measures and related assumptions are summarized in the table below. Guidance excludes the impact of share-based payments expense (recovery), gains (losses) on foreign exchange and non-qualifying derivative hedges, and merger related costs. Volumetric and earnings estimates assume normal seasonal growing and harvest patterns in the geographies where Agrium operates. 2017 ANNUAL GUIDANCE RANGE AND ASSUMPTIONS  February 9, 2017 The financial measures cash operating coverage ratio, cash selling and general and administrative expenses, cash cost of product manufactured, and EBITDA used in this news release are not prescribed by, and do not have any standardized meaning under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Our method of calculation may not be directly comparable to that of other companies. We consider these non-IFRS financial measures to provide useful information to both management and investors in measuring our financial performance and financial condition. These non-IFRS financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. Please refer to the section entitled \"Non-IFRS Financial Measures\" for further details, including a reconciliation of such measures to their most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with IFRS. 2016 Fourth Quarter Operating Results CONSOLIDATED NET EARNINGS  9 Feb 2017 18:06 ET Press Release: Agrium Reports In-Line Fourth -3-  Expenses  For further breakdown on Other expenses, see table below:  Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization breakdown  Effective Tax Rate  BUSINESS SEGMENT PERFORMANCE  9 Feb 2017 18:06 ET Press Release: Agrium Reports In-Line Fourth -4-  Crop nutrients  Crop protection products  Seed  Merchandise  Services and other  Nitrogen  Potash  9 Feb 2017 18:06 ET Press Release: Agrium Reports In-Line Fourth -5- Phosphate  Expenses  Other EBITDA for our Other non-operating business unit for the fourth quarter of 2016 had a net expense of $115-million, compared to a net expense of $92-million for the fourth quarter of 2015. The variance was primarily due to:  SHARE REPURCHASES Pursuant to the agreement dated September 11, 2016 with PotashCorp, under which the companies will combine in a merger of equals, we are restricted from purchasing our outstanding shares prior to completion of the proposed plan of arrangement. No shares were repurchased under the Normal Course Issuer Bid in 2016 or the period from January 1, 2017 to February 18, 2017. During 2015, we purchased for cancellation 5,574,331 shares at an average share price of $100.25. OUTSTANDING SHARE DATA Agrium had 138,176,000 outstanding shares at February 3, 2017. At February 3, 2017, the number of shares issuable pursuant to stock options outstanding (issuable assuming full conversion, where each option granted can be exercised for one common share) was approximately 937,528.  The agricultural products business is seasonal. Consequently, year-over-year comparisons are more appropriate than quarter-over-quarter comparisons. Crop input sales are primarily concentrated in the spring and fall crop input application seasons. Crop nutrient inventories are normally accumulated leading up to each application season. Our cash collections from accounts receivables generally occur after the application season is complete, and our customer prepayments are concentrated in December and January.

As the voice of life science in Manitoba, our organization has witnessed a truly collaborative effort from our members, which speaks to the fact that we're in this together. When we grow together, we succeed together.\" The LSAM Awards Gala celebrates two Manitoban companies and one student who have pursued and produced outstanding research and development in the field of life science. Awards will be granted in the following categories:  Farmers Edge will be awarded for their exemplary vision and significant achievement in life science, paving the road towards future wealth and job creation in Manitoba. The company was founded in 2005 by agronomists Wade Barnes and Curtis MacKinnon who pursued the development of forward-thinking technology to improve practices in crop management. Today, these innovations help growers improve crop production, reduce waste and focus on sustainability. Farmers Edge has helped thousands of farmers across five countries, and employs over 350 specialists in precision agriculture. Manitoba Centre for Health Policy (MCHP) will be recognized for their innovative leadership and international recognition in the field of life science. MCHP is a research unit of over 60 researchers and graduate students within the Department of Community Health Sciences at the University of Manitoba, focused on the science behind what makes people healthy. Over 20 years ago, they began investing significant resources into linking large volumes of broad data sets. Their foresight from decades ago is now helping validate policy and program improvements in health delivery. \"Our research has the potential to assist and affect a wide range of health-based programs for many years to come,\" says Dr. Alan Katz, MCHP Director. \"Through linking these broad data sets, we have the ability to collaborate with various partners locally and globally. This achievement is certainly one worth celebrating, and we'll continue to build upon this success that shines a spotlight on quality research conducted in Manitoba.\" Scott Dyck is currently completing his PhD in physiology and pathophysiology at the University of Manitoba. His goal is to become a clinician scientist, and has demonstrated his potential to pursue a career in life sciences through his extensive training within Dr. Soheila Karimi's research program. This program focuses on regenerative medicine research, seeking effective treatments for spinal cord injuries and multiple sclerosis. Dyck hopes to eventually lead his own research program in regenerative medicine, improving the quality of life for patients with neurological disorders.

Valener - Adjusted net income per common share of 52 cents for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, up 18 per cent from the same quarter of fiscal 2016; - Normalized operating cash flows per common share of 32 cents for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, compared with 27 cents in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Gaz Metro - Adjusted net income of $88.9-million for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, a $13.6-million increase from the first quarter 2016; - Adjusted net income per unit of 53 cents, up 18 per cent from the first quarter of fiscal 2016; - Excellent results by the Quebec energy distribution segment; adjusted net income up $10.7-million from the first quarter of 2016 as a result of an increase in deliveries; - Construction of the LSR plant's second liquefaction train nearing completion and inauguration of the Bellechasse gas system; - Acquisition of control of Climatisation et Chauffage Urbains de Montreal SEC (CCUM). Valener had adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders of $20.3-million for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, a $3.5-million, or 20.8-per-cent, increase from the first quarter of fiscal 2016. As a result, the 2017 first quarter adjusted net income per common share stood at 52 cents, compared with 44 cents in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. These increases were driven by a notable increase in Gaz Metro's adjusted net income. Net income attributable to common shareholders stood at $23-million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, compared with $39.4-million in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, mainly as a result of a one-time accounting adjustment recorded upon conversion to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, partly offset by a notable increase in Gaz Metro's adjusted net income and a remeasurement gain recorded following a business acquisition in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Normalized operating cash flows stood at $12.2-million (32 cents per common share) in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, compared with $10.4-million (27 cents per common share) in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. The increase was mainly attributable to higher distributions received from Gaz Metro as a result of: an increase in units subscribed by Valener, in proportion to its interest in Gaz Metro; and an increase in Gaz Metro's quarterly distribution from 28 cents to 29 cents per unit starting in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. \"Gaz Metro's regulated and diversified portfolio, Valener's main investment, and its steady, sustained growth directly contributed to our excellent first quarter results,\" said Pierre Monahan, chairman of Valener's board of directors.   Seigneurie de Beaupre Wind Farms 2 and 3 General Partnership and Seigneurie de Beaupre Wind Farm 4 General Partnership generated a combined 3-per-cent increase in electric power production in the first quarter of 2017, compared with the same quarter of 2016. They generated operating cash flows for first quarter of 2017 of $15.8-million, compared with $18.1-million in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 (excluding a $12.9-million payment received from Hydro-Quebec). This decrease is mainly due to a timing difference between revenue recognition and cash receipts. Gaz Metro's results For the first quarter of fiscal 2017, Gaz Metro's adjusted net income attributable to partners, which excludes one-time adjustments, amounted to $88.9-million, a $13.6-million, or 18.1-per-cent, year-over-year increase, driven mainly by: higher deliveries by Quebec's natural gas distribution segment (Gaz Metro-QDA), as temperatures in first quarter of 2017 were colder than those in first quarter of 2016; higher net income generated by the energy distribution segment in Vermont, mainly because of an increase in the rate base of Green Mountain Power Corp. (GMP); and a timing difference between Gaz Metro-QDA's and GMP's revenue and cost recognition profiles. \"Gaz Metro began fiscal 2017 on solid footing. Gaz Metro-QDA's excellent results and the growth of our investments in both Quebec and Vermont were the driving forces behind the nearly 20-per-cent increase in adjusted net income,\" said Sophie Brochu, president and chief executive officer of Gaz Metro. \"What's more, with the acquisition of our partner's interest in CCUM, we are now the sole owner of this strategic asset that allows us to service, through its heating and cooling systems, the energy needs of several landmark buildings in downtown Montreal, where close to 100,000 people circulate daily.\" Gaz Metro's net income attributable to partners was $101.4-million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, compared with $154.6-million in the same quarter of fiscal 2016. This was largely the result of a one-time $79.3-million impact of a regulatory treatment related to employee future benefits recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, partly offset by the above-mentioned factors, as well as by a $12.5-million remeasurement gain following the business acquisition.  Segment information Energy distribution In Quebec  For the first quarter of fiscal 2017, Gaz Metro-QDA's adjusted net income attributable to partners totalled $64.1-million, a $10.7-million, or 20-per-cent, year-over-year increase that was mainly due to: higher deliveries caused by colder temperatures; a timing difference between revenue and cost recognition (this difference, anticipated in the 2017 rate case, is expected to reverse by the end of fiscal 2017); and growth of investments in the rate base. Gaz Metro-QDA's net income attributable to partners was $64.1-million in the first quarter of 2017, compared with $132.7-million in the first quarter of 2016, which had included a one-time $79.3-million favourable impact of recognizing regulatory assets related to employee future benefits. In December, 2016, Gaz Metro-QDA commissioned a 72-kilometre pipeline section in the Bellechasse region. In December, 2015, the Regie had given its approval to extend the network between the municipalities of Levis and Sainte-Claire. Given the winter season, completion of the project, consisting mainly of landscaping work, will be completed in the spring of 2017. In Vermont  Through GMP and Vermont Gas Systems (VGS), the energy distribution segment in Vermont recorded net income attributable to partners of $20.4-million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, a $2.1-million, or 11.5-per-cent, year-over-year increase, mainly due to the increase in GMP's rate base and a timing difference between revenue and cost recognition; partly offset by an unfavourable effect of no longer capitalizing the return on VGS's non-rate-base investments related to the Addison project since Jan. 1, 2016, in accordance with the memorandum of understanding signed with the Vermont Public Service Board fixing project costs at $134-million (U.S.). At GMP, the regulatory process surrounding the acquisition of small hydroelectric power plants from Enel Green Power North America Inc. is continuing and expected to be finalized during the third quarter of fiscal 2017. As for VGS, it commissioned the first 17 kilometres of its Addison project in February, 2016, and was waiting on a Supreme Court of Vermont decision before completing the work required to commission the 49 kilometres of new pipeline. In December, 2016, the Supreme Court of Vermont authorized VGS to continue the work without ruling on the merits of the appeal. VGS has since been preparing to complete construction of the last kilometre of the second section and to finalize the project. Gas-up is expected to take place in spring 2017. Natural gas transportation For the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the natural gas transportation segment generated net income attributable to partners of $4.9-million, up $400,000 from the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Electricity production The electricity production segment recorded net income attributable to partners of $800,000 in the first quarter of 2017, compared with $500,000 in the same quarter of fiscal 2016. The increase was driven by greater power production at the wind farms, as previously described, as 2017 first quarter wind conditions were stronger than those in the year-ago period. Energy services, storage and other The energy services, storage and other segment generated adjusted net income attributable to partners of $1-million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, unchanged from the first quarter of 2016. This reflects a notable increase in LNG (liquefied natural gas) sales volume, which, at 8.82 million cubic metres, was more than double that of the first quarter of fiscal 2016, partly offset by higher operating expenses. LSR (liquefaction, storage and regasification) plant In addition, construction of the second liquefaction train at the company's natural gas liquefaction, storage and regasification plant, designed to triple the plant's liquefaction capacity, is near completion and production is slated to begin at the end of February, 2017. Business acquisition On Dec. 21, 2016, Gaz Metro Plus, a subsidiary of Gaz Metro LP, acquired the interest of Veolia North America, its partner in joint venture CDH Solutions & Operations LP since 2006, for a cash consideration of $25.8-million, giving it 100 per cent of the issued and outstanding units and consequently control over CDH. Following this acquisition, the carrying value of the interest in CDH, which was previously accounted for using the equity method, was remeasured to fair value, and, in turn, a $12.5-million remeasurement gain was recorded in the segment's net income attributable to partners for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Consequently, the segment's net income attributable to partners amounted to $13.5-million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, compared with $1-million in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. CDH owns CCUM, which owns and operates a network spanning three kilometres, serves the energy needs of 1.8 million square metres of commercial space in downtown Montreal. The network is used for the heating and air conditioning of both commercial buildings and residential co-ownerships. Following this transaction, Gaz Metro Plus became the sole owner of CDH and, consequently, of CCUM. Gaz Metro plans on continuing to develop and grow CCUM over the coming years while continuing to deliver a safe and reliable energy solution at a competitive price to its existing customers. Financial initiatives On Oct. 6, 2016, Gaz Metro Inc. completed a $125-million private placement of first-mortgage bonds, which bear interest at an annual rate of 3.28 per cent and mature on Oct. 9, 2046. The issuance proceeds were lent to Gaz Metro at similar conditions and were used to repay existing debt and for general business purposes. Accordingly, on Oct. 31, 2016, Gaz Metro Inc. repaid a series of first-mortgage bonds in the amount of $125-million that had matured and bore interest at an annual rate of 10.45 per cent. Conference call Valener will hold a conference call on Feb. 8, 2017, at 1 p.m. Eastern Time to discuss its results and those of Gaz Metro for the period ended Dec. 31, 2016. The public is invited to join the call at 647-788-4922 or toll-free at 877-223-4471.

This was largely the result of a one-time $79.3 million impact of a regulatory treatment related to employee future benefits recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, partly offset by the above-mentioned factors as well as by a $12.5 million remeasurement gain following the business acquisition.  8 Feb 2017 07:45 ET Press Release: Valener and Gaz Metro Report Their -2-  SEGMENT INFORMATION Energy Distribution IN QUEBEC  For the first quarter of fiscal 2017, Gaz Metro-QDA's adjusted net income attributable to Partners totalled $64.1 million, a $10.7 million, or 20%, year-over-year increase that was mainly due to:  Gaz Metro-QDA's net income attributable to Partners was $64.1 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $132.7 million in the first quarter of 2016, which had included a one-time $79.3 million favourable impact of recognizing regulatory assets related to employee future benefits. In December 2016, Gaz Metro-QDA commissioned a 72 km pipeline section in the Bellechasse region. In December 2015, the Regie had given its approval to extend the network between the municipalities of Levis and Sainte-Claire. Given the winter season, completion of the project, consisting mainly of landscaping work, will be completed in the spring of 2017. IN VERMONT  Through GMP and Vermont Gas Systems (\"VGS\"), the Energy Distribution segment in Vermont recorded net income attributable to Partners of $20.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, a $2.1 million, or 11.5%, year-over-year increase mainly due to:  partly offset by an unfavourable effect of no longer capitalizing the return on VGS's non-rate-base investments related to the Addison project since January 1, 2016, in accordance with the memorandum of understanding signed with the Vermont Public Service Board fixing project costs at US$134.0 million. At GMP, the regulatory process surrounding the acquisition of small hydroelectric power plants from Enel Green Power North America Inc. is ongoing and expected to be finalized during the third quarter of fiscal 2017. As for VGS, it commissioned the first 17 km of its Addison project in February 2016 and was waiting on a Supreme Court of Vermont decision before completing the work required to commission the 49 km of new pipeline. In December 2016, the Supreme Court of Vermont authorized VGS to continue the work without ruling on the merits of the appeal. VGS has since been preparing to complete construction of the last kilometre of the second section and to finalize the project. Gas-up is expected to take place in spring 2017. Natural Gas Transportation For the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the Natural Gas Transportation segment generated net income attributable to Partners of $4.9 million, up $0.4 million from the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Electricity Production The Electricity Production segment recorded net income attributable to Partners of $0.8 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $0.5 million in the same quarter of fiscal 2016. The increase was driven by greater power production at the wind farms, as previously described, as 2017 first quarter wind conditions were stronger than those in the year-ago period. Energy Services, Storage and Other The Energy Services, Storage and Other segment generated adjusted net income attributable to Partners of $1.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, unchanged from the first quarter of 2016. This reflects a notable increase in LNG sales volume, which, at 8.82 million cubic metres, were more than double those of the first quarter of fiscal 2016, partly offset by higher operating expenses. LSR plant In addition, construction of the second liquefaction train at our natural gas liquefaction, storage and regasification plant, designed to triple the plant's liquefaction capacity, is near completion and production is slated to begin at the end of February 2017. Business acquisition On December 21, 2016, Gaz Metro Plus, a subsidiary of Gaz Metro Limited Partnership, acquired the interest of Veolia North America, its partner in joint venture CDH Solutions & Operations Limited Partnership (\"CDH\") since 2006, for a cash consideration of $25.8 million, giving it 100% of the issued and outstanding units and consequently control over CDH. Following this acquisition, the carrying value of the interest in CDH, which was previously accounted for using the equity method, was remeasured to fair value, and in turn a $12.5 million remeasurement gain was recorded in the segment's net income attributable to Partners for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Consequently, the segment's net income attributable to Partners amounted to $13.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to $1.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. CDH owns CCUM, which owns and operates a network spanning 3 km, serves the energy needs of 1.8 million square metres of commercial space in downtown Montreal. The network is used for the heating and air conditioning of both commercial buildings and residential co-ownerships. Following this transaction, Gaz Metro Plus became the sole owner of CDH and, consequently, of CCUM. Gaz Metro plans on continuing to develop and grow CCUM over the coming years while continuing to deliver a safe and reliable energy solution at a competitive price to its existing customers. Financial initiatives On October 6, 2016, Gaz Metro inc. completed a $125 million private placement of first mortgage bonds, which bear interest at an annual rate of 3.28% and mature on October 9, 2046. The issuance proceeds were loaned to Gaz Metro at similar conditions and were used to repay existing debt and for general business purposes. Accordingly, on October 31, 2016, Gaz Metro inc. repaid a series of first mortgage bonds in the amount of $125 million that had matured and bore interest at an annual rate of 10.45%.  8 Feb 2017 07:45 ET Press Release: Valener and Gaz Metro Report Their -3-  Conference call Overview of Valener Overview of Gaz Metro Cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements This press release may contain forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities laws.

In its second report called Path to Prosperity, the Advisory Council on Economic Growth focused on the growth and potential in the agriculture and food sector. \"A lot of what we have been talking about from an EMILI perspective -- the mandate and vision -- fits well with the report and the recommendations that are being made,\" said Ray Bouchard, chairman of the initiative's board of directors. \"There is a lot of alignment with what the advisory council presented.\" The initiative was launched last March as a not-for-profit entity chaired by Bouchard, CEO of Enns Brothers, with key academic and business leaders on the board -- including Sandy Riley and Bob Silver (an owner of the Free Press). Its mandate is to establish a national centre for the commercialization of machine learning in Winnipeg that would include significant focus on skills training and the ethical ramifications of the advance artificial intelligence technology. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that uses mathematical models (algorithms) to identify trends and patterns in data to predict the possibility of future outcomes. A handful of Winnipeg firms are deploying the technology already. Wally Trenholm, the CEO of one of them, Sightline Innovations, has been a catalyst in the EMILI process. Jo Kennelly, a veteran scientific adviser to a number of governments in Ottawa, is an adviser to the project. \"When Wally Trenholm and I first talked to politicians and government officials about it in the summer of 2015, it was the first time many of them had heard of the technology,\" said Kennelly. \"Now, 18 months later, we don't have to sit down and tell people what artificial intelligence is. The world has changed.\" It is believed the federal government will make multiple bets when it comes to funding machine-learning development. Proposals have been made from Toronto and Montreal that are based out of academic institutions. \"There is a camp out there that thinks it should all be about academia,\" Bouchard said. \"Our argument is that is not what is going to bring the true prosperity to the country. It is about embedding and commercializing the technology, making sure we have the people and can keep the intellectual property at home.\" The fact the economic council recommended the ag-food sector as the first to undergo a detailed sectoral analysis burnishes the initiative's standing. Manitoba might not be a hotbed for the growing financial technology or life sciences sectors, but it clearly has advanced ag-food activity. As well, the Composites Innovation Centre is among the global leaders in the development of bio-fibres. Sean McKay, the centre's CEO, said its development of a bio-fibre grading data bank will eventually require machine-learning technology integrated with precision agriculture to most efficiently produce the right kind of fibre for the manufacturing sector. Manitoba's manufacturing sector is also primed to benefit from the knowledge-based benefits of machine learning. \"If we really focus on this, we have the unique opportunity of attracting other manufacturers to Manitoba who are needing that ability to be able to understand the consequences of this digital technology and what it can bring to their business,\" said Kevin Lusk, an executive with the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters and a board member of the initiative. martin.cash@freepress.mb.ca"}, {"title": "Press Release: GEOSYS Becomes Anchor Customer of UrtheDaily Constellation", "article": "GEOSYS Becomes Anchor Customer of UrtheDaily Constellation  UrtheCast Corp.

Among the highlights were workshops focusing on intensive wheat management, grain storage, environmental stewardship and precision technologies. An agricultural engineer with Ohio State University suggested farmers move beyond yield data and soil tests in order to tap into other information streams available for their operations. \"What we're seeing in this industry is an evolution to digital agriculture,\" John Fulton said. \"We've always thought about yield data. We need to think about the other types of data we can collect.\" Fulton had several examples, including aerial imagery and the production observations that farmers should be recording throughout the year. One newer source of data can be gleaned from the equipment farmers use, including tractors and combines. With planters, for example, he used the example of variations in downforce that can be recorded associate to field position through GPS. Greater downforce can correspond to areas where compaction is an issue. Similar data can be collected from tractors in relationship to things like fuel, consumption, ground speed and engine torque. In some instances, the insights gained may help farmers look at their operation in a new light. Fulton used an example of two different soybean varieties in an on-farm trial to illustrate his point. One yielded five bushels more than the other. Obviously, the higher-yielding variety would be the better choice. Not necessarily, Fulton said, explaining that the cost of harvest needs to be factored into the equation. The higher yielding variety had the disadvantage of having a tough, green stalk. This more than doubled the diesel consumed by the combine, there was greater wear and tear on the engine and harvesting took twice as long. Indiana farmer Mike Starkey talked about no-till, cover crops and the reduced use of chemical fertilizers at his farm which lies within the watershed of the Eagle Creek Reservoir, the source of drinking water for Indianapolis. According to Bob Barr with Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis, \"We're excited by what we're seeing. The preliminary results from the latest study suggest that water coming out of Mike's tiles has less nutrients than what's already in the stream. That's exactly opposite of what you would expect.\" Starkey said the introduction of no-till to his family's sixgeneration operation has been fundamental to its success. He also relies on cover crops, after wheat, soybeans and interseeded into corn. While he uses cover crops mixes, there's a heavy reliance on annual ryegrass as the key cover crop species at the Starkey operation. Starkey wasn't sure as to how his yields compare to some of his neighbours but he is confident his family has been spending less money on inputs. With corn, for example, he's down to using 0.5 to 0.6 pounds of nitrogen per bushel of expected yield. Recommended rates for his region are about double that. While Starkey spoke about reduce nutrient rates, Irishborn, Cargill agronomist David Shortall said there may be an opportunity in Ontario to move toward a more intensive management regime for winter wheat. With nitrogen, for instance, moving from a zero application to 60 pounds per acre should result in significantly higher yields. Shortall even suggested rates as high as 135 pounds in fields where farmers suspect the greatest yield potential is available. Shortall also recommends the split application of nitrogen with perhaps 80 pounds applied in early April and another 40 pounds in late April for many situations along with the use of Sulphur and a fungicide to control disease and maximize the ability of plants to photosynthesize. Rather than focusing on yield, James Dyck discussed ways farmers can maintain the quality of their grains and oilseeds in storage. Dyck is the crops systems and environment engineer with the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. \"In the past 15 years, we've seen growth of three and a half times of the on-farm grain storage capacity in Ontario. Commercial storage grew by just one and a half times in that period,\" he said. The basics of storage is related to temperature and moisture content. With corn, for example, a moisture content of 15.5 per cent is recommended for storage periods of six months or less compared 13 per cent for longer-term storage. The numbers for soybeans is 13 per cent for short-term storage and 11 per cent for more than six months. Along with moisture, temperature is a determining factor in how long grain can be stored. Cereals, for instance, can be stored at 28 per cent moisture for more than 50 days - but only if the storage temperature is at zero degrees Celsius. At 14 per cent moisture, the same cereal can be storied for 100 days at 30 degrees or for an entire year if the temperature were to be maintained at zero. The message here, Dyck said, is that at higher temperatures the length of time grains can be stored is greatly reduced. One reason is that insect activity peaks when temperatures are from 20 to 30 degrees. Once a crop is harvested, it's important to reduce field heat and as bring the moisture content down to the recommended level for the grain type or slightly below that level if the grain is to be restored for longer than six months. Dyck said farmer should check their bins at least once a month for quality and use aeration to avoid the development of wet spots within the bin. The timing of aeration is linked to relative humidity, he said. It's a matter of identifying opportunities, a job that can be made easier by accessing Weather INnovation's Bincast service. Dyck also talked about the importance of managing fines in corn. These tend to collect in the central part of bins and interfere with air movement. There may be an opportunity to remove and clean and return, fine-heavy corn to storage or, for farmers with livestock, to feed it."}, {"title": "Long-distance learning: using proximal sensing technology to map vineyard variability.(GRAPEGROWING: WINE EAST)", "article": "The Ontario wine industry produces approximately 80,000 tons of grapes each harvest, primarily from cultivars such as Riesling, Chardonnay and Cabernet Franc, with lesser quantities of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Gris and Pinot Noir. Soils are variable as a result of widespread glacial activity more than 10,000 years ago, and many vineyards are situated on several soil series that can differ widely in terms of texture, depth of solum (upper layers of the soil profile) and water-holding capacity. (1) This variability in soil characteristics can impact vine vigor, yield and perhaps water status. Significant growth in the number of small artisanal wineries has permitted production of wines that are unique to individual vineyard sites and, in some cases, unique to specific vineyard blocks. In the past 10 to 15 years, this interest has expanded to include identification of unique portions of vineyard blocks (some less than 2 or 3 acres) that might be capable of producing extremely high-value wines based on yield, vine size or water status-based quality levels. Large vineyards are variable with respect to soil texture, moisture and depth as well as organic matter, cation exchange capacity and major and minor elements. Consequently, vineyards vary spatially in vigor, yield and fruit composition. Since 1998, research in Ontario has produced spatial maps that have quantified spatial variability in numerous vineyards with respect to soil composition, vine elemental composition, vigor, vine water status, vine winter hardiness, yield and berry composition. (2,5) Moreover, these variables have been analyzed to determine relevant spatial correlations among them. Maps showing clear vine size, yield and vine water status zones have allowed production of wines from these unique zones that are both chemically and sensorially different. Geospatial technologies include a range of information tools (such as sensing devices capable of detecting electromagnetic radiation including visible and infrared light) that permit the acquisition, analysis, management and visualization of geospatial data. This information can help growers modify farming practices so they can move toward the concept of precision agriculture. When geospatial technologies are applied to viticulture, there is a focus on understanding the spatial and temporal variability in the production of wine grapes in order to achieve ideal optimization of vineyard functionality and to apply a precision agriculture approach to both viticultural practices and winemaking. (6) As a result of increased availability, geospatial technologies are now widely utilized in wine grape production regions such as California, (7) Australia, (8,9) New Zealand, (10) Spain, (11) France (12,14) and Ontario, Canada, (2,3,15-17) and those technologies have proven to be a practical implementation tool for making observations about vineyard vegetative growth and grape composition. (18) However, remote sensing image acquisition from satellite or airplane platforms requires complicated and time-consuming data processing (such as the manual delineation of rows), (19) is restricted by weather conditions (20) and requires appropriate ground-truthing. (21) There are other sources of imprecision, such as inter-row soil and shadow interference, (20) masking of non-vine pixels (e.g., cover crop) to assess the vine-specific normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) (4,15,16) and, most importantly, information may not be available in time to implement critical management decisions. (22) The role of ground-based proximal sensors is to overcome many of the restrictions associated with satellite and/or airborne remote-sensing systems. (23) Generally, proximal sensing systems collect multispectral images in visible wavebands (i.e., the green and red) and in the near infrared (NIR), and then calculate vegetation indices and make inferences about crop growth. (24) The most commonly used index for mapping variations in canopy density is the NDVI. As previously demonstrated with airborne spectral reflectance imagery predicting vine size, (25) ground-based sensor measurements indicated a consistent association between vine size (i.e., pruning weight, an indicator of vine vigor) and NDVI over time in Merlot vineyards in northern Greece. (20) Ground-based sensors predicted the spatial variation of biomass production near veraison with variable precision; nevertheless, NDVI was correlated with vine size and best described by a quadratic regression. (20,23) Vine productivity in terms of yield was also predicted by active canopy reflectance sensors measuring NDVI in Greek vineyards planted with Cabernet Sauvignon and Xinomavro. (26) In another study, a mobile monitoring system consisting of GreenSeeker optical sensors and ultrasonic sensors assessed the canopy health and vigor status of vines in Italian vineyards. (22,24) NDVI maps clearly identified differences in vegetation, whereby low vegetation vigor (low NDVI values) correlated with high incidence of grapevine downy mildew, and NDVI measurements correlated well with vine phytosanitary status. (22,24) Linear correlation to stable isotope content in leaves ([sup.13]C and 15N) showed that canopy reflectance detected plant stresses as a result of water shortage and limited nitrogen fertilizer uptake. (23) The implementation of geospatial technologies aims to promote vineyard management based on efficiency and quality of production and to explore vineyard variability with respect to soil and vine water status, nutrient availability, plant health and disease incidence. (27) However, the usefulness of proximal sensing technology (in this case, the GreenSeeker technology) and its relationship with plant physiological measurements still has to be explored. The resulting outcomes of this research may allow a wider adoption of precision viticulture with greater focus on the best exploitation of vineyard spatial variability. Methods in brief Sites and cultivars; geolocation: Three commercial vineyards were chosen in the Niagara Peninsula of Ontario and included two blocks each of Cabernet Franc, Riesling and Pinot Noir (2-5 acres in area). The sites represented the following sub-appellations: Creek Shores (Riesling and Cabernet Franc at Lambert Farms), St. David's Bench (Pinot Noir at Coyote's Run Estate Winery), Beamsville Bench (Riesling and Cabernet Franc at Cave Spring Cellars). Soil types (1) varied substantially in these sub-appellations from moderately welldrained Chinguacousy (Creek Shores and Beamsville Bench) to poorly drained Beverly/Toledo soils (St. David's Bench). This array of soil types provided a significant range of water-holding capacities that impact vine water status. Vineyard blocks were GPS-delineated to determine shape using a Trimble hand-held GPS tracker equipped with TerraSync software. Between 80 and 100 sentinel \"data\" vines were identified in a [approximately equal to] 8-meter x 8-meter grid within each vineyard and geolocated by GPS. Field measurements and berry samples were taken from these vines. Soil moisture and leaf water potential ([psi]): Vineyard soil moisture (SM) was measured by time domain reflectometry using the Field Scout TDR 300 Soil Moisture Meter. The volumetric water content mode was used. Measurements were obtained over a 20 cm depth for all sentinel vines at three times during the growing season: berry set, lag phase and veraison. Vine water status was measured using midday leaf [psi] with a pressure bomb from Soil Moisture Equipment using a pressurized supply of nitrogen gas. Measurements were conducted only at the designated leaf [psi] vines ([approximately equal to]20 per vineyard), on the same days as SM measurements. Leaf [psi] was determined on mature, undamaged/ non-diseased leaves fully exposed to sun for between 1,000 and 1,400 hours. Yield components, vine size, berry analysis: Harvest dates were at the discretion of vineyard managers. Fruit from each sentinel vine was handharvested; clusters were counted, and fruit was weighed using a portable field scale. Cane prunings were weighed to determine vine size in all vineyards. A 100berry sample was taken from each sentinel vine at harvest and frozen at -25[degrees] C. Each sample was weighed to determine mean berry weight and placed in a beaker in a water bath at 80[degrees] C for one hour to dissolve precipitated tartrates. All viticultural data collection, basic berry composition analysis including Brix, pH and titratable acidity (TA) and monoterpene analysis (Riesling) were conducted as in Willwerth et al., (28) and berry composition analysis for Cabernet Franc and Pinot Noir (color, anthocyanins and phenols) were determined as in Reynolds and Hakimi Rezaei. (16) Spatial mapping; GreenSeeker proximal sensing technology: The monitoring system used in this study consisted of two paired GreenSeeker sensors, and a high-performance DGPS double frequency receiver with real-time kinematic correction (AgGPS 162 from Trimble Navigation). The GreenSeeker active optical sensor technology uses electroluminescent diodes (LED) to generate high-intensity light at the 660 [+ or -] 10 nm (red) and 770 [+ or -] 15 nm (NIR) wavebands. The LEDs are pulsed at 100 Hz with an average reading of 10 Hz, have a 60 cm-wide measuring pattern (61 mm x 10 mm) and a 0.01-0.12 m discrepancy. (22) The sensors sample approximately 100 measurements per second and compute NDVI values in real time; the files acquired were stored as NDVI data points in shapefile formats (. shp), which could then be imported to the ArcGIS 10.3 from the Environmental Systems Research Institute. Dates close to SM and leaf [psi] data collection were selected for NDVI measurements three times during the growing season. The inverse distance weighting interpolation method was utilized, to create a continuous surface (raster) of vineyard study blocks from all point-data variables (i.e., SM, leaf [psi], yield components and berry composition), and the classification method was based on natural breaks. Geolocated sentinel vines were plotted as individual points on maps. Results and industry potential In Cave Spring Riesling (see \"Cave Spring Riesling\" on page 82), NDVI observations correlated well with yield and cluster weight with the eastern side showing pockets of high values and the west side showing low values. Free volatile terpenes (FVT) were inversely correlated with NDVI, particularly in the eastern section of the block. In Cave Spring Cabernet Franc (see \"Cave Spring Cabernet Franc\"), NDVI demonstrated highly similar patterns with vine size and correlated well with leaf [psi], whereby low leaf [psi] values were found in the central and eastern side of the block. Berry composition variables (color, anthocyanins and phenols) showed very high temporal consistency in both years and were inversely correlated with NDVI. In Coyote's Run Pinot Noir (see \"Coyote's Run Pinot Noir\"), NDVI showed correlations with yield and vine size in the west side of the block; similarities with SM were strong, while inverse relationships with color were exhibited. SM showed very temporally consistent patterns in both vintages, with high SM in the west-northwest side and low SM in the south-southeast side of the block. In Lambert Cabernet Franc (see \"Lambert Cabernet Franc\"), NDVI correlated well with pH and berry weight. SM showed consistent patterns in both vintages, whereby the north side had low values and the south (southeast) had high values. All berry composition variables exhibited very high temporal consistency in both years and were inversely correlated with SM and somewhat with NDVI. Moran's I spatial autocorrelation analysis indicated that NDVI was a clustered variable in most blocks. In Lambert Riesling (see \"Lambert Riesling Vineyard\"), principal components analysis (PCA) explained 45.5% of the variability in the first two PCs; leaf [psi] and TA were inversely correlated with FVT, potentially volatile terpenes (PVT), Brix and pH (PCI), while NDVI and berry weight were inversely correlated with SM, yield and cluster number (PC2). The non-hierarchical classification algorithm k-means was conducted for three clusters and supplemented the PCA as a qualitative variable with observation biplots projected in different colors based on low, medium and high NDVI values. The low NDVI observations appeared closer to FVT, PVT and SM, whereas the high NDVI ones were closer to berry weight, NDVI and TA. Maps (see \"Lambert Riesling Vineyard\") showed that NDVI demonstrated very temporally consistent patterns in both vintages with high values in the north side and low values in the south; correlations were established with berry weight, cluster weight and TA, while inverse relationships were exhibited with SM and FVT. Moran's I indicated a 100% clustering pattern, further confirming results obtained from statistical and spatial analysis. Overall, high NDVI was associated with yield components and vine size, while low NDVI was associated with higher anthocyanins, phenols and color for the red cultivars and terpenes for Riesling. Summarized statistics were conducted for all the variables, and the most notable coefficient of variation was observed for yield (CV% 23.5-62.8 across sites and years), followed by high variability in vine size (CV% 22.9-38.9). These basic statistics for one of the vineyards are presented in \"Results for Yield Components, Berry Composition and NDVI.\" This underscores the potential of a precision viticulture approach for zonal management and/or selective harvesting.29 Likewise, variables associated with yield exhibited similar within-field variation. With respect to berry composition, the most variability was exhibited by anthocyanins, color and phenols in Pinot Noir and Cabernet Franc and monoterpenes in Riesling. Aside from establishing relationships among NDVI and other variables, it was essential to show that spatial variability patterns remained stable over time and that the spatial variability in yield components could be reflected in fruit composition. Despite the small vineyard sites ([approximately equal to] 2 to 3 acres), spatial variability was observed for vine water status, NDVI and berry composition. Maps confirmed to a great extent the relationships established by statistical analysis. Among all variables examined, SM showed the highest degree of temporal consistency across the years, followed by NDVI and berry-composition variables. In spite of the fact that not all of the variability in the dataset was accounted for by the PCAs (<45%), the relationships revealed were consistent across the methods examined and vintages and in agreement with current literature. The fundamental intent of precision viticulture is to delineate management zones, often based on clustering techniques such as k-means clustering. Coupled with PCA, k-means clustering for the NDVI further highlighted natural grouping structures associated with important yield and berry composition variables (i.e., phenolics and monoterpenes). If this study had been combined with a sensory evaluation of wines produced from the k-means-derived NDVI zones, differences in wine sensory quality attributes might have been profound. Moran's I results (see table on page 86) further supported the premise that SM and NDVI followed clustering patterns at the within field scale. The theory underlying the NDVI calculation is that the photosynthetically active foliage absorbs sunlight in the visible blue and red wavelengths and gives a strong reflectance in NIR wavelengths, a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum not detectable by the human eye; grapevine canopies encounter many environmental biophysical constraints such as low soil water availability, and therefore reflect less light (low NDVI). (25) Results acquired by proximal sensing are considered sufficient in terms of repeatability and correlations. These results suggest that yield components and vine size were important factors in NDVI variability, while berry composition variables (i.e., anthocyanins, color, phenols, monoterpenes) showed strong consistent inverse relationships with NDVI. Therefore, proximal sensing's usefulness was exhibited not only through consistency of the relationships established, but also through the simplicity of the procedure with respect to image acquisition, easier applicability and higher resolution than remote sensing technology, along with lower operating costs. Maps produced for all variables strongly demonstrated the spatial variability in the vineyard scale, which indicates that zonal management could be potentially feasible. Proximal sensing technology will influence future agricultural systems by providing optimal vineyard functionality resulting in ideal harvests for better winemaking. KEY POINTS Researchers in Ontario evaluated the usefulness of high spatial resolution proximally sensed observations acquired by GreenSeeker for mapping yield, vigor, vine water status and fruit composition in Ontario vineyards. The overall objective was to identify unique zones in the vineyards in terms of physiology, productivity and berry composition. GreenSeeker observations were collected from berry set to just prior to harvest by calculating the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Higher NDVI values were associated with yield components and vine size, while lower NDVI values were correlated with several berry composition variables, suggesting that proximal sensing is a practical tool for vineyard vegetative growth surveys and grape composition inferences. A SHORT DICTIONARY Geolocation: A technique used to determine the geographic location of an object on the earth's surface; i.e., the process of obtaining spatial information for individual objects, mainly from geographical location (latitude and longitude). Geospatial technologies: Sometimes referred to as geomatics, geospatial technologies include a range of information tools and techniques used to acquire, analyze, manage, store and/ or visualize different types of location-based data. Commonly used geospatial technologies include global positioning systems (GPS), geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing. Ground truthing: In remote sensing, ground truthing refers to information collected at the study site location. It may also refer to a process in which pixels on a satellite image are compared to site locations (at the present time) to verify the contents of the pixels within an image. It can involve acquiring the geographic coordinates of site locations with GPS technology and comparing those to the coordinates of the image pixels under investigation. Inverse distance weighting: A type of deterministic method for multivariate interpolation with a known scattered set of points. The predicted values of a given variable to unknown (unsampled) points are calculated with the inverse function of the distance from the unsampled points to the known (sampled) points. k-means clustering: A method of vector quantization popular for cluster analysis in multidimensional data mining, k-means clustering aims to partition n observations into k clusters (classes) in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest Euclidean distance. Moran's I: Moran's I is a common index of spatial autocorrelation developed by P.A.P. Moran. Spatial autocorrelation is characterized by a correlation in a signal among nearby locations in space. Spatial autocorrelation is more complex than one-dimensional autocorrelation because spatial correlation is multi-dimensional (i.e., two or three dimensions) and multi-directional. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI): A numeric index, ranging in value from -1 to +1, that is calculated by taking a ratio of spectral reflectance measurements acquired by devices operating in the red (R) and near-infrared (NIR) portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. NDVI is used to assess vegetation condition including plant vigor and is calculated using the following equation: NIR - R/ NIR + R. Given that healthy vegetation strongly reflects NIR energy and absorbs most of the red energy incident upon it, the NDVI value for healthy vegetation is often close to +1. On the other hand, water-, disease- or pest-stressed (vegetation) canopies will reflect more red energy, resulting in a lower NDVI value (close to 0); negative NDVI values are seldom found in objects of agricultural relevance. Proximal sensing: A form of remote-sensing technology whereby a sensing device is positioned proximal (close to) the object of interest. Information is acquired by ground-sensing devices recording electromagnetic energy reflected or emitted from targets of interest. Spatial resolution: Commonly refers to the size of the smallest discrete object that can be clearly differentiated and identified in an image of a scene, and is a function of the number of picture elements or \"pixels\" in the image and the physical extent of the complete scene (e.g., the surface area captured by a remote sensing image). The term \"pixel size\" is frequently used to provide an indication of potential spatial resolution.

The realities of climate change mean our province sees unpredictable weather patterns and resulting issues around water management, said Pallister. This is a challenge we must face together, ensuring we farm the best land better while allowing water to be retained in places that make sense. This will provide protection, not only for our communities downstream, but also for the agricultural producers who help feed Manitobans and countless others around the world. The premier announced Manitobas soon-to-be-revealed green plan will include an overall water management strategy, with measures to address drainage, pursue precision farming to ensure better management of nutrient run-off, accommodate the storage of excess water and ensure the retention of valuable wetlands. In his remarks at Ag Days, Eichler also announced the governments commitment to immediately begin consultations as part of a review of the funding structure of Keystone Agricultural Producers (KAP) under the Agricultural Producers Organization Funding Act. The current check-off funding structure creates needless administrative costs for farmers, KAP and purchasers of agricultural products, said Eichler. A review of the system has long been requested.

At the tail end of 2016, Canadian agriculture received the news it had long been waiting for: the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) declared that broadband Internet access in Canada is now considered a basic telecommunications service for all. CRTC intends to invest over $750 million to support this initiative. In spite of the lack of details contained in the announcement, in terms of future costs for Canadians and businesses, it spells good news for Canadian agriculture and consumers alike. High-speed Internet is important to modern living. In remote areas, the Internet can get choppy, simply due to high winds. Even precipitation can slow the Internet down to a point where work becomes impossible. The CRTC's focus on broadband Internet access comes at the right time. In agriculture, things will get much more interesting as getting sound data in real time will play a significant part in most farming businesses. Rurality, of course, makes closing distances a challenge, which in turn makes communication critical. Therefore, the need for better and more efficient communication through a reliable network becomes obvious. For meetings, sharing data - and most important, for anticipating unpredictable effects like climate change - access to data underlies almost every business decision. Crop prices and futures are also key information points for farmers who want to make their operations more sustainable. With devices like wireless sensor networks, network-connected weather stations, high-tech cameras and smartphones, farmers can obtain an impressive amount of environmental and crop performance data, collected by field sensors and cameras, and accumulated by human observations, which have been recorded via mobile smart phone applications. Farmers can analyze the data they have, filter out worthless data and compute personalized crop recommendations for any specific farm and commodities. But without proper, affordable bandwidth, all of this can be at best a very painstaking process. Farmers are no longer rustic laborers on tractors. Agricultural operations have gotten larger - much larger - and smarter as well. With precision agriculture, resources are managed more sustainably, which lowers the carbon footprint of farms. Adapting production input based on localized needs for each individual animal allows better use of resources to maintain the quality of the environment, while improving the sustainability of the food supply. This is what is happening already. What is not happening enough, however, is any systematic attempt to appreciate how more efficient Canadian farms could contribute meaningfully to global food systems, and increase profitability for the sector. Better Internet capacity can only help in this regard. Canadian consumers will also gain on many levels. First off, allowing rural Canada to connect with the rest of the world would help urbanites better understand agriculture. This could potentially be the most significant contribution from the CRTC's decision. Farmers will gain access to more data, but so could city dwellers. The great rural-urban divide could be narrowed, thus allowing citizens from both socio-economic segments of our nation to understand each other better. Over the last century or so, public discourse around how we support agriculture in Canada has mostly been fueled by misconceptions and confusion. We have seen interest groups repeatedly use ignorance as a weapon to serve their constituents. Data-driven debates can only bring farmers closer to people's kitchen tables. In other words, better virtual connectivity could potentially lead to better agrifood policies in Canada. What is more, Canada has almost 200,000 farms, many of which are still hobby farms. With access to broadband Internet service, it could become possible to operate small-scale farms more efficiently, thanks to better market access and perhaps in turn creating more variety for Canadians looking for locally grown products. One day, expectations in grocery stores and in restaurants could be more aligned with how limiting agriculture can be at times. This is may be a pipe dream, but if access to broadband Internet service can only accomplish half of what it is capable of, Canada will gain. However, we can only hope this access is affordable for farmers to use. Sylvain Charlebois is Dean of the Faculty of Management, Professor of Food Distribution and Policy, Dalhousie University.
