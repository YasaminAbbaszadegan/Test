The Court made the ruling after a trial involving key witnesses from both Farmers Edge and Farmobile. Among the evidence reviewed was the fact that Farmobile's founders filed patent applications and founded Farmobile merely a few weeks after they left Crop Ventures, and that the patent applications were similar to work done at Crop Ventures. The Court found that \"the factual backdrop that led to this lawsuit\" and \"the close temporal connection between the individual defendants' departure from Crop Ventures and their design and development of a competing product at least suggests trade secret misappropriation.\" Based on a detailed review of the evidence, the Court found that Farmers Edge acted in good faith in bringing a claim against Farmobile and its founders under the DTSA. Farmers Edge believes that the legal and factual support discussed in the opinion should pave the way for a successful outcome in this case. In the summary judgment granted to Farmobile earlier this year, the Court focused on Farmobile's admission that it abandoned its United States patent application because of prior art. The recent ruling in favor of Farmers Edge stated, \"this Court's finding that the allegedly misappropriated information was not secret and was known in the industry will undoubtedly be challenged and could well be reversed.\" \"We're pleased with the Court's order to dismiss Farmobile's claim. Getting to the truth is not always simple, but Farmers Edge stands for what is right,\" said Farmers Edge CEO Wade Barnes. \"From the beginning, we were confident the Court would recognize that the credibility of our testimonies was consistent with the evidence and relevant facts of the case.

This is the Canadian India Acceleration Programme (CIAP), aimed at female technology entrepreneurs from both countries. Ten leaders of such enterprises will be mentored at Carleton University in Ottawa, the capital of Canada, so they can potentially expand into the North American market. Similarly, 10 Canadian women entrepreneurs will head to India to try and reach that vast market. Carleton's Canada-India Centre for Excellence (CICE) has created CIAP in partnership with the All India Council for Technical Education, the national regulator for a network of 10,500 colleges and institutes. The programme will run five years and during that period, 100 entrepreneurs, 50 from each country, will get the opportunity of entering a new market. Harry Sharma, manager of CICE, said the cohort of 10 entrepreneurs will arrive in late September and they were selected from among some 700 applicants after three rounds of appraisal by AICTE. \"Our experts will look at their potential and try and help get them traction in the North American market,\" he said. This will include access to the university's Lead to Win incubator. The \"key criteria\", Sharma said, is that these entrepreneurs offered a technology-oriented product. Agrowave, for instance, is working on incorporating technology to bring logistics support to the fruits and vegetables supply chain in the unorganised sector. Interestingly, several of these startups have a rural emphasis - ranging from a desi drone for precision agriculture and smart farming to a portable cold storage system using solar energy, solar electric stoves and biotoilets. Given the demographic and challenges women face in India, one startup is working on a wearable smart belt with an automatic kidnapping or rape detection mechanism. The women hail from every region of India - from Haryana and Punjab in the north, to West Bengal in the east, to Tamil Nadu and Karnataka in the south, and Maharashtra and Gujarat in the west. Sharma said they had designed a \"holistic programme\" targeting startups that are \"mature enough to enter the global market\". But since women entrepreneurs \"have not been getting their fair share in starting their own businesses\", it gets them access to financing, training, mentoring by experts and entry into an established tech ecosystem. The Canadian companies will head to India in the first quarter of 2019. Applications were invited in late July and by the end of this month, 10 startups will be selected.

Gross profit was 39.3 per cent compared with 41.3 per cent in the second quarter of 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a lower margin mix of products sold versus the prior year.

(TSX: AJX) (\"AgJunction\" or the \"Company\"), a leader in advanced guidance and autosteering, is reporting financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2018. All currency amounts are expressed in U.S. dollars. Second Quarter 2018 Financial Summary vs. Second Quarter 2017  Year-to-Date 2018 Financial Summary vs. 2017  Management Commentary \"AgJunction continued its year-over-year growth during the second quarter despite the uncertainty facing the worldwide agricultural market, \" said Dave Vaughn, president and CEO of AgJunction. \"Farmers that have invested in Precision Ag equipment continue to experience lower cost and higher yields, helping them cope with the effects of higher tariffs and lower grain prices. \"During the second quarter, AgJunction continued its investment in research and development, making significant progress with our Hands-Free Farm mission to bring autosteering to all farmers. Yesterday we announced Wheelman(TM) powered by Whirl(TM), our revolutionary new autosteering device and smart software that is priced to bring Precision Ag within the reach of millions of smaller farms. \"Looking to the second half of 2018, our financial results will benefit from the large bulk purchase order we began shipping in July. In fact, we anticipate the purchase order will help us drive both revenue and profit, even as we continue to invest heavily in R&D. We believe this investment, as well as the launch of Wheelman, expands the market by bringing precision technology currently available to only the largest farm operations to millions of smaller farms. We believe creating revolutionary products and opening new markets is key to driving shareholder value.\" Second Quarter 2018 Financial Results Total revenue in the second quarter of 2018 increased 3% to $13.8 million compared to $13.3 million in the second quarter of 2017. This was driven by an increase in sales in the Company's Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region. Gross profit in the second quarter of 2018 was $5.4 million compared to $5.5 million in the second quarter of 2017. Gross profit was 39.3% compared to 41.3% in the second quarter of 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a lower margin mix of products sold versus the prior year. Total operating expenses increased to $7.7 million compared to $6.0 million in the second quarter of 2017, primarily due to higher R&D costs associated with new corporate initiatives, as the Company invests in improving and developing new products. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses increased to 56.3% compared to 45.3% in the second quarter of 2017. Net loss in the second quarter was $2.3 million or $(0.02) per share, compared to a net loss of $(0.5) million or $0.00 per share in the second quarter of 2017. The decrease was driven by the aforementioned increase in operating expenses as the company continues to make investments in R&D. EBITDA in the second quarter of 2018 was $(1.9) million compared to $(0.0) million in the second quarter of 2017. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the second quarter of 2018 totaled $11.0 million compared to $13.9 million at the end of 2017. The Company used some cash to build inventory ahead of the large bulk purchase it began to deliver in July. Working capital was $17.7 million at the end of the second quarter compared to $20.3 million at the end of 2017. The Company continues to carry no debt and has access to its full $3.0 million line of credit. Year-to-Date 2018 Financial Results Total revenue in the first six months of 2018 increased 6% to $29.6 million compared to $27.9 million in the same period of 2017. This was driven by an increase in sales in the Company's EMEA region. Gross profit in the first six months of 2018 was $12.2 million compared to $12.3 million in the same period of 2017. Gross profit was 41.3% compared to 44.2% in the same period of 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a lower margin mix of products sold versus the prior period. Total operating expenses increased to $15.6 million compared to $12.3 million in the prior year period, primarily due to higher R&D costs related to the Company investing in improving and developing new products. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses increased to 52.7% compared to 43.9% in the first six months of 2017. Net loss in the first six months of 2017 was $3.3 million or $(0.03) per share, compared to net income of $3.1 million or $0.02 per share in the same period of 2017. The decrease was driven by the aforementioned increase in operating expenses associated with the Company's investments in R&D.

Wade Barnes grew up in rural Manitoba and has always been involved in farming, and he's still at it, but in a different way -- growing data. \"My vision has always been for the farmer's benefit. To understand what farmers need, I had to put my money where my mouth is,\" says Mr. Barnes, president and CEO of Farmers Edge Inc. in Winnipeg. Perhaps the biggest decision he made in his career was to become a co-founder with Curtis McKinnon of Farmers Edge in 2005. It meant shifting from working as a crop advisor to developing cloud-based information tools that help farmers manage their operations from a laptop or mobile phone. \"Farmers make a minimum of 50 key decisions in a cropping season. One poor decision can affect the next one, and can ultimately affect their [crop] yield,\" Mr. Barnes says. \"There's a wealth of information available at their fingertips to make the best possible decisions to support their operation.\" The idea of Farmers Edge is to deliver that data, literally, to farmers' fingertips, wherever the farmer may be located. \"Farmers should be using their data to make independent, informed decisions that bring more value to their operations,\" Mr. Barnes says. Today, Farmers Edge has grown to more than 450 employees and operates in five countries, with its headquarters in Winnipeg. It's part of a digital revolution in agriculture -- referred to as precision agriculture -- moving faster than you can spell E-I-E-I-O. A 2015 study by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln found that in that year, more than 90 per cent of farmers in that state who were surveyed were already using scientific soil sampling techniques and were connecting their farming data to cellphones and high-speed internet. Farmers there were adopting satellite and aerial imagery and using sensors to detect chlorophyll and \"greenness\" levels to analyze their growing crops. A 2016 report by Goldman Sachs predicted that by 2050, world yields will increase by 70 per cent thanks to digital data being applied to farming, even though the amount of arable land available will either remain the same or shrink. \"The world faces a substantial challenge to feed itself ...,\" Goldman Sachs says. \"How in a world of falling arable land is this possible? Our answer is the end of the analog age of farming. \"New winners and losers will emerge from this shift to digital agriculture, as will new entrants who want a slice of a total addressable market growing to [US]$240 billion by 2050,\" the Goldman Sachs report says. Farmers Edge decided more than a decade ago to be part of this growing market. \"One thing I learned about success is that you don't have to have $500-million to make a change. Technology has made it possible for anyone to make an impact -- with a great idea that truly makes a difference,\" Mr. Barnes says. Ron Osborne, chief strategy officer for Farmers Edge, says a key decision for the company has been to avoid being dazzled by the technology itself and to focus instead on what the technology can do for farmers. \"We took the consulting business that we had, and the information we had for farmers and automated it,\" Mr. Osborne says. To build the company, Farmers Edge also had to make some important business decisions, Mr. Osborne adds. \"The first was to go out and seek external investment capital. We're doing hard things -- there's no 'easy' button in agriculture,\" he says. \"We used [venture capital] funding to build out our technology, including an accurate weather data system. We built our own system with thousands of data gathering stations around the world,\" Mr. Osborne explains. In addition to Canada, Farmers Edge now operates in the United States, Australia, Brazil and Russia. It has about 2,000 clients among the 200,000 farms in Canada. Rather than rely on government weather data, which is collected over larger areas, Farmers Edge deploys its own sensors at closer range on clients farms. Farmers can use the precision data to provide more accurate information about weather conditions to insurers, to make sure their farms receive coverage or payouts from crop insurance. In the era of climate change and cataclysmic weather swings, \"the more accurate your weather data, the more accurate your crop growth models will be. With our model, there's tangible value -- the farmer can see the weather data being gathered at the end of the field.\" Another key tech decision has been to make sure the various types of agricultural data Farmers Edge gathers can be connected and interrelated quickly, so farmers can use it. \"We built our own proprietary system,\" Mr. Osborne says. Mr. Osborne and Mr. Barnes know they will face headwinds as agricultural giants such as Monsanto move rapidly into digital farming. \"Monsanto has a different vision of the world than we do,\" Mr. Osborne says. In his view, the large competitor's vision is to connect its farmer clients to an entire digital farming operating system, the way computer users opt to tie in with either Apple's iOS or Windows, and then collating the information it gets from all clients to build its products. \"We envision empowering farmers in a more independent way, so that farmers can make their own decisions without a corporation using the information they gather for the corporation's own purposes,\" he says. That's why, as Farmers Edge is growing as a tech company, Mr. Barnes says he has gotten directly into farming again. \"To truly understand what the farmer needs, I rented land from an Indigenous reserve and farm it. You get a different appreciation when it's your money in harm's way and the decisions that you make can cost you,\" he says. \"I've embraced Silicon Valley, but we put the farmer first.

Real-time Photo Recognition of Threats to Canadian Crops", "article": "2018 JUL 30 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Journal of Engineering -- In a preview of how artificial intelligence (A.I.) is modernizing agriculture, xarvio(TM) - The Digital Farming Company released its xarvio(TM) scouting app for the Canadian market at Ag in Motion, the largest agricultural trade show in Western Canada, showcasing the latest technology in the industry. Featuring instant photo recognition, the scouting app allows growers to more efficiently identify and map weed and disease threats in their fields so they can better manage crop health. The app is powered by advanced machine learning algorithms that continually improve precision and functionality through A.I. and data sharing. \"The unique crowd-sourcing feature on the xarvio(TM) scouting app will alert Canadian growers to potential disease threats before they reach their land,\" said Warren Bills, Business Development Manager for xarvio(TM). \"Through an ever-growing database of weed and disease images, growers across Canada and around the globe can work together to crowd-source solutions to crop management challenges worldwide.\" Crop scouting is time-consuming and requires detailed knowledge. The scouting app removes these barriers, allowing more acres to be scouted by anyone with a smartphone and providing weed and disease information to growers collected in the nearby area. Unlike other apps in the agriculture marketplace, the xarvio(TM) scouting app identifies threats through instant photo recognition, allowing growers to efficiently identify threats in their fields so they can better manage crop health in-season. Now available in Canada, the scouting app was launched in Europe in November 2017 and is operational in 90 countries worldwide with over 58,000 users. The app has amassed a database of 150,000 weed and disease images and is on track to add an additional 100,000 images this year. Farmers and leading research partners across the globe - including three influential partners in Canada: University of Alberta, University of Saskatchewan, and the nonprofit organization, Farming Smarter in Alberta - contribute to this ever-growing image database. \"Our ambition is to help farmers grow healthy crops more efficiently and profitably with innovative technology - and create a more sustainable agriculture industry,\" said Warren Bills. To bring instant weed and disease identification to your crops today, download the app for free from the App Store and Google Play by searching \"xarvio Scouting\".

THE third week of our seven-week journey of scholars, we spend in Washington DC, visiting policymakers from Congress, the US Farmers Union and many other farming representatives to get a first-hand insight into farming in the US and the world. The US is a net exporter of agricultural products and farmers and the National Farmers' Union (NFU), are seriously worried about possible retaliatory tariffs from other nations. A loss of free trade would be a disaster for them, they say, especially combined with the difficulty of getting agricultural workers. Andrew Warmsley from the American Farm Bureau mentioned that many crops are now lost due to a lack of a legal workforce and that agriculture in the US 'outswings its size'. Agricultural policy and support in the US is very reactionary. A small amount only is spent on conservation and the rest is for disaster relief -- to compensate for crop losses; price losses and for nutrition programmes -- which is a nice word for food stamps. I was shocked to hear that a large percentage of Americans cannot afford to buy food. The money for food banks comes from the agricultural budget and accounts for over 75% of it. Matt Purdue from the NFUpointed out that the share of income is minimal compared to the retailer -- a farmer gets $0.71 per pack of bacon, while the retailer gets $3.99. I suppose this is the same story all over the world. I always wonder why there aren't more farmers selling their own produce directly to the customers. One of the 2018 Nuffield scholars has a Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) scheme is Canada and he produces and supplies organic vegetables, fruit, meat and eggs to 200 customers who pay a yearly subscription for a weekly box of produce. Dana O'Brien from BIO (Biotechnology Innovation Organisation) believes that gene editing will provide many solutions for agriculture and that in the next 5-10 years a lot more genetic tools will be available to farmers. There will be also be much better use of data and also precision farming. Increased mechanisation with the use of drones to control farming operations will become commonplace, he says. My fellow traveller from Wales - Jonathon Gill - revelled in this statement as he has already created the 'Hands-free hectare'. He works for Harper Adams University in the UK and was behind the first farmer-less agricultural crop - all the machinery was operated by Jonathon's drone. Another major shift in the agricultural field is the change in how people buy food. Amazon is the largest online food retailer and about 1 in 10 shoppers buy groceries online and this will only increase. Amazon has recently purchased 'Wholefoods', one of the largest organic supermarkets in the US and Canada. I would never have believed that people could ever shop for food on the internet, but it happens right now. There is no financial support for organic farming in the US, but nevertheless, it's booming and the growing demand can't be met by production. With increasing food scares and more scientific proof that many pesticides and concoction are dangerous to human health and disastrous for the environment -- there will be a worldwide increased demand for organic food. Producers will find it hard to keep up with this consumer demand. The global organic food and beverage market was valued at USD 124.76 billion in 2017, with an expected growth rate of 14.5% annually between 2017 and 2024.. In simple terms -- the sale of organic food will nearly triple within the next six years. And so, for the rest of week 3 we moved to Texas. We first stayed in Fort Worth - also known as \"Cow Town\" and it's still a real cowboy town with saloons, wide streets -- the real Texas. I'm in danger of giving out a little about my week's stay because we had a wonderful week and met the most hospitable, warm people and real gentlemen, the kind who take their cowboy hats off when they meet a woman in the street. Texas in early April is also absolutely stunning -- fresh green grass and lots of trees to provide shelter for cows. You could nearly call it agro-forestry -- I know it's not always like that and in a couple of months it'll be all brown and unbearably hot. It took me a couple of days to get used to their farming terminology. They call livestock farming \"ranching\" and cereal growing \"farming\" and vegetable farming seems to be restricted to watermelons! And that prompts my gentle giving out: I saw no vegetables anywhere in the seven days I stayed there, apart from potatoes in the form of chips, and cabbage in the form of coleslaw. It was illuminating when I asked a Texan if they ever eat vegetables and his response was: \"Well, we have chicken and pork - that's vegetables.\" Jicama There was one vegetable though that I wouldn't have expected and I was really excited because I have only ever read about it - it was Jicama (Pachyrhizus erosus). It's also known as the Yam bean and grows in Central America, South Asia and apparently also in the Andes (but I didn't find it there). Our host sliced it finely and served it raw sprinkled with cinnamon. It had a delightful light crunchy texture and a surprisingly sweet, refreshing taste. It can also be cooked and Jicama is becoming popular because it's a very low-calorie vegetable and is an excellent food for diabetics. It reminded me a little of Yacon - my study object. Root Beer The other thing to complain about is the lack of restaurants. For every 2 restaurants there must be 98 take-aways. We did find one excellent restaurant though in the small town we stayed in and I also had to most delicious barbecue at \"Salt Lick Barbecue\".We also went to a few take-away places and one was highly recommended: What-a-Burger\". It was probably the worst meal I had during the entire trip but I made another discovery there too -- \"Root beer\". Brian, my fellow traveller from Iowa ordered it and let me have a sip. It was so disgustingly sweet with an awful taste I quickly dismissed it, until he explained that it was made from Native Indian herbs - originally sassafras. Straight away I googled it and was fascinated to learn that there is still real root beer out there and we found it a few days later and it was delicious. It's a non-alcoholic drink and I find it difficult to describe the taste -- not quite like ginger beer, but it's kind of in that category. There is also an alcoholic version of root beer, but I didn't get to taste that. Sassafras comes from the bark of the native American tree Sassafras albidum, of the Laurel family and all parts were used for consumption -- roots, leaves, bark and flowers. Native Americans used the leaves to treat fresh wounds, acne and urinary disorders. Sassafras branches were also used as toothbrushes. However, Sassafras is now banned for human consumption and can no longer be used to flavour root beer. Researchers found that laboratory animals which consumed large amounts of sassafras oil and tea, developed liver diseases and cancer. Root beer is now flavoured with the bark extract of the Black Birch (Betula lenta), and the herbaceous plant Wintergreen, and is still delicious, if made properly. Wheat and rice and commodifying food In Texas, we visited wheat and rice processing plants, in particular, Ardent Mills Wheat Processors. Wheat has a long history and it the product of three varieties of grass which were bred about 12,000 years ago. The Egyptians were the first to use the improved grain. At present worldwide stocks of wheat are higher than ever and this has caused the collapse of wheat prices. This trip has shown over and over again that everything that happens worldwide has a direct influence on agriculture -- and all farmers are worried about their future. Farming has become so globalised and so interlinked, that anything that happens in any part of the world has such a big influence everywhere else. The problem is that there is no way out for commercial enterprises dealing in commodities. There are a few alternatives to this globalised way of farming where farm produce has become a mere commodity. The alternative is some form of Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) scheme, or other forms of direct selling to the customer. Even our own Supervalu is doing a very good job of promoting local produce. JD Hudgins -- Brahmin Farm This farm visit impressed me most in Texas -- here is a young farmer, John, who really cares about his farm, his animals and his soil. His main objective is to improve the fertility of his land and leave it more fertile for future generations. His great-grandfather, Joel Hudgins started the farm in 1869 in Hungerford, Texas which has the most challenging farming conditions in the state. Joel bought his first Brahmin cow in one of the \"Freak Shows\" that were common in Texas at that time. The Brahmins are the holy Indian cattle with a large hump on their back. These cattle can survive the harshest and most challenging climate conditions. They have oily glands and instead of panting -- they sweat. In the 1920's the Hudgins bought 150 cows and 30 bulls from Brazil for the same price as they could have bought 2,000 cows in Texas. They already knew how successful these cattle are in dry conditions and the real proof came in the years 2011 to 2014, when Texas had no rain at all. The Texas government had to ban the use of water for agriculture and there was no wheat, rice, peanuts and other crops grown there for three years, with lots of cattle fatalities -- except for the Brahmin herds. This obviously led to an increased interest in Brahmin cattle. John practices Regenerative Grazing which is also known as Holistic Grassland Management or Mob Grazing. The system didn't work too well at first, but as he adapted it to his own growing conditions, it has been a massive success in restoring soil fertility and increasing the organic matter content of his soil. Simply put, organic matter is the carbon content of the soil, measuring everything that is, or was, alive. The remainder is inert rock particles. In every country I visited, a decline in organic matter content in soils was a serious problem. It is so serious that if it declines too much - a soil will turn into a desert. This is how John works regenerative agriculture: He has 40 paddocks which can be further divided with an electric fence and he moves the whole herd of cattle at least 10 times per day onto a new paddock. They only eat the top third of the grass. John doesn't believe in tight grazing. This system has proven itself as a means of sustainable farming. The only challenge he has, is to improve his system of opening gates. They are already semi-automated, but following a few discussions with Jonathon (our fellow robotic engineer and Nuffield scholar), there may be a way to simplify the system even further. John's biggest thrill and proof that he was on the right track was when he noticed the first dung beetle in a manure pat -- he knew that his yields would increase by 30% on that basis alone. After an excited phone call to his wife with the good news -- he found she wasn't quite prepared to share in his excitement. Rice Belt Warehouse A visit to the Rice Belt Warehouse and surrounding rice farms was very exciting. This warehouse processes about 25% of rice grown in Texas. Again during the drought years 2011 to 2014, there was no rice grown and once an international market is lost, it's very difficult to get it back. In 1685 rice production started in Texas and in the mid-1800's it started to be mechanised. All American rice is irrigated. The Colorado River is the source and for the first time in history, agriculture was banned from using it during the drought years. Prior to the drought, there were 22,000 acres grown and now only 8,800 acres or rice remain. Over 90% of rice is still grown in Asia -- and on a relatively small scale. Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Centre As we approached the wildflower centre, outside of Austin Texas, I was shocked by the number of cars trying to find a car parking space -- I didn't anticipate such an interest in wildflowers in Texas. I guess there were at least 5000 people in the centre which comprises 284 acres and was first opened in 1995 by Lady Bird Johnson, the wife of Lyndon B Johnson who became President of the US after John F Kennedy's assassination. Apparently, he was a champion of the environment and instrumental in over 200 pieces of environmental legislation. All of the water used on the land is from a rainwater collection system, which is quite incredible given that for every inch of rainfall, they collect 10,000 gallons of water. Environmental education is as important to the centre as the conservation of wildflowers. Austin Food Bank zzzTexasFoodbank_large.jpg It shows my ignorance -- I had no idea what a food bank was before we arrived at the Austin Food Bank. In total there are 21 Food Banks in Texas and they have a clear objective -- to provide food for the one in seven people who can't afford it in Texas The Food Bank is run very professionally. The money comes from the Texas Department of Agriculture to run the system and food comes from donations, farms, processors and retailers. Every day they have around 120 volunteers to grade and pack donated food. It was so impressive, but also quite depressing that there is a need, in such a wealthy country, for food banks. Klaus Laitenberger is the author of three gardening books and works as an Organic Inspector for the Organic Trust Ltd and manages a number of private gardens. Together with his wife, Joanna, he runs a seed company specialising in vegetable varieties most suited to the Irish climate.

Nine digital color cameras continually take images in real-time while computer software processes the images in 0.15 s to determine the target locations where the nozzles open and spray at speeds up to 1.77 m s(-1). Two wild blueberry fields in central Nova Scotia were selected for smart sprayer performance testing with spot-application (SA) of agrochemical as compared to control and uniform application techniques. Chateau(A (R)) herbicide was applied in a field with an infestation of hair cap moss. Spray droplet comparison showed moss patches were properly targeted using the smart sprayer. SA provided the same coverage performance as compared to uniform on the moss targets with herbicide application savings of 78.5% using the smart sprayer. Harvestable yield results were similar for all application tracks. TruPhos Magnesium and ZincMax foliar fertilizers were tank mixed with Bravo(A (R)) and Proline(A (R)) fungicides and applied to compare the difference of SA, control and uniform application. Results showed SA of foliar fertilizer and fungicide led to less premature leaf drop and increased the blueberry stem height, number of branches, stem diameter and fruit buds. SA of foliar fertilizer and fungicide also increased the percent of healthy wild blueberry plants by 57.8% and the harvestable yield by 137.8%.\" According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Fungicide application savings using the smart sprayer for SA were 11.6%.\" The news correspondents report that additional information may be obtained from Q.

Ag in Motion, referred to on its website as the largest agricultural trade show in Western Canada, kicks off next week just north of Saskatoon. The event brings out businesses, researchers, and farmers who want to get a glimpse of the cutting edge of today's farming industry. Show director Rob O'Connor said this will be the biggest one yet, with 457 businesses registered for booths and demonstrations. Last year, there were just over 400, and a little more than 300 the year before that. \"The most amazing thing is just the continued growth of the show,\" O'Connor said. \"It has much more industry involvement than it did in year one.\" O'Connor said it's striking to see how much farming technology had changed in the past 20 years, with the growth of both automation and genetic research to improve crop and livestock farming. According to data released by Statistics Canada in 2016, the number of farm operations and farm operators in Saskatchewan has been steadily declining. O'Connor called it one of the \"biggest challenges\" facing the agriculture industry today, which is why he said it comes as no surprise to him that some of the biggest technological innovations showing at the expo involve selfdriving machinery and artificial intelligence technology. \"Whether it's grain carts or sprayers or tractors, these vehicles being able to drive themselves with the help of GPS technology is going to help quite a bit on farms,\" O'Connor said. Technological advancement is given a special spotlight at Ag in Motion thanks to the Saskatoon Regional Economic Development Authority. The organization helps support the Innovation Awards to celebrate the cutting edge of farming technology in various fields. Joanne Baczuk, director of business development, said it's especially important to recognize agricultural innovation in a huge farming province like Saskatchewan. \"The Saskatchewan agriculture landscape has advanced from small farming operations to large ones mainly due to the farmers'ability to take advantage of these innovations,\" Baczuk said. Baczuk recently travelled to Germany for Agritechnica, the world's largest agricultural exhibition. She said there's \"lots of opportunity\" on the international stage as well as within Canada for new agricultural technology. Companies like xarvio Digital Farming Solutions are working hard in the relatively new field of developing computer science for farming solutions, and xarvio is one of the finalists for this year's Ag in Motion Innovation Awards for their new technology. Warren Bills, xarvio Canadian business manager, said that while technology is making huge strides, there's much more that can be done in the industry. \"There always needs to be a human component to farming,\" Bills said. But, he added, some intelligent models will replace some of the more common practices. O'Connor said the expo has now reached a size where it's receiving international attention, and that around 200 attendees from outside of Canada and the United States are expected to be among the thousands at Ag in Motion."}, {"title": "AJX AgJunction settles Raven litigation, grants licence", "article": "AgJunction Inc (TSX:AJX) Shares Issued 117,178,275 Last Close 7/11/2018 $0.84 Wednesday July 11 2018 - News Release Mr. Bob Barjesteh reports AGJUNCTION SETTLES WITH RAVEN IN PATENT INFRINGEMENT SUIT AgJunction Inc. has settled a patent infringement lawsuit it filed against Raven Industries Inc. in January of this year.

The 'narrow' in the excerpt warns that there will be fewer stocks generating strong returns. Citi also reduced its ranking of global financial stocks to neutral from overweight as part of the quarterly review, and this is something for bank-loving Canadian investors to keep in the back of their minds. There has, of course, never been a bad time for patient investors to buy Canadian banks. Citi cited slower global economic growth, a flatter yield curve and widening credit spreads as their reasons for downgrading the sector. But domestic banks, in light of their dominant position in virtual all facets of the Canadian economy, should be able to weather the effects of those trends easily. It is what comes next in the credit cycle - Phase 4 is 'The Bad Debt Cycle' - that provides reason for caution on bank stocks. \"We will eventually enter the dreaded Phase 4, when the bear market begins. Global recession approaches, stock market bubbles burst and more defensive strategies become appropriate. Buying the dips is very dangerous.\" Past market history strongly implies that while domestic bank stocks might endure some pain, they will be fine through Phase 4. It is extremely unlikely that the next global downturn will be anything as severe as 2008 and our banks came through that period relatively unscathed. It's also true that Canadian households have never carried as much debt as they do now, and economic growth has rarely been so dependent on real estate and private credit expansion. We have to examine the probability, even if it's well below 50 per cent, that the banks will get hit much harder this time when Phase 4 hits. I'm not worried about bank stocks now and I won't be anxious about them if the U.S. slips into recession either. I will, however, be watching closely for signs of stress as Phase 4 begins in case this historical confidence is misplaced. -- Scott Barlow, Globe and Mail market strategist This is the Globe Investor newsletter, published three times each week.

This stock is on the positive breakouts list. There are a number of gold and silver stocks that are gaining positive price momentum fuelled by trade war fears. This stock provides investors with leverage to rising commodity prices and also offers investors a dividend yield of 1.6 per cent. Since releasing its first-quarter earnings results, 13 analysts have issued buy recommendations on the stock. Jennifer Dowty reports (for subscribers). The Second Cup Ltd. (SCU-T). Second Cup Ltd. is discovering that the stock market's madness for marijuana comes with a downside. The Mississauga-based coffee chain, which has suffered from declining sales in recent years as it battles multinational behemoths such as Starbucks Corp. and McDonalds Corp., struck a deal in the spring to convert some of its cafes into cannabis dispensaries. Its stock price quickly shot up to their highest point in years. Within days, the shares had gone up nearly 50 per cent, to more than $4, a level they had not seen since early 2015. And since then? Investors have lost all of those gains, amid a volatile ride for the entire cannabis sector as the country edges toward legalization of the drug in October. Brenda Bouw reports (for subscribers). Enbridge Inc. (ENB-T). Is Enbridge Inc. on its way to becoming boring again? Investors certainly hope so. Long admired for its financial stability and steadily rising dividend (if you're into that sort of thing), the pipeline owner has looked dangerous for more than a year. But look at Enbridge now: The shares have rebounded 25 per cent over the past two months, sending the dividend yield down to a less-alarming 5.7 per cent. Subsiding bond yields are helping. So is the recent regulatory approval from Minnesota for Enbridge's Line 3 route through the state. And a deal announced on Wednesday to sell Enbridge's Canadian natural-gas-gathering and processing business to Brookfield Infrastructure Partners LP for $4.3-billion suggests that there is demand for energy assets. Judging by their recent buying, corporate insiders never lost their confidence in the company. David Berman reports (for subscribers). The Rundown Five stocks this year that made a mockery of expert opinions There's always a place for smart macro-driven calls, but the Canadian stocks that performed best in the first half of the year didn't require keen insight into oil prices, interest rates, the U.S. dollar or even cannabis legalization.

Health care needs a place in your portfolio. Here's the best ETF for adding income An area in which the Canadian stock market falls short is healthcare, in large part due to our universal health care system. We can't invest directly in hospitals, clinics, or service providers. There are no giant healthcare insurers like UnitedHealth Group in the U.S. For companies like Manulife or Sun Life, health insurance is only a small part of their business and involves providing protection beyond that which is provided by Medicare. But if you look at demographics and take a long-term view, healthcare is an area that should have a place in your portfolio. Canada's population is aging, as it is in most of the Western World.

The system is unsustainable, and things will only get worse unless we figure out a way to feed what will be nine billion people on Earth by 2050. This is not a time for food producers to pretend all is well. On the contrary, they must set ambitious and determined goals to do better. Maple Leaf Foods has set the goal of becoming the most sustainable protein company on earth. The company aims to reduce its footprint in water and natural gas by 50 per cent by 2025, while finding ways to create a food system that can help to feed all those new mouths. Only with intelligent and aggressive use of technology can this be achieved. Precision agriculture is showing great promise in reducing the environmental footprint while increasing production, and advances such as high-tech lighting and alternative energy-powered battery storage are helping to make greenhouse production more efficient. Technologies such as artificial intelligence, sensor technology, and the Internet of Things are showing huge potential and will surely provide some of the solutions that make up the sustainable ecosystem. Alongside these advances, one of the most exciting developments is the integration of traditionally consumer-based technologies with B2B software. A recent project at Maple Leaf Foods serves as a good example: The company kitted out its production supervisors in 10 factories across Canada with iPads loaded with an app that digitizes and mobilizes dozens of previously paper and office-based tasks. The goal was simple: find a way for production supervisors to do on the shop floor everything they do in their offices, including keeping track of materials and inventory, making process orders, scanning labels and staying in touch with others. The act of moving between the floor and office was an inefficient process for production supervisors, and they had to decontaminate every time they entered the production area. Furthermore, if they, for example, found a problem with a piece of equipment, the process of logging it involved e-mailing a picture and entering data into clunky forms. It all felt very early 2000s. With the new app, things like this can be done quickly and efficiently by just pressing a few buttons, as can barcode scanning, transactions and dozens of other tasks. Production supervisors now spend 50 per cent less time in the office, which has helped the company improve overall efficiency by 20 per cent. Not a bad result from a few iPads and an app. It's now clear that every business-process-creating chief information officer must take Apple and its devices seriously. Since the company began partnering with business software makers such as SAP to support the development of enterprise apps, the opportunities to create elegant solutions that improve efficiency have become too powerful to ignore. Many companies are reaching the point where they're no longer solving IT issues. They have the plumbing in place - a cloud platform and a consolidated database of information - and can begin turning their attention to finding new efficiencies from emerging technologies. The sheer number of opportunities to use technology in enterprise today is dizzying, and technology is changing so quickly that keeping on top of it is a major challenge. This is where technology partners come in. Don't underestimate their ability to understand your business, your customers, and the challenges in your industry. In today's digital world, they should be your closest allies.

That's the advice Patrick Whippey, Western University physics professor emeritus, gives students from Grades 4 to 12 for success in the regional Thames Valley Science and Engineering Fair. Amal Aziz heeded that advice. She's one of nine Thames Valley District School Board (TVDSB) students from the Thames Valley region who won awards at the Canada-Wide Science Fair (CASF) in Ottawa. Aziz, a Grade 11 student at Sir Wilfred Laurier secondary school, won a gold medal, a Youth Can Innovate Award (worth $1,000), and scholarships to Canadian universities by exploring a potentially new method to treat Alzheimer's disease. This is the sixth year Aziz has been selected to compete at the national level. She began participating in Grade 4. Although she's found passion for science, Aziz said her latest project came from a place of fear. \"What sparked my interest was how scared I was of (Alzheimer's disease). I read about the first patient diagnosed with it and I wanted to learn as much as I could. I saw the drugs used are not very effective; they help the symptoms but not the disease. Not a lot of progress had been made.\" During her research, Aziz learned that in Alzheimer's patients, deposits of a protein called amyloid beta (A-beta) clump together, interfering with connections in the brain. She also learned that the blood-brain barrier prevents drugs from crossing into brain cells where they are needed. In good health, it's a safety mechanism, but Aziz began to wonder if it's possible to treat neurodegenerative diseases by bypassing the barrier. Her project suggests a \"Trojan horse\" method could help deliver medicine to brains affected by diseases such as Alzheimer's. Aziz has been working on the project for two years. Although her research has shown promise, she said it's still in its early stages and more work needs to be done. \"So far there are positive results,\" she said. \"It seems to get the drug to the brain. I want to continue work on this; I want to see if there is a way I can generalize the use, not just for Alzheimer's.\" Another winner in Ottawa was David Wu, a Grade 11 student at London Central secondary school, who won a bronze medal and several university scholarships with his project, \"The Efficacy of Cancer Chemotherapy Combinations with Cranberry Extract.\" London sends the maximum number of 10 students to the Canada-Wide Science Fair each year. \"The sophistication of the projects increases each year,\" said Whippey, who has been involved with Youth Science London for 48 years. \"You never know who is going to really take off. The most successful students come back several times.\" Some of those students are having success at the international level, too. Grade 9 student Danish Mahmood, also from Central, won a second place award of $1,500 at the International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF) recently held in Pittsburgh. Mahmood is developing a wearable device designed to help first responders more effectively triage patients in an emergency situation. Also at ISEF - the Olympics of science fairs - Waleed Sawan, from Oakridge secondary school, won a third place award of $1,000 and a Qatar Foundation, Research & Development award for his project, \"Drip - A Precision Agriculture System for the Developing World.\" \"My experiences at international, national, and regional science fairs have inspired me to pursue my studies in engineering and offered me the opportunity to meet likeminded students from around Canada and the world,\" Sawan said in a news release. \"We open doors the students never knew existed,\" added Whippey. \"It changes people's lives.\" Aziz also has advice for other students who may consider participating in a science fair. \"Improve on an idea and do the best you can,\" she said. \"Failure is a really important part of the process.\""}, {"title": "MAXR Maxar, CGIAR partner for agricultural machine learning", "article": "Maxar Technologies Ltd (TSX:MAXR) Shares Issued 56,422,480 Last Close 6/27/2018 $65.04 Wednesday June 27 2018 - News Release Ms. Amy Minnick of DigitalGlobe reports MAXAR TECHNOLOGIES DIGITALGLOBE AND CGIAR PARTNER TO ACCELERATE MACHINE LEARNING SOLUTIONS FOR AGRICULTURE USING GBDX Maxar Technologies Ltd.'s DigitalGlobe has partnered with CGIAR (formerly the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research). CGIAR will leverage the company's Geospatial Big Data platform (GBDX) to answer agricultural questions across the globe by using machine learning at scale. CGIAR's Platform for Big Data in Agriculture democratizes data to digitally transform agriculture and address global challenges, such as food security, health, environment, climate and prosperity to improve the lives of people in developing countries. CGIAR's geospatial scientists will mine DigitalGlobe's 100-petabyte imagery library using machine learning and the computational power of GBDX to create more sophisticated baseline datasets in agriculture, plan new projects, and monitor crop health, crop yield and the environmental impacts of farming. In addition, GBDX will fuel CGIAR's research and development efforts to improve agricultural information products and create new ones. With the support of CGIAR's Platform for Big Data in Agriculture, the scientists are leveraging GBDX to examine: - Land tenure -- by finding and identifying parcel delineation, the scientists will aid families in securing property rights and helping communities mature and prosper. The group will initially examine India, Ethiopia and West Africa. - Crop yield estimation and crop production estimation -- by predicting and measuring the availability of food, particularly staple crops like rice, the scientists will help regions move away from food insecurity. - Water resource conservation -- the scientists will model water use and quality of watersheds. The resulting outputs will be paired with high-resolution imagery to inform farmers of the right times to irrigate their fields in South Asia. - Pest and disease monitoring -- the scientists will predict the spread of crop pests and disease to develop early interventions. They will initially focus on the spread of the fall armyworm insect in Africa, which has affected a dozen countries in one year. \"By combining DigitalGlobe's best-in-class imagery and our GBDX machine learning platform, with CGIAR's global footprint and domain expertise, we will collaborate to create technical breakthroughs for farmers around the globe,\" said Amy Minnick, DigitalGlobe's senior vice-president and general manager of commercial. \"Together with CGIAR, we'll design machine learning solutions that will change the lives of farmers, their communities and, therefore, the planet, helping us all see a better world.\" \"Partnering with DigitalGlobe delivers a clearer picture than ever before of land use, natural resources, crop lands and much more, which we need to develop the strategies to build lasting food security worldwide,\" said Brian King, co-ordinator for CGIAR's Platform for Big Data in Agriculture. \"We are confident our work in GBDX will unlock the creative and innovative minds of CGIAR's researchers and help them catalyze digital agriculture, leading to a better quality of life across the developing world.\" About Maxar Technologies Ltd.

I wanted to inspect the plant stand in the southwest corner, an area of the field that is otherwise inaccessible. It worked. I was able to upload high-definition video and photos of a section that last year I could only see through binoculars from the road, half a mile away. It's exhilarating, really. But this is all quite rudimentary and hardly qualifies as any sort of actual implementation of an agricultural technology. It's a mere nod to what's available to those wanting to stay current. Agriculture is a deep, restless pool in which most people, including farmers, have only dipped their toes. It's an industry moving and growing at such a pace that even those immersed in it struggle to keep up. Pundits covering NAFTA and supply-management routinely reveal a lack of understanding and perspective on domestic agricultural economics and cross-border trade. It's supply-management, but it's also the banks that support them. It's dairy, but it's also all U.S. dairy getting fractioned and entering our closed market as ingredients. \"Throughout most of this (19th) century the fact of the matter has been that most Americans have never heard of the companies that distribute and sell American grain all over the world,\" writes Dan Morgan in the book Merchants of Grain. \"These five companies have grown, diversified, spread their operations to almost every continent and country so successfully that by the time most Americans heard of them for the first time, during the grain sales to Russia in 1972, the firms were among the world's largest multinational corporations.\" It's not that different today. The Bayer-Monsanto merger is $60 billion deal. And companies, such as Farmer's Edge and others, are implementing precision agriculture technologies all over the globe. And scientists the world over are continually feeding new knowledge and suggestions into the industry, adjusting it and fine-tuning it. This is, after all, the food we eat. The agriculture industry's uniqueness makes sense. This year, the Canadian Farm Writers' Federation conference will be held in Winnipeg. Unlike most writer conferences I've attended, this one assumes attendees want to learn more about agriculture. So, we're going to tour farms and research facilities, and hear about some of the groundbreaking work happening in what was once the grain hub of Canada - the gateway to the golden West. The bent of this conference fascinates me and I think speaks to Morgan's point. It's not just about improving your craft as a writer. Just as important, if not more so, it's about getting updated on the high-level science going on at the Canadian International Grains Institute (Cigi), to name one of many research facilities in Winnipeg. (If you haven't been to Cigi, you should go.) And it's about hearing from the people working passionately on files such as northern nutrition. The sector will keep its pace whether we keep up or not. I sit on boards on which we brainstorm ways to inform students in journalism and communications programs to consider agriculture. There is tremendous opportunity in the sector. And it's most likely not at all what students think. If they only knew. And in my farming life, I sit on boards on which we brainstorm ways to get farmers more involved in the sector. If they only knew. I am beholden to the wants and whims of the commodities value chain, which requires - and in some cases also rewards - farmers who can keep pace. My canola is starting to bolt. That is to say, it's starting to turn a gorgeous, vibrant yellow. We could use some rain, but as of right now, there's still some moisture in the soil. I don't know what tomorrow will look like, and I mean that poetically but also literally. Markets have been doing funny, unpredictable things lately and who knows what tech I'll fix my gaze on next - perhaps a virtual nose that sniffs out plant disease. Don't laugh.

Switzerland uses approximately CDN$40 million/year in chemical fungicides where growers are increasingly seeking non-chemical alternatives and represents the company's beachhead into Europe. The entire European fungicide and insecticide market is approximately CDN $9.0 billion, of which approximately CDN$1.0 billion is a target for BVT's bee delivery system. 'Growers in Europe face a great number of restrictions on chemical pesticide use, said Ashish Malik, CEO of Bee Vectoring Technologies. 'Products such as ours, have both the advantage of being biologic as well as fitting nicely with European practices for sustainable and precision agriculture.' Swiss growers are early adopters of the most advanced technologies and the Swiss registration scheme allows for a relatively fast approval, within a year, for registration dossiers which are deemed to be complete. 'We are excited by the interest in our product which has led to active discussions with two possible partners concurrent with preparing an independent go-to-market option,' said Christoph Lehnen, Business Manager, Europe (pictured here carrying the Swiss regulatory submission). BVT will initially target crops that require pollination and are susceptible to diseases such as botrytis, such as strawberries and tomatoes. Application of Clonostachys rosea CR-7 before pathogens infect the plant, not only controls disease, but can improve plant vigor as well as quality and yield at harvest. The BVT system uses bumble bees to carry product directly to key areas of target plants in doses significantly lower than traditional spray applications. Additionally, using bees to deliver the product allows growers to reduce their consumption of water and diesel. About Bee Vectoring Technologies International Inc. BVT has developed and owns patent-pending bee vectoring technology that is designed to harmlessly utilize bumble bees and honey bees as natural delivery mechanisms for a variety of powdered mixtures comprised of organic compounds that inhibit or control common crop diseases, while at the same time enhancing crop vigor and productivity. This unique and proprietary process enables a targeted delivery of crop controls using the simple process of bee pollination to replace traditional crop spraying, resulting in better yields, superior quality, and less impact on the environment without the use of water or disruptions to labor.

Growth was due mainly to a strengthening domestic economy, increasing consumer spending and encouraging data from key end-user markets, particularly light vehicles and housing. US chemical exports by sea rose by 2.1% to 992,063 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) in 2017, from 819,887 TEUs in 2016, the biggest growth since 2014, despite stricter regulation and trade disputes with China, which was the biggest importer of US chemicals by sea, followed by Belgium and Japan. According to he American Chemistry Council (ACC), US chemicals exports worth US$173 billion were the second biggest globally in 2017, after Germany's US$234.6 billion and China's of US$152.4 billon, US ethylene production used to be among the world's most expensive. Thanks to shale revolution it now can produce cheap ethane extracted from shale gas, and is now a global petrochemical leader. Specialty chemical market volume rose by 0.9% year on year in April 2018, according to the ACC's US Specialty Chemicals Market Volume Index, which observes 28 specialty chemical segments. Of the 28, there was growth in 24, a decline in one, while the other and three were static. The index increased by 4.7% from a year earlier in the first four months of 2018. Revenues and profits of four out of five leading chemical companies grew in first quarter 2018, the exception being Monsanto. The rises were to operational efficiency and robust demand for chemical products in domestic and international markets. Joint venture and merger and acquisition (M&A) activities continued to grow in the five months through May 2018, led by growth initiatives and active fund managers. Hurricane Harvey ravaged the Texas Gulf Coast, affecting more than half of its chemical plants, including refineries and specialty chemical facilities. Harvey caused the Arkema plant to explode, shutting down more than half of US ethylene production and recovery took months. In May 2018, the US Chemical Safety Board insisted that chemical producers devise better plans to avoid such outages during severe weather. The industry is crucial to the US economy as the Texas Gulf Coast is the heart of America's specialty and petrochemicals industry. Sector Performance Share prices of the eight leading US chemical companies were rose by an average 0.28% over the six months through June 1, 2018, underperforming the S&P 500 Index's 1.69% increase. The eight leading companies' share prices were mixed, with Eastman Chemical (NYSE: EMN) having the highest and only double digit share price growth. Its share price rose by 12.88%, from US$93.71to US$105.78, due to good financials, increased specialty demand and better cost management bringing a double-digit rise in earnings per share. One of the biggest agrochemical firms Monsanto's (NYSE: MON) share price rose by 9.49%, from US$116.50 to US$127.56, following US justice Department approval of its merger with German multinational company Bayer (ETR: BAYN) in April 2018. North and South America's largest industrial gases company Praxair's (NYSE: PX) share price has risen since it announced that it would buy the world's largest industrial gas company Linde AG (ETR: LIN) in October 2017. The deal will increase its presence in Germany and make Praxair the world's biggest industrial gas company and sent Praxair's share price up from US$155.15 to US$157.80. One of the world's largest chemical companies LyondellBasell's (NYSE: LYB) good first quarter 2018, combined with its February announcement that it would acquire leading global supplier of high-performance plastic compounds A. Schulman (NASDAQ:SHLM), boosted its share price by 1.34, from US$111.62 to US$113.12. One of the world's most diversified technology companies 3M Co (NYSE: MMM) suffered the biggest share price drop, 15.61%, from US$236.48to US$199.56 was due to private investment company Parsons Capital Management Inc reducing its stake by 12.45% in first quarter 2018, despite 3M's good financials in the quarter. Huntsman Corp's (NYSE: HUN) share price dropped by 4.34, followed by PPG Industries (NYSE: PPG) 2.94% and Air Products and Chemicals (NYSE: APD) 0.30% declines. Stock Performances of Leading US Chemical Companies (US$)  Source Mergent analysis Sector Index The FTSE global equity index provides capital growth measurement data for the chemicals industry with mixed review periods and takes into account the ancillary impact the chemicals sector has on the global and North American economies. It showed that the global chemicals segment had a negative total return of 0.87% in the three months under review. This indicated that the chemicals industry weakened over the three months due to the trade dispute between the US and China. The industry had a negative total return of 3.27% year to date June 4, 2018. Stock Performances of Leading Global Financial Services (Total Return)  Source: FTSE Equity Index Based on end-of-day data for the Total Return Index as at June 4, 2018 Leading Companies Robust demand for chemical products, increased efficiency and business expansion saw four leading chemical companies perform well in first quarter 2018, with Praxair having the highest growth, 10%. Although Monsanto had flat growth in the quarter, US chemical companies are likely to continue growing through 2018. DowDupont (NYSE: DWDP) Dow Chemical and DuPont merged on August 31, 2017, forming DowDuPont, the world's largest chemical company. It had a good first quarter 2018, the merger and improved prices and volumes in most segments and regions boosting sales by 5% to US$21.5 billion, from US$20.5 billion in first quarter 2017. In May 2018, DowDuPont announced plans to invest US$45 million to buy and modernize the Delaware plant in Indiana over the next two years. The investment is driven by the increased demand for kalrez sealing materials and the company wants to boost production to meet the demand. In April DowDuPont announced a US$100 million two-year investment to ramp-up manufacturing production and upgrade the Sabine River Works (SRW) plant in Orange County, Texas. DowDuPont will divide into three new companies in second quarter 2019 and the new plant and Corteva Agriscience, the agriculture division of DowDuPont, will be based in Delaware, Indiana. Monsanto Co (NYSE: MON) Agricultural product manufacturer Monsanto's net sales were flat in first quarter 2018, totaling US$2.66 billion, just 0.38% up from US$2.65 billion a year earlier. Gross profit increased by 4% to US$1.31 billion, from US$1.26 billion a year earlier. Monsanto aims to become carbon neutral by 2021 and has reduced its carbon footprint by more than 200,000 metric tonnes, burning 200 million pounds less coal since December 2015. The rate of reduction is expected to increase over the next few years and the company will collaborate with farmers and global partners to educate and encourage them to adopt climate-smart agriculture practices. Monsanto began collaborating with charitable organization 2Blades Foundation in May 2018to produce a genetic solution to Asian soybean rust (ASR). The disease causes soybean leaves to turn yellow and brown, leading to premature senescence and significant yield loss. With a number of effective treatment choices or resistant hybrids accessible, creating new solutions is crucial and the partnership will aid bring much-needed disease-resistance solutions to farmers. PPG Industries Inc (NYSE: PPG) With 90,000 employees in more than 70 countries, multinational conglomerate 3M Co manufactures innovative industrial and consumer products such as abrasives, adhesives, sealants, electronic materials, healthcare and protection products. Its net sales increased to US$3.8 billion in first quarter 2018, up by 9% from US$3.5 billion a year earlier. All business segments grew, industrial coatings the most, by 10%. PPG completed two Colorful Communities projects in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Istanbul, Turkey, in May. The program, which offers PPG employee volunteers and the company's paint products, along with funds, to bring color and liveliness to communities across the globe, is one of PPG's many community programs. Praxair Inc (NYSE: PX) Industrial gases company Praxair had a strong financial performance in first quarter 2018. Sales grew by 10% from a year earlier to US$3.0 billion, thanks largely to higher volumes in North America, Europe and Asia, and new project start-ups. Volume grew by 4%, driven by rises in North America, Europe and Asia, and operating profit increased by 15% to US$653 million. Praxair announced in May the names of six universities that were awarded the TruForm Ambition Grant introduced in November 2017. The grant supports North American universities involved in metal additive manufacturing (AM) to support sector growth. Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis, the University of Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania State University were among the recipients. Mergers, Acquisitions and Joint Ventures Amid favorable market conditions chemical merger and acquisition (M&A) and joint venture activities remained robust in the six months under review. Chemical producers continued to focus on M&A to diversify and increase growth, increasingly seeking opportunities for cost synergies and scale operations through consolidation. Some 195 deals were announced or closed in the American chemicals industry in 2017, 24% down from 2016's h 256 transactions. Public firms maintained their grip on deal share with 70.2% transactions in 2017 and 78.8% of transactions in first quarter 2018 The most notable merger in first quarter 2018 was one of the world's largest plastics companies, Houston-based LyondellBasell Industries' (NYSE: LYB) acquisition of leading global supplier of high-performance plastic compounds A. Schulman (NASDAQ:SHLM) for US$2.25 billion to create an industry-leading compounding business. The acquisition will enhance Lyondell's existing product portfolio and create new product solutions. It will also increase Lyondell's presence in the global market enabling it to meet increased demand. The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2018. DowDuPont signed a three-year deal with US-based integrated aerospace and data analytics private firm Planet for an undisclosed amount in March 2018. The collaboration will provide digital agriculture software solutions to growers. It will also upgrade analytics tools and will further aid farmers in controlling risk and optimizing crop yields. This will strength its agriculture business division and help DowDuPont agriculture business and help it to boost crops and reach more customers. German crop-chemical conglomerate Bayer (ETR: BAYN) plans to acquire US-based Monsanto (NYSE: MON) for US$66 billion, creating the world's biggest pesticide and seed company. The proposed deal, expected to close by the end of June, has caused chaos in the agriculture world as the company will control 61% of seeds globally and control pesticide production with the other two mega corporations DowDuPont and ChemChina. Current Environment- Canada Sector Overview The Canadian chemical industry performed well over the six months under review, despite global economic uncertainties and a weakened environment, thanks largely to the abundance of new shale products. Real gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 3% in third quarter 2017 from ayear earlier, thanks to increased household expenditure, higher residential investment, export growth and lower imports. The shale phenomenon continued to generate prospects for long-term availability of cheap natural gas and natural gas liquids, leading to strong industrial chemical performance and stronger investment growth momentum. However, industrial chemical exports were flat in 2017, with 80% of them going to the US, with the next largest importers being China, 7%, and Mexico, 3%. While the shale gas revolution was generally positive for Canadian petrochemical companies, there was a downside, particularly in Alberta, where production was down, because there was less need for the US to import gas from Canada. Lower production means a corresponding reduction in the availability of ethane. This has caused companies in Alberta to look for innovative solutions, such as importing ethane by pipeline from a shale oil formation in North Dakota, extracting more feedstock materials from the by-product. New technologies and advanced materials continue to have enormous commercial potential in Canada. The domestic chemical industry has invested additional funds in R&D and developed infrastructure to create new products and promote them in various markets. The chemical sector should attract further investment through 2018 as its costs are lower than those in many countries and it has the required technical capacity and competence. Alberta's economy is poised to grow as new petrochemical projects worth US$185 billion are being built there, starting in November 2017, the first for almost 30 years. A provincial government royalty tax credit of US$500 million for petrochemical projects is attracting many manufacturers. Other benefits of building in Alberta include ample supplies of low-cost natural gases such as butane, ethane and propane, and lower construction costs. The Canadian Plastics Industry Association (CPIA) and the Chemistry Industry Association of Canada (CIAC) estimate that by 2030, all plastic packaging will be recyclable and economically extracted natural resources, meaning that zero waste will be added to landfills by 2040.That was one recommendations in the ?Towards a Zero Plastic Waste Canada? program proposed by the Canadian Environmental Law Association. Sector Performance The Canadian chemical stock market slipped in the six months under review, with a decline in industrial stocks offsetting stronger resources share prices. Investors were concerned about the US Federal Reserve suggesting a rollback of its monetary stimulus program. They remained cautious and continued to avoid chemical stocks, as declining global growth and a stronger Canadian dollar meant Canadian manufacturing sales remained weak and the trade deficit continued widening. Chemical company share prices on the Toronto Stock Exchange were mixed between January 2 and June 4, 2018, those of five leading companies dropping by an average 6.40%, with only two gainers, Methanex Corp (TSX: MX) and Superior Plus Corp (TSX: SPB). The world's largest producer and supplier of methanol Methanex Corp (TSX: MX) had the biggest gains, with share price growth of 12.06%. This was due to a good first quarter 2018 financial report and rising demand for methane boosting investor confidence, sending share price up from US$61.35 to US$68.75. One of the world's largest wholesale suppliers of oil and gas drilling fluids Bri-Chem Corp (TSX: BRY) was the biggest loser, its share price dropping by 28.57%, from US$0.49 to US$0.35 because of lower drilling fluids sales over the previous quarters. Chemtrade Logistics Income Fund's (TSX: CHE.UN) share price dropped by 15.86%, from US$19.04 to US$16.02, despite good first quarter 2018 financial results. Nutrien's (TSX: NTR) share price declined by 4.18%, from US$50.40 to US$52.60, due to a weak first quarter financial report. Stock Performances of Leading Canadian Chemical Companies (US$)  Source: Mergent analysis Leading Companies The four leading chemical companies had good first quarter 2018 financial results, especially Chemtrade Logistics Income Fund, its consolidated revenue rising by almost 50%, the highest growth among the five. Nutrien was the only company that had a weak first quarter. Nutrien Ltd (TSX: NTR) Agrium and Potash Corp of Saskatchewan merged on January 2, 2018, and became Nutrien Ltd, the world's largest supplier of crop inputs and services. A late spring in North America, which delayed crop input sales to the second quarter, reduced sales first quarter sales to US$3.73 billion, down by 1.12% from US$3.7 billion in first quarter 2017. Most business segment sales fell, those of crop protection to US$774 million, 11.2% down from US$872 million a year earlier. Merchandise segment sales had the highest growth, by 11.2%, from US3134 million to US$149 due to higher volumes. In May 2018, Nutrien announced that it wants to sell 32% of its stake for US$4.1 billion in Chilean fertilizer and lithium producer Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile Sa (NYSE: SQM) in second quarter 2018. In January 2018, Nutrien sold its stake in Israel Chemicals (TLV: ICL) for US$700-million. The company also is seeking buyers to but its stake in Jordan-based private Arab Potash Company for US$470 million. Nutrien has to sell its stakes so that regulators from China and India will approve its merger of PotashCorp and Agrium. Nova Chemicals Private plastics and chemical company Nova Chemicals is a subsidiary of Abu Dhabi's International Petroleum Investment Co. Higher operating profit from olefins/polyolefins and expandable styrenics raised revenues to C$62.6 billion (US$48.8) in first quarter 2018, 15% up from US$51.4 billion (US$39.8 billion) a year earlier. The Canadian Government gave Nova Chemicals C$35 million (US$29.96 million) through Canada's Strategic Innovation Fund announced in February 2018 to show the government's commitment to reduce the use of plastics in the nation. The fund from the government is to encourage research and development that will result in more environmentally friendly chemical production. Methanex Corp (TSX: MX) The world's largest producer and supplier of methanol Methanex Corp's consolidated revenue rose by 15.1% from C$810 million (US$628 million) in first quarter 2017 to C$932 million (US$745 million) in first quarter 2018, thanks to higher prices and robust international demand. Sales volume totaled 2.82 billion tonnes, slightly decreased by 1.06% from 2.85 billion tonnes a year earlier. Production rose by 4.1%, from 1.87 million tonnes to 1.94 million tonnes in first quarter 2018 with 608 thousand tonnes coming from its New Zealand facility, which can produce up to 2.4 million tonnes a year, depending on natural gas composition. Superior Plus Corp (TSX: SPB) Diversified business group Superior Plus Corp's first quarter 2018 revenues surged by 29.5% year on year to C$874.9 million (US$677.6 million), thanks largely to its acquisition of Canwest from Gibson Energy Inc (TSX: GEI) and increasing demand for chemicals in Western Canada. Higher sales by the energy distribution and specialty chemical unit sent gross profit up by 28.13% to C$289.2 million (US$224 million), from C$225.7 million (US$174.8 million). Chemtrade Logistics Income Fund (TSX: CHE.UN) Industrial chemicals supplier Chemtrade's revenues jumped by almost 50% to C$381.5 million (US$295.4 million) in first quarter 2018, from US$274.6 million (US$212.6 million) a year earlier, thanks to new businesses. All business segments reported lower sales except electro-chemicals, with sales rising to C$160 million (US$124 million) from C$48.9 million (US$37.9 million), a more than 200% jump owing to newly acquired businesses. Sales in sulphur products and performance chemicals (SPPC) dropped by 2.3% to C$122.6 million (US$94.9 million) from C$125.5 million (US$97.1 million) while sales in water solutions & specialty chemicals (WSSC) decreased by 1.3% from C$100.2 million (US$77.6 million) to C$98.9 million (US$96.6 million). Mergers, Acquisitions and Joint Ventures M&A activity was strong over the six months period through May 2018. Intensified competition from foreign chemical companies forced many local companies into corporate restructuring and divestitures, while further volatility in market fundamentals drove merger and acquisition (M&A) deals. The most prominent merger under the review period was In January 2018, Nutrien Ltd (TSX: NTR) was the successful completion of the merger of equals between Agrium Inc (TSX: AGU) and Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc (TSE: POT) worth US$36 billion. The merger created the largest supplier of crop inputs and services in the world. With approximately 20,000 workers and operations and investments in 14 countries, the company is dedicated to deliver products and services that support farmers boost crop yields and their profits. To win approval from the US Federal Trade Commission, Agrium is selling two of its assets: a phosphate production facility and a nitric acid facility, both in Idaho. Nova Chemicals closed a joint venture with Austrian-based private polyethylene and polypropylene company Borealis AG and French petroleum refining company Total SA (EPA: FP) to build a US$1.7 billion world-scale ethane plant on the US Gulf in May 2018. The joint venture between the three companies created a company named Bayport Polymers which 50% owned by Total and 50% owned by Novealis Holdings, a joint venture between Borealis and NOVA Chemicals. The project is scheduled to start up in 2020 will include an ethane steam cracker under construction in Port Arthur, Texas as well as Total's existing polyethylene facility in Bayport in Texas. Nutrien has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Agrichem, a Brazillian private leading specialty plant nutrition company for an undisclosed amount in May 2018. This acquisition will allow Nutrien to enhance their products and services and develop new products in Brazil as well as increase their presence in the Brazilian market. The acquisition will be made in two stages, with 80% of the business to be acquired in 2018 and the remaining 20% will be acquired in 2019. Industry Profile - Canada Industry Overview Accounting for 8% of total manufacturing revenues, the C$53 billion (US$38.4 billion) chemical-pharmaceutical industry is key to Canadian innovation and one of the underlying economic pillars supporting major industries. It employs more than 80,000 people and is the fourth largest manufacturing industry by sales after transportation equipment, food and petroleum refining, according to the Chemistry Association of Canada (CIAC). The sector employs 86,700 workers, supports an additional 520,000 jobs and plays an important economic role, the CIAC reports. It transforms and adds value to raw resources such as minerals, crude oil, natural gas and biomass, producing intermediate products used as inputs by other parts of the industry and by almost all other manufacturing sectors. Main consumer industries include oil and gas extraction, pharmaceuticals, plastic and rubber products. The Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development (DFATD) estimates that chemical exports were worth C$18.6 billion (US$14.41 billion) in 2017, the same as in 2016. Of Canada's 3,000 chemical firms, 61% have fewer than 100 employees, while 31% are micro establishments with less than five staffs workers, according to Industry Canada. About 200 establishments are medium sized, employing between 101 and 499 personnel, while 17 companies, with more than 500 employees each, accounted for less than 1% of the total. Thanks largely to investor-friendly policies and rich natural resources, Canada is particularly attractive to global investors. Mergent research found that foreign ownership, predominantly by US and European interests, dominates many medium to large chemical companies, usually through subsidiaries, joint ventures and acquisitions. The largest chemical processing region, Central Canada, has become the engine of the economy and is home to seven of the ten biggest chemical companies, while the major petrochemical manufacturers are based in Western Canada. The industry is concentrated in three provinces: Ontario (44%), Alberta (27%) and Quebec (19%). Ontario has 1,200 chemical plants providing 43,000 high paying jobs and is the largest manufacturer, with exports worth more than C$14 billion (US$10.5 billion) a year. The industry has boomed in Ontario in recent years as the province is in the heart of North America, with easy access to cheap feedstock, biotechnology and nanotechnology. In Alberta, the industry is concentrated in the Fort Saskatchewan and Joffre areas, employing about 9,500 workers directly and supporting 47,000 jobs in the oil and gas, plastics, construction and other sectors. Over the next decade Alberta is likely to invest up to C$5 billion (US$3.7 billion) in the chemical sector. In Quebec, the industry provides more than 15,000 jobs at 350 facilities and employs around 3,000 workers in the relatively small petrochemical segment. Industrial chemicals, which add value to raw materials and act as intermediates for almost all manufacturing industries, are the mainstay of the sector. They are produced in bulk and account for more than half of chemical revenues. Basic chemicals, synthetic resins, rubbers and fibers are categorized as industrial chemicals, the main products including benzene, propylene, ethylene glycol, methanol, styrene, chlorine, sulfuric acid and polyethylene. Exports and Imports The chemical industry is export-driven, with 70% of chemicals produced exported in 2017, 80% of these to the US, followed by China (7%) and Mexico (3%). DFATD estimates that chemical exports totaled C$18.6 billion (US$14.41 billion) in 2017, the same as in 2016. Canada is a net chemical importer because, due to its relatively small domestic market compared with those of China and the US, manufacturers are reluctant to produce chemicals that require a large market to attain economies of scale. As increasing local consumption caused import growth to outpace that of exports the trade deficit widened by 7.3%, from US$26.1 billion in 2016 to US$28 billion in 2017. The minimal trade surplus in industrial chemicals remained highly dependent on external factors, with the ratio of exports to imports ranging between 0.7 and 0.8 over the past decade. Sector Employment The chemical industry employed 90,000 people in 2017 and supported another 520,000 jobs, with 40% working in administration and the remainder in production, according to Industry Canada. The CIAC estimates that one new chemical job generates five positions in other sectors, but the workforce has shrunk by 1.3% a year since 2004. Chemical personnel, among the most specialized and qualified, earned an average C$66,700 (US$51,725) annually, 25% higher than the average manufacturing salary of C$55,100 (US$42,729), in 2017. Industrial chemical salaries were higher, averaging income of CS$81,500 (US$63,203) annually. Chemical industry salaries and wages totaled C$5.4 billion (US$3.92 billion), with C$1.4 billion (US$1.09 billion) paid in the industrial chemical segment. In Ontario, the industry directly employed 44,700 people in 2017, an increase of 1.0% from the previous year. The industry supports around 270,000 jobs in the province and the number in industrial chemicals increased by 5.2% from 2016. Salaries and wages totaled C$3 billion (US$2.3 billion), an annual average of C$68,100 (US$52,811), while the industrial chemicals average annual income was C$81,800 (C$63,436). The average salary across all manufacturing industries in Ontario was C$58,800 (US$45,600). In Alberta, the industry employed 7,600 people in 2017, down by 7% from 2016, and supported around 45,000 jobs, with the number of employees in industrial chemicals totaling 3,970. In Quebec, the industry employed 22,600 workers and supported 135,000 jobs, with industrial chemicals employing 3,400 people. Sector Investment Chemical R&D and innovation is vital for the industry to stay competitive globally, especially in areas such as nanotechnology, advanced materials, biotechnology and energy utilization. The industry is one of the most investment-attractive sectors and accounts for a substantial proportion of manufacturing R&D expenditure, according to Industry Canada. Of the seven leading chemical manufacturers only Superior Plus Corp (TSX: SPB) and Chemtrade Logistic (TSX: CHE.UN) increased capital expenditure (capex), by a CAGR of 24.9% and 9.13%, respectively, over the four years through 2017. Superior Plus Corp's capex CAGR was mainly due to the purchase of tanks, pumps and regulators and to Superior signing new leases worth C$24.9 billion (US$19.37 billion). Chemtrade's capex CAGR of 9.13% was due to the acquisition of Connexus Corp in first quarter 2017. Chemtrade revamped its business units, introducing a new one that includes it sodium chlorate business and all newly acquired businesses. An economic downturn, especially in second half 2017, combined with low commodity prices, meant that most chemical companies had a negative CAGR over the four years through 2017. Bri-Chem Corp, a leading wholesale distributor of oil and gas drilling fluids, steel pipe and piping products, had the lowest capex CAGR, -37.07%, Methanex -34.91%, Agrium -18.77% and PotashCorp -18.31%. Capital Expenditure and Intensity of Canadian Chemical Companies  Source: Mergent analysis Policy and Regulatory Environment Canada is among world leaders in chemical regulation and has formulated a Chemicals Management Plan (CMP), not only to support the Strategic Approach to International Chemical Management (SAICM) but also to realize goals set by the World Summit on Sustainable Development for Chemicals by 2020. The Canada Consumer Product Safety Act (CCPSA), Pest Control Products Act (PCPA) and Food and Drugs Act (F&DA) are the major legislation used to implement the CMP. Under the Canada Environmental Protection Act (CEPA) 1999, the primary federal chemical legislation jointly administered by Environment Canada (EC) and Health Canada (HC), new chemical products must be submitted for safety evaluation before commercialization and all chemicals used in Canada must be registered on the Domestic Substances List. In 2006, 4,300 substances with potential persistent toxic effects were screened for further assessment through a categorization process. A CMP status report in June 2017 found that around 3,200 of the 4,300 substances requiring further attention were assessed and 420 substances were found to be toxic. The Canadian Government announced in October 2017 that the Environmental Protection Act 1999 (CEPA) and the Chemicals Management Plan (CMP) would be modernized and improved. The complete proposal for a revised CEPA was to be submitted by June 2018. A risk-based approach is used to regulate CEPA-toxic substances, with a variety of tools applied to evaluate and manage potential risks. The Government has the right to control the use of chemicals on the List of Toxic Substances through restriction or prohibition of use and release, prevention notices, codes of practice and public engagement, in addition to introducing voluntary self-regulation to minimize negative consequences. In May 2018, the Canadian Government proposed clearing cumene hydroperoxide and dicumyl peroxide as safe to be used under section 64 of CEPA. Cumene hydroperoxide is used widely in commercial products such as building and construction materials, and dicumyl peroxide is used in building and construction materials, in plastic and rubber materials, and in products used in automotive, aircraft and transportation applications. The Government expects to issue a final assessment in May 2019. More effective regulatory measures were introduced, benefitting Canadian chemical companies by lowering regulatory barriers, through the cross-border Canada-US Regulatory Cooperation Council (RCC) Initiative, which emphasizes chemical management, Environment Canada (EC), Health Canada (HC) and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have developed work plans on new uses of chemical substances and risk assessment to facilitate information collection and sharing, technical and scientific partnership, and risk evaluation methods. In addition to a tariff-free-zone for industrial manufacturers the Canadian Government has implemented a duty-free manufacturing tariff regime. The initiative has been largely welcomed by the industry for reducing costs, enhancing productivity, promoting innovation and increasing foreign investment inflow. However, smaller domestic producers say that they are losing out as intensified competition squeezes their profit margins. Industry Profile - US Industry Overview With chemical products used as intermediates for more than 96% of all manufactured goods, according to the American Chemistry Council (ACC), the US chemical industry is a key to improving living standards. Its development is associated closely with several macroeconomic and external factors, including economic development of major trading partners, monetary policies, exchange rates, geopolitical issues, commodity prices, the performance of manufacturing sectors and other key end-user markets such as automotive and construction. It is one of largest manufacturing sectors in the country with more than 10,000 companies employing 811,000 people and manufacturing more than 70,000 products to meet domestic and global demand. Its US$800 billion revenue accounted for 15% of the world total in 2016, according to the ACC, second only to that of China. Sales to end-use markets constituted 49% of total turnover, while intra-industry sales, such as that of ethylene to manufacture plastics, made up the remainder. Rubber and plastics was the biggest chemical-consuming sector, using US$76.1 billion worth of chemical products in 2016, followed by healthcare, agriculture and other manufacturing sectors, according to the ACC. Other main downstream industries included metals, energy, construction, food and beverage, electronics, machinery, construction, transportation, paper, textiles and apparel. The US is well known globally for its pharmaceuticals, petrochemicals, plastic resins and specialty chemicals. The sector is a vital pillar of the economy and has added more than US$300 billion, or more than 2%, to GDP annually since 2009, the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) estimates. Chemical shipments, including pharmaceuticals, US$788.3 billion in 2017, accounting for 16% of US exports, according to the ACC. DowDupont (NYSE: DWDP) is the largest US producer by sales, but is behind Germany's BASF (FSE: BAS) and China's Sinopec Corp (SSE: 60028) in the global market. The development of shale gas resources has changed the competitive landscape of the entire industry, which utilizes more gas-based feedstock than the oil-based feedstock commonly used by European and Asian manufacturers. This has enabled the country not only to transform itself from a high-cost to low-cost chemical maker but also to attract investment to avoid losing ground globally. With energy and feedstock prices remaining low the sector continues to attract local and overseas investors, with around 325 new chemical production projects nationwide as of April 2018, according to the ACC. These projects, 60% of which are foreign direct investment (FDI), have a combined value of more than US$194 billion. Investment in chemical and plastics manufacturing capacity is worth more than US$130 billion in 2017, ACC figures show. The US is expected to become a natural gas net exporter by 2018. Chemical investment is forecast to grow and exceed consumer spending as a driver of the US economy. The ACC estimates that, excluding pharmaceuticals, chemical capacity will grow 4.2% in 2018 and 4.1 in 2019. The agency estimates that capital spending will increase by more than 6% to US$35.7 billion in 2018. Exports and Imports Chemical shipment values rose from US$767.7 billion to US$788.3 billion in 2017, a rise of 2.68% according to the US Department of Commerce (DOC). The US Census Bureau divides chemical shipments into four segments: pesticides and fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, petrochemicals and chemicals used in paints, coatings and adhesives. US chemical shipments in January 2018 increased slightly 0.18% from a year earlier from US67.94 billion to US$68.06 billion according to the US Department of Commerce. Chemicals were the third largest non-durable goods industry in the US, behind transportation equipment's US$81.47 billion and food products' US$68.78 billion. In January 2018, three segments showed growth with paints and coatings, having the highest growth of 23% against January last year. Petrochemical segment, the largest sector had a 5.6% growth as oil prices increased and pharmaceutical rose by 8% while pesticides and fertilizers fell by 3% The ACC expects chemical exports to grow by an average 7% annually through to 2021 and exports of chemicals linked to shale gas to total US$123 billion by 2030, more than double the 2014 total. That will increase the trade surplus from these chemicals from US$19.5 billion to US$48.3 billion. Sector Employment Technological improvements have reduced the need for human labor and chemical employment, excluding pharmaceuticals, has dropped by 1.3% a year since 2005, despite 4% annual chemical production growth over the past decade, according to the ACC. Nonetheless, one chemical job has a 6.3 multiplier effect on the entire US economy, thanks to the need for auxiliary industries such as transportation. However, in 2017, sector employment rose by 0.01% from 810,900 in 2016 to 810,000, with an average US$93,000 annual wage, 47% more than the average manufacturing wage. The two most populous states, California and Texas, are the biggest employers, jointly hiring more than 140,000 people. The increase in their workforce began in 2013 and has continued despite some fluctuation. The combined employment levels of eight leading US chemical companies had a negative CAGR of 0.99% over the four years to 2017. This showed that the industry was providing fewer job opportunities, with only four companies hiring while the rest downsized. Strong growth momentum resulted in PPG Industries' (NYSE: PPG) workforce expanding at a CAGR of 1.43% from 44,400 workers to 47,000 workers, the highest growth among the gainers between 2011 and 2014. However, restructuring and cost reduction caused Air Products & Chemicals (NYSE: APD) to reduce workers from 21,200 to 15,300, a negative CAGR of 7.86%, Eastman Chemical (NYSE: EMN) from 15,000 to 14,000, a 1.71% drop, Huntsman (NYSE: HUN) from 16,000 to 15,000, a 1.60% fall and Praxair (NYSE: PX) from 27,780 to 26,461, a 1.21 drop. The ACC estimates that by end of 2018, the industry employed about 828,000 workers and in the next few years, the industry will add another 20,000 jobs. Employment Levels of US Chemical Companies  Sources: Respective company data and Mergent analysis Research, Development and Innovation Besides creating employment and improving lives chemical R&D and innovation are among the key drivers of technological advancement in other sectors, such as transportation and construction. Although the shale advantage has brought sustained long-term R&D expenditure growth the ratio of annual R&D spending to chemical sales has dropped since 2010, according to the ACC. R&D expenditure of eight key US chemical producers totaled US$4.6 billion in 2017, a negative CAGR of 2.20% since 2014, with only one company spending more on R&D annually. In 2017, 3M (NYSE: MMM) invested US$1.9 billion, the most among selected companies and had the highest R&D/revenue ratio of 1.79%. Despite management's emphasis on innovation, chemical and refining firm, Air Products' (NYSE: APD) R&D spending had a negative CAGR of 7.43% during the period and lowest R&D intensity among the eight companies. R&D Spending and Intensity of US Chemical Companies  Sources: Respective company data and Mergent analysis Sector Investment After years of high and volatile prices, new and more affordable domestic supplies of natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs) have created a competitive advantage for US chemical manufacturers, leading to greater investment, industry growth and new jobs. Companies from around the world are investing in new projects to build or expand their shale-advantaged capacity. The ACC announced that there were 325 projects and that chemical investment totaled US$194 billion as of April 2018, with 49%, completed or under construction, 45% in the planning phase and 6% of unknown or delayed status. More than 64% of the investment is from companies based outside the US. Investment has increased continuously, from US$70 billion in 2013 to US$100 billion in 2014, US$135 billion in 2015, US$168 billion in 2016 and US$170 billion in 2017. The projects include new facilities, expansions, and factory restarts. The agency projects that capital expenditure will increase to between US$240 and US$250 billion by 2020 with more than US$20 billion coming from new ethylene projects. The world's largest chemical maker DowDuPont Inc's (NYSE: DWDP) plans to invest over US$100 million in two years, expanding manufacturing capacity and upgrading facility at the Sabine River Works plant in in Texas, US announced in April 2017. The investment includes boosting annual ethylene and polyethylene capacity by 500,000 tonnes, making it the largest ethylene plant in the world and the later by 600,000 tonnes. DowDuPont will also build a polyolefin facility in Europe that will produce 450,000 tonnes of polyolefin annually and build a new innovation center in Michigan, US. A month earlier, the company announced its plan to invest US$50 million in kevlar production, including at Spruance plant in Chesterfield, England as there is strong demand for Kevlar globally. Kevlar is a high-strength fiber used in bullet-resistant vests, gloves and boots and in various industrial applications. The investment is the largest Kevlar expansion in England since a more than a decade ago. The investment will help meet growing customer demand, lift productivity and increase quality through better automation. Policy and Regulatory Environment The US is gradually amending its chemical regulations to reduce the adverse impact of chemical use and production after the European Union's (EU) implementation of the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH). Critics have long regarded the 1976 Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), administered by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), as heavily flawed and ineffective in controlling industrial chemicals, as it has not been updated for almost 40 years. Certain fundamental weaknesses of the act, including chemical commercialization without pre-market safety reviews and labeling, and resting the burden of proof of safety on the EPA instead of chemical companies, have caused many states to intervene by introducing stricter local policies. The TSCA issued three final framework rules in June 2017, published one year after the amended Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21stCentury Act was signed into law. The statutory deadline for actions must be completed within a year of the law's passage. The three rules are: the EPA should prioritize existing chemicals for evaluating their risks, the EPA will evaluate the risk posed by existing substances and the EPA will label substances on the TSCA inventory as active or inactive. As of April 2018, the EPA figures show the latest inventory contains 86,303 chemical substances which 38,303 substances are active and 48,000 have not been reported as active. 30,972 of active substances are on the public inventory and 7,331 on the confidential inventory. The EPA also notes there are over 100 pending proposed chemical regulations. The most popular proposed chemical regulations are related to limiting exposure to polyfluoroalkyl substances and flame retardants. Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances are highly fluorinated chemicals and studies by the EPA show that these substances when exposed are harmful to humans. These substances are widely used especially in everyday life, thus the EPA wants to reduce the use of these substances. Environmental Social and Governance DowDuPont's Social and Sustainability Approach DowDuPont's agriculture division Dow AgroSciences donated US$10,000 to Feeding America on April 2018. Feeding America is a hunger relief organization with a nationwide network of food banks feeding the hungry. This donation was intended to motivate farmers to engage in the 4R Nutrient Stewardship program practices and to support finding solutions to hunger problems across the country. The 4R Nutrient Stewardship is a framework to attain cropping system objectives such as heightened environmental protection, increased production and enhanced sustainability. The donation will help curb hunger issues across the country through food banks, disaster food assistance and senior, school and children-specific programs. It will provide 100,000 meals secured by Feeding America on behalf of local food banks. The Dow Chemical Co, a part of the DowDuPont Holding Co, partnered with Keep America Beautiful, a national nonprofit organization, to give US$100,000 in grants for institutions to establish Hefty EnergyBag programs in their communities. The program offers an innovative approach to diverting non-recyclable plastics, including cereal box liners and foam cups, from landfills and converting them into valuable energy resources. The 2018 grant program builds upon the success of 2017, when Dow made two US$50,000 grants to institutions in Cobb County, Georgia, and the City of Boise, Idaho, to launch the program in their respective communities. As of February 2018, the programs had gathered more than 44,500 orange bags, and had converted 25 tons of non-recycled plastics diverted from landfills since 2014. The Dow Gives Community Grants Program granted funds to 20 local organizations in 2017 through the Dow Chemical Company Foundation. The program supports local non-profit organizations establish projects that will improve the quality of life of residents of Southern Brazoria County in Texas.

Market Trends & Outlook US Petrochemical Plants Fuel Ethane Consumption and Exports Within the next two years, ethane consumption by the US petrochemical industry will surpass the combined consumption of all other petroleum and liquid products, the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates. The agency also forecast that ethane exports will continue to grow as the number of ethane pipelines and export terminals increases. Ethane is a crucial substance, used as a feedstock for ethylene, the base for most plastics, resins and other industrial products. The rapid expansion of plastics and petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast is responsible for the growth of ethane consumption. Three Gulf Coast ethylene crackers opened in 2017, boosting domestic ethane consumption by 210,000 barrels a day (b/d) to 1.2 billion b/d, according to the EIA. It anticipates that ethylene plant volume will continue to increase as six ethylene crackers, to be completed by the end of 2019, will together consume 380,000 barrels a day (b/d) of ethane. The agency expects the annual consumption of ethane to surge to 1.4 million in 2018 and 1.6 million b/d in 2019. There are many major projects under construction, including French oil major Total SA's (EPA: FP) planned US$1.7 billion ethane steam cracker alongside its Port Arthur, Texas, refinery, part of a joint venture with Austrian and Canadian private companies Borealis AG and Nova Chemicals Corp. Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM) plans to start up a new cracker at its Baytown complex, the largest petrochemical complex in the US, in first half 2018, to produce 1.5 million tons of ethylene annually. The EIA expects average annual exports to grow from 180,000 b/d in 2017 to 290,000 b/d in 2018 and 310,000 b/d in 2019. US-based natural gas pipeline transportation company Kinder Morgan's (NYSE: KMI) Utopia pipeline started transporting ethane from Ohio's Utica shale field to Canada in January 2018 and this is expected to drive part of US ethane growth. Ethane shipments from two terminals: Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania, and Morgan's Point, Texas, which started in 2016, supply petrochemical feedstock by tanker to countries such as Brazil and Sweden, and the EIA expects them to extend shipments to China in fourth quarter 2019. US-China Trade War Will Affect US Chemicals Industry Free trade has been a driver of the US chemical industry but a looming the trade war with China is a major concern, according to American Fuels and Petrochemicals Manufacturers (AFPM). President Trump announced in April 2018 that the US would impose tariffs on 1,300 Chinese products valued at US$$60 billion, of which 40% are chemicals, and will restrict Chinese investment in the US to punish China for alleged technology and trade-secret theft. In response China announced plans to raise tariffs on 128 US goods, including 44 chemical products. However, a late-May pledge by China to import more US products could avert a feared trade war, which would negatively affect the industry. China is the third biggest chemical exporter to the US, with shipments valued at US$10.6 billion in 2016, the latest year included in an American Chemical Council (ACC) analysis of US Department of Commerce data. The agency reported that China imported 11%, or US$3.2 billion worth, of all US plastic resins in 2017 and that the US exported chemicals and polymers worth US$11.5 billion, or 9% of its overall chemical exports, to China in 2017. US chemicals on which China could imposed tariffs include low-density polyethylene (LDPE), polyolefin elastomers and plastomers (POEs, POPs), polyvinyl chloride (PVC) resin and polycarbonate. The US exported more than 152,000 tonnes of LDPE worth US$$215 million and over 129,000 tonnes of polycarbonate worth US$$325 million to China in 2016. Investment worth US$185 billion to build new chemical factories in the US and expand and restart facilities around the country is predicated on current tariff schedules. A trade war with China would jeopardize these projects as market shifts caused by tariff increases could convince investors to do business elsewhere. Chinese tariffs would make US chemical firms unsure about selling their surplus products on the international market. Some major companies have raised the prices of their chemical products due to concerns over a trade war. Chemical Spending Surges Access to cheaper and more abundant feedstock and energy is a big advantage to American chemical manufacturers, increasing the number of chemical production projects to 320 worth more than US$185 billion, according to the American Chemistry Council (ACC). In addition to the new projects, industry capital spending totaled US$38 billion in 2017, accounting for half of total construction spending by the whole manufacturing sector. According to the agency, capital spending increased by 6% in 2017 and forecasts 6.3% growth in 2018 and 6.9% 2019, the total to reach US$48 billion by 2022. The country remains one of the leading destinations for chemical investment due to its cheap, abundant feedstock, with 62% of the US$185 billion in announced projects being foreign direct investment. Petrochemicals will dominate capital spending in the US chemical industry, the ACC forecasting that petrochemical capital investment will grow by 7% to US$8.6 billion in 2018, with major capacity additions, as the industry recovers from Hurricane Harvey-related disruptions and continues delayed projects. Chemical industry capital spending rose by 67% in seven years to $33.8 billion in 2017, the chemical sector accounting for half of manufacturing sector construction spending, according to the ACC. Industry capital spending in the US is expected to total US$48 billion in 2018, nearly two-and-a-half times the level in 2010, thanks largely to the shale boom. Planned plant turnarounds, shutdowns and outages rose by 5% in 2017, mostly in the refining industry according to the ACC. As demand for US feedstock remains high, primarily in overseas markets, refiners are likely to increase planned maintenance expenditure by 38.5% to US$1.26 billion in 2018. US tax reform, signed in December 2017, is expected to boost chemical capital investment. The reform reduced corporate tax from 35% to 21% and allows companies to claim 100% rebate on certain capital expenditure for the first five years. This should boost investment in major chemical projects. Market Outlook The threatened trade war between China and the US is casting a cloud over the US chemical industry. Nevertheless, it is poised to grow thanks to the benefits of shale gas, surging capital investment, continuous product innovation and the strengthening domestic economy. Chemical companies will continue taking advantage of abundant supplies of shale gas and its related products. Global markets are expected to improve as increased consumer confidence and improved employment conditions will continue to support sector growth, especially due to increasing automotive manufacturing and construction activities. The ACC says that US chemical production will increase in 2018 amid robust demand, especially for shale-related chemicals in domestic and overseas markets, and increased investment due to promising markets and capacity additions. However, a stronger dollar will hamper exports and make US chemicals less attractive in international markets, but strength in US manufacturing is providing a significant boost for chemical demand from end-users and is improving the job market. Market Trends & Outlook Canada Chemical Industry Essential for Low Carbon Economy Canada introduced the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change in January 2018, the Government's plan to meet its emissions reduction targets and create a clean economy. It aims to boost innovation and growth by encouraging technology development and adoption to make sure Canadian companies are competitive in the global low-carbon economy. It also includes actions to enhance climate change adaptation and build resilience to climate effects. The sector plays a major part in dealing with climate change globally. Canada has plentiful, low carbon resources, including natural gas and natural gas liquid, which are chemical feedstocks. More than 95% of all manufactured products depend on the chemical industry, without which advances in key industries, including green buildings, sustainable transportation, clean energy and sustainable agriculture would have not happened. The Canadian industry has been a leader in and shown its commitment to responsible and sustainable chemical manufacturing for more than two decades. The Chemistry Industry Association of Canada (CIAC) established an initiative, ?Responsible Care?, in 1985 and more than 62 countries have adopted it, pledging to fight climate change by reducing emissions from their facilities and making their products ?greener?. More and more countries are beginning to follow these practices as they recognize the importance of fighting climate change. Chemical manufacturing contributes less than 2% of Canada's national greenhouse gas emissions thanks to support from the Government and a commitment to innovation. The sector recognizes its role as an emitter of greenhouse gases and a climate change solutions provider. One of the goals of the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change, is to put a price on carbon pollution by the end of 2018. The Government wants it to start at US$10 a tonne, rising by US$10 a year to US$50 a tonne in 2022. With government support and the right policies the chemical industry could attract more than US$25 billion in new investment by 2025. This will not only stimulate economic growth and drive innovation but also influence the contribution that the industry makes in meeting rapidly growing worldwide market demand for chemicals with the lowest carbon emissions. Sustainable Chemistry Boosts Ontario Investment People are becoming more concerned about the environment and government urging and consumer demand for sustainable processes have pushed chemical manufacturers to shift to greener chemicals. This has become a priority as they seek to reduce negative impacts on the environment and ensure that their chemicals are safe for consumers. Sarnia-Lambton in Ontario, known as Chemical Valley, has been a petrochemical industry hub for more than seven decades, home to more than 60 chemical facilities and oil refineries. It is attracting green investment with the help of the Government, which provides incentives for chemical companies to build plants. Bioindustrial Innovation Canada (BIC), a Sarnia-based, not-for-profit institution, aims to help Ontario and Canada become global leaders in sustainable chemistry. The BIC and GreenCentre Canada announced in May 2018 that they will invest an undisclosed amount into waste water treatment services company Forward Water Technologies This will help the company to develop a commercial scale-up of a proprietary forward osmosis technology, allowing it to meet the rising global demand for fresh water and significantly cut wastewater treatment and disposal costs. It is expected to come online in 2022. BIC approved an unspecified investment in Texas-based private biodiesel company Benefuel Inc in May 2018. Benefuel plans to build refining plants, the first of which will produce 75-million liters of biodiesel a year, Production is likely to start in 2020 and a second project will double output. These projects will boost employment and spur economic growth in Ontario. Advance Chemical Technologies announced that is collaborating with private, California-based bio chemical company Origin Materials to build the second largest plana plant in Sarnia. It will produce polymers and other products from bio-based materials and should be operational in 2020. British Columbia-based private biochemical company S2G Biochemicals Inc plans to build a US$20 billion bio-chemical facility in Sarnia, with construction starting in 2018 and expected to be completed in 2020. It will produce 2,000 tonnes of the sweetener xylitol annually and bio-glycols from agricultural residues. London-based private biorefining and biomass company Comet Biorefining Inc plans to build a US$70 million plant in Sarnia, expected to come online in 2019. Comet's cellulosic dextrose innovation transforms non-food biomass, including agricultural and forest material, into high-purity dextrose. This has renewable biochemical and biofuel applications, such as replacing petroleum-based products in a range of industries. Western Canadian Liquefied Natural Gas Exports Surge Canada has ample natural gas deposits and, with global demand for natural gas expected to rise by 46% by 2040, there is a huge opportunity to exploit its resources. The Pacific North West LNG project is a major opportunity to strengthen the economy, creating 4,500 direct and 630 indirect jobs. Local First Nation communities will benefit significantly through agreements reached with the developer. The project will transport 19 million metric tons of liquefied natural gas (LNG) annually through the TransCanada pipeline to Lelu Island near Prince Rupert for export to Asia. The British Columbia Government estimates that LNG exports will rise to 2.2 billion cubic feet a day (Bcf/d) in 2020, from 1.6 billion cubic feet, and increase to 3.4 Bcf/d in 2032. LNG Canada, a partnership between four major natural gas companies with substantial experience in LNG: Royal Dutch Shell (AMS: RDSA), Korea Gas Corp (KRX: 036460), Mitsubishi Corp (TYO: 8058) and PetroChina (SHA: 601857), will build and operate an LNG export terminal at Kitimat, on British Columbia's northwest coast. Costing US$40 billion, it is the largest single infrastructure investment in BC's history Construction will begin in 2018 and is expected to be completed by 2027. TransCanada Corp will start construction of its US$4.7 billion Coastal Gaslink pipeline in early 2019. It will transport 5 Bcf/d of LNG from Alberta and northeast BC to a terminal near Kitimat for overseas shipment. The BC Government introduced new conditions and tax subsidies for the province's LNG projects in March 2018. They should attract more LNG investment in Western Canada and the Coastal Gaslink pipeline will bolster Western Canadian LNG exports. The pipeline will have a total capacity of six million tonnes of LNG a year, surging to 26 million tonnes through future expansion. Market Outlook The Canadian chemical industry is expected to grow by 27% through to 2020, according to the CIAC. Many companies are increasing investment and merging or expanding operations to stay competitive in the global market. Exports will continue to grow, as will demand for oil and gas production in North America, meaning more pipelines and other infrastructures projects. The growth of value-added industries related to resource development should expand the Canadian economy and benefit many sectors, including the chemical industry, bringing stable, high-paying jobs over the next 20 years. Canada has ample natural resources and a diversified economy with a variety of services and manufacturing. Rising business investment, driven by strong corporate balance sheets and a high level of foreign direct investment, should help raise production capacity. New shale gas and biomass feedstock, and a growing market for chemical-based solutions, place the chemical sector in a good position for growth. By working with the Federal Government to boost competitiveness, the industry should continue to see growth and environmental benefits.

The AgExpert software has been certified by Ag Data Transparent (ADT), a U.S.-based, notfor-profit company, which verifies the security of agricultural data gathered by firms working with farmers. \"Transparency and integrity are fundamental to what we do,\" Wall said. \"We want our customers, the producers, to know we are taking this seriously. Third-party verification shows they can trust us with their information. \"The ADT process is solid and simple, just like our software,\" he said. \"It tells our producers exactly how we handle their data, what we do with it and who has access to it. Data transparency is top of mind for our customers and it's a priority for us.\" The ADT certification means FCC is committed to industrywide principles, including transparency in data collection, access, use, portability, availability and retention, he said. FCC has become the first Canadian company to receive the ADT seal for its commitment to safeguarding farmers' data. FCC recently released its web-based version AgExpert Field, which enables producers to record, share and analyze field data, such as inputs, yields and field conditions -right from their mobile phone. It plans to soon launch a webbased version of it farm financial software, AgExpert Accounting. \"Grain Farmers of Ontario thinks this is a great first step for the industry in Canada and we recognize the importance of accreditations like ADT for services and products that collect farmer and farm data,\" said GFO spokeswoman Victoria Berry. \"We would congratulate FCC for achieving this.\" ADT administrator Todd Janzen said, \"All the companies and organizations that designed Ag Data Transparent understood the need for transparency and trust in the ag precision sector.\" \"They knew that data and analysis will continue to change and improve agriculture, but that the producer deserves to work with credible data partners. \"Certification shows a commitment to the producers, the backbone of the ag industry,\" he said. ADT represents a coalition of major farm organizations, commodity groups and agriculture technology providers. The ADT Evaluator was created to help producers understand where their data is going, who has access and control over it. ADT works to protect farmers in today's big-data market, he said. \"Only companies that meet all core principles regarding collection, access and ownership are awarded the certified seal.\" Guelph-based Canada Digital Agri-Food (CDAF), which is working to help farmers take full advantage of the Big Data era, welcomed FCC's certification. \"For ag-tech companies, the ADT process requires considerable commitment in terms of time and resources,\" said CDAF Director Karen Hand. \"As the first Canadian company to become ADT certified, FCC exemplifies incredible leadership in demonstrating their commitment to Canadian farmers as a farm-first organization -a value shared across the Canadian ag-tech landscape.\" CDAF's role is to help the agrifood sector make full use of the emergence of digital technology and precision farming. \"The ability of the Canadian agrifood sector to commit to the establishment of a comprehensive digital transformation strategy will determine our future as either leaders or followers in the global marketplace,\" it said. \"Through the development, implementation and operation of open, shared tools and platforms CDAF can equip Ontario farmers with decision support tools relevant to their farms,\" it said. \"CDAF will all enable participants to take advantage of builtin-Canada solutions designed to support them in the highly competitive global economy in which we operate.\""}, {"title": "Technology - Agricultural Technology; Reports from University of Guelph Describe Recent Advances in Agricultural Technology (Characterizing soil particle sizes using wavelet analysis of microscope images)", "article": "2018 JUN 7 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Agriculture Week -- Investigators publish new report on Technology - Agricultural Technology. According to news reporting originating in Guelph, Canada, by VerticalNews journalists, research stated, \"Soil texture (relative proportions of soil particles of varied sizes) is a fundamental soil physical property affecting almost all other soil physical properties and processes of agricultural, environmental and engineering importance. However, characterization of particle sizes in the laboratory presents a range of challenges in terms of the time, labor, difficulty and/or cost involved with the analysis.\" Funders for this research include NSERC Discovery, McGill Precision Agriculture and Sensor Systems Research Team. The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from the University of Guelph, \"Continuous wavelet transform (CWT) has been used in characterizing scale-specific variations in spatial or temporal domain as well as in image analysis. The objective of this study was to develop a CWT-based computer vision algorithm to characterize soil particle sizes from digital images captured with a microscope. A cheap portable microscope with 5 MP camera and maximum magnification of 200 x was used to develop an image acquisition system. Three images of air-dried, ground (2 mm) soil samples were captured in laboratory conditions for each soil sample (56 + 67 = 123) collected from two agricultural fields (Field26 and Field86) with highly variable soils. Triplicate in-situ images were also collected from 67 locations from Field86 after scrapping off surface residues. The color images were transferred to grey-scale images and the CWT was performed along the 20 equally-spaced rows and columns. The total area under the average global wavelet spectrum represented the total variation in any image. Two fractions of particle sizes; 'coarse' (diameter between 2.0 mm and 0.05 mm) and 'fine' (diameter < 0.05 mm), respectively, representing sand and sum of silt and clay were calculated based on the area under the curve and compared with lab-measured particle sizes using the hydrometer method. The lab-measured coarse- and fine-fractions showed strong agreement with the predicted (from image) fractions. The regression relationship showed the prediction capability of 87% and 88% for coarse (RMSE 44.7 g kg(-1)) and fine (RMSE 44.7 g kg(-1)) fractions, respectively for Field26 samples. A similar prediction was obtained (88% with RMSE 40.2 g kg(-1) for coarse and 88% with RMSE 40.3 g kg(-1) for fine) for Field86 samples. The efficiency of the wavelet algorithm shows promise in determining the particle sizes from an image and the portable nature of the image acquisition system results in a good proximal soil sensor.\" According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"In contrast to the laboratory images, a weak prediction (48% for coarse and 56% for fine) was observed for the images taken in-situ mainly due to the quality of the images as they were affected by various field conditions; this requires further research.\" Our news correspondents report that additional information may be obtained by contacting A.

This agreement addresses the Commissioner of Competition's concerns that the proposed transaction would have significantly harmed competition and innovation in Canada's agricultural sector. Following an extensive review, the Bureau concluded that the proposed acquisition would likely substantially lessen and prevent competition in Canada with respect to the supply of canola seeds and traits, soybean seeds and traits, seed treatments that protect crops against nematodes, and carrot seeds. To address those concerns, the agreement requires Bayer to sell its canola seed and traits business, soybean seed and traits business, carrot seed business, nematode seed treatment business, glufosinate-ammonium herbicide business, LibertyLink herbicide tolerance technology, assets related to the Centurion herbicide, and digital farming business in Canada. Bayer has proposed BASF SE as the buyer of the assets under the agreement. The Bureau is actively reviewing the suitability of BASF as the proposed buyer of these assets. The Bureau is satisfied that the agreement will preserve competition and innovation in important agricultural inputs such as canola seeds, Canada's highest acreage crop. Given that Bayer and Monsanto's businesses operate in many countries and the global nature of the transaction, the Bureau coordinated its review with other jurisdictions, including the European Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice (U.S. DOJ). The Bureau's strong relationships with the European Commission and the U.S. DOJ resulted in an efficient review of this matter. The Bureau will publish a comprehensive position statement on its review in the coming days.

The companies reached a settlement with the Justice Department that resolves the government's concerns the merger as initially structured would harm consumers and farmers, the U.S. said in a statement Tuesday. The agreement requires the sale of assets to BASF SE that Bayer has previously announced. The divestiture package is worth about $9 billion, the largest in a U.S. merger enforcement case, the government said. \"America's farm system is of critical importance to our economy, to our food system, and to our way of life,\" Makan Delrahim, the head of the department's antitrust division, said on a call with reporters. \"American farmers and consumers rely on head-to-head competition between Bayer and Monsanto.\" For Bayer, acquiring Monsanto is the last step in a corporate transformation as the 154-year-old company shed its plastics business and remade itself as a life-science company with equally-sized health and agriculture units. Once the deal is through, three global behemoths will dominate the world's agriculture industry, a prospect that has left farmers worried about the possibility of higher prices and less choice. Significant divestitures The settlement came together after Justice Department antitrust officials pressed for significant divestitures to remedy the competition problems from combining the two companies. The companies have received antitrust approval from most jurisdictions around the world. Bayer has said it's confident the deal will close by the June 14 deadline. Bayer expects to receive the approvals it needs from Canada and Mexico in the coming days, according to a statement from the Leverkusen, Germany-based company. The European Union approved BASF as the buyer of the assets Tuesday. Bayer can then close the deal once it has the remaining approvals even though the integration of the two companies won't happen until the BASF divestitures are finished, which will probably be in about two months. Monsanto, based in St. Louis, said it was pleased with the U.S. approval. Merger wave The Monsanto takeover extends a series of tie-ups in the agricultural industry. Last year, U.S. and EU regulators approved two other major deals in the sector, Dow Chemical Co.'s merger with DuPont Co. and China National Chemical Corp.'s takeover of Syngenta AG. With about $48 billion in sales from their combined businesses, Bayer and Monsanto will surpass those of both DowDuPont Inc. and China National. The Justice Department said without the asset sales, the merger would have created a range of competitive harms. Both companies sell seeds and chemicals to farmers, and the combination would have raised prices and reduced choice, the U.S. said. The deal as initially proposed also would have combined Bayer's seed treatments with Monsanto seeds, giving Bayer the incentive and ability to raise prices that rival seed companies pay for treatments, the government said. Both companies also compete in developing technology that improves crop yields for farmers, the government added. \"When BASF combines the divestiture assets with its existing portfolio of crop protection products, it will have the breadth of product offerings to step into Bayer's shoes and be an effective competitor to the other integrated agricultural technology companies,\" Delrahim said. More divestitures Bayer initially agreed in October to sell some of its seed and chemical businesses to BASF for 5.9 billion euros ($6.8 billion). The deal included the Liberty herbicide brand, cotton and soybean seeds, and seed-trait and breeding capabilities. Then in April, Bayer said it was selling more pieces of its agricultural business to BASF for as much as 1.7 billion euros to satisfy regulators. That deal covered Bayer's vegetable-seeds business, other herbicides, research on wheat hybrids, and Bayer's digital farming business. Those businesses had combined sales of 2.2 billion euros last year. Bob Young, president of Agricultural Prospects in Grasonville, Maryland, said the merger is a good idea given that DowDuPont deal was approved. Currently, only DowDuPont has the advantage of streamlining both seed and chemical research and development within one company. \"If you were going to let Dow-DuPont go forward, then you probably want this one to go forward, too,\" Young said. 'Toxic mega-merger' Friends of the Earth, an environmentalist group, criticized the government's decision to approve the merger, calling it a \"toxic mega-merger\" that will hurt farmers and consumers. \"The DOJ's weak divestment requirements will do nothing to stop Bayer-Monsanto from controlling more and more of our food system,\" Tiffany Finck-Haynes, senior food futures campaigner with Friends of the Earth, said in a statement. \"This merger will damage the bargaining power of family farmers, prevent farmers from accessing diverse seed varieties, and allow seed prices to rise.\" Credit: By Bloomberg | |"}, {"title": "Resson; Mahindra & Mahindra Joins McCain Foods and Monsanto Growth Ventures As Strategic Partners in New Brunswick-Based Resson", "article": "2018 MAY 21 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Journal of Engineering -- Resson, a predictive analytics company for the agricultural industry, announced a $14 million Series C up round of financing that welcomed Mahindra & Mahindra as a strategic partner, joining existing strategic partners McCain Foods and Monsanto Growth Ventures as well as existing investors Build Ventures, Rho Canada, BDC Capital, East Valley Ventures and the New Brunswick Innovation Foundation.

Motorleaf's hardware and software support and strengthen the human and environmental aspects of greenhouse production, helping to predict accurate harvest amounts in a tight-margin industry. By providing a digital agronomist, Motorleaf's yield prediction tools help greenhouse operators meet contract obligations, better plan weekly operations and forecast production capacities in real time. \"We see strong potential in leveraging advanced data analytics to further optimize predictability and performance of production in commercial greenhouse and indoor farm production,\" said Ulrich Eisele, Managing Director of Osram's Fluxunit. For horticultural applications, Osram already supplies specially developed lighting solutions designed for cultivating plants in greenhouses or indoor farms that stimulate and manage plant growth. Adjusting light in the context of overall environmental growing conditions to the specific needs and characteristics of a plant has a strong impact on actual yield and quality of the plants produced. Motorleaf's solution adds smart harvest forecasts based on artificial intelligence. In initial trials with California greenhouse SunSelect, Motorleaf's technology led to a 50 percent reduction in yield prediction error in tomatoes. These results were enough for SunSelect to adopt Motorleaf's algorithms after a short trial. However, yield prediction is just the first step in Motorleaf's solutions for producers. \"Better yield prediction is only the beginning for Motorleaf's value to this sector,\" says Motorleaf CEO Alastair Monk. \"We're ultimately producing dynamic grower protocols, which help manage everything from light and nutrients to predicting crop diseases before they happen, and optimized growing conditions that increase ROI -- all based on real-time data.\" In this seed financing round, Fluxunit, along with financial investors Radicle Growth, Desjardins Capital, Real Ventures, BDC Capital and 500 Startups Canada invested $2.85 million USD in Motorleaf. Osram recently expanded its horticulture portfolio with the acquisition of US-based specialty luminaire supplier Fluence Bioengineering. Via Fluxunit, Osram also acquired a stake in the horticulture startup Agrilution in 2017. Intelligent lighting plays an increasingly important role in the food supply of rapidly growing mega-cities, and horticultural lighting solutions open up an attractive growth market for Osram.

This was driven by an increase in sales in the company's Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Gross profit in the first quarter of 2018 remained constant at $6.8-million compared with the first quarter of 2017. Gross margin was 43.0 per cent compared with 46.8 per cent in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a lower-margin mix of products sold versus the prior year. Total operating expenses increased to $7.8-million compared with $6.2-million in the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to higher R&D (research and development) costs associated with new corporate initiatives, as the company invests in improving and developing new products. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses increased to 49.6 per cent compared with 42.6 per cent in the first quarter of 2017. Net loss in the first quarter was $1.0-million or one cent per share, compared with net income of $3.6-million or three cents per share in the first quarter of 2017. Net income in the prior-year quarter included $3.0-million of other income associated with the company's entry into a strategic agreement with Hemisphere GNSS Inc., a world-class provider of global navigation satellite system technology. EBITDA in the first quarter of 2018 was ($500,000) compared with $4.1-million in the first quarter of 2017. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the first quarter of 2018 totalled $10.2-million compared with $13.9-million at the end of 2017. The company used some cash to build inventory ahead of the large bulk purchase it will begin to deliver in July. Working capital was $19.5-million at the end of the first quarter compared with $20.3-million at the end of 2017.

When my family started farming in Norfolk in 1796, the world's population was one billion. Supporting a global population requires a tremendous acceleration of knowledge and technology to produce more food, feed,fibre and fuel, while trying to use less energy, water, chemical and acreage. A study by management consultants McKinsey and Co., expects that, by 2025, the world's emerging economies will develop middle classes with the ability to spend $30 trillion annually in global markets for the kind of things we grow, feed, mine and manufacture. The consultants call this the \"biggest growth opportunity in the history of capitalism.\" Farmers are early adapters of technology -something that has been documented over the 10,000 year history of agriculture. In contrast to days gone by, intensive agriculture, precision farming, biotechenhanced production, mechanization, automation, robotics and drones continue to play a much larger role in today's agri-business. For the sake of Ontario's agri-food future, we must up our game. We need people who have a background in science, mechanics and computers, as well as animal husbandry and crop production. Those involved know that farming and the food business can be a tough way to make a living. Farming and finding a market are always difficult. We need to ensure confidence that farming has the potential for a rewarding and prosperous career. Production advances are many, but it still takes a seed to grow a plant and feed to raise livestock. Beyond that, we need policy for confident action to capitalize on any projected boom and enhanced trade in farm commodities. Those of us living out in the country need to be assured that we are not forgotten. We have issues -supply management, trade, broadband, natural gas, soil erosion, school closings, health care, farm prices, minimum wage, debt and taxes-the list goes on. The best part of myjob is visiting and listening to what people have to say in small-town Ontario. My last degree was in agriculture extension and I find those principles valuable to relay ideas and concerns and solutions back and forth to Queen's Park. I've been attending farm meetings for as long as I can remember -with my father, my grandfather. Our farms, as T.B. Barrett and Son, signed up for the Federation of Agriculture in the 1950s and had joined the Norfolk Co-op in 1918. In my view, the backbone of our rich agribusiness and country culture in Haldimand-Norfolk and across Ontario is our plethora of farm commodity and small-town organizations. There are 2.2 million people who work directly and indirectly in agri-food. They are major players in Ontario's rural economy, as well as that of the entire province. These farmers and experts in production should play key roles in making the decisions that impact them the most. We can be the breadbasket for the globe, and support the comeback of our farm and rural areas. But, to do this, we must get our economic and political fundamentals in order. Developing our agricultural and natural resources need not be an afterthought.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ola RollA(c)n. Please go head. OLA ROLLA(c)N, CEO, PRESIDENT & DIRECTOR, HEXAGON AB: Thank you. Welcome to this first quarter of 2018 interim report presentation. And if you go to Slide #4 in the deck, overview of the first quarter. Organic growth came in at 7% and that's equal to the recorded growth, which also was 7%. And within those 2 numbers, you have a negative FX impact of 8%, primarily the Chinese renminbi and the U.S. dollar. And then you have a positive impact of 8% from acquisitions. We saw 13% organic growth in China, we had 11% growth in Geosystems and 9% organic growth in Manufacturing Intelligence. And we recorded a 62% EBIT margin -- sorry, gross margin and an EBIT margin of 23.8%. If we move to Slide 5, Q1 is now our weakest quarter, and that has to do with the geographic mix change away from Europe and North America to Asia. But it was our strongest Q1 ever. On Slide 6, we see the key numbers. Net sales amounted to EUR 834.7 million, which is 7% organic and 7% recorded growth. Operating earnings, EUR 198.3 million, which is 12% up from the same quarter previous year. And for those of you who have the old report from 2017, these are the restated numbers according to the new IFRS rules. Earnings per share, excluding nonrecurring items, grew by 10% from EUR 0.39 to EUR 0.43. If we move to Slide 7, cash flow. Cash flow from operations before changes in working capital and taxes and interest paid grew to EUR 255 million. If we look at taxes paid and change in working capital, those are really the 2 items that are materially different from the same period of last year. We can see that we paid almost double as much in taxes paid. We also see an adverse impact on the change in working capital, and this is the normal situation in the first quarter for Hexagon. I would say that we had an exceptionally good working capital development in the first quarter of last year. Do we expect significant growth, adverse growth in the working capital, going forward? No. I think this is roughly the level. Typically, we have an outflow in working capital in the first half, and then we have an influx of capital in the second half. This time it was accounts payables where we simply had an adverse effect in our working capital position. We also want to highlight investment intangible assets. There is nothing exceptional in the first quarter, but planning ahead then for your calculations going forward, you need to take into account that we will acquire a property, an R&D property in Canada, in Calgary, and we've also started the construction of our new facility in China. So we expect it will increase and be in the range of EUR 145 million to EUR 165 million in this fiscal year. Still, in spite of the adverse development of working capital, if we look at Slide 8, working capital to sales is developing well and is now at 13%. This is a function of increased software content and increased recurring revenues. If we had 100% recurring revenues, this would, of course, be negative. So it shows the difference from 100% to where we're at, at the moment. Market development, if we go to Slide 10, sales mix per geographic region. North America, slightly lower than this time last year, 29% versus 31%. We see Western Europe strengthening its position from 31% to 32%. Asia Pac also grew on the back of good development in Australia and Southeast Asia. Slide 11. China reported strong growth, 13%. Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa were also double-digit growth, and so was South America. North America, good growth; Western Europe as well, but single digit. Asia excluding China, also single-digit growth in the quarter. Slide 12 is for your reference. It's a lot of information but you can see the various segments per geographic area. Slide 13, EMEA. Western Europe recorded 4% organic growth. We saw good growth stemming from a recovery or a comeback to strong growth in construction and infrastructure segments in Germany and France and Italy. We saw weak development in the U.K. U.K. is at record levels but in recent quarters, growth has been somewhat weaker. I think it's -- it would be a guess to connect it to Brexit or anything else. It could also be just a breather in the market. Growth is mainly driven, as I said, by infrastructure and construction. We saw new products like our BLK 360 gaining traction. We've launched that in Europe and North America, and we yet have to launch it in the rest of the world. The recovery is continuing in Russia, and we saw strong double-digit growth for all business units in Russia, and we also saw Middle East coming back to growth in the quarter. Now as you can see on the table to the right, GES is outgrowing IES in this region. If we move to Americas, Slide 14, North America recorded 8% organic growth, and that was once again on the back of strong infrastructural investments and a construction market that was buoyant. We saw mining and public safety solutions grow strongly in North America as well. Industry was somewhat weaker. Aerospace, automotive, not as strong demand as the other sectors. Solid development in new solutions and recovery for PP&M in the U.S. South America is now returning to growth, and we saw double-digit growth in South America. And it's Brazil recovering for the second quarter in a row. Moving to Asia. China recorded 13% organic growth, and that's on the back of continued strong demand from our electronics customers. And we also saw solid development from tier 2, tier 3 industrial enterprises all across China, and we also saw good development in the Smart City solutions. Southeast Asia recorded 28% organic growth. The powerhouse in the quarter was really Vietnam, that continues to go from strength to strength. A lot of international companies are relocating their operations to Vietnam at the moment. Weak development in Japan and India. Reporting segments, if we go to slide 17, Industrial Enterprise Solutions. MI grew by 9% organic growth. Auto and aerospace improved globally, but it was really China that was the powerhouse for MI in the quarter. PP&M, 1% organic growth mainly driven by favorable growth in project control software and recent order wins in Korea and China. The Oil and Gas segment was weak, but we do see improvements going forward, so growth is expected to accelerate in the coming quarters. Due to mix, where PP&M didn't grow as fast as MI, we had a slight reduction in operating margin from 24.2% to 24.1% in the quarter. Geospatial Enterprise Solutions, Slide 18, organic growth of 8%. Geosystems recorded a very strong 11% growth, and its new products, the BLK 360, mining infrastructure and construction driving this growth. SI, 5% organic growth. We have good prospects and a good founding for our safe city and public safety solutions. Positioning, still weak market for offshore positioning, but the NovAtel business grew by double-digit growth, backed by strong demand in agriculture and defense. We saw good development for both sales EBIT and operating margin for Geospatial in this quarter. Slide 19, Gross margin. The 12-month rolling is now at 61%, up 1% against this period last year. For the quarter itself, it was 62%. Slide 20, EBIT margin, 24% in the quarter, which is our seasonally weakest quarter, and 24% on a 12-month rolling. The targets are unchanged. Base scenario, 27% and opportunity scenario, 28% by 2021. Orders and product releases. If we turn to Slide 22, we announced that we're acquiring AGTEK. It's a U.S.-based software company, specialized in planning and productivity software for heavy civil construction and engineering, i.e. roadworks. And our intention is to connect this software to our machine-control solutions, Hexagon machine controlled construction, and have a seamless portfolio of software and hardware solutions for civil engineering and roadworks. On a longer term, we also have plans and roadmaps to connect it to Hexagon SMART Build, where SMART Build would then not only stretch building and construction, but also engineering and infrastructure. Slide 23, driving mine safety through collision avoidance. We've launched a new product called Personal Alert, which is a subproduct for our collision avoidance family of products, where we now have vehicle mounted and personnel mounted sensors that can alert vehicles in the mine, if there is about to be a collision or an accident. And Glencore Coal in South Africa is the first customer that now will standardize on this solution. It's actually a -- it's compulsory in South Africa via the Department of Mineral Resources to have collision avoidance systems in South African mines. Slide 24. We've captured a number of orders in the quarter from the mining sector. Reality Capture from Singareni Collieries Company in India, planning software from Fekola Mine in Mali and safety solutions, collision avoidance, from Codeldo in Chile. Slide 25. We're launching a new product this quarter, called HxGN AgrOn. HxGN AgrOn is a software solution where we connect precision agriculture sensors with the office on large farms to do real-time measurements and resource allocation, sort of ERP system for a farm. And we already closed deals with two Brazilian companies in the quarter involved in the sugarcane industry and that's SAPSo Martinho. And then we have Suzano, which is the largest pulp and paper company in Latin America. Slide 26. We got an order from a major aerospace OEM who wants to remain anonymous, and they will incorporate our simulation solution into their development process for the next-generation aircraft. Major aerospace OEMs use MSC Apex to do conceptual modeling workflows when they design the next generation. And they do this to reduce the design cycle time and avoid potential human errors in the early design stages. Slide 27, we're launching a new product, called BendingStudio with an Absolute Arm and this creates the ability to connect directly to a CNC machine, bending machine, your metrology software. And you have speedy determination of exact geometry to tell whether you're producing scrap or good things. So it's another in-line solution for CNC machines. Slide 28, we're launching the next generation of Adams products. In computer-aided engineering, Adams is a classic software. And we launched the next generation. We acquired MSC in, well, about this time last year, and we worked hard on refreshing and modernizing this product. And I think it's fair to say that I think we have a really good product in this field now. Slide 29, Managing underground utilities for a Smart City. We got an order from the third largest city in the Indian state of Gujarat, and they're going to implement our GIS-based project management tool for underground utilities. And that's going to include utilities like water, sewer systems and telecoms. And it's based on our GIS platform, GeoMedia. Slide 30, Predictive analytics for crime prevention. You can use our technology to predict where crime is going to happen and the city of San Pedro Garza GarcAa in Mexico is standardizing on our platform and the police will use our platform to predict the likelihood of crime in certain locations. You basically geo-reference incidents and you follow-up over time and you can see when crime happens, where crime happens. And you can man your resources accordingly. Slide 31. We got a large order from the Viennese Professional Rescue service. It's the largest rescue organization in Austria, and they have more than 100 ambulances covering an area with 1.9 million residents. They manage roughly 1,000 incidents per day and they used our dispatch solutions to do -- well, to improve productivity for their organization. Slide 32. AT&T is using our technology to extend their footprint to another 90 million customers in North America. AT&T is the world's largest telecommunications company, and they have already used our technology for network, design and installation tools, for its landline footprint in the West and Midwest regions of United States. And now they're extending this into the Southwest regions of -- region of the United States, that will add another 90 million customers to our platform. Slide 33, Driving innovation with top-of-the-line enterprise engineering software. PP&M received orders from, among others, FG LLC, which is an owner-operator based in Taiwan. And SINOPEC renewed their commitment to PP&M in the quarter. Finally, Slide 34, internal investments of large scale. We're opening our new campus in China in Hongdao in the Shandong province in China in 2020. It's a 52,000 square meter, state-of-the-art facility, and we're using all our tools when construing this campus. So we use HxGN SMART Build, we use our surveying equipment, we use our construction equipment to build it. We're going to use our security and safety systems to protect it, and we're going to showcase all our technologies for our Chinese customer base so that we have a Chinese demo center -- state-of-the-art demo center. In July of 2018, we inaugurate our new R&D facility in Calgary in Canada. Calgary is our R&D center for the Positioning Intelligence division, and we develop GPS or GNSS technologies in Calgary. It will house roughly 600 employees. I think this is what I wanted to point out when you calculate investments going forward. We're going to have investments of EUR 90 million to EUR 110 million in this fiscal year related to these 2 new facilities. So you should budget for tangible assets investments in the range of EUR 145 million to EUR 165 million in 2018. Finally, some advertisements. We have a Capital Markets Day in Las Vegas in connection to our user conference HxGN LIVE 2018. Hexagon LIVE will kick off from the 12th of June and last till the 15th of June, and we will have the Capital Markets Day the day after, the 13th of June, in The Venetian, Las Vegas. If you're interested, please contact us at cmd@hexagon.com. So in summary, Slide 37. Strong growth in Geosystems, Manufacturing Intelligence. An excellent start to a hopefully good year for Hexagon, another good year. 13% organic growth in China, continued robust demand from the electronics industry. Positive development in PP&M. Growth expected to accelerate in the quarters to come. Strong profitability despite this significant euro strength that we currently see in the market. And with that, operator, we've come to the final slide of my presentation, and we're now ready to open up for questions. Questions and Answers OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) We will take an opening question from Guillermo Peigneux of UBS. GUILLERMO PEIGNEUX, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND INDUSTRIALS ANALYST, UBS INVESTMENT BANK, RESEARCH DIVISION: Guillermo Peigneux from UBS. Just a couple of questions. First regarding China. As you highlighted, China is a little bit slower, but still strong growth in electronics and Smart City. I was wondering whether you could point what was slower in the quarter. What industries were lower? And whether this is just the base effect? So that's the first question on China. The second on PP&M. Can you give an indication of the magnitude of a recovery that you point to in the press release regarding PP&M recovering in the subsequent quarters? Is there any orders at hand or any activity that you could highlight us -- helping for us to address the magnitude of recovery there? OLA ROLLA(c)N: I don't think you can address the magnitude of recoveries, that's up to our salespeople to do. So I will pause on that. I'm just stating that it's -- we believe it's going to grow faster in the quarters to come. And if you listen in on the 31 of July, I will tell you exactly how much it's grown. When it comes to China, yes, it's a slowdown compared to Q4. I still think 13% organic growth is decent growth. What we saw sequentially slowing down was certain parts of the manufacturing industry, like auto for example, that didn't grow as fast sequentially as it did in the fourth quarter. Is that a long-term issue? I don't know. I think long term and then my outlook is the next 4 or 5 years. I think we're going to see good growth from the auto industry, simply because all auto manufacturers now need to provide 3 platforms. It's been combustion engines up till now. Now it's going to be combustion engines, hybrids and electric cars. And this is putting a lot of pressure on their investment budgets, and especially in China where we see a lot of local manufacturers switching to electric cars. GUILLERMO PEIGNEUX: And can I follow up on Smart Cities? Can you comment on how many cities in China have you already received orders from? OLA ROLLA(c)N: It's less than 5, right now. OPERATOR: We will take our next question from Markus Almerud of Kepler Cheuvreux. MARKUS A. ALMERUD, SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, KEPLER CHEUVREUX, RESEARCH DIVISION: Markus Almerud from Kepler Cheuvreux. Starting out with Geosystems, you said that infrastructure is one of the key drivers. Can you talk a little bit about the regions, which regions stick out? And then I -- if I can also ask on the new product, you say that there's about 2 percentage points of the organic growth is new products. Which products account? Is it mainly the BLK 360 or are there others as well? OLA ROLLA(c)N: It's -- if we start with a new products, I would highlight 3 products -- product lines. It's our GeoRadar solution, where we use radar rather than laser to predict mudslides, landslides, rock falls and so on. And we see really good growth for that. We use a similar technology to create so-called ground penetrating radar where you can locate assets underground like fiber optical cable, sewage systems and so on. And in general, you could say the GeoRadar solution is gaining a lot of traction in the market. The second product line would be BLK 360, which has really good growth in the quarter. And the third solution I would point at is our new vision technologies in MI directed towards the electronics industry. MARKUS A. ALMERUD: Okay, thank you. And when it comes to the infrastructure, what -- any regions that particularly sticks out? Or it's just across the board? OLA ROLLA(c)N: Now it's Central Europe, driven by France, Germany and Italy, which is coming back. And this is the first time we see solid demand in Central Europe since the financial crisis. But we also saw a return to growth in North America, primarily United States actually. MARKUS A. ALMERUD: And then finally, if I can just ask also on manufacturing. I'm a little bit surprised that you see weak demand in manufacturing in the U.S. Can you just talk a little bit about that and what's behind that. Is there specific areas of manufacturing that is behind, et cetera? OLA ROLLA(c)N: It's primarily aerospace, and I think it's a changeover of models. OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Stacy Pollard of JP Morgan. STACY ELIZABETH POLLARD, HEAD OF SOFTWARE AND IT EQUITY RESEARCH, JP MORGAN CHASE & CO, RESEARCH DIVISION: Just a few from me, please. Operating margins seemed to have held up relatively well, particularly in light of the FX headwinds. Could you provide some more details around product mix and the improvements in your cost structure? How that's progressing? Second one would be just about M&A. And then -- how are you seeing the valuations in the market on that? And then third question, any changes in the competitive position either in PP&M, so for example, of course, we have seen Aveva and Schneider come together. Any thoughts on that? And also within MI or metrology or even agriculture, it sounds like you're trying to be more competitive there as well. OLA ROLLA(c)N: Okay. Cost wise, the benefit we got cost wise. Well, we had 2 benefits in our cost structure, or 3 actually. We have product mix, we have the cost rationalization program that we launched in the first quarter of '17. That is now giving us cost reductions of -- in the tune of EUR 10 million per quarter. And then thirdly, what we do have as an improvement FX wise is the weakening Swiss franc, where we have costs in Switzerland, which in euros is becoming less expensive. So that's the cost side. And if you do a proper calculation on our incremental margin on the EBITDA level, it was actually 60% in the quarter, which is a very good drop-through for a quarter. So cost is under control. If we talk about M&A, I would say that's not under control. Some of the multiples that we see in our market right now are outright crazy. It's -- we backed out of the, I don't know, 4 or 5 processes in the past 6 months, simply because of price. But you can still find really attractive acquisitions, but you need to be very picky right now and buying the stuff that gives you good synergies. And hopefully we're going to come back to that. STACY ELIZABETH POLLARD: And then competitive? OLA ROLLA(c)N: And then -- and competitive situation, no, we haven't seen much change in the competitive landscape this quarter. Agriculture, yes, we're trying hard to catch up with the leaders in that industry. And it's fair to say that, apart from our GNSS solution, we're very small at this moment. But AgrOn will hopefully help us grow that segment much -- to a much larger size. OPERATOR: We will take our next question from Mikael LasA(c)en of Carnegie. MIKAEL LASA(c)EN, HEAD OF SOFTWARE AND SERVICES & FINANCIAL ANALYST, CARNEGIE INVESTMENT BANK AB, RESEARCH DIVISION: All right. I also had a question regarding your margins mainly in the Geospatial segment where incremental margins were really good. Can you explain this in more detail why they improved so much? I guess, after [switch] from one thing? OLA ROLLA(c)N: Sorry, I can't -- there is a very -- there is a buzz on your line. MIKAEL LASA(c)EN: Okay. I will try to call in again and see if I can get through. OLA ROLLA(c)N: Yes, we will wait for you. OPERATOR: We will take our next question from Daniel Djurberg of Handelsbanken. DANIEL DJURBERG, RESEARCH ANALYST, HANDELSBANKEN CAPITAL MARKETS AB, RESEARCH DIVISION: Starting again with the PP&M, you stated that you will see pulling improved growth in coming quarters. And is this partly, of course, oil and gas recovery? Or is that more of a 2019 happening to start there? OLA ROLLA(c)N: I definitely hope it's a 2018 happening. It's not oil and gas related. We worked hard on penetrating other segments of the market. So hopefully oil and gas, it seems to be at the bottom. We plotted our sales of seats, software seats, to the CapEx cycle of the oil and gas sector. And there is a fantastic correlation between the 2. And CapEx seems to be improving slightly in that market. But as I said, at the same time, we've worked hard in this downturn to penetrate new segments of the market. And we expect good wins from those segments. DANIEL DJURBERG: Okay, thanks. Another question if I may would be regarding your predictive analytics. There is a lot of talk about artificial intelligence, et cetera nowadays. I was thinking it's -- are you using your own analytics, IPR? Or do you buying this from third party, et cetera? If it's your own, can you (inaudible) license this (inaudible) for selling? Any comments on that. OLA ROLLA(c)N: We have our own analytics and we're building our own AI group right now with competencies from around the world for various applications. We see it being used in all our divisions. So it's a group project and we connect it closely to our IoT platform. And we've been looking at models where we could license out the entire package: IoT connections, orchestration, analytics and presentation on a mobile platform via our technology. So it looks quite promising actually. DANIEL DJURBERG: Interesting, we will hear more about that in Las Vegas. Another -- last question would be on SMART Build. I know it's still early days so on, but now we have also AGTEK integration ahead. So can you say anything about how AGTEK will change the size of the offering relative to (inaudible) trend, when that will happen? OLA ROLLA(c)N: The basic fundamentals are the same and that is we're not a BIM. A BIM is beautiful 3D model. We want to create almost an ERP system, something that you can work with when you build stuff. And so far, we've tried to encompass building construction, i.e. when you erect buildings. With AGTEK, we can now look at connecting infrastructure, civil engineering projects like bridges. I know some people in the construction industry call it flat or horizontal projects rather than vertical, if that makes sense. Vertical projects would be building and buildings and horizontal would be roads, tunnels, bridges and so on. So we believe that we can finally connect SMART Build with that construction process as well. OPERATOR: We will take our next question from Gal Munda of Berenberg Capital Markets. GAL MUNDA, ANALYST, BERENBERG, RESEARCH DIVISION: Hello, can you hear me? OLA ROLLA(c)N: Yes. GAL MUNDA: That's perfect. I have got a few questions. The first one is just if you can comment on the recent consolidation in construction industry, especially on the recent build that your competitor in the U.S. did. Is that something -- is adding additional pieces of the BIM puzzle important for you at this stage? Or are you more relying on building your own? How do you think about build versus buy in that sense, especially in light of the multiples you mentioned? And then the second one, which is to be connected with -- in connection with MSC. I don't know if you can comment, give us any clarity on the growth? How it's progressing? You mentioned one important win on APAC side? If you have any color on that, that would be very helpful. OLA ROLLA(c)N: Thank you. No, we had a vision long ago for the construction industry and thus, we acquired PP&M in the Intergraph, and we got the platform and the foundation to create SMART Build. So I wouldn't say that -- we're always going to make bolt-on acquisitions when we expand into a market. But I would say that the basic fundamentals for SMART Build are now in the hands of our developers. We don't need to make huge investments in terms of M&A to realize our vision in the construction market. Regarding MSC, they grew 10% organically in the quarter. OPERATOR: We will take our next question from Max Fryden of Danske Bank. MAX FRYDEN, ANALYST, DANSKE BANK MARKETS EQUITY RESEARCH: Just 2 questions from me. The -- follow-up on the sales contribution from new products. It's accelerated during the second half and in Q4, and now seems to have decelerated into Q1 2018. Is this sort of the contribution profile, if you can say so, from new products? Or should we expect this trend to turn here into the second quarter? OLA ROLLA(c)N: First of all, I need to make a correction because in an interview earlier today, I stated 2%, and we have since checked and it was actually 3%. And that is a sequential slowdown from Q4 where we said it was 5%. I think the cycle for Hexagon is very much connected to Hexagon LIVE. We run Hexagon LIVE in June. All divisions are targeting product launches at that conference. So then you get to cycle where you see some adoption in the third quarter, fourth quarter, and then it's trailing off in Q1, Q2 only to strengthen, again, in the third quarter. So that's our cycle typically. MAX FRYDEN: Perfect. Very clear, thanks. And just maybe on Manufacturing Intelligence organic growth, you have seen very strong growth in electronics and you're going to meet tougher comparables there, and you mentioned automotive CapEx slowing slightly here in the quarter. And then if we look at the historical growth rate in MI of 7% to 8% in the past 2 to 3 years, in comparison to that, what growth drivers should we take into account here in the near term in order to continue that very strong track record? OLA ROLLA(c)N: I think that in the near term, it's the same growth drivers as in Q4 and Q1. It's going to continue to be electronics for a while. It's going to be -- I think we're going to see a return to growth in aerospace. I expect automotive to look a bit better. And what we also saw in the quarter, which hasn't really happened since 2011, that is tier 3, tier 4 customers starting to invest heavily in our technology. OPERATOR: We will take our next question from Mohammed Moawalla of Goldman Sachs. MOHAMMED ESSAJI MOAWALLA, EQUITY ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: The only question from my end, Ola, you talk a lot about sort of penetrating with your solution set in a lot of the OEMs, but as you kind of increase your share of wallet in there, how do you think of the sort of supply chain opportunity within these OEMs? Is this a sort of further accelerator down the line? I don't know, is there a way to kind of size some of these opportunities within supply chains of sort of major OEMs? OLA ROLLA(c)N: It's very difficult to size it, but you're absolutely right. As you penetrate the Tier 1 players in an industry, there is going to be growing demand for Tier 2, Tier 3 and Tier 4 to standardize on the Tier 1 solutions. You've seen that in the software industry where you want to integrate into a large company's ERP system and have seamless deliveries, for example. It's similar in our industry. So think of a construction work site where you have a huge contractor that subcontracts a lot of work to small companies. These companies need to be connected to this information system. Otherwise, it's useless and pointless to invest in that system. So I do believe that over time, you will see an acceleration. We're definitely seeing it in the automotive field where we've been for the past 18 months -- sorry, 18 years. And I expect that to happen in other industries too as they digitalize their workflows. MOHAMMED ESSAJI MOAWALLA: Okay, and if I can sneak one more in. Can you kind of give us an update on sort of these Smart Solutions and sort of the revenue contribution from those also? I know Smart Cities has been a focus area. And how sort of the pipeline is evolving on those kind of product sets? OLA ROLLA(c)N: The pipeline is evolving. It's -- I think it's a stepwise process. I couldn't back out them right now sitting here but I can give you a number off-line later on. OPERATOR: We will take our next question from Gerardus Vos of Barclays. GERARDUS VOS, SENIOR ANALYST, BARCLAYS BANK PLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: First on the BLK 360, when do you expect that to launch in the rest of the world and outside North America and Europe? Should we expect some tick up in Geosystems because of that in the second half of the year? And then, secondly, could you remind me about the negative FX impacts you had on the quarter on the margin? OLA ROLLA(c)N: Okay. BLK 360, we are actually trying to fulfill the need in the market in North America and Europe as we speak. So it's going to be an H2 question when we open up in the rest of the world for deliveries. And when it comes to the margin, the impact on the margin. It was EUR [14] million on the top line. It was EUR 18 million EBIT -- negative adverse EBIT impact on EUR [16] million adverse sales. So it's a 30% incremental margin on the FX. GERARDUS VOS: Okay, so a EUR [16] million impact top line, EUR 18 million on the EBIT. OLA ROLLA(c)N: Yes, 1-8. OPERATOR: We will take our next question from Mattias Holmberg of DNB. MATTIAS HOLMBERG, ANALYST, DNB MARKETS, RESEARCH DIVISION: Ola, Mattias Holmberg from DNB here. I have a couple of questions on the BLK 360 as well. So you just mentioned here that you are trying to fulfill the need in North America and Europe. Am I reading into this too much by hearing that you're maybe struggling a bit with getting out the volumes that the market is requesting? And then another question on the BLK is that -- please correct me if I have misunderstood this, but I've heard that you only sell this online. So sort of stepping away a bit from your traditional route to market. Is there -- could you please just elaborate a bit on your thoughts of this new approach? OLA ROLLA(c)N: So it's absolutely true that we have -- it's a brand-new product. It's the first in its family of a new generation of products that Geosystems is designing and planning to launch. So we're going to see more BLK products in for future. But we're catching up. So I don't see this as a long-term problem to gear up and fulfill the needs in the market. It's true that we started launching it as an online product, and we've only sold it online. That was a collaboration with Autodesk where we had a package deal. You could buy Autodesk's BIM software as a package together with BLK 360. We are, however, going to sell it through more traditional channels as well as it's maturing. MATTIAS HOLMBERG: Great, that is very clear. And a final one from my side. Looking at the FX, we've seen the Swiss franc weaken quite significantly in value versus the euro, and I know you have quite some exposure at least to the Swiss franc. Could you please just remind us a bit about the dynamics here? And if you can expect some kind of offset versus the dollar and other currencies here in the coming quarters? OLA ROLLA(c)N: Yes, I mean, the negative effect is stemming from the renminbi and the U.S. dollar if you simplify life. And then there is a positive impact, not on top line but on bottom line, from the Swiss franc. So you're absolutely right. We -- it would've been even worse if the Swiss franc have stayed where it were, but it weakened in the quarter against the euro as well. MATTIAS HOLMBERG: Would you be willing to share any sort of significance of the Swiss franc in this quarter? How much it would've been without it? OLA ROLLA(c)N: We had a net effect of minus 18, and we had a positive effect of roughly EUR 5 million from the Swiss franc from the bottom line. OPERATOR: We will take our next question from Erik Golrang of SEB. ERIK GOLRANG, HEAD OF RESEARCH FOR SWEDEN, SEB, RESEARCH DIVISION: I have a few questions. The first one is returning to the margin strength in Geospatial. I think if I'm not wrong, it's the first time that we're seeing Geospatial higher than industrial in terms of operating margin. I don't think -- that most of us probably assume that, that won't be the case long term. But is that something that we would have to rethink perhaps? And then the second question. I had a bad line when you talked about the working capital impact on cash flow. If you could repeat that and also in relation to the increase we saw in prepaid expenses and include income quarter-on-quarter. And then finally, some thoughts on where the new product AgrOn in the agriculture space, how do you think about your position here now? Why it's better compared to when you try to penetrate this segment, perhaps, historically? OLA ROLLA(c)N: Well, I wouldn't bet that Geospatial would have a lower margin than Industrial. I think it's going to be neck-on-neck. And I think they're going to compete fiercely internally who has the better margin. I would definitely not rule out good margin expansion for Geospatial. When it comes to working capital, my comment was that typically, we have a working capital build up in the first half of the year, and then we have working capital release in the second half of the year. And '17 was an exceptionally good Q1 when it comes to working capital. What happened this time around was that it was accounts payables that shrunk in working capital, and thus, we tied up more working capital in the quarter. And then you had a question on AgrOn. And I would say that when we launched our precision agriculture product portfolio some 10 years ago, we were late in the game, and the OEMs had already started integrating precision agriculture functionality into the cab of the tractors. Since then, we've changed strategy and PI, Positioning Intelligence, is now delivering GNSS components to the OEMs to their factory lines. So it becomes an integrated factory option very much like the automotive industry when it comes to SatNavs. And what AgrOn is trying to do is to address the entire farm or plantation where you need to orchestrate and synchronize traffic in the fields, fertilizer, follow-up with satellite imagery and, well, follow through productivity on a farm level rather than on a tractor level. So that's the big difference. ERIK GOLRANG: Just a follow-up on the first one in Geospatial. Is SI and Geosystems both contributing equally to that margin improvement? Or is it more a Geosystems thing given the -- new product launches you have there? OLA ROLLA(c)N: I would say all 3 contribute, but of course, Geosystems is contributing the most. But then you shouldn't forget PI, which had a record quarter. OPERATOR: We will take our next question from Wasi Rizvi of RBC Capital Markets. WASI RIZVI, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: A couple from me. Firstly, on the FX impact on EBIT, you've given it at group level. Is it possible to get an idea of how that's split by division? And I guess, the commentary makes it clear that it maybe it's a bit more in [IES]. Some numbers would be helpful. Then also just to understand the dynamic of how that works, whether there's any kind of lag in terms of shared risk moving and the profit impact? OLA ROLLA(c)N: Yes, I mean, if you dissect it and we have a positive impact from the Swiss franc, which is almost to its entirety related to [Geospatial], you have a much more severe negative impact on [IES]. So that's absolutely true. But I don't have the numbers from top of my head. WASI RIZVI: Okay. And then the next one was on electronics. Have you got an idea of your customer concentration? I mean, what do the top 3 or 5 represent of your electronics sales and how does that compare to how it was maybe a few years ago? OLA ROLLA(c)N: A few years ago, it was very easy. We had one customer. And since then, we've penetrated several accounts and now we have maybe 6 to 10 top customers. WASI RIZVI: Great. And then just finally on autonomous vehicles. Can you give us an idea of kind of what's your total exposure to that through various bits and what kind of growth rates you're seeing? And then in the businesses you do have, what kind of market positions they have? And what relationship they have, whether it's with the OEMs or whether it's with kind of Tier 1 suppliers? OLA ROLLA(c)N: We have a good position in autonomous vehicles, and currently, we're engaged in the positioning side, so it's Positioning Intelligence, and it's strong double-digit growth. I would say that we're probably involved in all -- almost 100% of all platforms being developed right now. But more on that in Las Vegas. I have to save something for a rainy day, not that it rains in Las Vegas but... OPERATOR: We will take our next question from Alex Tout of Deutsche Bank. ALEXANDER WILLIAM TOUT, RESEARCH ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: Just a couple. So on the CapEx guidance, the tangible CapEx guidance, just why is it so much higher than we've been used to? It's about -- you're looking -- you're guiding at about 3x the rate of the last few years, and it seems to be driven just by two major site developments. If you can just give us a bit more color on why these are such expensive developments. And does CapEx then drop down back to those more normal levels from FY '19 or even slightly below those levels in compensation for the spend this year? And secondly, just on the growth outlook, I guess, how do you see the net of growing momentum in PP&M, Europe and Brazil, potential for better performances in auto and aerospace versus much tougher comps coming up in China and GES, generally, already having done very well for some time now? OLA ROLLA(c)N: Let's take the first one. The second question was a really long one, so that one we have to come back to and dissect a bit. But take the first one, with CapEx. Well, we're building a state-of-the-art facility in Calgary for 600 people, and that's roughly the cost to do that. Secondly, we're building a state-of-the-art campus in China, where we're going to regroup all our operations, our strategic operations in China, which is our second largest market. So unfortunately, that's the cost you have to pay. Why are we not leasing, like some companies do, simply because the IFRS rules have changed, and there's very little difference nowadays leasing or outright buying property. But this is just something we have to get used to. What's going to happen in '19? Well, it's going to be around EUR 25 million additional investments in Hongdao in '19 and another EUR 25 million in '20. In '21, we're moving our staff from the current facility to the new facility, and then we're going to have a positive impact on fixed assets simply by releasing the capital currently employed in that facility. So that's the profile of the outlay. Net-on-net, we were not sure if we're actually going to make or if it's going to be cost at the end of the day because the current facility is appreciating every year. And then your second question on outlook, and you mentioned many segments. Could you pose that question again? ALEXANDER WILLIAM TOUT: Yes, sure. I was just kind of totting up the puts and takes around growth, and it looks like growing momentum in PP&M, Europe, pretty strong, may be accelerating. Brazil seems like it's certainly accelerating versus the second half of last year and the potential for better performances in automotive and aerospace. And then you set that against what become much tougher comps in China from here and the GES part of the business that's been strong for a little while now. I'm just wondering what you make of that in terms of the growth outlook for the year. Can it accelerate from the first quarter over the coming quarters? Or does it look like the headwinds grow? OLA ROLLA(c)N: Well, we're going to see -- the one who lives will see. So if you call back on 31st of July, we will know. ALEXANDER WILLIAM TOUT: Any difference to that analysis of the headwinds and tailwinds that are coming up? Or is that more or less how you see it as well? OLA ROLLA(c)N: I think -- let me put it like this, and this is probably the politically correct answer, and then we have to explore this question a bit further up at the Capital Markets Day. But we're probably going to grow above our long-term target that we set about in 2016 of 5% organic growth between '16 and '21. This is going to be one of the years that -- where we're going to beat that number. That's my firm belief. And then we'll see by how much? OPERATOR: We will take our next question from Alexander Frankiewicz of Berenberg Capital Markets. ALEXANDER FRANKIEWICZ, ANALYST, BERENBERG CAPITAL MARKETS: I'll ask two quick questions. Firstly, just what was the contribution of new products in the quarter and where do you see this going additionally on BLK 360? What was the contribution from that in terms of the organic growth for Geosystems? And what would Geosystem have been ex BLK 360? And then, secondly, for AgrOn, just what were the -- who were the main competitors for AgrOn, and how do you see that developing? How do you see the competitive market for that? And how does Hexagon plan to take share from them going forward? OLA ROLLA(c)N: New product, we commented that before, it's 3% of the organic growth in the quarter, and we've also said the cycle is you release new products in connection to our user conference in June. We've seen upturn in Q3, and then acceleration in Q4, and then typically trails of Q1 and Q2, and then you'll start all over again. So that's a typical cycle for new products. Regarding AgrOn, we haven't seen a head-on competitor, but both Topcon and Trimble would be companies that are aspiring to the same position. And then, you actually have some fertilizer companies exploring if they can launch products in the agricultural area. ALEXANDER FRANKIEWICZ: Okay, thanks. And then just also on organic growth of Geosystems. Do you know what that would would've -- what BLK 360's contribution to that wasn't what it would've been ex BLK 360? OLA ROLLA(c)N: It's not just BLK 360 fueling growth. We launched a new GPS solution where you can tilt the pole. We've launched new Imagery Programs, and so there's a variety of new products contributing to the 11% growth. But I'm not going to single out one number. OPERATOR: We will take a follow-on question from Guillermo Peigneux of UBS. GUILLERMO PEIGNEUX: Ola, I wanted to know your opinion about agnostic metrology software and the combination of (inaudible) metrologic. Is it posing a threat for you at all maybe long term? I guess, what's the reason? What acquisition? Also you commented really on the multiples, but I wonder what your opinions are about the combination of those 2 businesses and at mostly software and metrology? OLA ROLLA(c)N: I can't comment on the combination, but I've heard this expression earlier today agnostic metrology software. And I didn't know what it was. But it's sad to say that over the 18 years we've been involved in the metrology industry, there has been a move towards open interfaces. So it's nothing new. We are selling our software on [size] machines and size is selling its software on our machines. And it's simply a retrofit package that you offer customers if they do want to change, but I think even more important is what you do with the data from these platforms. And what we worked hard in the industry is to standardize the data format so that the user can download the data from various platforms into one database. And that is really the important angle for the user. GUILLERMO PEIGNEUX: Okay. And can I maybe -- again, it's very early stages, but I think one of the key synergies they're talking about or the combination of, not the specific names you mentioned here, but the combination of potentially cutting tools technologies and metrology technologies is to do in-line measurement as opposed of off-line measurement. Is that something that could be a threat to Hexagon? Or is something that is completely different from the business you're in at the moment? OLA ROLLA(c)N: No, absolutely not. On the other hand, I think that we are the leaders in in-line measurement, and we are driving that change. You need -- if you want to participate in smart connected factories, you need to launch in-line measurements. And that's going to happen in all sorts of production facilities, anything from stamping presses, robot operations to CNC machines to end assembly line. And we've talked about it in our Capital Markets days where we say, quality drives productivity. And we're going to see a new way of using metrology data in the manufacturing chain, and it's quite exciting actually. OPERATOR: We will take our next question from Mikael LasA(c)en of Carnegie. MIKAEL LASA(c)EN: I have three questions, quick ones. First of all, can you help us with the acquisition-driven growth in Q2? I guess, it will be significantly lower. I mean, I'm just thinking about then they're already done deals? OLA ROLLA(c)N: Yes. If you've done the deals, it should be lower in Q2 absolutely. I mean, MSC is the big acquisition. So I think it was in Q2 of '17 for one month. MIKAEL LASA(c)EN: Yes, and you've done also other transactions that you have not announced, so that's why I'm asking. OLA ROLLA(c)N: Yes, we'll see. MIKAEL LASA(c)EN: Okay. And the second one is deferred income. Maybe also that's already explained the increase that you had in Q1, it was 48% of sales, and last year, it was 40% basically. What was the reason behind that? OLA ROLLA(c)N: I think it's the consolidation of MSC. MIKAEL LASA(c)EN: But it was also lower in Q4 when you had MSC software. OLA ROLLA(c)N: Yes, but then we've grown the deferred income, and that's typical. So we've -- the order growth has been stronger than the invoicing growth in the first quarter. I mean, what happens is you get paid, you book your deferred income, and then in subsequent quarters, you invoice. And if you have a very strong order growth, but maybe not delivery, if you can talk about delivery for software, then this happens. MIKAEL LASA(c)EN: Okay, so it's mainly organic and also mix effects or IFRS effects or things like that, that is disturbing that? OLA ROLLA(c)N: No, not that comes to mind sitting here. I would explain it with stronger order intake in the software business. MIKAEL LASA(c)EN: Okay, and good. The last one is regarding the MSC apex order that you got from the cost manufacturing. Didn't you have that already, that customer? So the net effect, what is that really? OLA ROLLA(c)N: The net effect is that MSC is growing by 10% organic growth in the quarter, which is slightly stronger than some competitors. MIKAEL LASA(c)EN: Okay. So they are expanding a share of wallet, really, with that order. OLA ROLLA(c)N: Yes. OPERATOR: As we have no further questions, I would like to turn the call back to the speakers for any additional or closing remarks. OLA ROLLA(c)N: And this was an exhausting Q&A session so I have no more further comments. And I thank you for listening in, and we can do this again on the 31st of July, if you so wish. Thank you, everyone. OPERATOR: Thank you. That will conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, ladies and gentlemen. You may now disconnect.

SATURDAY, MAY 12 No major events scheduled."}, {"title": "Digital divide: rural internet moves at snail's pace", "article": "Anyone who dares suggest country life moves at a slower pace would be laughed out of the room in most rural communities, especially at this time of year as the spring-planting frenzy kicks into high gear. But there's one sector of the rural economy and of rural living that few would deny moves at a snail's pace compared to cities: the internet. It's a reality few urbanites would comprehend. Tasks that take seconds to complete in high-speed zones can take hours, if they can be done at all. Grainews editor Leeann Minogue, who farms with her husband near Griffin in southeastern Saskatchewan, once started a routine update of their farm-accounting software and waited four days for it to finish. On the bright side, however, she never had to worry about their young son spending too much time playing games online. Their local service improved dramatically when a small provider put up a tower near enough for them to tap into better service -- for around $220 a month. The price is steep. But Minogue isn't complaining. Her download speeds are still far slower than city residents take for granted, but they are now \"fast enough\" and fast-enough internet access is an important, some say essential, service for rural Canada. \"What are we going to do? We really have no choice,\" Minogue says. \"As a farm business, as someone who works from home, everything is just better.\" That's the gist of a parliamentary report by the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology released earlier this month. While rural internet services are improving, many parts of rural Canada are still far behind in achieving even bare-minimum service, let alone catching up to the services available in densely populated areas. At the current rate of improvement, it could take 10 to 15 years, and this report says that's holding the whole economy back. \"The digital divide harms all Canadians by preventing a share of the population to benefit from the same opportunities and services, and thus to fully participate in the economy,\" concludes the report, Broadband Connectivity in Rural Canada: Overcoming the Digital Divide. The federal government is counting on agriculture to lead this country's export growth, and the sector is becoming increasingly reliant on Big Data and precision-farming tools. But those systems require high-speed access to a network for storage and analysis, and availability of that is hit and miss. This report comes on the heels of another, released in 2016 by the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC). That one declared broadband access an essential service and said rural areas should have access to at least 50-megabyte download speeds and 10-mb uploads. It found 18 per cent of Canadians still don't have access to that level of service, a number that seems suspiciously low considering there often is a big difference between what service providers say they are providing and the actual service people routinely receive from day to day. No one underestimates the magnitude of the task. Delivering broadband access, no matter what mechanism is employed, is expensive in remote and sparely populated regions. It's exceedingly hard to recoup a return on investment. The connectivity report makes several recommendations, including one that says rules governing service providers must become a lot more flexible so that smaller operators, co-ops and public-private partnerships cannot only enter the game, but become eligible for some of the designated government funding. For example, the city of Olds, Alta., took matters into its own hands in 2013 and set up a non-profit to implement the first community-owned, open fibre-utility infrastructure network in Canada. But it has never qualified for federal support. In Manitoba, the communities of Morden and Winkler also are investing in their own high-speed services, betting their ROI will be in the form of continued economic growth. There are several public/private partnerships boosting services in Ontario and the Northwest Territories. The research is done. The reports are in. Now we wait. Rural Canadians can only hope the federal government moves faster than a spinning icon. Laura Rance is editorial director for Glacier FarmMedia.

The Foremost Test Range is a permanent Restricted Airspace area for flying Unmanned Aircraft Systems, located in Southeast Alberta. The airspace is particularly attractive for companies that wish to conduct beyond visual line-of-sight (BVLOS) test flights. The test range provides 700 square nautical miles (2400 square kilometres) of airspace designated for drone operations up to 18,000 feet above sea level. Safe BVLOS unmanned flight operations require the very best in equipment and technology, said Doug Hanna, Foremost UAS Range Manager. The Kongsberg Geospatial display application combined with the real-time ADS-B and Remote ID monitoring capability from uAvionix provides an extremely cost effective solution to deliver airspace situational awareness and significantly improve safety. The Kongsberg Geospatial IRIS display technology enables multiple drones to be monitored simultaneously by a single operator and provides real-time calculation of aircraft separation and communications line-of-sight to enable BVLOS operations. IRIS will provide the range with real-time 2D and 3D visualization of airborne track and weather data, as well as geo-fencing capabilities. The integration of the uAvionix ADS-B and Remote ID positioning capability provides an extremely accurate depiction of BVLOS aircraft. Were pleased to be working with a client like the Foremost UAS Test Range said Ranald McGillis, President of Kongsberg Geospatial. This is one of only two Transport Canada certified test ranges in Canada that is applying imagination and engineering expertise to develop a testing range for new UAS solutions to tackle long-range flight problems like pipeline inspection and precision agriculture. At Kongsberg Geospatial, weve developed world class technology for sensor integration and airspace awareness for these missions."}, {"title": "EUO Eurocontrol loses $5.42-million in 2017", "article": "Eurocontrol Technics Group Inc (TSX-V:EUO) Shares Issued 90,750,238 Last Close 4/24/2018 $0.075 Tuesday April 24 2018 - News Release Mr. Paul Wood reports EUROCONTROL REPORTS YEAR END 2017 RESULTS Eurocontrol Technics Group Inc. has filed its audited financial statements and management's discussion and analysis for the year ended Dec. 31, 2017.

These technology hubs, based in Scottsdale, Ariz., and Brisbane, Australia, will accelerate innovation in developing low-cost, simple-to-use precision agriculture solutions for all farmers. \"By creating these centres of excellence, we are further advancing our ability to innovate rapidly to better serve our customers,\" said Dave Vaughn, AgJunction president and chief executive officer. \"Our customers are facing tough economic challenges today, and our job is to make auto-steering accessible to the millions of small farms who can't afford it, so they can begin to prosper from the benefits of precision agriculture.\" In today's environment, small farmers are facing the choice to either expand their farm or die. AgJunction believes there is a third choice: get more out of the land they already own with affordable precision ag solutions, which is the foundation of the company's hands-free farm revolution. Hands-free farming, the ability to precisely auto-steer a tractor, is proved to increase yield and decrease input costs regardless of the size of the farm. According to a USDA study, auto-steering can save a farmer an average of $15 per acre regardless of the size of the farm. Current precision ag solutions in the market are out of reach for most small farms, because of high costs and complexity. By creating solutions that are low cost, simple to buy and easy to use, AgJunction is bringing the technology to small farms that has been unattainable to date. \"Farming is a legacy to be cherished and passed on to the next generation. AgJunction is committed to levelling the playing field with precision ag technologies, so all farmers -- even those with smaller farms or older equipment -- can prosper,\" said Mr. Vaughn.

To launch the on-line store, AgJunction introduced Ranger, precision farming made simple with an easy-to-install-and-use guidance system for under $1,000. \"The launch of our Hands-Free Farm on-line store is an exciting milestone for AgJunction as we continue to expand our vision to bring hands-free farming to every farmer,\" said Dave Vaughn, AgJunction's president and chief executive officer. \"Critical to our vision is the need to change both the method of getting product to the farmer and the level of complexity in installation and use of precision [agriculture] equipment.\" With the introduction of Hands-Free Farm, a new on-line buying experience has been created to sell direct to all American farmers. Customers will find the easy-to-use products, affordable prices, simple purchasing and always-accessible support that they desire, but have never had, for precision agriculture solutions. Hands-free farming represents the precision guidance, positioning, autosteering and machine control that are the foundation of any precision agriculture solution. Until now, products for hands-free farming have been sold almost universally through dealers that are best suited to support the expensive purchasing decisions, complex installation and extensive training required for the current offerings in the market. The cost, complexity and cumbersome purchasing process limits the reach of hands-free farming to only the largest farms despite evidence that every farmer can benefit. \"We are committed to bringing the benefits of precision [agriculture] to all farmers,\" Mr. Vaughn continued. \"The Hands-Free Farm store is a key step in providing all farmers easy-to-use, low-cost solutions they can easily purchase and install themselves without having to leave the farm.\" Ranger, an easy-to-use, complete GPS (global positioning system) guidance solution priced at only $995, is the first product in the Hands-Free Farm on-line store. Ranger is ready to use right out of the box, with everything included, installs in minutes and is so simple to use that customers can start farming with precision right away. The intuitive, patented steering guide shows visual cues in advance affording farmers the time to focus on farming instead of staring at a map. The system provides the essential accuracy for spraying, spreading, tilling and planting crops like soybeans and supports both straight-line and free-form contours useful for terraces and irregular fields. Ranger provides farmers the flexibility to leave the field and return precisely where they left off and gives the option to share GPS location data with implements and yield monitors.

diversity: Study", "article": "2018 APR 9 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Global Warming Focus -- Climate change and other environmental factors are more threatening to fish diversity than predators, according to new research from the University of Guelph. It is a surprising and important finding, as humans rely upon freshwater lakes for more than one-fifth of their protein needs worldwide, says lead author Prof. Andrew MacDougall in U of G's Department of Integrative Biology. \"Freshwater is a huge source of food for people, including Ontario's Great Lakes,\" he said. Lakes, rivers and streams cover less than one per cent of Earth's surface but provide 12 per cent of human fish consumption, MacDougall said. The findings, published this month in the journal Nature Communications, may offer ideas for resource managers to better protect all-important species diversity in lakes around the world, MacDougall said. His international research team included U of G biologist Prof. Kevin McCann and scientists in Canada, Switzerland, Sweden, Australia, the United States and Japan. The research team modelled prey-predator interactions and environmental factors, such as lake size, temperature and water quality. The scientists used information compiled earlier by the Ontario government on more than 700 lakes in the Great Lakes watershed. The team found that species diversity depends more on \"bottom-up\" environmental factors than on \"top-down\" interactions, or which fish species eats what - a result that surprised MacDougall. He said food chain interactions among organisms are still important. \"All lakes have big predators, and predators always kill lots of fish that they consume,\" said MacDougall. \"But the strength and degree of the interactions seems to depend fully on environment. The interactions are never independent of lake conditions.\" He said resource managers need to pay attention to physical conditions, including lake warming caused by climate change and water quality impacts of human activities such as farming. The authors say the paper's findings set a baseline for species diversity in southern Ontario lakes. That will help resource managers monitor or predict those effects as well as the impacts of other changes such as introduction of invasive species. Many freshwater fish species in Canada and abroad are already endangered by human-caused environmental changes, said McCann. \"There's a looming threat of loss of species.\" He said the study shows how so-called big data can help detect patterns in complicated ecosystems and how precision agriculture - including more targeted use of crop fertilizers -- may lessen pollutants entering lakes and streams. Big data and precision agriculture are key aspects of the University's Food from Thought project, which aims to help find sustainable ways to feed Earth's growing human population. McCann co-leads that project, launched in 2016. U of G researchers in the new study were supported by funding from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council and from the Canada First Excellence Research Fund for the Food from Thought project.

The program will begin on April 1st of this year. Provinces as well as territories are eligible to apply for this federal funding and are encouraged to cooperate with industry on projects focusing on precision agriculture and bioproducts. Precision agriculture Precision agriculture (PA), sometimes called satellite farming, or site specific crop management (SSCM), manages crop production by observing, measuring, and responding to inter-field and intra-field variability of crops. The goal of precision agriculture is to create a decision support system of management for the entire farm that will optimize returns on inputs while preserving resources. New satellite technology is crucial to much of precision agriculture although surveillance drones are also of use. Wikipedia describes the technology: \"The practice of precision agriculture has been enabled by the advent of GPS and GNSS... This data is used in conjunction with satellite imagery by variable rate technology (VRT) including seeders, sprayers, etc. to optimally distribute resources.\" The use of some of these technologies by a Saskatchewan farmer was reported in a Digital Journal article last year. The Western Producer newspaper also has an article on precision agriculture on the Canadian prairies. Government statements on funding cleantech Lawrence MacAulay, Minister of Agriculture ad Agri-Food said: This investment will help Canadian farmers stay on the cutting edge of clean technology by targeting developments in bioproducts and precision agriculture. Our government has made both agriculture and clean technology a priority for growth in our economy. This new program will contribute to Canadas place as a world leader in agricultural clean technology, helping farmers to develop new and efficient uses of energy, while also protecting our environmental resources and mitigating climate change. The government also notes that a further $155 million will also be provided by Natural Resources Canada for research, development, and demonstration projects of clean technology. In the 2017 budget the government announced a number of clean technology programs and initiatives. $130 million was directed to cleantech research and development. $400 million over 5 years funds the Sustainable Development Fund that focuses on cleantech projects. Finally, $14.5 million over four years is used to develop Clean Technology Data Strategy."}, {"title": "Canadian producers eye big plant-protein play", "article": "The competition is over. The winners are declared. But unlike the Olympics, after which the athletes can go home and bask in the glory, the victors of the federal government's \"supercluster\" competition are faced with a rather stark reality. Now, the real work begins. Protein Industries Canada (PIC), a highly diverse cluster of organizations that coalesced around the notion of making Canada a global leader in plant-based ingredients, was among the five winners announced earlier this month in the hotly contested federal competition for innovation funds. It was awarded $153 million out of the supercluster pool of money, but its leaders predict that when all the in-kind contributions and other government program contributions are tallied, the total investment in western Canadian economic diversification could top $800 million. The real prize is tapping into a global market opportunity for plant-based protein that's worth an estimated $13 billion and the potential for increasing Canada's agri-food exports by upwards of $30 billion. You could argue that this is the western Canadian agricultural economy's coming of age, finally, after more than a century of policies that favoured the export of raw commodities and more than two decades after those policies -- namely grain export subsidies -- were ended. But the future is unfolding far differently than the pundits imagined. Back in the 1990s, no one predicted farmers would shift production away from cereals that were no longer economical to export. No one anticipated the trade, currency, and disease issues that would plague the meat sector. Nor did they predict that Canada would become the world's leading supplier in a surging global market for plant proteins. Plant-based proteins are now expected to make up one-third of the global protein market by the midpoint of this century, according to a Canada West Foundation report released late last year. Consumption is expected to double between now and 2023. The growing middle class in developing countries is eating more meat; consumers in industrialized countries are eating more plant proteins. Fractionating or separating the protein from co-products closer to home means more accessible markets for farmers and more high-tech jobs for workers. So the opportunity is there, it's real, and Canada is well positioned to take full advantage. But will it? As coalitions go, Protein Industries Canada is unique. It has pulled more than 110 companies, commodity groups and research organizations into a value-chain approach. It promises to further the interests of farmers through better germplasm and precision-agriculture technologies, invest in sorely needed food-processing innovations and develop new markets. Processing is the missing link; the region historically has exported raw grains. \"It will allow us to develop new processes for fractionating seed and taking the high value out and developing new markets,\" said Frank Hart, chair of the PIC board of directors in an interview on the Between the Rows podcast. \"Although you can pull 20 per cent of the seed out as protein in a pulse crop for example, what do you do with the other 80 per cent? \"You have to find the value in industrial products, cosmetics, animal feed other uses for the starches. That will make the whole processing cycle a lot more viable and profitable, which means that processing companies will be attracted to locate in the region.\" It all makes perfect sense, except for the historic truths of this region. Let's face it. we're talking about a region in which governments get into tit-for-tat spats over licence plates from the neighbouring province parked at construction job sites. The Canadian West Foundation report didn't tiptoe around the issue, noting that Canadian provinces \"do not always have the best record on co-operation. Interprovincial trade disputes abound and there is often a sense of 'me too' in terms of federal funding,\" it says. \"Provinces can choose to compete against each other or they can collaborate and compete against the rest of the world,\" the report said. Hart cites \"catalytic forces\" behind the PIC's pan-Prairie approach. \"It's attracting people with a strong incentive to collaborate even though they are competitors -- because it will benefit the whole industry.\" Their mission now: keep everyone's eyes on the prize.

Skip the Dishes was on its way to becoming Winnipeg's first unicorn, but it was acquired by the U.K.-based public company Just Eat, so it might not technically qualify for the label. Farmers Edge, the precision agriculture company that has raised much more than $100 million from venture capital investors and has customers around the world paying for its data-based precision agricultural services, is probably getting close to that mark. In a discussion about the changing shape of governance for knowledge-based companies at a get-together of the Institute of Corporate Directors on Wednesday, Josh Simair and Wade Barnes, the respective founders of those two companies, had some biting commentary to share about the challenges they faced growing their companies in Winnipeg and the realities the province is facing in the increasingly digital economy. Both of them would be considered fabulously successful by most accounts and many might think they ought not to have a care in the world. But the two founders and CEOs (Simair recently resigned from Skip the Dishes) -- who are both born-and-bred Prairie boys -- want to see the landscape change so that others might have an easier go of it growing digital-era companies in a region that may be more wedded than most to traditional industry. It may very well be the case that those two companies are the outliers and that enterprises of their size may not emerge out of Winnipeg again for another generation, but both were unimpressed enough with their own accomplishments to imagine how it might be easier for others to do it the next time. They both believe they face significant challenges ahead for their companies to continue to grow and both rang alarm bells about the kind of structural changes the province ought to be considering. \"We need to stop thinking there is economic value in new factories,\" Barnes said. \"That is not where the world is going. It is going digital. The world is changing. You are going to see a lot of really big companies get hit with a sledgehammer. Big-name companies so mighty and powerful. They are going to get a big shakeup.\" Barnes, the CEO and founder of Farmers Edge, pointed out that with 1,400 employees and growing, Skip the Dishes now employs just about as many as the largest private-sector employers in the city -- New Flyer Industries and Boeing Canada, which are both at around 1,500. But their ability to keep growing is tied at least in part to their ability to continue to fill the positions that need filling. Simair said Skip the Dishes officials recently returned from Sao Paulo, Brazil, where they made job offers to 93 system developers. \"Between Farmers Edge and Skip, we are hiring more developers than the entire province is graduating,\" Simair said. His big thing is how hard it is to get immigration permits for skilled workers to be able to come and work here. They both urge government to make that process easier using the simple logic that there are jobs available here, no local candidates that qualify and future wealth generation for the province is at stake. Those two companies eventually became as successful as any Manitoba company in recent history in accessing enough investment capital to grow their companies to the size they are at now. But both of them also ran into extreme culture clashes with their Silicon Valley investors (who do not believe there could possibly be anyone smart enough in the Prairies to run the companies they started). Simair said he ran up $70,000 in credit-card debt as he boot-strapped his company into existence in the early years. That kind of self-reliance and economic reality was a stark contrast to the way the Silicon Valley venture capitalists throw around money. Barnes's experience starting up Farmers Edge was also one where he had a team of dedicated partners who understood when they had to miss a paycheque every now and then. Their subsequent venture capital partners were not nearly as understanding. Both of them said investors and board members were needed who understood the world of technology and also the particular cultural realities of Prairie companies. The fact that there is virtually no way for companies such as theirs to access capital locally to achieve the kind of success they've achieved speaks once more to the need for more flexible and reliable pools of capital based in the region. martin.cash@freepress.mb.ca"}, {"title": "The Canadian Press News Agenda for Thursday, March 22", "article": "EDITORS: Following is a list of news events for March 22 as of 9:30 p.m. ET: x-denotes wire, y-denotes picture, z-denotes graphics coverage.
