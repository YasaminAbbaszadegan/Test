With support for the VSi electric steering interface, improved contour functionality, and additional vehicle kit support, eDriveX v2.1 provides an accurate and affordable steering platform for precision farming applications. For eDriveX users needing long-range functionality, Hemisphere GPS has also released 400-megahertz radio repeater kits that extend the range of the company's RTK systems. VSi support brings high-performance steering to the simplicity of an electric steering wheel solution and allows eDriveX to be installed on vehicle platforms not previously targeted with hydraulic kits. VSi is a quick and easy performance solution when using eDriveX on a second tractor or other farm machinery. eDriveX contour improvements include Identical A/B Contour, an additional guidance mode that allows for curve following where skipping passes and repeatability is required, and Adaptive A/B Contour, which allows on-the-fly modification of an identical A/B contour to account for obstacles or changes in terrain. The new pre-engage function allows the operator to engage the steering system early so that once the machine is driven back within certain parameters, auto-steering takes over without the need for user input. This provides the opportunity to focus on other machine operations and even allows the operator to engage auto-steering while the vehicle is stationary. Additionally, Hemisphere GPS is releasing to specific markets its preplanned guidance functionality that allows growers to survey fields and create guidance paths using a GIS tool and export the lines in a shape file for use by S3A and eDriveX for auto-steering contact Outback Guidance sales or customer service for more information on this exciting new feature. Hemisphere GPS has released new, vehicle-specific installation kits to support eDriveX VSi functionality.

All currency amounts are expressed in United States dollars. For the quarter ended March 31, 2012, Hemisphere GPS reported revenues of $22.6-million, a 7-per-cent increase from revenues of $21.2-million reported for the first quarter of 2011. Revenue from the company's agriculture business increased 9 per cent for the quarter, while revenue from its precision products business was lower by 3 per cent. \"North American sales from the company's largest sales regions -- Canada and the United States -- were up by 31 per cent and 12 per cent, respectively, year over year, or 16 per cent combined,\" stated Steven Koles, president and chief executive officer of Hemisphere GPS. \"Strong North American markets are important to our overall sales due to their relative weighting to our overall revenues. North American results were indeed quite strong early in the first quarter, but mitigated in March as warm weather resulted in early planting activity, particularly in the U.S. corn belt.\" Agriculture sales growth was supported by the company's new Satloc G4 air-based product and its flagship Outback Guidance products. Revenue from the recent AgJunction acquisition contributed modestly to revenue growth in the quarter. Because the related software licensing revenues are initially recorded as deferred revenue and are amortized into revenue over the software licence period, the impact on revenue will increase over time and accelerate in the last half of the year. Agriculture segment revenues contributed 84 per cent of total first quarter revenues. In the precision product business, growth from sales of the company's new S320 survey product in the quarter was offset by declines in sales in European markets. The growth in Hemisphere GPS's largest markets during the first quarter was offset by sales outside North America.  International revenues were down by 12 per cent compared with the first quarter of 2011. Continued uncertain economic circumstances in Europe, weather in certain parts of South America and a strong quarter for international sales in 2011 contributed to this year-over-year decline. Gross margin for the first quarter was 47.5 per cent compared with 48.2 per cent in the first quarter of 2011, with the year-over-year difference related to changes in the value of the Canadian dollar. Total operating expenses increased by $800,000 from the first quarter of 2011, with the acquisition of AgJunction contributing approximately $600,000 of the increase. Excluding the impact of AgJunction, the increase in operating expenses was $200,000, or 2 per cent, in line with management's profitability objectives. Research and development expenses increased to $3.3-million from $2.8-million in the first quarter of 2011, an increase of 14 per cent, and sales and marketing expenses increased by $400,000, or 12 per cent, to $4.0-million for the reporting quarter. The acquisition of AgJunction contributed to the increases in each of these categories. Hemisphere GPS earned net profit of $1.4-million, or two cents per share (basic and diluted), in the first quarter of 2012 compared with net profit of $1.8-million, or three cents per share (basic and diluted), in the first quarter of 2011. At March 31, 2012, the company held cash of $6.9-million, or 10 cents per share, compared with $6.7-million at Dec. 31, 2011. Working capital was approximately $28-million, and the company had 66,280,777 common shares outstanding. During the first quarter Hemisphere GPS entered the emerging data services market in precision agriculture with the acquisition of AgJunction, a provider of a cloud-based data management software platform and wireless hardware to precision agriculture retailers and growers. With this acquisition Hemisphere GPS brings real-time decision-making information into the farmer's cab, enabling lower use of pesticides, fertilizer and fuel, while generating higher crop yield, resulting in more profitable farming operations. AgJunction provides attractive growth prospects for Hemisphere GPS. New features and partners are being added, along with additional retail sales locations. Today, AgJunction's client acres under management is 18 million and growing. On Jan. 31, 2012, Hemisphere GPS purchased the AgJunction assets and operations for consideration at closing of $2.0-million in cash and 5,447,410 common shares. As additional purchase consideration, Hemisphere GPS will pay earn-out payments to a maximum of $500,000 cash and 2,723,705 common shares upon the achievement of revenue growth targets for each of the 2012 and 2013 fiscal years. The company has signed a term sheet with Export Development Canada to finance $1.5-million of the purchase price, and to finance the earn-out payments of $500,000 that may be payable in February of 2013 and 2014 if the revenue targets are achieved. It is expected that this loan will close during the second quarter. First quarter product releases - Hemisphere GPS released Satloc G4 -- the most comprehensive and advanced aircraft guidance system for aerial applicators. Satloc G4 delivers Web-based connectivity along with a high level of guidance performance through an intuitive light bar and graphical display. This new product enables aerial application companies and their pilots to leverage Web-based services in order to make their jobs more efficient and bring a higher quality of service to their customers. Satloc G4's connectivity feature offers pilots the ability to transfer application data wirelessly, accept work orders and maps through the Internet, access the guidance system from remote locations such as the office, truck or mobile device, and directly communicate through Skype audio and video. - Hemisphere introduced the Eclipse P300 and Eclipse P301 OEM modules -- the next-generation high-performance compact modules ideal for developing integrated high-precision and control applications for geomatics, survey, machine control and unmanned vehicle solutions. Based on new Hemisphere GPS multifunction application firmware and Eclipse GNSS multiconstellation technology, improved GNSS positioning performance is achieved, particularly with RTK applications, through Hemisphere GPS's patent-pending SureTrack technology. - Many of the same technologies were integrated into the company's new Vector H320 OEM module for precise positioning and heading data for marine navigation applications. The Vector H320 is also ideally suited to augment hydrographic, bathymetric and side-scan survey packages as well as other machine control applications where centimetre-level precise positioning and heading are required for superior data representation. - Hemisphere GPS also released the Vector V103 GPS compass and Vector V113 GPS compass designed for professional, commercial marine and machine control applications. The all-new rugged enclosure gives these Vector models the advantage of working reliably in such harsh environments as side-scan survey, multibeam and single-beam surveys, dredging, general navigation, and machine control applications -- including agriculture, heavy construction, mining, cranes, seismic drills and auger rigs where accurate heading and positioning are essential. They are also ideal for harbour pilots and tugboat operators. - Subsequent to the end of the first quarter, Hemisphere GPS and Stara announced their expanded OEM partnership as part of Stara's new SpeedDrive X system at the AgriShow Rabeirao Pretoin, Sao Paulo state, Brazil. SpeedDrive X will be factory installed as standard equipment on various models of Stara tractors, sprayers and spreaders. The new SpeedDrive X combines a customized Hemisphere GPS eDriveX automated steering system and A320 GNSS smart antenna and Stara Topper 4500 terminal providing total user management for precision agriculture.

Hemisphere GPS earned net profit of $1.4 million, or $0.02 per share (basic and diluted) in the first quarter of 2012 compared to net profit of $1.8 million, or $0.03 per share (basic and diluted) in the first quarter of 2011. At March 31, 2012, the Company held cash of $6.9 million, or $0.10 per share, compared to $6.7 million at December 31, 2011. Working capital was approximately $28 million, and the Company had 66,280,777 common shares outstanding. During the first quarter Hemisphere GPS entered the emerging data services market in precision agriculture with the acquisition of AgJunction, a provider of a cloud-based data management software platform and wireless hardware to precision agriculture retailers and growers. With this acquisition Hemisphere GPS brings real-time decision-making information into the farmer's cab, enabling lower use of pesticides, fertilizer and fuel, while generating higher crop yield, resulting in more profitable farming operations. AgJunction provides attractive growth prospects for Hemisphere GPS. New features and partners are being added, along with additional retail sales locations. Today, AgJunction's client acres under management is 18 million and growing. On January 31, 2012, Hemisphere GPS purchased the AgJunction assets and operations for consideration at closing of US$2.0 million in cash and 5,447,410 common shares. As additional purchase consideration, Hemisphere GPS will pay earn-out payments to a maximum of US$0.5M cash and 2,723,705 common shares upon the achievement of revenue growth targets for each of the 2012 and 2013 fiscal years. The Company has signed a term sheet with Export Development Canada to finance $1.5 million of the purchase price, and to fund the earnout payments of $0.5 million that may be payable in February of 2013 and 2014 if the revenue targets are achieved. It is expected that this loan will close during the second quarter. Q1 Product Releases * Hemisphere GPS released Satloc G4 - the most comprehensive and advanced aircraft guidance system for aerial applicators. Satloc G4 delivers Web-based connectivity along with a high level of guidance performance through an intuitive lightbar and graphical display. This new product enables aerial application companies and their pilots to leverage Web-based services in order to make their jobs more efficient and bring a higher quality of service to their customers. Satloc G4's connectivity feature offers pilots the ability to transfer application data wirelessly, accept work orders and maps through the Internet, access the guidance system from remote locations such as the office, truck or mobile device, and directly communicate through Skype audio and video. * Hemisphere introduced the Eclipse P300 and Eclipse P301 OEM modules -- the next-generation high performance compact modules ideal for developing integrated high-precision and control applications for geomatics, survey, machine control and unmanned vehicle solutions. Based on new Hemisphere GPS multifunction application firmware and Eclipse GNSS multi-constellation technology, improved GNSS positioning performance is achieved, particularly with RTK applications, through Hemisphere GPS's patent-pending SureTrack technology. Many of the same technologies were integrated into the Company's new Vector H320 OEM module for precise positioning and heading data for marine navigation applications. The Vector H320 is also ideally suited to augment hydrographic, bathymetric and side scan survey packages as well as other machine control applications where centimetre-level precise positioning and heading are required for superior data representation. * Hemisphere GPS also released the Vector V103 GPS compass and Vector V113 GPS compass designed for professional, commercial marine and machine control applications. The all-new rugged enclosure gives these Vector models the advantage of working reliably in such harsh environments as side-scan survey, multi-beam and single-beam surveys, dredging, general navigation and machine control applications - including agriculture, heavy construction, mining, cranes, seismic drills and auger rigs where accurate heading and positioning are essential. They are also ideal for harbour pilots and tugboat operators. * Subsequent to the end of the first quarter, Hemisphere GPS and Stara announced their expanded OEM partnership as part of Stara's new SpeedDrive X system at the AgriShow Rabeirao Pretoin Sao Paulo State, Brazil. SpeedDrive X will be factory installed as standard equipment on various models of Stara tractors, sprayers, and spreaders. The new SpeedDrive X combines a customized Hemisphere GPS eDriveX automated steering system and A320 GNSS smart antenna and Stara Topper 4500 terminal providing total user management for precision agriculture.

Those developments will be in focus during National Soil Conservation Week, April 15 to 21. \"Farmers are very aware of sustainable soil management today,\" says Glen Shaw, executive director of the Soils Conservation Council of Canada (SCCC). \"Soil management techniques such as reduced tillage farming systems have revolutionized cropping systems. \"Rather than tilling fields, crops are planted through the soil-protecting residue cover of the previous crop. \"That residue cover prevents erosion and improves soil health.\" Another growth area is precision agriculture where producers use new technology such as GPS units linked with new generation application capability to precisely apply exact amounts of agricultural inputs and manage their land in the most sustainable way. \"Soil conservation is so much more than erosion control today,\" says Shaw. \"Food producers see their farms as part of broad food production systems directly linked with issues such as greenhouse gas emissions, carbon sequestration, water quality, air quality and biodiversity.\" One sign of the global emergence of a new generation of farming is the Sixth World Congress on Conservation Agriculture which SCCC, in partnership with the Conservation Agriculture Systems Alliance (CASA), is bringing to Winnipeg in 2014, says Don McCabe, SCCC president. \"That conference will showcase Canadian farm developments such as no-till farming systems to the world,\" says McCabe. \"The Beneficial Management Practices employed in conservation agriculture are the backbone of sustainability. \"The need in the future will be to ensure farmers get recognized by the marketplace for their efforts.\" A new opportunity for farmers is the emerging bioeconomy, he says. Ethanol and biodiesel production are well known, but the feedstock for the next wave of fuels, chemicals and composites will come from farmers' fields in the form of crop residues. This is a huge market opportunity but it must be done properly with soil conservation principles established to ensure long-term soil health. \"National Soil Conservation Week is an annual effort to put the spotlight on the continuing success in soil management and at the same time to keep soils in the eye of both farmers and the public,\" says McCabe. \"There is continued work to be done to better understand soil quality and management systems and our goal is continual improvement.\" SCCC is a charter supporter of National Soil Conservation Week, says Glen Shaw. The past several years the organization has acknowledged this by recognizing \"soil champions,\" producers from across Canada who represent the successes of the soil conservation movement. \"We salute their efforts and as we do so, we remind farmers and ranchers and the general public of what well managed soil means to everyone,\" says Shaw. The face and voice of soil conservation in Canada, SCCC is a national, nongovernmental, independent organization, formed in 1987 to provide a non-partisan public forum at the national level for soil conservation."}, {"title": "Spring time means decision time", "article": "Spring is in the air and signs are everywhere. Time to make the major decisions related to crop inputs. How much fertilizer to apply, availability of seed, seeding rate and pest control programs are all being considered. One of the biggest costs of seeding is fertilizer. Despite low natural gas prices, fertilizer prices are staying up there. With such a major investment in fertilizer, it pays to carefully consider the amount and placement of this crop input. Fertilizer is either the number one or two biggest cost of putting in a crop. To make an informed decision on fertilizer requires good information, usually in the form of a soil test. Soil testing can take one of several options. It used to be that the test was a compilation of samples from all over the field, giving a good, average rating for the entire field. Benchmarking is another approach where an identified area is tested year after year and the changes to that one site are indicative of the whole field. With the increased use of precision farming, there is now a third type of testing, much more in-depth. Using multiple samples, yield maps and GPS, maps are being generated linking productivity to different zones in the field. Regardless of your soil test, the information is important in reflecting nutrient availability for the years' crop. A major part of the nutrients incorporated into the crop is from the soil organic matter. Throughout the growing season, the soil organic matter will be breaking down and providing nutrients for crop growth. The higher the organic matter in the soil, the more nutrients it can provide for the crop. If you think of it as a nutrient bank account, then high organic matter in the soil gives you a cushion for your growing crop. In years where the crop may be under-fertilized, organic matter can provide some of the extra nutrients needed if growing conditions improve. Like a bank account, however, you can't keep taking out without putting back in. Deposits can take the form of a green manure crop, applying more fertilizer, growing a pulse crop or putting the land into permanent forage with legumes. The highest organic matter level in our soil are currently found in the black soil zone. As a rule of thumb, black soils contain about 4 -6% organic matter, dark brown soils, 3 -4% and brown and dark grey wooded soils 2 -3%. Grey wooded soils can be as low as 1 -2%. Zero tillage and the retention of crop residues on the soil surface have helped to increase some organic matter levels. Organic matter functions not only as a nutrient bank account, it also improves soil structure and soil tilth. It improves moisture penetration and retention in the soil. Low organic matter soils often have problems with puddling and crusting of the soil surface, creating emergence problems. Improved moisture holding capability in the soil, helps growing crops withstand dry conditions. Its value cannot be underestimated. Soils with very high organic matter content also can have problems. Usually, they are low in some trace minerals, especially copper and are often very acid. As a rough rule of thumb, you get about a pound of nitrogen for every .1% organic matter in the soil, depending on moisture conditions. Too dry and the soil organisms cannot breakdown as much organic matter. Too wet and you get denitrification. Denitrification occurs when soils are drowned in the spring for extended periods. Nitrogen, either fall fertilized or from the soil, will convert from nitrate, the plant absorbable nutrient, into N2, nitrogen gas which is then lost to the atmosphere. With all this information, what does it mean to the producer? Due to the cost and importance of fertilizer in the ultimate crop yield, it pays to spend some time fine tuning your fertilizer program. A useful tool to help producers with this is the AFFIRM program. It is free for download off of Alberta Agriculture's web-site. This program takes the past year's yields, current soil test results, expected moisture conditions, the intended crop type and comes up with some recommended fertilizer rates. It can be used to calculate return per dollar invested and also generates producer probability curves for various cropping alternatives. It also will take into account the use of crop insurance to reduce risk. When making fertilizer plans for 2012, it only makes sense to use every tool available to maximize the return on your crop input investments. AFFIRM is only one tool that can help."}, {"title": "Step out of college and into a job", "article": "Students pursing an Associate Diploma in Agriculture at the Ridgetown Campus of the University of Guelph have one thing in common. If they graduate, they'll likely find employment. John Zandstra, coordinator of the diploma program, said the results in recent years have been remarkable. \"When students come back here for their graduation ceremony, consistently 95 to 98 per cent of them have a job in the area they had studied in,\" he says. Mandy Martin, the daughter of Elmira-area farmers, was at the Applicant Information Day at Ridgetown on March 18. While an off-farm job isn't out of the question, she's thinking about bringing her experience at the campus back to the family farm. \"I wanted to come to school here... It seemed the most prudent choice for what I want to do,\" she says. What Mandy can expect is a well-rounded education at Ridgetown and the opportunity to focus on the areas of the industry she finds most interesting. Here's how it works. In the first semester, there are seven mandatory core courses: applied mathematics, applied plant science, computer applications I, livestock systems, soil principles, and written communications. In the second semester, there are just four of the core courses: business accounting, computer applications II, marketing and policy, and oral communications. That leaves room for three electives. By semesters three and four, the emphasis is on the electives. In the final year alone there are close to 30 to choose from. Some students focus on the animal side of agriculture; others on cropping. Still others pursue a more eclectic mix with such diverse choices as precision farming, organic agriculture, farm structures and the environment, renewable energy and welding. For students who wish to continue their studies at the University of Guelph, credits at Ridgetown count toward a degree. Ridgetown students also have advanced standing with Olds College in Alberta, should they wish to complete their diploma there. Zandstra says that while classroom studies are an integral part of the program, the emphasis on hands-on learning is immense. \"We're trying to move beyond rote learning... We want them to have practical experience.\" The instructors at Ridgetown understand the approach well. They both teach and operate their own research programs. Dr. Peter Sikkema, for instance, is known internationally for his work in weed science. There are several animal species on campus that students work with and ample opportunity to interact with farmers and other agricultural professionals. There are also opportunities to broaden horizons even further with Ridgetown's international learning opportunities. Among the third semester electives is the US Agriculture Study Tour. This year's tour included a visit to the international headquarters for Pioneer Hi-Bred in Iowa. In addition, there's an opportunity to participate in the Belize study tour, a one week experience over the Christmas break that is worth a credit. Between their first and second years, students can travel to the Netherlands for a three-month work experience and earn another credit. Branden Domm, a first year student, says the atmosphere at Ridgetown allows students to build relationships with their instructors and activities like the Belize trip are especially rewarding. \"It's an incredible opportunity... To see how other countries adapt their agriculture and how it's so difference from ours.\" Along with learning, the Ridgetown experience brings young people together in a supportive atmosphere. There is a wide range of extracurricular activities, student support services, co-ed accommodations on campus and many housing options in the town."}, {"title": "Precision Farming", "article": "to rapidly grow and develop in today's world, many farmers have started to benefit from it. It started roughly ten years ago when some of the first precision farming systems was used by some of the larger producers, but because technology has been made more affordable in recent years, these new farming systems are being used more and more. \"The first people that used the first models probably did so about ten years ago, but in the last number of years, there's been a transition to the point where all the major farmers have picked up on it and the price for it now compared to the initial price has dropped in half, much like we've seen happen with computers,\" explained Gary Braithwaite, Field Technician for the Smoky Applied Research and Extension Council of Alberta (SARDA). Precision farming or precision agriculture is a management concept based on observing and responding to intra-field variations. It relies on new technologies like satellite imagery, information technology, and geospatial tools, and has also drastically helped farmers' rate of production by using satellite-positioning systems such as GPS to locate their precise position in a field. \"A lot of the big farmers now run satellite-guided steering systems for their seeding, combining and often for their spraying operations,\" Braithwaite explained. \"What that does is, every row when you look into a field is absolutely precision north-south or east-west. \"When they go to do their second pass, there's absolutely zero overlap, so there's no doubling up on a row where two might run into each other or there's never a case where there's gaps more than a few cemeteries at best, and it's because of these new satellite-guided systems.\" Before this precision farming became available, a lot of the work and measuring had to be done by the farmers themselves, which took a lot of time and hard labour, and often wasn't as efficient as it can be when using this new technology. \"It used to be by eye so you'd sort of go as straight as you can and there would always be some degree of crookedness on the plots or the spacing's might be a little bit off,\" Braithwaite said. \"We used to go out there with a stake, a prism and a tape measure and spend a day marking out a plot, where as now you go to the site, hit a button to zero in, line it up and program it so it sends you straight in an east-west or north-south direction.\" According to local farmer, Al Lavoie, who is currently incorporating precision farming technology into his operations, he uses precision technology mostly for efficiency and to save costs on fertilizer, but the initial expense of the technology can be quite costly. \"There's definitely cost implicated in this, and you also have to modify some of your machinery, so it can take a while,\" he said. \"Some of the cost savings that come with using the guidance system is it helps minimize overlapping so that helps reduce the use of fertilizer and your seeds so it helps cut some of your expenses. \"The other thing we're looking at doing right now is called sectional control, which is for seeders or fertilizer application and also for spraying. Either your sprayer, applicator or seeder will actually close a section of your machine down to minimize the overlapping, so it's the same type of thing that will help reduce your costs.\" Although the initial cost of the technology may be expensive, Lavoie believes it will pay off in the long run but cutting many of the day-to-day costs that come along with farming."}, {"title": "Ag World Equipment continues to expand lines offered", "article": "Ag World Equipment in Kinistino has been in business for 17 years.

Some 235 exhibitors were set up this year at Evergreen Park south of Grande Prairie, 42 more than 2011, according to show president Dave Martin. \"The show has been terrific this year,\" Martin said Saturday . \"The at tendance has been out tanding, we've had lots of people through (and) really good interest.\" With strong commodity pricing and high optimism for another good year for the industry across the Peace, Martin said the show was a reflection of the outlook. \"The prices are going to hold so actually it's been really positive,\" he said. The economic conditions of the area are often reflected in the show's attendance, Martin said, and this year was no different, with strong attendance mirroring what is expected to be a strong 2012 farming season in the Peace. \"The commodity pricing and stability, if you will, in the farming community is going to be a boom for the entire area,\" Martin said. With local projections showing the region's agriculture providing 7% of the province's economy Martin said he is impressed with the strong showing considering the amount of oil and gas production and forestry work in the Peace. \"Food production is very important to all of us,\" Martin said. \"All we have to do is go hungry for a day to realize how important it really is.\" With new equipment and technology around every corner at the TEC Centre during the show, Martin said there are plenty of changes going on in the age-old industry. \"There's two real big factors in farming,\" he said. \"We've got crop production and then we've got the cattle production and there's new and diverse changes in equipment (and) in the way things are farmed.\" Precision farming makes up the biggest part of those changes, according to Martin, and it has come a long way over the last five to 10 years. \"Five years ago if people said you could plant canola at 2 1/2 pounds an acre everybody would have thought they were crazy because we planted five-to seven-pounds-an- acre,\" Martin said. \"Now we' re getting as good or better crops when we're laying down between 2 1/2 and five-pounds to the acre.\" While technology is a big part of the future of farming, Martin said an even bigger part is the people, and he's impressed with what he sees. \"We have a future in farming and it's really good to see the young people grabbing hold,\" he said. \"4-H has always been a proponent for that (and) they get young people prepared for the future whether it be in farming or in business.\" With the show winding down for another year, Martin said there's no telling what's in store for future years, but one thing is certain -the Peace Country Classic will continue to lead the way. \"This show is a floor plan for all the things that are out there that are new this year and the changes happen all the time,\" he said. \"It's a platform for people to come and see what's going on (in farming).\" dan@dailyheraldtribune.com"}, {"title": "Not just a pretty map", "article": "I've always considered myself a Farmer, and I'm just as guilty as anyone in loving a fancy map! But what does a map tell us? Is it just a bunch of data or is it actually valuable information? Data can be considered to be just a bunch of numbers, and information is data that has purpose and meaning that can be used to make pragmatic decisions. We just attended a very well attended Precision Ag conference in Calgary last month and I will share with you some of my observations. Variability in every field is a constant. Is there any acre on your farm that performs consistently year to year? On a majority of your acres, you are either over or under applying fertilizer because we are trying to farm with averages. Averages are likely on the higher side of what the field is capable of and are not good numbers to work with on a farm scale with the costs involved. If you're half in the oven and half in the freezer, you should be OK based on averages right? So how do Farmers manage this variability in a practical, sensible manner? Variable Rate Technology (VRT) is quickly gaining acceptance in Canadian farming and rightfully so. One the main objectives of VR Farming is to reallocate resources in an environmentally sustainable manner to produce a safe and reliable food source. As inputs increase in price, this practice will have higher rates of return for the investment made. I've heard plenty of times, \"Matt, why wouldn't I just spend another $10-15 per acre on nutrition instead of investing in VRT?\". With cheap fertilizer inputs I might agree, but input prices inevitably increase, and consumers are always looking for more food safety and environmental stewardship. The best part is that technology is here to do a more efficient job at applying our inputs in an environmentally sustainable manner. VR doesn't have to be complicated! It can start as simple as a top-dress nitrogen application in-season, or a full blown package varying all nutrients and even seed. I've shown some pretty dramatic responses to some clients, but on average, VR farming typically yields a positive return if done properly in the range of 2-4bu/acre, and in some cases input costs will also be lowered. Making the management decision to move into precision farming is a huge pendulum swing with lots of learning along the way. One of the presenters at the conference stated, \"If you don't have yield monitors and are practicing VR farming, you have it upside down\". I fully agree. This can be a great way of using this information to measure the end result of any trial if calibrated properly. Yield maps are ONE layer of information, and trust me, there can be many! We have worked with satellite and air plane images of all sorts and kinds, and a lot of electrical conductivity measurements of the soil. None of these technologies alone are the end all be all answer. Some fields are more applicable to one source of information than the other, but when more information is available to make a decision, it's usually a better end result. The farmers field experience, combined with in-field agronomic expertise and a technology expert carries a lot of horse power in determining the proper management zones within a VR field. A management zone is a sub-region in a field that expresses a homogenous yield limiting factor. Some zones produce better than another for certain reasons that good analytical information can help detect. Farmers were once classified as \"mechanised\" farms when they started to use machinery and soon after, mechanised farms didn't exist as everyone soon had a tractor. Now I've heard farmers being called \"precision\" farmers... how long will it take for precision to disappear from classifying a farm? Raw data on the left is shown with thousands of electrical conductivity measurements. If you have a keen eye, you'll be able to tell where the underground pipelines are... hint -there are 4! There are lots of very low EC readings that correlate to some sandier areas of the field -the one shown in the SE used to be an old pasture that was put into stubble years ago. There are a lot of higher EC readings typical of salinity (6.8%). These acres will be loaded with nutrition and not responsive to a pound of fertilizer on it if applied in the future! The strip shown in the middle with missing data was due to some severe compaction from farm equipment. The right map was the end result, and after consulting with the farmer -a 5 zone map with yields ranging from 25-60bu/acre of canola was generated. With this we will make an agronomically sound prescription that tells the producers equipment what to put down where, all automatically on the go using GPS technology in the cab. I know that this field will respond well to Precision Farming!"}, {"title": "HEM Hemisphere GPS loses $1.53-million (U.S.) in 2011", "article": "Hemisphere GPS Inc (TSX-V:HEM) Shares Issued 66,271,819 Last Close 3/5/2012 $0.98 Tuesday March 06 2012 - News Release Mr. Steven Koles reports HEMISPHERE GPS REPORTS 2011 Q4 AND YEAR-END RESULTS Hemisphere GPS Inc. has released its financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended Dec. 31, 2011. All currency amounts are expressed in United States dollars. The company notes that effective with the 2011 year, its financial results are reported under international financial reporting standards (IFRS) and as a result certain components, as well as 2010 comparatives, have been reclassified and adjusted within the financial statements to reflect the conversion. Details relating to the impact of the conversion were included in the financial statements and management's discussion and analysis documents for the first quarter ended March 31, 2011, which are available on SEDAR. 2011 financial review For the year ended Dec. 31, 2011, Hemisphere GPS reported revenues of $67.8-million, a 21-per-cent increase from revenues of $56-million reported in 2010. Growth reported for the first three quarters of 2011 was followed by flat growth in the fourth quarter as market activity in Europe and South America, primarily from original equipment manufacturers (OEM), was below other regions. \"Other than lower European and South American sales in the third and fourth quarters we have seen relative stability and strength in our global markets,\" stated Steven Koles, president and chief executive officer of Hemisphere GPS. \"The United States contributed 44 per cent of our total revenue in 2011, and 47 per cent in the fourth quarter specifically. Due to the size of the U.S. market, the recovery occurring in the U.S. economy is still the largest relative driver of our growth. With higher levels of customer confidence and discretionary income, I am pleased to report that our U.S. customer segment is indicating further improvement for 2012.\" Mr. Koles explained: \"Historically high grain prices and healthy harvests are providing rural farming communities with the highest relative income in generations. As a result we've had a strong start in 2012 with our North American sales. The USDA (U.S. Department of Agriculture) projects that U.S. net farm income increased by 24 per cent to $98.1-billion in 2011 -- the highest year ever in the United States. Similarly in Canada, 2011 farm income is projected to have increased by 24 per cent to a record level of nearly $12-billion. We have been building up our product inventory for an anticipated increase in postharvest sales and the 2012 buying season, and we are projecting revenue growth of 25 per cent in 2012. Most importantly, our revenue run rate has now surpassed our operating break-even point indicating a return to positive annual earnings in 2012, a full recovery from the global recession of 2009/2010.\" Gross margin for the year was 47.2 per cent compared with 47.6 per cent in 2010. Prior to expenses of $800,000 related to strategic initiatives in the second quarter of 2011, year-over-year total operating expenses decreased by $700,000 to $32.6-million for the year despite the 21-per-cent growth in revenues, demonstrating the scalability of the company's operating model. Hemisphere GPS reported a loss of $1.5-million or three cents per share (basic and diluted) for 2011, an improvement of $6.1-million compared with a net loss of $7.6-million or 14 cents per share (basic and diluted) in 2010. At Dec. 31, 2011, the company held cash of $6.7-million, or 11 cents per share, compared with $5.3-million in 2010. Working capital was approximately $28.8-million, and the company had 60,824,409 common shares outstanding. 2011 regional sales review North American revenues including Canada and the United States, the company's largest sales region, were up by 24 per cent to $42-million in 2011. Australian sales grew by 69 per cent to $4.3-million, and sales to other international regions, which include South America and Asia, were 2 per cent lower in 2011. European revenues were up by 21 per cent over 2010. Strong European sales growth of 60 per cent in the first half of 2011 was tempered for the year with declines of 24 per cent and 7 per cent in the third and fourth quarters, respectively, resulting from temporary uncertainty stemming from the European sovereign debt crisis. 2011 product segment sales review Agriculture Ground-based agriculture sales from Outback Guidance-branded products, increased by 27 per cent year over year. Sales of the company's air-based agriculture products grew by 22 per cent compared with 2010, led by the new Bantam aerial guidance system. Total sales of $53-million to the agriculture segment in 2011 increased by 21 per cent for the year compared with 2010, contributing 78 per cent of total revenues, which was the same contribution percentage as 2010. Precision products Record sales of $14.7-million for the precision products segment were up 21 per cent in 2011, contributing 22 per cent of total revenue for the year. Sales of Vector heading sensor products to the marine markets together with sales of GPS boards, receivers and development kits to OEM customers and system integrators led the growth in this segment. Fourth quarter financial review For the three months ended Dec. 31, 2011, Hemisphere GPS reported revenues of $12.3-million, slightly up from $12.2-million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Healthy sales growth in Australia and Asia, were offset by a fourth quarter decline in South American and European revenues. North American sales were consistent with the fourth quarter of 2010. Fourth quarter gross margin contribution was 45.7 per cent or $5.6-million for the fourth quarter, an increase compared with 42.2 per cent and $5.1-million for the fourth quarter of 2010. Two thousand ten gross margins reflected an incremental reserve for obsolete inventory with no similar item impacting the 2011 margins. Operating expenses decreased year over year by $400,000 or 5 per cent to $8.2-million in the fourth quarter in line with management's profitability objectives. Research and development expenses in the fourth quarter were lower by $100,000 year over year at $3.1-million. Sales and marketing expenses for the quarter were lower by 4 per cent and general and administrative expenses were down by 11 per cent. For the fourth quarter of 2011, Hemisphere GPS reported a reduced loss of $2.6-million or four cents per share (basic and diluted), compared with a fourth quarter 2010 loss of $3.3-million or six cents per share (basic and diluted). Operating highlights Hemisphere GPS entered the emerging data services market in precision agriculture with the acquisition of AgJunction, a provider of a cloud-based data management software platform and wireless hardware to precision agriculture retailers and growers. Data services is a new growth segment in precision agriculture with market adoption driving an 80-per-cent three-year cumulative annual revenue growth rate for AgJunction. The merged businesses positions Hemisphere GPS for a leadership position in the sector by bringing real-time decision-making information right into the farmer's cab. Effective use of precision agriculture data can result in lower costs and environmental impact through lower use of pesticides, fertilizer and fuel, and provide a higher crop yield per acre, increased profitability and lower the impact on global food costs.

Growth reported for the first three quarters of 2011 was followed by flat growth in the fourth quarter as market activity in Europe and South America, primarily from OEM's, was below other regions. \"Other than lower European and South American sales in the third and fourth quarters we have seen relative stability and strength in our global markets,\" stated Steven Koles, President and CEO of Hemisphere GPS. \"The United States contributed 44% of our total revenue in 2011, and 47% in the fourth quarter specifically. Due to the size of the US market, the recovery occurring in the US economy is still the largest relative driver of our growth. With higher levels of customer confidence and discretionary income, I am pleased to report that our US customer segment is indicating further improvement for 2012.\" Mr. Koles explained: \"Historically high grain prices and healthy harvests are providing rural farming communities with the highest relative income in generations. As a result we've had a strong start in 2012 with our North American sales. The USDA (US Department of Agriculture) projects that US net farm income increased by 24% to $98.1 billion in 2011 - the highest year ever in the United States. Similarly in Canada, 2011 farm income is projected to have increased by 24% to a record level of nearly $12 billion. We have been building up our product inventory for an anticipated increase in post-harvest sales and the 2012 buying season, and we are projecting revenue growth of 25% in 2012. Most importantly, our revenue run-rate has now surpassed our operating break-even point indicating a return to positive annual earnings in 2012, a full recovery from the global recession of 2009/2010.\" Gross margin for the year was 47.2% compared to 47.6% in 2010. Prior to expenses of $0.8 million related to strategic initiatives in the second quarter of 2011, year-over-year total operating expenses decreased by $0.7 million to $32.6 million for the year despite the 21% growth in revenues, demonstrating the scalability of the Company's operating model. Hemisphere GPS reported a loss of $1.5 million or ($0.03) per share (basic and diluted) for 2011, an improvement of $6.1 million compared to a net loss of $7.6 million or ($0.14) per share (basic and diluted) in 2010. At December 31, 2011, the Company held cash of $6.7 million, or $0.11 per share, compared to $5.3 million in 2010. Working capital was approximately $28.8 million, and the Company had 60,824,409 common shares outstanding. 2011 Regional Sales Review North American revenues including Canada and the United States, the Company's largest sales region, were up by 24% to $42 million in 2011. Australian sales grew by 69% to $4.3 million, and sales to other international regions, which include South America and Asia, were 2% lower in 2011. European revenues were up by 21% over 2010. Strong European sales growth of 60% in the first half of 2011 was tempered for the year with declines of 24% and 7% in the third and fourth quarters respectively, resulting from temporary uncertainty stemming from the European sovereign debt crisis. 2011 Product Segment Sales Review Agriculture - Ground-based agriculture sales from Outback Guidance(r) branded products, increased by 27% year-over-year. Sales of the Company's air-based agriculture products grew by 22% compared to 2010, led by the new Bantam aerial guidance system. Total sales of $53 million to the Agriculture segment in 2011 increased by 21% for the year compared to 2010, contributing 78% of total revenues, which was the same contribution percentage as 2010. Precision Products - Record sales of $14.7 million for the Precision Products segment were up 21% in 2011, contributing 22% of total revenue for the year. Sales of Vector heading sensor products to the marine markets together with sales of GPS boards, receivers and development kits to OEM customers and system integrators led the growth in this segment. Fourth Quarter Financial Review For the three months ended December 31, 2011, Hemisphere GPS reported revenues of $12.3 million, slightly up from $12.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Healthy sales growth in Australia and Asia, were offset by a fourth quarter decline in South American and European revenues. North American sales were consistent with the fourth quarter of 2010. Fourth quarter gross margin contribution was 45.7% or $5.6 million for the fourth quarter, an increase compared to 42.2% and $5.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2010. 2010 gross margins reflected an incremental reserve for obsolete inventory with no similar item impacting the 2011 margins. Operating expenses decreased year-over-year by $0.4 million or 5% to $8.2 million in the fourth quarter in line with management's profitability objectives. Research and development expenses in the fourth quarter were lower by $0.1 million year over year at $3.1 million. Sales and marketing expenses for the quarter were lower by 4% and general and administrative expenses were down by 11%. For the fourth quarter of 2011, Hemisphere GPS reported a reduced loss of $2.6 million, or ($0.04) per share (basic and diluted), compared to a fourth quarter 2010 loss of $3.3 million or ($0.06) per share (basic and diluted). Operating Highlights * Hemisphere GPS entered the emerging data services market in precision agriculture with the acquisition of AgJunction, a provider of a cloud-based data management software platform and wireless hardware to precision agriculture retailers and growers.

This year's event will host 230 exhibitors -about 40 more than last year, and the event will also see some new additions to attract a crowd. Artcetera will showcase Peace Country country-western art with 15 booths, including paintings, photography and jewelry. The show also will see a return of Elevator Row. \"We've got all the chemical and seed companies participating... it's been many years since we've seen them in the show,\" said show president, Dave Martin. With the industry seeing steady, high prices from cattle to grain, Martin said the there's optimism when looking towards the future. Seminars are also available to attend, including GPS precision land management. \"Precision farming has changed dramatically in the last five years, to the point where most swathers sold are sold with GPS, most combines have GPS, and most tractors from a 140 horsepower up are GPS equipped,\" Martin said. With GPS technology, machines can drive in a straight line accurate to a half-an- inch for multiple passes. \"Precision farming has made it so the operator in the tractor -or in a combine or swather -can actually pay attention to what's going on around him because he no longer has to drive the unit.\" Martin said without precision farming, farmers, on average, are only accurate to 20 inches, and said redundant passes can add up on a 6,000- acre farm. Prescription farming is also on the horizon for Peace Country farmers. \"They'll be able to adjust their fertilizers on the go,\" he said. \"With ground mapping, they'll be able to apply fertilizer in areas where it's needed, and reduce fertilizer where they don't need it.\" Technology has come so far in the last five years, said Martin and it won't be long before tractors drive themselves entirely. \"Pretty soon, the tractor will drive in the field while they'll sitting at their office desk in their house.\" The Agri-Show is geared towards those in the industry looking to see what's available in the marketplace, and products and services of all things agriculture will be showcasing wares. \"They're there in a noninvasive way, people are able to see what's going on, they won't cornered by salespeople... and they can see what's being offered.\" The general public is encouraged to come to see what's going on in the industry, if nothing other than to see the physical size of the machines. \"One of these new super combines is the largest in the world. It's the equivalent of three built five years ago.\" \"The size of the machinery is just incredible.\" The show is held at Evergreen Park on March 8,9, and 10, and admission is free. graeme@dailyheraldtribune.com"}, {"title": "Large agribusiness nominees honoured by recognition", "article": "Two highly respected companies are vying for top honours in the large agribusiness category of the 12th annual Oxford County Federation of Agriculture(OCFA) Agricultural Awards of Excellence ceremony, set for April 4 in the Oxford Auditorium. The award-winning Field Gate Organics Inc. is the first finalist in the running. \"Anytime you have the opportunity to win an award, you feel very gratified,\" president Ted Soudant said. \"I, along with the staff and shareholders, are delighted to be nominated. We are really the only business of this kind in Canada with its own plant, so being compared to others is often difficult to do. \"So I am very proud just to be nominated by the OCFA for this award. It's great recognition coming from an impartial third party.\" Field Gate Organics Inc., an alliance of Canadian certified organic farmers, was established in May 2003 by 12 organic beef farmers to sell and market beef. Now it has 41 shareholders and markets beef, pork, lamb, chicken and turkey, expanding into kill and processing with a provincial meat plant in Ingersoll. \"Field Gate Organics co-ordinates with the farmers to help reduce cost,\" Soudant said. \"For example, when shipping animals to the kill plant, instead of each farmer sending his beef, we co-ordinate the trucks so they are full, reducing the farmers' cost of freight. \"Our sales have increased at a rate of 25 % on average per year since we started. In the 2011-2012 year, our sales will grow even faster as we started supplying large retail chains with product. In terms of strategies or technologies, our main strategy was becoming vertically integrated, allowing us to do things in the marketplace that no-one can else do.\" Field Gate Organics Inc. has 12 full-time employees in Oxford County, including plant manager, HACCP manager, production manager, butchers (meat cutters), packers and truck drivers. \"Our employees are the key to our success because they are loyal and hard working,\" Soudant said. \"I'm particularly proud of taking the first step with 12 original farmers and $24,000, opening our own store in London and growing our markets to where they are today and creating FGO Organic Processing Ltd., a federal meat plant in Ingersoll. \"There is really nobody else in Canada that is vertically integrated to be able to manage farm supply, farm transportation, kill and process at a federal level, market and distribute across North America. The second finalist is Great Lakes New Holland Inc. \"I was very surprised when I heard that we had been named a finalist, but pleasantly surprised,\" president Wayne Feltz said. \"I really wasn't that aware of the awards but have become better acquainted with them recently. \"It is certainly an honour to be included in this list of finalists. We are very grateful that the OCFA committee would think of our company as being worthy of such an honour. We have strived over the years to maintain a solid reputation within the agricultural and agribusiness sectors and it is very gratifying to be recognized for our efforts.\" With four locations (two serving Oxford County) the company offers a full line of New Holland tractors, combines and hay and forage equipment, in addition to a wide range of other equipment for tillage, seeding and spraying and numerous other agricultural needs including light construction and excavation. \"We offer unique strategies and technologies like GPS and precision farming,\" Feltz said. \"We have people specializing in those areas and our shop is fully equipped to handle all projects. \"We also place an emphasis on staff training, so our employees are well-versed and on top of the latest technological advances.

Farooque and Co-Researchers in the Area of Soil Science Described", "article": "2012 FEB 23 - (VerticalNews.com) -- \"Crop management practices within wild blueberry fields are implemented uniformly, with inadequate attention being given to substantial variations in soil properties and fruit yield. These variations emphasize the need for precise and site-specific crop management based on proper characterization and quantification of spatial soil variability,\" scientists in Truro, Canada report. \"The objective of this research was to characterize and quantify the spatial patterns of variability in soil properties and fruit yield. A grid pattern of sampling points was established at each experimental site to collect soil and fruit yield samples during 2009 to 2010 at North River and Carmal sites, Nova Scotia, Canada. The soil samples were collected from 0- to 15-cm depth at each grid point. These soil samples were analyzed for soil organic matter, pH, texture, electrical conductivity, and inorganic nitrogen (N). The volumetric moisture content (theta(v)) was recorded at each grid point using time domain reflectometry. Ground conductivity readings were also recorded using dual EM conductivity meter at same selected grid points. Fruit yield was mapped using calibrated digital color photography during the crop year. The coefficient of variation of the soil properties and fruit yield suggested moderate to high variability (coefficient of variation >15%) except for soil pH. The results of correlation analysis indicated that the values for inorganic N, soil organic matter, electrical conductivity, clay, and theta(v) were generally higher in high-yielding areas and vice versa. The trend was opposite for sand and silt content, which were higher in low-yielding areas. Most of the soil properties had a large spatial variation with semivariogram range of 20 to 50 m and varied greatly within field. Kriged maps of soil properties and fruit yield also showed substantial variation within field. Characterization of spatial soil variability in wild blueberry fields would assist in planning future soil sampling in new fields showing soil and/or yield variability. The selection of soil sampling should be based on the sampling interval suggested by the variogram range (<20 m),\" wrote A.A. Farooque and colleagues. The researchers concluded: \"Proper soil sampling can help in identifying yield-limiting soil properties and develop prescription maps for site-specific nutrient management to ameliorate unproductive areas and reduce environmental contamination.\" Farooque and colleagues published their study in Soil Science (Response of Wild Blueberry Yield to Spatial Variability of Soil Properties.

That's the assessment of Canadian development experts, interviewed by The Canadian Press, who are getting a first-hand look at the spiralling hunger across several countries in the increasingly dry and afflicted Sahel belt. The United Nations and other major international bodies are warning of a famine that could affect 23 million people across Niger, Mali, Chad, Burkina Faso and Mauritania, unless a major global rescue effort is mounted. (The Canadian Press) (Illegal-Cattle-Exports) A veterinarian and several livestock operations in Manitoba are facing federal charges following a two-year investigation by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. Court documents obtained by the Brandon Sun allege that hundreds of cattle were illegally exported from Canada into the United States between February 2008 and August 2009. In those documents, C-F-I-A specialist Shirlee Sigurdson says the allegations have the potential to cause serious disruptions to the export of Canadian cattle to the U-S, and to cause widespread harm to the cattle industry. In 2003, the U-S government banned all imports of Canadian cattle following the discovery of a single cow infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy. The U-S eventually relaxed the ban to allow cattle under the age of 30 months in 2005 and then again in 2007 to animals born after March 1st, 1999. The charges based on the C-F-I-A investigation relate to allegations of inaccurate recording of the ages of cattle.

Before we begin with the real presentations, could you please take a moment to view the Safe Harbor on the slides, and on your desktop? And now, I'd like to introduce the CEO of Mosaic, Jim Prokopanko. JIM PROKOPANKO, PRESIDENT AND CEO, MOSAIC: Well, thank you, Laura. Welcome and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'd like to share my vision of Mosaic with each of you. To do any vision thing, or to bring a vision to life, you need strong leadership. And I have the privilege of serving with one of the strongest most talented and most experienced leadership teams in this industry. You're going to hear from many of them today. You're going to hear from Joc O'Rourke who leads our Operations and Mosaic's Supply Chain team. You're going to hear from Rick McLellan our Commercial leader, and he's the one that's responsible for selling everything that we make. Bo Davis leads our Phosphates Operations group, both here in Florida and in Louisiana. Rich Mack, General Counsel, also responsible for permitting operations at Mosaic. And our CFO, Larry Stranghoener, not a stranger to anybody here in this room. As Laura said, you're also going to hear from Dr. Mike Rahm this evening, also known by many as the Wikipedia of Agriculture. As I prepared my thoughts to share with you today, I reflected on my career on agriculture. When I started working 30 years ago, agriculture was underappreciated, a bit of a backwater, and definitely, not a glamorous sector. Agriculture was not on the radar of the investment community. Fast-forward to today, and we are living in unprecedented times with intense global challenges and opportunities. Agriculture has developed from an industry often ignored to one taken very seriously in terms of global economic development. What a great time to be in this business. When you look at the technical advancements over the past decade in seed science, precision agriculture, crop protection, irrigation and agronomy, it's clear that we're entering a new green revolution. But it's equally clear that current output levels, world food production strains to produce enough food to feed the world's population. Food supply shocks, and price disruptions such as the ones we saw in Egypt, Pakistan and Thailand in 2008 drove civil unrest in these regions. This is a foretaste of what the world will face if we fail to address growing global demand for food. We're entering a period where agricultural success will be a major factor in promoting global prosperity and geopolitical stability. As the world's leading crop nutrient company, Mosaic has a major role to play. Our mission of helping the world grow the food it needs is an urgent one. Against this backdrop, I'm thrilled to welcome you to Mosaic's 2012 investor day. This is our first such event since becoming a completely fully independent publicly traded company. I'm delighted to lead the company with formidable range in depth of competencies that stem from a 100 year legacy and an entrepreneurial spirit of a young enterprise. I'm privileged to serve as an architect for our next stage of growth, and share my vision with you today. And I'm honored to be a leader in an industry that will play a central role in the future of our global communities. Let me be clear about the message we want to leave with you today. We face the most compelling long-term supply and demand fundamentals confronting any business sector, and Mosaic is ideally positioned to capitalize on it. We have burgeoning population, each year, we add 75 million people to the global population, equivalent to having to feed another two Canadas every year. FAO estimates tell us the world needs to grow 70% more food by 2050 than it does today. In places like Africa, ample food not only eliminates hunger, but is a critical first step in eliminating poverty, and increasing political stability. We don't just need more food. The world is also demanding higher quality grains and oilseeds. Our growing middle class in Asia, and India is shifting away from starches, toward a more protein and dairy rich diet. That requires substantial increases in farmers' output. Today, growth and crop yield is linear, but growth in food demand is exponential. In North and South America, Europe and Asia, this new green revolution has already taken hold but has not yet spread to emerging markets, where population growth and shifts in class structure and diets will be even more dramatic. Arable land in the world is finite, yet gains and increased arable land are offset by urban sprawl. For example, yield growth trends for irrigated corn in Nebraska are flat, meaning we need to find new ways to achieve yield growth. These are complex issues, but here is some added context. About 50% of the global crop yields are the result of manufactured crop nutrients. Half the ones we have today is a result of application of the products Mosaic manufactures. Crop nutrients play one of the most significant roles in improving lives around the world. I expect them to be amongst the world's most valuable commodities in the years ahead. There is no single magic bullet to these challenges, but one factor is proven, balanced crop nutrition is the single most effective way to boost crop yields and to ensure that food production can meet the projected demand. My vision for The Mosaic Company is simple; to be the best crop nutrition company in the world. How we achieve this goal, and how we'll generate superior shareholder value is the topic of today's events. I have a clear view on the attributes required to be the world's best crop nutrition company. It will not hinge on a single differentiator such as being the largest in a particular nutrient category, but the best will be a multifaceted undertaking. Mosaic possess the most powerful combination of assets, experience, financial strength, innovation and global reach. We support our mission with four key values at Mosaic. Organizational integrity, meaning a focus ethics and transparency, a commitment to excellence, including lower costs, and pursuit of an injury-free workplace. A focus on sustainability. We take great pride in building sustainable practices into every aspect of how we approach our business. And, insuring productivity, linking customers, and production through our global distribution network. These values enable The Mosaic Company to be the best by leveraging efficiencies across the organization and positioning the Company for success. Superior size and scale are essential. Our world-class mining and processing operations, produce more than double the amount finished phosphate than the next competitor. And we are among the three largest global producers of potash. Combined, we're the world's largest phosphate and potash producer, and we're heavily investing to extend this advantage. During fiscal 2011, we spent over $600 million on expansions at our three Canadian potash lines. Once completed, we expect our annual potash capacity to soar by more than 50% to approximately 16.5 million tons by 2021. In phosphates, we're taking shipments from the Miski Mayo mine in Peru, which we expect to produce up to 3.9 million tons per year when fully operational. And we continue to look for opportunities to increase our rock supply. And yesterday, we announced that we have reached an agreement to end litigation that has impacted Mosaic, our employees, our communities, suppliers, and our shareholders. Upon approval of the courts, Mosaic will soon begin mining the Hardee County extension of the South Fort Meade mine, in accordance with our existing federal, state and local permits and approvals. South Fort Meade mine has historical been one of the most efficient and cost effective phosphate mining operations in the world, and we look forward to returning the mine to its leadership position. The Hardee County extension will allow ten additional years of mining at the South Fort Meade track, which employs more than 220 Floridians. To be the best, you also need to move significant volumes around the world, around the globe in a just in time fashion. We do this for Mosaic's extensive global distribution system, with networks in the eight major agricultural growing regions of the world. As part of our global distribution network, we maintain port facilities around the world, ensuring consistent, reliable delivery for our customers in approximately 40 countries. This gives Mosaic another key advantage. Our boot's on the ground, local presence, brings us the insight and access into these regions, and the ability to leverage our global knowledge and product set. Out research and physical presence in key growing regions outside the US, along with 1200 employees outside of North America, allows us to field test new crop nutrient formulations on a counter-seasonal basis, and refine our products year-round. Mosaic is driven by innovation in multiple ways. On the product front, MicroEssentials are proven yield enhancing micronutrient phosphate product leads the way. We're investing over $70 million to extend MicroEssentials production from 1.5 million tons to 2.3 million tons per year. In turn, this benefits our customers. Field tests of this product show increase yields with 2.7 to 7.7 more bushels per acre than competing products. Over the past 18 months, sale of MicroEssentials increased dramatically, which validates our ongoing investments in production, innovation and global testing. We're also committed to process innovation to help us meet demand in a sustainable and a cost-efficient manner, whether it's enhancing finished phosphate extraction, or surface solution and shaft mining, from our electric cogeneration to expertise in brine flow management, we're committed to harnessing our global intelligence and agronomic expertise. Another key to our success is the ability to execute on our objectives, both from an operational, and financial management view. We set out two years ago to achieve operational excellence across our phosphate and potash operations. Our goal is simple, drive substantial improvement in our productivity across all the dimensions of performance, including safety, throughput cost, capital allocation and quality. This effort will give us a process base source of competitive advantage, putting us on track as one of the safest, lowest cost, and most capital efficient producers in the industry. Our efforts ,through the end of fiscal 2011, generated recurring annualized benefits of over $125 million; $40 million in potash, and $85 million in phosphates. Later, Larry will give you a detailed update on how we approach capital allocation. For now, I'll call out Mosaic's strong financial position as a key to creating long-term value for our shareholders. Our solid financial foundation positioned us well to achieve our vision for tomorrow. We started fiscal 2012 financially strong, we -- with a superior balance sheet, a cash position of nearly $4 billion, additional debt capacity, and excellent capital prospects. Prior to the Cargill split-off, we made great efforts to monetize assets that did not factor into our future so we could redirect this capital. Today, we're focusing on optimizing our balance sheet. This gives us tremendous flexibility for funding our potash extension program and other strategic priorities, taking advantage of new opportunities as they arise and returning cash to shareholders. Larry will get into more detail on this in his remarks. But the Mosaic Board has approved 150% increase for the calendar of 2012 dividend program, beginning with the next regularly declared dividend. This action was based on our confidence we have in Mosaic's ability to continue to drive financial results, and the long-term fundamentals in our industry. This raises the annual dividend per share from $0.20 to $0.50 and continues our commitment for returning cash to shareholders. Today's Mosaic, puts far greater emphasis on sustainability and environmental sensitivity than ever before. Many of the best examples are right here in Florida. For instance, approximately, 95% of the water used in our phosphate operations, and more than 82% of the water used on our Canadian operations -- potash operations, is recycled. In 2010, Mosaic produced enough carbon-free electricity through its cogeneration efforts to power 160,000 households for over a year. Nearly 50% of the electricity in our Florida operations, is now obtained from emissions-free cogeneration processes, and by 2015, we expect to be fully self-sufficient. We approach the application of crop nutrients by following the guidelines of four Rs; right source, right place, right rate, and right time. We promote these guidelines through trade organizations and the farmers who use the products. And Mosaic restores every acre of land impacted by our phosphate mining activities. These are just a few of the many examples of our sustainability commitment today. Now, as I look to the future, I see a market landscape that is dramatically different from today. These changes play right into the hands of Mosaic. Immature markets, such North and South America, I expect a greater emphasis on micronutrient products with their yield enhancing properties. In emerging markets, distribution networks will evolve as the benefits of crop nutrient applications are proven. Today, Mosaic's Village project is demonstrating the effectiveness of crop nutrient application in modern farming techniques in place such as Guatemala, India, and across the African continent. These efforts will be instrumental in stimulating future demand in emerging markets for our products. As the leader in micronutrient products and the Company with the most extensive distribution network, Mosaic already has a tremendous advantage in both areas. Crop nutrient supplies will also increase, but marketing pressures, limited national resource supplies, and the high cost to access them will give the advantage to producers with the best rock assets, and the most cost advantageous way to develop them. While other companies mount significant efforts to develop new greenfield capacity in potash, I believe pricing dynamics, as new potash capacity comes online, will undermine the economics of greenfield's capacity expansion. Mosaic's brownfield expansions and excellence initiatives are putting us in a position to be the largest and one of the most efficient producers in the industry. On the pricing front, several factors, most notably grain and oilseed pricing and foreign economics will drive cyclicality in crop nutrient pricing. I expect overall, [P and K] prices would continue to be cyclical, with higher lows, and higher highs driven by reinflation of the dollar, tight grain and oilseed supplies, and the need for economic returns to justify capital investment in new production. As a result, effective capital allocation will continue to be critical for developing shareholder value. Mosaic's capital allocation discipline gives us the ability to take advantage of opportunities while optimizing long-term returns from these investments. When I look at the competition, I see a changing landscape. The effectiveness of our competitors in both potash and phosphates will be limited by their access to natural resources. Consolidation in phosphates will continue to create larger, stronger competitors. Greenfield investments in potash are not a sure bet. Brownfields are beginning to come online, and will strengthen the hand of today's leading producers. Mosaic's expansion plans are underway and position us well against the longer lead times of Greenfield investments. From a fully integrated operations in phosphates to a superior access to natural resources from our global sales to our distribution network, Mosaic is already far ahead of the game in terms of excelling in tomorrow's markets. So, what would Mosaic look like in five years? First, we expect to be a much larger organization and take our dual-nutrient platform to a new level, and at the same time, preserve our leadership position in terms of size, and competitive costing. In potash, we expect our capacity to grow by 40% driven by 4.4 million tons of additional capacity. We have over a century of reserves and continue to grow as demand grows. Through acquisition of joint ventures, we expect to increase and diversify our rock assets. Today, we are the phosphates leader and a great position to pursue attractive opportunities. Mosaic will be much more globally connected and integrated across the entire value chain. Today, we possess the most powerful distribution network and sales operations in the industry, and we will leverage this network to benefit from these advantages as the market leader. Of course, Mosaic will continue to be one of the most trusted and reliable companies in our industry. We regularly monitor customer satisfaction, and have become much easier to do business with. High customer trust, driven by our connections and expertise, will distinguish Mosaic from our peers. We continue to believe Mosaic will be a destination employer for the best people in our industry. Our employees are driven by our mission, the strong values we embrace, combined with competitive compensation tied to financial and shareholder performance. And, finally, Mosaic expects to be known as the provider of products with the most profound effect on economics for everyone in the crop nutrient value chain, from farmers, through to our shareholders. Mosaic is the clear innovator in premium products in particular MicroEssentials. These products are anticipated to be of increasingly important value to extending farmers' yields. And we're intending to develop new additional products to be deployed and marketed globally. These premium products should increase our relative market position, increase the productivity of P2O5 production, as well as generate additional margins above peer commodity products. In five years, we plan to achieve a significantly higher level of excellence and operational effectiveness. Mosaic stands alone in the crop nutrient industry in terms of mining and processing expertise that will help us improve our relative cost position in both potash and phosphates. We operate the largest phosphate chemical complex in the world, and are focused on continually improving those efficiencies. This operational focus is on continuous improvement equips us to manage through cyclical swings, while increasing margins relative to peers and driving higher shareholder returns. Over the next five years, expect us to deploy our balance sheet in ways that greatly enhance shareholder value. In concluding, we believe Mosaic will be known as the destination for shareholder value for one simple reason; we possess the most powerful combination of assets, experience, financial strength, innovation, and global reach in the crop nutrient industry. This combination of qualities are absolutely essential to capitalizing on market opportunities ahead, driving top and bottom line growth, and are generating attractive return on investment capital and value for our owners. Thank you. Thanks very much, for you investment and time and attention this morning, or this afternoon. And now, I'll like to turn over the podium to Joc O'Rourke, leader of our Operations and Mosaic's Supply Chain. Joc? JOC O'ROURKE, EVP, OPERATIONS, MOSAIC: Jim, really well said. Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to Mosaic's Analyst Day conference. It's great for me to be here talking about a subject that I think is so important to Mosaic, and that is our potash expansions. I want to take you through Mosaic's growth strategy, and how we are positioned to meet the challenges of the future through our potash expansions. Today, we have over 100 years of reserves, we have strong executional capabilities and access to capital that allows us to actually get to and capitalize on these expansion opportunities through our cost advantage brownfields expansions. Now, today our product mix is approximately equal between potash and phosphate. Through this, we are alone able to deliver these two key crop nutrients on such a massive scale that no one else is capable of doing. As we invest in potash, we expect to shift that mix to about 60% potash. So, why is that important? Well, we believe that by shifting to the higher margin potash product, we will improve the profitability for Mosaic and in doing so, enhance shareholder value. So, we are, and we plan to remain a leader in the global potash business. Our multi-year expansion efforts, which include over seven individual projects, will raise our annual capacity by about 50%. In all, we will expand by 6.2 million tons, so that by 2021 our capacity will be a total of 16.5 million tons. Now, this includes the reversion of the tolling agreement, which I'm going to come back to. But bottom line is, through these expansions, we're going to solidify our position as one of the global leaders in the potash business. So -- also in connection with this, I want to focus on a little bit on our tolling agreement. Under the terms of the tolling agreement, Mosaic's obligation to supply potash corporation was about 1.1 million tons per annum of potash will come to an end at the end of this year when the tolling agreement completes. At that point, and in connection with this, Mosaic will also have 1.3 million tons of capacity that will revert from Potash Corporation to Mosaic, for the purposes of calculating our relative share in the sales of potash through Canpotex. This is important to us because we believe Canpotex' international sales and distribution capability add real value to Mosaic through their logistics assets and economy of sales, including port and warehouse facilities in Vancouver British Columbia, Canada and Portland, Oregon; an ever expanding ocean fleet, including 18 new vessels to be delivered between 2010 and 2014; and, a specialized rail fleet of over 5,000 specialized potash rail cars. So now, let's switch gears and explore what we consider to be one of our most compelling competitive advantages, and that is our brownfields expansions. Mosaic has exceptional mineral resources, and expansions of our existing minds and infrastructure or what we call brownfields expansion, will allow us to take that material to the market more quickly and more economically than an equivalent new mine or greenfields expansion. Mosaic's Brownfields expansions are most efficient and cost effective for a number of reasons. First, our brownfield expansions as -- add incremental tonnage, so they're not burdened with a lot of new overhead cost. Our brownfield expansions are individually less extensive, so the individual projects can come to market much quicker than an equivalent greenfields expansion. Next, while capital cost for our brownfield expansions is in the range of $1,000 per capacity ton, an equivalent greenfield could be as much as double or more on a per ton basis. And, finally, we have extensive expertise, infrastructure and logistics to deliver our products to our customers internationally. These are additional assets and capabilities that our competitors would have to establish to successfully implement a greenfields operation. So, when it comes to growth, the math is simple, and the advantage to Mosaic and its share holders is obvious. So, because of this, Mosaic is aggressively, yet thoughtfully expanding, and we are very focused on delivering the right balance that maximizes return on all of these projects. These projects are designed so that we can respond to changing market conditions and develop new production that is closely aligned with increasing demand. During fiscal 2011, Mosaic spent $600 million on potash expansions. In 2012, we will spend nearly $1 billion on the same expansions at our three Canadian mines, Belle Plaine, Colonsay and Esterhazy. These investments take time to complete and the investments we're making today are for the next decade and for the future beyond that. So, as you see from the slide, we've only made a portion of our total investment to-date. We expect to be actively expanding our potash operations into the next decade. So, as I look over today's landscape, I'm personally thrilled and proud of the platform we've built to develop through the future. I think we've got a real competitive advantage, and we're really able to execute on that. So now that we've gone through that, what I would like to do is give you a little better flavor for the potash expansions by playing a short video. Can we cue a short video? (Video Plays) Okay. Now, that you have a deeper understanding of our efforts to expand potash, I'd like to give you little more detail on each of the three individual mines, and what we're doing there to increase their production. First, let's take a look at our Belle Plaine facility. Belle Plaine is a source of our Pegasus product, which is a premium white product. It has a higher potassium content than the standard red potash. This is the world's largest solution mine at Belle Plaine, and we've developed a substantial amount of technology and proprietary knowledge that makes us extremely competitive in this space. We've been able to improve both the recovery, and the rate at which we've been able to extract the potash from the mine in Belle Plaine. Now, over time at Belle Plaine we expect to invest nearly $3 billion, resulting in 1.9 million tons of additional capacity by 2021. Just a couple of pictures of Belle Plaine. Here is a picture of the overall site, and you can see in the foreground the new warehouse facility that's being built to contain more product as the plant gets bigger and bigger. If we go to the next slide, here's two pictures of additional facilities. On the left, we have the new processed water facility which allows collection of water or brine that is pumped through the underground mining fields and brings the potash back to surface. And then, on the right, we have one of the new compactor circuits. And what that does is produce uniform product sizing and -- so that it works better for the customer as it goes through a spreader on the field. So, this gives us a more consistent and uniform product that is more beneficial to our customers. Now, let's look at Colonsay. Overtime, we expect to invest about $1.3 billion in Colonsay to produce an additional 1.2 million tons of production by that same 2021 date. Late in 2011, we successfully completed the last annual turnaround at Colonsay. At that point, we installed a lot of the new equipment and made some of the key tie-ends that will allow that project to go forward next year and start producing. So, if we look at some of the progress, you can see here some of the skill work going up for the low that would be the mill circuit, that will be the second mill circuit. And one of the reasons we want to show you these pictures is to make sure it's clear. This is not about a plan. This is about steel and equipment that is going in the ground today. If we look at the next one, again, part of the stage one expansion of Colonsay, more compaction equipment to make the compaction of this Colonsay product. Finally, we move to our largest facility -- a matter of fact, Esterhazy is the largest potash mine in the world and still growing. By the end of fiscal 2011, we expect to invest about $1 billion in Esterhazy, and by the end of 2021, $2.1 billion towards an additional 1.8 million tons of annual production. Esterhazy's K2 milling circuit is now complete. We started commissioning that on December the 8th, and that brings to an end basically, the surface construction of this phase of Esterhazy. Now, we are finishing the last phases of our underground work. And, here, we have a slide of our third, four router miner going in that will help mine and bring in the ore to surface to feed that new milling facility. Also, at K2, we're building four new remote storage bins underground to help produce the rock, to get the rocks from the miners to the conveyors to the hoist and up into the mill circuit. Now, we go on to probably what is our most complex and longest projects, and that is our K3 shaft project. K3 represents a large portion of the overall commitment of capital that Mosaic still has to spend at Esterhazy. The initial capacity when completed will be about 1 million metric tons, with huge potential to expand over time as demand grows. This project is being built to maintain, a one-mile buffer between existing mine workings and the new mine. However, what we will do is we will leverage surface infrastructure such that we can continue to use those milling facilities at K1 and K2 to make the final product that we sell to our customers. Now, the magnitude and complexity of a shaft project is such that describing it from here is quite difficult. So, we prepared another video that hopefully would give you a real clear look at what we have to do to develop a underground shaft in Saskatchewan. So, again --. (Video Plays) So, that really shows just how complicated sinking a new shaft in Saskatchewan is and why the capital costs are high and why it takes so long, we're taking seven years to build this. However, what we've done is we've assembled the right team of experts and professionals to build this project and we believe we're going to get it done on time safely and on budget. So, hopefully, I've given you a solid overview of our efforts to grow our potash business. In closing, I'd like to say the market for potash holds tremendous potential for Mosaic. Our forecasts predict that robust demand growth over the next decade will have to be met by other -- by a supply growth. And we believe, through our reserves, our capabilities for execution and our capital that we are really well-placed to take advantage of those -- of that growth through our brownfield expansions. So, with that, I would like to thank you. And I'd like to turn the podium over to the person who, when Jim talked about global reach is probably most responsible for that global reach, my colleague, our Senior Vice President of Commercial, Mr. Rick McLellan. RICK MCLELLAN, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, COMMERCIAL, MOSAIC: Thanks, Joc, and thanks to everybody that's here or on the net, listening in to what is going to be, for me, a great pleasure to talk about innovation within Mosaic. We've got a group of people that are focused on making a difference and looking at growing crops in different ways. And I'm real proud to be able to tell their story. They've come a long ways -- we've come a long ways. We are focusing on increasing yields, and it is a great role that we're going to play. So, over the next little while, I'm going to talk to you about how Mosaic is using innovation. It's not one group of Mosaic that makes this happen, frankly, it's about a team of people that have made it happen. And the collaboration within Mosaic, from production through to distribution, through to sales, to working with researchers is very, very positive. It's a very positive story. So, as I look back -- I pinch myself every day. These are exciting times to be involved in agriculture, whether you're in China, whether you're in India, or right here in Florida. And I can honestly say that during the last five years with our focus on looking at growing crops differently, we've learned more about how our products, phosphate and potash work in the soil and in the plants than we have in the previous 25 years I've been in this business. So, armed with this knowledge and other specific crop research that we've done, Mosaic is uniquely positioned to create value for our stakeholders, and we'll accomplish this by developing new products that are going to be focused on increasing yields of grains and oilseeds to meet an ever growing demand for food. Innovation in Mosaic is about the best total solution. Operational excellence and maintaining our position in the cost curve is clearly more than table stakes within Mosaic. And you'll hear Bo describe how we're delivering on this promise with ROIC Works in our phosphate business. For product leadership, I'm going to focus on telling a story about our MicroEssentials phosphate product line, and the success we've had and how it's helped us develop our premium product's focus. Customer intimacy is best described in Mosaic as our Affinity customer relationship management program. Affinity is a global solution for us. It allows clients to access their own orders, shipments and invoices to better manage their own accounts. And this system allows our customer-facing employees to track progress with our key accounts of goals that we set with them. By thinking about our business in this way, we changed our team, our team dynamics and, more importantly, our outcomes. When we began to outline our premium product strategy, we focused on how we could create value for three core stakeholders; growers that would use the product; distributors that would take it to market; and, shareholders that will expect a return on what we're doing. We believe comes in -- with a focus on three strategic drivers. First, it is about improving profitability and financial returns for all stakeholders. Second, it's differentiating Mosaic and our key customers from the competition. And, finally, it's about the development of sustainable products for our business and those stakeholders. Mosaic is focused on delivering products that create value through these three strategic drivers. As we began this journey, we identified the potential needs for nutrients outside of our traditional phosphate and potash products. We clearly identify the needs for sulfur, and two key micronutrients; zinc and boron. Now, different crops require different levels of these nutrients, and we continue to study their interactions with both phosphate and potash. During this journey we've learned quite a few things. One of them specifically is regarding zinc. First, we learned that growers can experience up to a 40% decrease in yields if the soil is deficient in zinc. And as you look across the world, there are wide tracks of land in the Americas, in Africa and in Asia that are deficient in this nutrient. Second, the nutritional quality of food from plants can be negatively impacted by soils that are low in zinc. Recent estimates by the World Health Organization indicate that a lack of zinc -- a zinc deficiency in diets affects over 2 billion people annually, and causes over 800,000 deaths, 450,000 of those are children. So, as we looked at what we're going to do, it starts with a need and we've identified those needs. We began with an understanding that there are synergies and interactions between phosphates and sulfur in this case. As well, we learned that crops requiring different amounts and types of each nutrient, they required at different times in their growth. And the other piece that we picked up is that these newer higher yielding seed technologies require more nutrients than they have in the past. It's very important to understand that approximately 80% of the phosphate and 55% of the sulfur in a crop are removed at harvest in the grain and leave the farm. Thus, more nutrients will be required as crop yields increase now and most definitely in the future. Mosaic has been consistently focused on developing and delivering a pipeline of products to address the needs of crops and soils in multiple geographies since our inception. But innovation is more than just products that we can develop it also applies to the customer service we offer. K-Mag and Pegasus are examples of using innovative marketing efforts to help growers and retailers understand the benefits of our products and unlock the value to their business. As far as developing new products, we use a very structured approach to analyze products as we bring them to market. Currently, we have 11 potential products that are in the developmental pipeline. Three of those products, 1103, 1111, and 2205 are in stage three trials. Stage three trials is where we take the product and place it in a field and see how it reacts in real-world situations, and is probably a key point for us is we go to make decisions on whether that product makes it through to a marketable position. We're expecting that some of these 11 products will come to market in the next three to four years. Successful innovation, though, requires that our customers and their customers understand the value created. I'm going to show you one of the tools that we provided to MicroEssentials distributors to assist them in communicating the benefits and value of MicroEssentials products to their customers. We believe these tools help our distributors differentiate themselves and Mosaic from our competitors. (Video Play) Those type of tools have proved very effective in helping our retailers that work with us take those products to market. But, frankly, more important, this fusion technology is becoming widely accepted as the best method to deliver phosphates, sulfur and key micronutrients to growing crops. And, again, it's all about increasing yields, and that's why people are leaning this way. That, and we've spent plenty of time in production trying to understand how do these interactions allow the nutrients to be more available to the crop. Now, let's move and talk about value. We believe our focus on innovation in products and customer service uniquely positions Mosaic in the crop nutrition space, and results in increased value for growers and for distributors. MicroEssentials provides value in many different ways for growers. In the video, you heard the importance of proper distribution of crop nutrients, and the impact of increased availability of crop nutrient to the roots of a growing crop. But, frankly, improved profitability drives this bus, or should I say the new pickup for these growers. That profitability comes from increasing yields. We've seen yields of corn increase from 3% to 7% depending on the cropping system used. These results are backed by over ten years of yield and research trials. So, we feel very strongly when we sit and talk to our customers about why this works. But I think it's best to understand it by using an example. If you're a 1,000-acre corn grower some place in the US who's got a 200-bushel-per-acre-yield target, you can expect between ten bushels yield increase or a 5% increase from including MicroEssentials in your fertility program. Based upon a corn price, conservative at $5, this provides a net return of $28,000. That's a year of college for a child, or as this group of customers think about it, a 27% return on investment. Yield matters and growers use products at increased yields, and that's why they're asking for MicroEssentials. Distributors find value in several ways. First, distributors that sell MicroEssentials attract new growers to their business, as well as delivering and creating value for their existing customers. Distributors of market MicroEssentials differentiate themselves from their local competitors. And distributors in North America who sell MicroEssentials tell us that they generate between $30 and $60 per ton incremental margin compared to their traditional products. Now, we've got to be clear. We don't track retailer margins, but these are very indicative of what has been reported to us. Now, in Brazil, we do know the distribution value that we're generating from this product, as in most cases we are selling this product directly to large commercial farming operations, through our international distribution group in Brazil. And over the last few years, on over 165 demonstration plots on soybeans, growers increased yields by 3.3 60-kilo sacks of soybeans per hectare versus their current system. Given current prices for soybeans of BRL40 per sack, they're generating BRL132 per hectare. Net of costs they are generating approximately BRL100 per hectare. Not only do they increase yield, but they tell us one of the more important factors is, they also improve planting efficiency by using more concentrated nutrients than in their traditional phosphate package. As a distributor in Brazil, we capture further downstream earnings of approximately $60 a ton, in addition to what we generate at our production facilities here in the US. We're developing other markets around the world, including Argentina and Chile using this same distribution model. And we have research ongoing in both India and China to understand is there a play there. Frankly, after talking about this, we thought it'd be a good idea for us to share with you what our distributor customers and some of their grower customers had to say about Mosaic and our products. (Video Plays) Frankly, listening to what our customers have to say about us makes us feel very proud, and we have a great position to work from. They're clearly telling us it's about increasing yields. It's about helping them develop competitive edges, and it's about delivering on our promise of innovation. These are some tremendous stories. But I think what you also want to understand and need to understand is, what's in it for you. In the face of changing global markets, we're investing and differentiating Mosaic as the leading supplier of phosphate fertilizers. We're investing over $70 million in capacity expansion and changes, so that we can grow the production volume of MicroEssentials. Our standalone premium products capacity exceeds many of our competitors total production capacity. In fiscal year 2012, we expect to invest approximately $19 million across both our phosphates and potash businesses, and researching and developing new products and assisting our customers in marketing those products to their customers the grower farmer. I've got to tell you these investments are making a difference. We have a portfolio of products, from DAP, MAP and MicroEssentials, designed to meet our customer's needs. While our MicroEssentials business is growing, we've also seen our overall business grow in key geographies. Today, MicroEssentials represents approximately 14% of our phosphate sales, and we expect this percentage to grow into the future as we bring on new capacity. In North America, in only a few years of distribution MicroEssentials has captured an approximate 9% of all phosphate products sold. Now that's growing. During fiscal year 2011, we experienced some key milestones. MicroEssentials sales exceeded $500 million, and we had three new product launches, with our MicroEssentials S9, a product specifically developed for our Brazil customer base; MicroEssentials S5, a product that's focused on grain production around the world; and, Nexfos, a feed phosphate product. By the end of 2012, we'll have completed our investment in new MicroEssentials capacity, increasing it to over 2.25 million tons. So the question is, is it worth it? Today, MicroEssentials generates approximately 5% more margin than does DAP, or an approximate $38 per ton of incremental gross margin on a product ton basis. We do incur additional R&D, marketing, technical sales cost of about $10 a ton. But that still leaves a net incremental profit of $28 a ton. Importantly, MicroEssentials helps us overcome one of the growth constraints we have in our phosphate business. We are constrained by our rock resources and, as a result, constrained by our P205 production. Relative to that, we can produce about 15% more finished MicroEssentials product per ton of phosphoric acid and at higher margins. So, our returns on a ton of P2O5 are substantially better than DAP. Frankly, we believe that this investment in innovation is worth it, and we hope we've provided you with some concrete examples of how we're investing in innovation and improving our returns. We are driving results for our growers who use the product. We are creating value for distributors of Mosaic products. And we are delivering improved returns for our shareholders. The bottom line is innovation and we're adding to it. This is a great time to be in this business and a great time to be involved in a company like Mosaic. So, I thank you for your time this afternoon. And it's my pleasure to turn the podium over to Bo Davis, our Senior Vice President of Phosphate Operations, who has been a very strong supporter of getting us to where we are with MicroEssentials. Bo? BO DAVIS, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, PHOSPHATE OPERATIONS, MOSAIC: Thank you, Rick. Welcome to Tampa. This is my home, and home for our phosphate business. Mosaic's phosphate business operates, I'll say, in a very challenging environment. I'm going to review today a process that we've put in place to help us with those challenges. We are the leading producer of phosphate fertilizers as you heard from Jim. This is because of our competitive advantage provided by a rock. We are a low-cost rock source, and to maximize that competitive advantage, we started two and a half years ago a process we call ROIC Works. This is aimed at three things; driving down cost, maximizing return on invested capital, and to keep us in the first quartile of cost worldwide. The program I'll overview today has enabled us to tackle the reduced rock reduction that's been caused by litigation under South Fort Meade mine. We announced a settlement in that lawsuit yesterday evening. We are eager to move through the final steps and get South Fort Meade back up to full production. As I go through the following improvements, the role that litigation played and where are we concentrating our efforts will really be clear to you. For some perspective, the injunction against our South Fort Meade permit have resulted in significant reductions in our rock production. In fiscal year 2011, it impacted us nearly 3 million tons of production against our plan. This year, approximately 2 million tons against our plan. To offset this shortfall, we quickly expanded the scope of our ROIC Works program. We focused on increasing rock production at our Four Corners mine. This effort has been tremendously successful. We'll start at the beginning of 2009. As I was looking on the draft plan, it showed a return on invested capital for phosphate segment of less than 5%. That number is well below our hurdle rate for investments. And it was clear that those numbers were not sustainable for our shareholders or our employees. It was truly for us a call to action. The numbers were clear. We had to improve. We set a course for continuous improvement. It required some whole scale changes of our culture within our operations and certainly with our workforce. After some initial analysis, our phosphate leadership team, we set an aspirational goal of reducing our controllable cost by $100 million over an 18-month period. Knowing that improving those numbers would require a deep dive and much deeper than just controllable cost, we also set our eyes on looking at capital cost. Our operating capital and preliminary goal was to achieve another $300 million reduction. By touching a wide range of operating areas, we focused on reuse of assets from closed facilities, establishing more favorable payment terms from our suppliers and spare parts inventory. Our overarching goal was to ensure that our ROIC was always or at least ideally higher than our weighted average cost of capital, even in down cycles and even when the market prices for our products were at the very lowest. From the very beginning of our process, we intentionally set a broad scope and investigated multiple areas across our operations and support groups. From spare parts inventory to procurement to reducing power consumption at our operations, we look for every opportunity to increase the efficiency and also to reduce our cost. While we knew this program would be a long-term transformation, the numbers demanded immediate results. To create the necessary urgency, we set an expectation again for significant reductions and savings to achieve that within 18 months. As any popular business book will tell you, this type of rapid improvement is really only possible by engaging your workforce in the process. We also recognize that our employees on the frontline would have a better recognition of where the greatest opportunities were going to be. As is often the case, our employees became the largest driver of this effort and they contributed many, and I'll say, most of the ideas in the significant savings. With that thought in place, we really had set on a journey of continuous improvement. The initial scope had more than 20 initiatives. We boil this down from more than 400 ideas from our employees. We optimized our supplier base into certain categories, such as mechanical contractors. And by focusing on our needs, competitive cost, and, of course, the safety record, we developed a bidding process for procurement of goods and services of anything less than $5,000. Our goal prior to that was anything less -- bidding of the process as less than $50,000. So we reduced that significantly. This competition has driven more value and to expand and reduce our time and materials contract for most of our jobs. And support groups -- we drove -- or dove into several areas; travel and entertainment expense, office consolidation, and even the dreaded cell phone usage. To ensure that these efforts delivered value, we established metrics and tracking systems to measure progress against our projections. In two and half years, we have come a long way. I'm extremely pleased with the results. As you can see, as of December 11, we have already recognized $188 million in annual savings. To clear things up for those -- and I see a few of you with your calculators out, not all the savings appear in the income statements yet. In order to track our targets against the annual goals, we team -- or we actually address our savings on a month that we find the savings. For example, if we improve a process in a plant that creates a monthly savings of $100,000, we immediately recognize the annual savings of $1.2 million. Well, you say that's fuzzy math and we're not interested fuzzy math. So, we track the savings after it's booked. If we don't sustain it month after month, we remove the savings. This makes it possible for the team to track the progress toward their annual goals, really, in real time. All of those savings will hit the balance sheet over time. I'll briefly cover three areas highlighted in the slide; rock, energy and workflow. Another important disclaimer is that the majority of our rock savings represent really cost avoidance for Mosaic. While production was hindered due to litigation, any additional rock that we mine in Florida for close to $50 a ton, avoids the need to purchase much more expensive foreign rock. When our production at South Fort Meade mine was disrupted, the high cost of purchased rock really forced us to look for alternatives, and it also -- looked for production within our capabilities with our own mines. Our mines were already at 100% operating factor. And we recognized the urgent need aimed at our efforts at Four Corners, because it was our biggest mine. With the goal there of increasing efficiency and output, we zeroed in five areas highlighted on the slide. While each of the focused areas are important, we placed the top priorities on our dragline utilization. In theory, a dragline can operate 24 hours a day. We have 15 draglines, not all at Four Corners, but between our mines. Reality is certainly different than theory, and no mining operation can sustain 24 hours a day of operating a machine. Our Four Corners mine performed particularly poorly on achieving only of 41% asset utilization rate with their machines. That's about 9.5 hours a day. Compounding the low utilization rate, the mine suffered from suboptimal maintenance workflow, pumping rates and performance management. Through the lean processes, our efforts have really paid off. We've increased our dragline utilization to 65%. We developed optimized schedule that reduce unproductive time for each machine. We've improved the maintenance planning and also reduced downtime related just to routine maintenance alone. Better communication alignment and performance management has resulted in speed losses and less speed losses and better output for every dragline. To achieve full value under dragline improvements, we needed to carry the improvements throughout the rest of our operation. We focused on improvements in this list and our return has been remarkable. Before sharing the results that include both higher production volume and lower cost, I want to go back to one of our original directives. Our goal was to create, first of all, a burning platform and then spread the measles. As we executed these improvements, we increased employee engagement and shifted employee attitudes across all of our locations. As we bring South Fort Meade back on line, we'll apply at what we had learned at Four Corners and Wingate to expect the same similar results there. It's one thing to hear from me; it's more believable when you hear it from our operation. So you can see that improvement yourself, I'm going to next go to a video that includes commentary from Bruce Bodine, our Four Corners mine manager, and many of his frontline employees that you'll see tomorrow. (Video Plays) Hopefully, tomorrow you're going to get an opportunity yourself to meet many of these employees. I will encourage you to ask them, how's our ROIC Works changing your business, changing your life and changing your work? It's worth noting too, also, in our most recent engagement survey. The employees at Four Corners came in at 71%. Now, on a scale, 65% is considered very engaged. This score increased since the previous survey two years ago, and I really believe ROIC Works played an important role in this increase. With production volume the numbers really tell the story. In the last several months, our volumes have grown where our production levels are about 1.2 million tons higher than historical averages. Historically, Four Corners has averaged around 6 million tons a year of output. At fiscal year '11, we are able to mine 7.4 million tons with many of our processes in place. This year, we expect to hit 8.2 million tons. Deficiencies I had spoke of led to the increases noted at the bottom of this chart. In mining, unless you move yards, you're not going to make tons and we're moving about 3.5 million more tons a year material prior to these improvements. That gives us more efficient access to this reserve. And I'll tell you, more tons is always a good story to tell particularly in light of what we've had the last two years with the injunction. But more tons of lower cost production is a great story. It makes Jim smile. We've driven our cash cost per ton at Four Corners down close to $30 a ton and total cost of just around $40 a ton. That's a savings on a full cost of nearly $7 a ton over prior year cost. With 8.2 million tons projected for Four Corners this year, that's a homerun; with a higher volume of output or cost were spread -- across a greater volume of finish drop. The improvements of workflow processes I mentioned earlier deserve a lot of credits for this gain, but we saw an opportunity beyond that. Energy inputs make up a significant portion of our cost for our product, and we zeroed in on this as a high-value target for us. These factors combine to create stellar performance we're now seeing out of Four Corner's operation. And if you step back and look at our phosphate business, it's easy to identify that attacking energy cost is really a great opportunity. Our ROIC Works team put a full court press on our energy consumption. It is making tremendous gains for us. As you may recall and heard earlier, our objective is to achieve self-sufficiency and power and this really predates our ROIC process. But, with the Four Corner's initiatives, this really stepped up our surge in getting after energy. We convert waste heat from our process into electricity. And under the current regulations, we're paid to sell surplus back into the utility grid at only about a third of the price that we pay for power when we're buying power. We're now increasing our power and to build tie lines to our mine from our concentrate plants. With our own power lines, we've significantly reduced our purchase power. Our process also reduced power consumption and our waste energy at manufacturing plants. This leaves us more available to export to our mines. On our mine side, we've successfully reduced our energy, and coupled together with those efforts are helping us really to close that gap on being self-sufficient. Before ROIC Works, we were already producing about 178 megawatts of power. This partially covers our consumption of about 300 megawatts. ROIC works initiatives, alone, have reduced that gap by another 32 megawatts. Beyond this, we've started, or have planned projects to produce another 53 megawatts. This includes a major investment just approved by our Board of Directors recently, of more than $100 million for another generator at our New Wales facility. Give an example, [three] years ago, we paid nearly $110 million for our power bills. This year, we'll come in about $85 million. That's real money. Recognizing the great opportunities that exist in this area, we've established a continuous improvement team focused solely on energy and moving our company toward self-sufficiency. We've recognized at the beginning of this process that there are certain areas also in our operation where improvements would pay a huge dividend. The performance of our maintenance operation in our mines and manufacturing facilities directly input our cost as well as our output. The team has been improving our workflow. I call it wrench time at both our plant and mine maintenance. We have approximately 600 people engaged in maintenance in our operations, out of our 3,300 total employees. This doesn't include many, many other contractors that are also helping us with our maintenance. This group is also an aging workforce. Our goal is to increase efficiency so that when many of these employees retire that we'll not have to replace them. To ensure that the workflow drives productive engaging work for our existing employees, we're reducing both indirect and what we call non-contributory work. We've introduced efficient processes for preparing maintenance task, ensuring the right materials are in place and labors available at the right time and introducing, again, metrics for measuring this labor. Prior to this initiative, we conducted an independent audit of our maintenance and we determined that our wrench time -- physically turning the wrench to get productive work time, was about 30% across all our locations. If you look at eight-hour a day, that's about two and a half hours a day of productive work time where you're physically turning a wrench. Don't be alarmed. That's pretty normal across the US and other parts of the world. World class is about 55%. I'll tell you, at the end of November 2011, we had to change in this workflow process and we are now at a 52%. We measure it quarterly at every location. Some of our locations are up to nearly 60%. The improvements in workflow I just covered has seen widespread adoption, not just in our mines, but at every plant. And better yet, our employees have fully-bought into this process. Every facility now has performance management score cards and daily dialogs to ensure that they're making the targets. To ensure that accountability is embraced, we've placed significant emphasis on communication and feedback. We also cleaned up our procurement and kitting process to ensure that the maintenance crews have the right material, right part, the right time for the task that they're having. As I mentioned earlier, while change is always accompanied by resistance, our focus really was on buy-in, and we think we've achieved that among our maintenance crews. As an example, our River View facility has led the way in improving the workflow process. The employee engagement scores at the facility is now up to 79%. And as I stated early, 65% is considered highly engaged. In addition to a more engaged workforce, these improved workflow processes have reduced our overall maintenance employees, our contractors and significantly lowered our overtime hours. All of these improvements have reduced cost by approximately $1 million a month in our maintenance cost. I said earlier that this was a continuous improvement process. So, what's next? Our focus is to continue transformations already underway at Four Corners, Wingate mines as well as our New Wales plant. We also plan to do further work for the next two years at our remaining facilities so they're at the same point. Our emphasis will always be focused on ensuring we operate reliably and safely. We'll continue to reduce waste at every available opportunity, and use this to create a really -- a more disciplined workforce. At the end of the day, it's our employees that lead the way on this journey. They deserve a tremendous amount of credit for identifying our greatest opportunities, and then adapting to embrace this change we've made. We'll not lose sight of need to recognizing achievements and to keep them engaged. We produce these communications weekly. We email them to everyone in the business, as well as posting them on these screens. We want to ensure everyone recognizes the good work that these teams are doing, and the important role they're playing in our goal, and that's being the most -- or best crop nutrition business in the world. We're excited about our success. Only two and a half years in the process, and we're confident enough now that we've increased our target to an annualized savings of $250 million. We'll achieve this through operational excellence across all of our operations. And as has been the case from day one, our employees will be the key. They're working with us to evolve from a mindset of executing simply a series of initiatives, to really a continuous improvement process today. In the end, this is all about you, investors. We aim to be good stewards of the funds you've committed to our company. Operating savings of $250 million a year represent a significant value to you, I think. While ROIC Works in phosphates has led the way with transformations within Mosaic, our potash operations also have embarked on similar programs. These efforts will cross-pollinate with ours to maximize a value for shareholders and our employees. As you can probably tell, I'm pretty excited about the progress that we've made in this journey. It is a journey -- a continuous journey of process change. Today, I'd like to thank you for allowing me to inform you really about this process change. Next, one of the most important moments, a 15-minute break for you. If you would carefully look at your watches be back in and help to stay on time for the next 15 minutes, thanks. (Break) JOC O'ROURKE: Okay. Everybody is getting back to their seats. Thanks, everyone, for not leaving midway for our presentations. I was asked to do something upbeat after the break, so I'm going to talk about something really exciting, which is brine inflow. We need something that's going to keep everybody awake. Actually, brine inflow is a very important focus area for Mosaic. We've been successfully managing brine inflow for over 25 years. Well, why are we able to do that? First of all, the brine is an area of the mine far away from where our existing workings are, about 4 miles away and quite a bit lower in the mine. So spatially, it's out of the way by quite a bit. The characteristic of the brine is saturated brine from the Dawson Bay, and our own preparation has helped us manage that. So, I'm going to go through a little bit of that and what our costs are from that. But let me start with saying, as we continue to backfill the mine, as we continue to pump up brines from the surface -- or, to the surface, sorry-- as we continue to inject, as we continue to grout with calcium chloride, our cost of managing this brine have gone up quite a bit. But I think what you'll see when we talk about those costs that we've done that -- we really helped mitigate the risk of brine inflow to Mosaic. So, first of all, let me spend some time just bringing you up to speed with what this is all about. First of all, the whole of this Saskatchewan potash industry sits underneath a brine lake or a brine aquifer called the Dawson Bay. It's a saturated sodium chloride aquifer. So, any [line] in Saskatchewan faces the risk of brine inflow because of this Dawson Bay structure. Now, the Dawson Bay is almost fully saturated. And it also contains another chemical, calcium sulfate. Now that's highly advantageous to us. And the reason that is, is one of our things that we've been able to do is we've been able to inject calcium chloride into the aquifer area to form what you can see here in the pictures are gypsum crystals, calcium sulfate crystals. So we can control the saturation of calcium sulfate to form crystals, and those crystals form a grout or cement-type product that helps plug up these cracks and whatnot in the aquifer that have allowed brine to flow into our mine workings. Our mine structure is another advantage that we have. I mentioned earlier the actual brine area is about 4 miles or over 25,000 feet away from the main shaft, and over 150 feet lower in the mines than the main shaft. So, what that means is essentially we have a large reservoir from all the hundreds of miles of workings that we've done in the past that allows -- if there's a little bit of an increase in the inflow, there's a reservoir that hold that volume. Now that was particularly important in the early days where we didn't have the pumping capacity and the preparation that we do today. So, we've historically disclosed our overall cost of brine inflow. And as you can see, the annual costs have risen as we've improved our capabilities and we've enhanced some of the technologies we've used to address brine inflow. So, how is that money being spent? First of all, we've invested heavily in pumping, both pumping from underground up to surface, then storage on-surface to carry that -- hold that brine, and pumping back down underground into an aquifer below the mining workings, complete separate from the mine itself. In 2011, we spent $36 million pumping, storing, and disposing of brine. Sorry, I just want to - can we just hold that for two seconds -- back ? I just want to point out the long role of pumps on the left are all the pumps that pump the brine to surface. So, again, when you talk about the cost, it is all of the equipment that we've installed that allows us to mitigate the risks but also comes at a cost. And then, on the right is the actual storage of the brine on surface. Grouting involves changing the chemical composition, as I said, of the solution to allow the calcium sulfate to precipitate as gypsum. So, what we do is drill into the aquifer, we inject calcium chloride which precipitates and helps plug the cracks or the joints that would be in the geology between the aquifer and the mine level. The cost of that is associated with, of course, drilling a lot of holes to put the solution down there and all the surface infrastructure it takes to work with that. And if you look at the picture on the right, what we're doing today, which is the next sort of step in technology, is we're using a similar type technology as being used in natural gas where we're drilling horizontal holes. And what horizontal holes allow us to do is cover a lot more ground in the aquifer regions so that we can pump grout over a much larger area. That's cost a fair bit of money developing this technology, but we're looking at it from a perspective that at some point, it may offer a long term solution to this issue. And, again, when we look at the cost of grouting, a lot of that is simply the surface the infrastructure, pumping, cement storage, drilling, batch mixing, et cetera. In 2011, we spent $48 million on grouting. That bill is exactly what it sounds like. What we do is we take salt from the tailings or salt mixed concrete, and we pump it in to avoid areas underground. And really, what that does is just like in a hard rock type mining environment, it stabilizes the ground so that the cracking and what not that causes the inflow is supported and can happen, basically. In 2011, we spent $44 million on backfilling the mine for long support and making sure that we improve the conditions of that mine. The next aspect that we think is critical to our brine management is actually the money that we spend on our monitoring activities. We spend a lot of money on doing microseismic work. The microseismic work sends microseismic signals underground and starts understanding what geology is based on this microseismic reflections, just like they do in the oil and gas industry. So, we're using the same technology. What that allows us to do is pinpoint where there's damage, where there's cracking or anything like that. We also use a lot of monitoring to tell us what is the saturation level of the brine. And where that's important, as this graph show is the solubility of gypsum really makes a difference. The solubility of gypsum is much lower as the concentration of sodium chloride goes up. So, the fact that we have a very saturated solution makes that gypsum precipitation a lot more effective. And any of you who followed the industry -- the other aspect of monitoring the saturation -- anybody who's followed the industry knows that different inflow came in that can be very damaging. It does a lot of erosional and corrosional type damage to mine very quickly. We've been very fortunate, or Saskatchewan is very fortunate that the Dawson Bay is a highly saturated brine area. In 2011, we spent $24 million on doing saturation monitoring and other monitoring work like that. Just to make sure we knew exactly what was going on in the areas where we're dealing with this. So, why have we been so successful in managing the brine? I think it comes down to both the natural things we have had, but also the preparation and the risk mitigation that Mosaic has undertaken. The natural elevations of the mine mean we have a large natural reservoir that we use to collect brine and dampen the impacts of instantaneous flow changes. The saturation of chlorides in the Dawson Bay and the presence of sulfate in the Dawson Bay. The calcium sulfates are what allow for the gypsum to be precipitated. Those have allowed us to be successful. But from our perspective as well, we have invested heavily in making sure that we have the pumping capacity, that we have the grouting capacity, that we have the storage capacity on surface, and that we have the disposal capacity to make sure that we can manage these inflows and the variability that that entails over the long period of time. So, that said, we expect the costs are going to remain high. We see in the 2013 or fiscal of 2012, sorry -- we will have that are in the range of $170 million. Now some of that is going to developing this technology, and doing cutting-edge research on what we can do better, but it's going to cost us money on the long term. Having said that, we still believe Esterhazy is a fantastic ore body and is a fantastically competitive project would easily in the mid-range of the world cost curve. So, I think we've done a good great job over 25 years managing this brine inflow, and I believe we'll be able to do that for a long time to come. So, thank you. Now, I'd like to introduce the man of the hour. The guy that is responsible for our settlement at South Fort Meade. Our Executive Vice President of Legal and General Counsel, Mr. Rich Mack. RICH MACK, EVP, GENERAL COUNSEL AND CORPORATE SECRETARY, MOSAIC: Well, good afternoon. And, thank you, Joc. Appreciate those comments and I will say that there was a team of people that brought this good news to us and in the interest of full disclosure. Before I start my comments, I want to let you know that I don't have any snappy videos like Joc, and Rick and Bo but if I were to think about it, a good Judge Judy episode or perhaps, People's Court might be in order. So, I will remember that for next time. So, I'm very happy to be with you here today. Particularly -- and I think it's a good timing given the very good news that we had in yesterday's announcement relative to South Fort Meade. What I wanted to do is I wanted to share some information with you and provide some inside insights, if you will, with respect to Mosaic's mine permitting activities. And, of course, given yesterday's announcement, I wanted to shed some perspective on the proposed settlement on our South Fort Meade litigation. Permitting has been a topic of considerable interest during the last year or so given the recent challenges at South Fort Meade. And I want to be able to provide some insights that I believe will provide you some comfort that Mosaic has the people, the processes and a strategy to ensure that we successfully obtain all of our future permits that we need here in the State of Florida. Let there be no doubt, Mosaic is the preeminent phosphate producing in the world today, and we fully expect that this will continue to be the case in the decades ahead of us. So, before I get to South Fort Meade, let me set the table with some baseline comments relevant for Mosaic's permitting activities. First, I'm sure you are all aware that we are a very important commercial enterprise in the State of Florida and in the local communities where we operate. We meet with a lot of people in our permitting activities in various daily activities. And during our frequent engagement with local state and federal policy makers, regulators and elected officials, people get the importance of what we do. They appreciate our mission and they agree that Mosaic has a very compelling story to tell. And in that story are statistics that include over 100 years, a century of successful mining experience in Central Florida. How many organizations can say something similar to that, where an economic engine and rural and financially challenged counties, we provide fantastic jobs for thousands of people in these areas? Of course, we're very important to US agriculture and to US trade. And we have the ability to influence a highly desirable region of the State of Florida, owning currently between 250,000 acres and 300,000 acres of land. We're a significant and proactive corporate citizen, with a long proven track record of success. There is no doubt that our DNA is firmly embedded in this state. Now, no question, we are a surface mining operation and we have temporary impacts on our land in Florida. However, we also have a very strong track record of success of impressive reclamation that is continuously improving through innovation and experience. Over the years, we have invested significant sums of money, your money, our shareholders' money to acquire the valuable reserves that we own today. And we have every right and every expectation of being able to responsibly mine these reserves in the future. And as a surface miner, we all need to recognize that there are may be a small minority who may have different interests or perspectives than we do, and we respect this. And we're certainly interested and able to engage with them, but this will simply be a fact of life. So, turning South Fort Meade, our proposed settlement which is subject to final approval by the district court in Jacksonville, will put an end to the now year and a half plus period of litigation that has bounced around the federal courts. The general terms of this settlement, which we believe are a principled and reasonable of trade off versus the alternative of continuing to ride this matter through the courts is comprised of a few central commitments. First, we have agreed that we will protect roughly 130 acres of land continuing reserves that Mosaic otherwise would entitled to mine. As many of South Fort Meade is a large property comprised of approximately 10,800 acres, nearly 3,200 of which are already preserved under our permit. This settlement will allow Mosaic to promptly access the remaining 7,000 plus acres in the decade to follow. Second, we've agreed to contribute a 4,200-acre parcel of land called Peaceful Horse Ranch. Peaceful Horse Ranch is an environmentally attractive property located in DeSoto County where the Peace River and Horse Creek converge. This property became available in a foreclosure sale in December of last year, and Mosaic, recognizing its importance, promptly acted and acquired the property. Peaceful Horse Ranch was a key component in this settlement and we're happy to work with the plaintiffs, in this case, to protect for future generations as a Florida State Park. And, finally, we have agreed to various other commitments that do not require substantial monetary expenditures but relate to discreet requests for environmental projects, as well as processes to provide additional information such as a monitoring program and an independent panel, who will receive information about -- and data about Mosaic's mining activities. We hope that this will further advance our relationships with these interested stakeholders in Florida. So, logical questions that I've heard after the announcement of the settlement include, why now, and are there any adverse impacts in the future? So, let me try to address those. First, this settlement provides certainty. A certainty as to timing, cost and outcome. With the various twists and turns in this litigation, it removes a cloud that has simply hovered longer than we expected or desired. We certainly respect the American judicial process, it is fair to say though that this case has been grinding away far long enough. And we believe that gaining certainty once and for all is of value to Mosaic and our shareholders. Second, I think everyone knows when you have a multifaceted dispute, with multiple constituencies who have many different interests and perspectives in mind, it takes time to bring this matters to conclusion. This was a complex case with multiple parties and multiple interests. Several plaintiffs, Mosaic, the Army Corps of Engineers, the US Department of Justice, to name a few. We engaged in a dialogue with all of these stakeholders for the better part of a year. And with oral arguments on our appeal scheduled for early March, perhaps, that was an incentive for all to bring this matter to a final conclusion. Third, I also want to emphasize that, while we have settled this matter, we have a strong conviction that our South Fort Meade goes above and beyond and meets all applicable requirements under federal law. But in the end, it became not who is right, but what is right for Mosaic, for our employees and for our shareholders. Simply put, a window of opportunity arose to bring this matter to a principled conclusion and we believed it was in everyone's best interest to do so. Finally, before I transition to Mosaic's future, let me conclude by saying that South Fort Meade is a very specific and unique case, with a unique sequence of events. In reviewing the South Fort Meade litigation, I would caution not to lead to unfounded conclusions about Mosaic's future permits. Those permits will each have their own specific set of facts and on properties that may or may not have similarities to the South Fort Meade track. As is the case with virtually every permit, the facts and science will ultimately carry the day. And Mosaic has every confidence in the world that we will successfully obtain all of our permits that we may need in the future. So, happily, let's now turn the page and look ahead at Mosaic's current and future mines in Florida. This maps shows where our current future mining operations are located in the Bone Valley. Ona and DeSoto which are depicted in the lighter green color will be new mines that eventually replace the capacity at Four Corners and South Fort Meade when they ultimately mine out. Ona and DeSoto will be part of the area-wide environmental impact statement, which is well underway, along with our Wingate East Project, which will extend our Wingate mine. In terms of future, major permit requirements, let me share three observations. First, the resolution of South Fort Meade provides welcome flexibility for Mosaic. We have ample time before permits for Ona, DeSoto and Wingate East are required. Certainly, beyond these three, we will always have a variety of permits in process, smaller parcels, various modifications. But in terms of future major permits, this slide shows the general time horizon. Second, in connection with the Ona and DeSoto mines, there is a sense of urgency on our part to obtain these permits as early as possible this decade so that we can confidently make capital deployment decisions which are in the hundreds of millions of dollars to build our beneficiation plants and related infrastructure that will be needed in connection with these mines. As you know, these are very sizeable investments and take several years to complete. As a result, we estimate that permits will be needed by 2015 or so, so that no ambiguity will exist when these significant investment decisions are made. And, third, I can assure you that we are aggressively working on each of these major permits right now. In fact, the permit applications for each of these mines have already been filed with the Army Corps of Engineers, are included in the area-wide EIS, and are being concurrently, not sequentially processed as we speak. Turning now to the topic of the area-wide Environmental Impact Statement. In early 2011, the Army Corps of Engineers began work on the EIS -- area-wide EIS for the phosphate Bone Valley region in Florida. The area-wide EIS is important because the army because the Army Corps has indicated that they want this study to be completed before issuing any additional significant permits for phosphate companies in the Bone Valley. The map here shows the geographic region that is in scope for the area-wide EIS. And the goal of this study, of course, is to assess cumulative impacts -- impacts of mining past, present and future -- so that the regulatory community can be better informed in its permitting decisions. In advancing the area-wide EIS, the Army Corps retained an independent environment consultant to assist in performing its assessment. And Mosaic engages regularly, in communications with the Army Corps and the environmental consultant when requested by the Army Corps periodically throughout this process. We also have regularly scheduled update meetings to discuss questions that might arise, scheduling and other matters. In the world permitting, environmental assessments are part of nearly every permit that applicants apply for, including Mosaic. And we believe that in area-wide EIS, properly and timely conducted can of great value to Mosaic, as it will allow further streamlining of our future permits, including Ona, DeSoto and Wingate. This is a very high priority for our organization today. In terms of timing, this slide show some of the milestone dates for the area-wide EIS. The current status is that the area-wide is being drafted. It's intended to be issued in draft form by the middle part of 2012, with final issuance currently scheduled for the end of this calendar year. This pie chart shows public comments received during the area-wide EIS public scoping meetings that were held in March of 2011. During this process, over 3,000 public comments were submitted to the Army Corps and I think the results are worth touching on. First, over 91% of the public comments were supportive of the phosphate industry and continued mining. Approximately, 1% were unsupportive or generally concerned about the impacts of the phosphate industry. The remaining 8% were either neutral or had mixed feelings about phosphate mining. These results tie in to my introductory remarks on the importance of phosphate mining in this state and the communities in which we operate. We will work hard to ensure that we continue to have this overwhelming support in the future. Now, let me share with you a few success stories relating to Mosaic's permitting activities, some of our major projects that we have recently completed, and our efforts on the legislative and regulatory front in telling the compelling Mosaic story. Mosaic has a strong track record of success. This slide entitled century of success contains a couple of salient points. Very notably, every permit that Mosaic has applied for in its history ultimately has been received. Some take longer than others, but in the end, we get our permits. And just as we're starting the spring training season here in Florida, that's a pretty remarkable batting average. Those of us from Minnesota are hoping that Joe Mauer has similar success this season. We engage in surface mining followed by sophisticated reclamation. In connection with all of our permits, the public has the ability to engage through public comment or permitting challenges. And as an example, we've been challenged four times in our history on state ERP permits. This would be the primary state permit as contrasted to a federal permit that we have resolved with the Army Corps of Engineers. And on each of these challenges, we have successfully prevailed every time. In the end, again, facts and science carry the day. Regulators understand what they are doing, they shouldn't be second-guessed, and we expect this to be the case in the future. Here is a list of several permitting successes that we've experienced in the last year or so, and these are also important to Mosaic. While South Fort Meade has received most, if not all of the headlines, there is a lot of good work ongoing within Mosaic. We do not overlook the importance of the smaller incremental permits that are important to our operations. So, in wrapping up my comments, let me leave you with the following. First, Mosaic has a vibrant and engaged permitting organization that is well prepared to ensure that our permit applications are processed timely, approved on reasonable terms, and appropriately defensible from future challenges. Second, our permitting success in the future will require us to competently tell Mosaic's compelling story to our public officials, the regulatory community and others. We know that those who are responsible for making the permitting decisions need to have a deep understanding of what Mosaic does, how we do it, what is true, and even more importantly, what is not true. In the last several years, we have significantly increased our emphasis on connecting with these individuals and agencies who have responsibilities relating to the processes or regulations that apply to our permits. This includes planning commissions and boards of county commissioners, state permitting agencies, the Army Corps, the EPA, the Fish and Wildlife, the Department of Interior, Department of Agriculture -- I could go on -- very sophisticated outreach program to ensure that people understand what we do. Third, we will continue to work with interested stakeholders to build their trust, understand their concerns, and see if and how we might be able to accommodate them, all while being an exceptional corporate citizen in our communities. And, finally, if needed, and hopefully only as a last resort, we will protect our rights. We've invested sizeable sums of money with the expectation that we will have the right to responsibly mine these phosphate reserves, and we will vigorously defend our rights in the future should there be a need to do so. So, with that, I thank you for your kind attention, and I'm happy to introduce my friend and colleague, Mosaic's Chief Financial Officer, Larry Stranghoener. LARRY STRANGHOENER, EVP AND CFO, MOSAIC: Good afternoon, everybody. Thank you for your time and attention today. Jim started this afternoon by laying out his vision for Mosaic and the core capabilities that will get us there. Joc, Rick and Bo then outlined our growth, innovation and execution capabilities. Joc again, and Rich talked about how we're successfully addressing a couple of issues. My job as the concluding presenter is to bring this all together and talk about financial implications, and to relate Jim's vision and our core capabilities to the value we can create for shareholders. To start, it's important to remind you that the crop nutrient business, in fact, any agricultural business is cyclical, and we don't see foresee this changing. The majority of our product is sold as a global commodity, influenced by both global grain and oilseed prices, as well as the global supply and demand characteristics for each crop nutrient. This chart shows another commodity, oil, which remains cyclical, but where demand growth and the need for increased supply have driven prices to higher levels over time. Similarly, in crop nutrients and other natural resources experiencing secular demand growth, pricing must reach levels to incent new investment for supply to bring markets back into balance. We have reached a tipping point in demand for crop nutrients where new supply is needed and investments are being made. The other line on the chart shows MOP pricing over time. After remaining flat for many years due to government incented over-supply, demand has now caught up with and is outstripping supply. This has lead to strong price signals, encouraging new supply growth this time driven by economics. Prices required to incent new supply to balance demand are ever increasing. For example, today, our estimate for the at-the-mine price required to incent new Greenfield potash mines is around $600 per ton. Our estimate to bring a new phosphate production varies with the cost of raw materials. Using current sulfur and ammonia prices. We estimate an integrated producer would need prices above $600 per ton to generate a 10% return. We believe our industry will continue to cycle up and down, but with higher highs and higher lows as the world strive to produce sufficient amounts of grains and oilseed. To be sure, we are currently seeing near term pressure in potash prices and lower global demand, as India wrestled with subsidy issues and North American distributors cautiously avoid holding unnecessary inventory. As a result, we are reducing our third quarter potash volume guidance range from 1.2 million to 1.5 million tons to 1.0 million to 1.2 million tons. Our third quarter potash price and phosphate volume and price guidance ranges remain the same. Even so, we believe these are short-term issues that do not diminish the favorable long-term secular trends. And, while this vitality may demand increase financial flexibility and operational adaptability, the cornerstones of increasing shareholder value remain the same. Those cornerstones can be summarized as free value drivers; our ability to grow revenue, our ability to expand margins and our ability to deploy capital wisely. These are the three areas I want to talk to you about. While prices have the biggest on our top line, Mosaic is driving revenue growth beyond the impact of higher pricing. We expect margin expansion to come as a result of economies of scale, efficiency gains, a shift in our business export potash, and a shift to higher margin premium products. Together, we plan for revenue growth and higher margins to drive stronger cash flow. Deploying this cash or capital stewardship is the last critical piece I'll talk about this afternoon. In the long term, effective capital allocation is the most critical variable in creating shareholder value. We are investing a large amount of capital to grow our potash business. Growing our phosphate business would require strategic investments. Investments will only be made if we believe they have a risk return profile that allows us to create value for our shareholders. Now, turning to each value driver starting with revenue growth, while pricing cycles will have their effects over the long-term Mosaic will drive revenue through potash capacity expansion and an increasing proportion of premium products. Acquisitions may play a role particularly in growing our phosphate business. But any deal would be subject to a rigorous and disciplined risk return analysis in comparisons with other capital allocation opportunities. Our potash expansion program is expected to be the largest driver of revenue growth. You've seen the detail resulting in a 40% increase in capacity over the next five years. Expansions combined with the reversion of the Esterhazy tolling agreement tons are expected to materially add to our ability to our ability to grow both our top and bottom lines. This chart shows potential revenue growth represented by capacity growth assuming constant operating rates and revenues per ton equal to 2011 values, and without factoring in any cyclical impacts, you see substantial revenue growth potentially. Under these assumptions, potash revenues would grow by over 15% annually for the next two years, and an 8% annual rate over the next five years. While we can't control the cycle, we can control our destiny and position the Company with the capacity to take advantage a long-term demand growth. This industry is generally comprised of large, strong, and disciplined producers. We know the value of the resources we control, and we know how to optimize value in environments with short-term demand changes while pursuing our mission for the long term. While demand for potash is likely to decline modestly this year due to the slow start, we expect record global potash shipments in 2013 and 3% to 3.5% annual growth over the next decade. We are committed to capturing that growth and we are investing to do so. While our best source of new revenue growth is our potash expansion program, we also have opportunities to grow phosphate revenue. Note first that phosphate is a margin business. Phosphate prices often reflect changes in raw material cost. And without consideration of margins, both prices and revenues are meaningless in determining economic profit or shareholder value added. With that understanding, our premium products have a material benefit in light of our current operating constraints. As Rick explained well, our ability to grow our phosphate business is limited by our phosphate rock resources. By leveraging our phosphoric acid capacity, however, we can generate more revenue. As shown on the chart, our MicroEssentials products not only have higher revenue for finished product ton, but we can produce more tons with our rock resources. In addition, our premium products have historically generated higher margins, which brings me to the next value driver, margin expansion. For us, margin expansion can come from growth-driven economies of scale operational excellence initiatives growth of our higher margin potash business, and growth of our innovative premium products, all topics you've heard discussed today. However, before I get into Mosaic's specifics, I'd like to talk briefly about the phosphate industry to provide some current context for our margin expectations. Over the past decade, the phosphate industry has become much more disciplined. A number of producers that were focused on short-term cash flow are no longer in existence. The merger IMC Global and Cargill Crop Nutrition to create Mosaic led to improved financial stability. Not long after our creation, we shutdown on economic production. The emergence of OCP as a strong commercially oriented merchant rock producer has also played a role. Note that one-third of the producers in this industry are non-integrated, meaning they purchase phosphate rock. Current merchant rock prices are about $180 per ton and 1.7 tons are required for each ton of DAP. In contrast, rock costs for an integrated producer with its own rock mines are $50 to $70 per ton with Mosaic at the low end of that range. The most straight-forward way to look at industry margins is to look at the stripping margin, which takes into account both product prices and cost. The stripping margin for an integrated producer is the price per ton. In this case, published FOB Tampa DAP prices less raw material cost at published prices required to make a ton of DAP. What stripping margins have integrated producers generated over the past decade? Again, you can see the cyclicality, but overtime stripping margins are expanding as demand drives the need for new capacity. To maximize margins and generate value across the cycle, we've established a minimum target of maintaining our bottom quartile position on the industry cost curve. We plan to do this while offering premium products and service. The more we can differentiate ourselves from a marginal high-cost producer, the greater our margins will be, all else equal. Bo gave a number of examples that are focused on operational excellence. We achieved $188 million in annual run rate savings by the end of calendar 2011 and are targeting, as Bo said, $250 million by the end of fiscal 2015. This is not expected to all fall to the bottom line, as inflationary pressures on other energy labor and process chemical cost are expected to continue, but it will help us maintain our highly competitive cost position. The last topics I want to cover on phosphate margins are Mosaic's specific events; opportunities and decisions that could have a material impact. Effects of the South Fort Meade permanent litigation lowered 2011, excuse me -- 2011 margins by about four percentage points, a figure which would have been much higher, but for the great job our phosphates team did in mitigating the impact of this litigation. This reflects higher mining costs at South Fort Meade, and rock purchase that would have been avoided if South Fort Meade had been fully operational. Now that this matter is successfully resolved, we would expect to see margin improvements in this range. An increasing proportion of MicroEssentials versus DAP and MAP should positively impact margins. As Rick indicated, MicroEssentials margins are approximately five percentage points higher than for DAP. If we had double the proportion of this premium products in 2011 versus the 1 million tons sold, it would have benefited margins by two percentage points. Note, though, as Rick did that SG&A cost are higher for this product line. Lastly, we are evaluating complete backward integration in ammonia. Today, as you know, we produce about one-third of the ammonia we need to produce phosphate fertilizer. We are completing a detailed feasibility study and expect to make a final decision by the end of this calendar year. If we had been fully self-sufficient in ammonia in fiscal 2011, we estimate our margins would have been 17 percentage points higher than reported -- 17 percentage points higher. Before I move on to talk about potash margins, let me just conclude. We believe the phosphate industry offers very attractive opportunities in an industry with economic characteristics that have substantially improved over the past decade. And because of our market position, our size and scale, our operational capabilities, our innovation, we believe we are one of the best positioned companies to generate shareholder value in this industry, and we have very specific catalysts that have the potential to drive short and medium-term margin gains. Potash has significantly different industry characters than phosphate; there are fewer players, fewer global reserves; there are limited raw material inputs beyond the oar; and, the industry cost is fairly flat, even so, we are focusing on cost and operational effectiveness. For example, we are using our operational capabilities to a large complex capital investment agenda in potash. And after several years, I'm delighted to say our program continues to remain on budget and on time. Also, we are rolling out a targeted operational excellence initiative, similar what Bo described in phosphates to increase our recovery rates and to lower cost. We expect to generation $200 million in annual run rate savings by the end of 2013. Our global cost position is hampered by $170 million to $180 million in annual expenses from managing brine inflow, as you've heard Joc explained. This cost is expected to continue into the foreseeable future. Even with these costs, we remain close to the industry median and costs per ton. Our expansion plans and results in economy of scales are not only expected to increase revenue, but also positively impact margins. Faster growth in potash -- a high margin business -- is expected increase overall margins as potash becomes a larger portion of our business mix. In addition to our aggressive plans to grow through expansion and our opportunity to significantly enhance margins, we have a large store of capital to manage. In our industry, as in other natural resource industries, capital allocation is critical to creating shareholder value. We view our balance sheet as just that a store of value. What we do with this capital and our philosophy around capital deployment is another way for us to create substantial shareholder value. We have communicated our balance sheet targets in the past. Given the cyclical nature of this business, we target $1.5 billion in liquidity, including our $750 million largely unused line of credit. Note that we currently hold over $3 billion in cash and cash equivalents. We target an investment grade rating. Our targeted rating combined with our current load debt balances implies at least $5 billion to $6 billion in additional debt capacity. Combined with excess liquidity, we currently have accessed over $7 billion in capital. With this capital, we want to maintain flexibility to take advantage of opportunities in the market beyond our potash expansion investments, which we expect to fund with cash from operations. As I've already noted, we are considering allocating capital to additional ammonia production. And we told you we're continuing to look for additional sources of phosphate rock including the possible expansion of our Miski Mayo joint venture and other strategic opportunities. And, of course, we have a track record of returning cash to shareholders to dividends and share repurchases, which I'll discuss in more detail soon. Today, I'd like to go beyond our balance sheet targets and previously discussed opportunities, and give you some additional insight into our decision making process. While we are always looking for appropriate strategic opportunities, you should feel comfortable that we are good stewards of the capital entrusted to us. If we cannot generate acceptable return of proposed projects over the long term, we will give the money back. Here's an historical look at ROIC with reconciliations available on our website. Note that it took us a couple of years to get our feet under us after our creation in 2004. And while returns since 2008 reflect the cyclical nature of the business, ROIC for four of the past five periods exceeded 15%. With the current weighted average cost of capital of 10% we have created substantial value for our shareholders. Today, of course, the majority of our capital is going to our product expansion program. Through the second fiscal quarter of 2012, we've invested almost $1.8 billion in this initiative. This spring, the first material capacity will become available, as Joc presented earlier. These brownfield expansions have very attractively turns even at significantly lower at-the-mine prices than we see today, as noted on the slide. For simplicity sake, this chart leaves prices constant in perpetuity, and only considers projects already approved by our Board of Directors. We have also assumed that we'll continue to be on-time and on-budget, and that we will achieve our volume projections. Lastly, we've assumed a consistent 90% operating rate. You can see that this initiative should create substantial value. For you to have confidence in our capital stewardship when looking at new opportunities, I think it's important that you understand our process. For each proposed project, we determined a hurdle rates based on both our cost of capital and the specific investment risk. In order words, we are not just looking for acceptable returns, but we are looking for returns appropriate for the risk we are taking. Our current base hurdle rate is 11.8%. Country and external risk factors include currency and political risk, and range from zero for United States to 4.8%. Project risk related to new technology or something we don't have experienced with ranges from zero to 9.7%. These risk premia are added to the base rate. Because this is a cyclical industry, we evaluate multiple scenarios to assess an investment. Each of our experts, inputs and distribution, the key model variables. Using those distributions, we create a distribution of possible outcomes. Our decision then becomes one of analyzing the probabilities of meeting or exceeding our hurdle rate. In this business, history has proven that the winners accumulate capital during up cycles and take advantage of opportunities when values are compressed in down cycles. Our process helps prevent near-sightedness and ensures a focus on fundamentals to maximize long-term returns. If we can't find opportunities to invest and create value, the best stewardship requires that we return capital shareholders. We are certainly been willing to do this with regular dividends, a special dividend and a large share buyback. As Jim noted, we are pleased to announce today a substantial increase in our regular dividend rate. Beginning with the next declaration date in April, we will raise our annual dividend of 150% to a rate of $0.50 per share. Our goal is to remain competitive with a committed sustainable dividend. As long-term secular trends play out, we would expect this to result in dividend increases overtime. Beyond our regular dividend -- and this is very important -- remember that restrictions from the Cargill transaction effectively preclude us from repurchasing any additional shares until May of 2013. Also remember that lock up restrictions on 129 million Mosaic shares held by the trust and certain Cargill shareholders, begin to expire in the summer of 2013 in three separate tranches over three years. We believe that patients with our balance sheet now may pay off handsomely for investors later if we maintain flexibility to repurchase some amount of those 129 million shares. So, where do we think our initiatives can take us over the next five years? Going back to the value driver model I started with and using simplifying assumptions, which ignore cyclical impacts, favorable secular trends and presume an all else is equal world, here's the picture. We believe we can generate annual revenue growth of 3% to 6% annual earnings growth of 6% to 10% reflecting revenue growth and margin improvement, and returns on invested capital of 15% to 20%. As some of you know, I started my career as an investment analyst. I have a CFA. I know a good investment story when I see one. This is a good investment story. My colleagues and I are excited, energized and thrilled to be here, and look forward to the future very much. With that, we're going to take a brief pause while we reset the stage to take questions in the Q&A session to follow. Thanks again. (Break) Questions and Answers LAURA GAGNON: Welcome back, everyone. We're now going to get started with our Q&A session, and this is the highlight. So, we have mics on either side of the room. So, please just raise your hand. And when you want -- when you get acknowledged for a question, please state your name for the webcast. DON CARSON, ANALYST, SUSQUEHANNA FINANCIAL: Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Jim, on the US, fiscal second quarter call you talked demand deferral not demand disruption. Spring is coming -- certainly, it seems closer here in Tampa. But we've seen matching pricing start to move up nicely. But we've seen phosphate and potash, they're sluggish. You just took down your volume guidance for the quarter. So, I guess the question would be we're going to have a robust spring, margins are good, you see a move up in P&K, or do you think that they're more price elastic than nitrogen? Kind of interested in your near term demand outlook. And you talked about reluctance of dealers to stock until they have a former order. But then you yourselves appear to be contributing to that by willing to floor plan inventory. So, I'm wondering if you could talk about that whole policy as well. JOC O'ROURKE: Okay, Don, I'll take the first part of your question. I'm going to ask my colleague Rick to answer the second part about the warehouse. The outlook is just that. We've got great green prices, farmers are doing well, we have super balance sheets. Farmers are going to have a capacity and a will to buy. I was with the group of dealers -- [formal] group of dealers last week. And they're frustrated with farmer's intentions or referral of purchasing. Yet, from the experience they've had with their seed purchases. They're saying they're having outstanding seed purchases, outstanding fertilizer -- or Ag chemical and fungicide commitments. And they expect the fertilizer will come, but there's a sense well there's been some curtailments by the producers that there's just maybe a little weakness on the producer's part. And I think they'll be surprised. When the season comes, it will come quickly -- not much frost in the ground, not much snow covered at this point. We can get a big snow storm in March. And we're not likely to see any flooding on the Mississippi. It could be early and wide open spring and the flood gate open up. When that happens, and a couple of things internationally the farmers start buying, then all concern about price I think is behind us. They're just going to want to be sure they get it to the field and get it on to the farms. The other wild car is we're trying that in potash. And I think we will see something. And I believe, and certainly the first calendar quarter, and it could be sooner rather than later that they're going to make a purchase. And when that starts locking up, it will just begin to roll. So, in the case phosphate, I think there's more upside than downside on the phosphate pricing, on the potash pricing. I think there are some upside. We haven't got our leagues under on the potash. But if China does come in, then I think we're off to the race and everybody is going to want it the same time. And once it gets going, it's going to be hard to hold it back. Rick, would you just talk about -- the question Don had was, are we making it too easy for dealers to differ? RICK MCLELLAN: We've had that discussion ourselves, Don, and so [let me] break it in. On potash, we most definitely haven't changed much of what we've done in the past. Potash has always been a product moved to warehouse and then people buy out of the warehouse is when markets are slower. So, that's really not changed. It's acting like it always will. And when the market starts to move, the product will be in place. On phosphates, we have changed a bit of our model. Instead of shipping product offshore to lower netback markets, we've kept it back home. And we want to make sure we build a strong base in North America. We feel we've done that. And so, with some of the things because we've changed how we go into market, people are stuck and have had to react. People that make big bets on buying inventory and moving product in have found that we've got the agreement with the dealer tied up. We're using his space. And, frankly, it's allowed to improve our position in the markets in North America, as well as get a lot of flexibility in our production plans or guys like Bo to be able to move production around. It's not perfect when markets stop things changed, but we feel very comfortable in the process. DON CARSON: Would it be better off having a storage capacity rather than (inaudible)? RICK MCLELLAN: So the question is, so people can get it is, would we be better to build more warehouse capacity rather than putting it into [bins]? That's one potential future plan that we'll probably take a look at. But it's not one way or the other. In our mind, it's how do you utilize space that's going to be there because if you have a warehouse and you wait, you could have the same problem with people that make big bets and there isn't space there. And so, we give some, we take some away. But we are quite comfortable with what we're doing today. RICH MACK: The gentleman at the back. EDLAIN RODRIGUEZ, ANALYST, LAZARD: Edlain Rodriguez, Lazard. Quick --, this is for the legal eagle. In terms of South Fort Meade, what's the next step? I mean, when do you go back to court to try to get the court approval, and how long do you think that's going to take? And also -- just for Jim, in terms of, like, the other mines, I mean you have been able to increase the output from the other mines. Will you continue to do so once SFM comes back, or are you going to scale back on that? RICK MCLELLAN: Sure. Thanks, Edlain. In terms of timing on South Fort Meade, I would estimate anywhere from a reasonable time horizon would be, say, 15 to 25 days. What needs to happen is the jurisdiction of this matter is currently lodged at the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. And there are a couple of things that we need to do to go up and down and ensure that Judge Adams in Jacksonville is going to approve the settlement. So call it 20 days, plus or minus, would be a reasonable time horizon. JIM PROKOPANKO: Bo, I'm going to ask you to answer the question as well as part of that. I think it would be helpful for you to understand how quickly we can get the draglines working. So, Bo, if you would comment on that. And then, what is your thinking about recalibrating other mines -- the ones in our entire production, what are you going to do going forward? BO DAVIS: As Rick said, once the judge get through with the order and we have complete ability to run our mines, we think within a week that we can have one of our two operating draglines running. And as we were sitting in an area that was pretty contained, we call it a phase two area, (inaudible) that's what we were limited to earlier. We now have the whole South Fort Meade reserve that we can mind. So, we're going to take advantage, really, at our long-term mine plan and go ahead and move the second dragline that's there, which will take about six weeks to get into an active mind for a long term efficient mine plan. So, first machine approximately a week after the judges are complete with the order and we have full ability. And then about six weeks later, we think we're in full production back in South Fort Meade. As far as some recalibration back at our mine site, I think the only jigging that we'll do, really, would be at Four Corners where we'll pull back some of the pressure. We've pushed extremely hard there. We do not want to lose the efficiencies that we've learned during this process. We picked up at Wingate mine from a less than 1 million ton a year to maybe 1.4 million, 1.5 million . We're really doing well. And that's the mine that we'll stay around that area. Our Hookers Prairie mine, we'll continue to operate it quite well at the high efficient pace that's it at right now until the mine out time there. So, the other one that I think that we're going to try to manage a little bit would be back at the Four Corners, but we're still want to expect the efficiencies that we're getting today. JIM PROKOPANKO: Yes, the lady at the front from Goldman, I think. Lindsay? LINDSAY DRUCKER MANN, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Thanks. I just wanted, Larry, I was hoping you could expand on a very enticing comment you made before about shareholders being rewarded handsomely for patients with respect to your buyback. So, could you give us a little more detail in a normal operating environment, how much money you might be willing to put to work, how much leverage you might be willing to take on as soon as next year once you have the opportunity to execute those buybacks? And then, just secondly, we've heard a lot of talk about potential acquisitions on the phosphate rock side, maybe just go into some more detail on where the opportunities there exist. LARRY STRANGHOENER: Sure. We try to make it clear that we've got ample flexibility. And then I'm sure that what we need to follow was closely. It's clear we've got ample balance sheet flexibility and probably some $6 billion to $7 billion of capital available to us without impairing our current credit ratings, which is important to us. And so, theoretically, at least in the absence of any other investment opportunities, would it make sense to put all of that to share repurchase? It might, depending upon the price of the stock at that time and other variables that we'd be considering. But certainly, we have the wherewithal, and I think once we're free of these restrictions coming from the cargo deal, we will have the inclination to use our balance sheet much more aggressively. We will always look first for internal growth opportunities, which we're doing the potash expansion program. Of course, being the most prominent of those opportunities. We will look for other strategic opportunities, ammonia, additional phosphate rock, other likely phosphate related acquisitions. But all of those would have to be compared and would have to compare favorably with our perception with the economics of a share buyback at that time. So, I think all of those things are in the mix. And, again, I'm asking the industry just to be patient and understand why we're keeping such a big balance sheet right now and the likelihood that we will be much less willing to have such a big balance sheet when we got full freedom and flexibility. JIM PROKOPANKO: Gentleman up to the left, or my right here. PJ JUVEKAR, ANALYST, CITIGROUP: Hi, PJ Juvekar from Citigroup. A question on your ammonia plant, I think you're going to make the final decision by end of the year. It seems like a long time. So, what are you really waiting for? Are you waiting for gas contracts? Because from what we understand is E&P companies are not signing gas contracts of this price. Are you waiting for carbon permits? Can you just talk a little bit more about that? LARRY STRANGHOENER: Sure. PJ, I could just add a bit of color around that. We've now gotten serious -- much serious, and we have been in the past about a nitrogen facility. We are ever more confident now that the gas prices are going to stay sustainably low in North America, and that is probably $5 range or less. And I don't know if it's going to stay much under $3. So, right now we're short 1 million tons of ammonium every year. By building an ammonia plant without some kind of assurance on and strong point of gas, we build the ammonia plant. And we are then not short with ammonia, we're short 1 million times 32 MMCF of gas. So, we're just moving that short in the risk factor down. So, two things we're keeping in touch on them. We're looking at what's the best approach to reducing the risk of being short that amount of gas. So whether it's through long-term supply agreement, contracts, price contracts, formula pricing, maybe buy a small gas field, we don't know. And we're exploring all those alternatives. And I think it's only been recently that the realization has settled in with the gas producers that this $3 might be a cap for a while. And in the past, we've had -- recent past some gas producer say, no, no, we're not at these prices. We're not interested in talking because it's going up. Well, at least it's down at $4. Now, sub $3. So, I think we're just letting -- this market just settling out in this realization that it might be cheap for some while. So, that's one element. Let us have the time to get the gas contracts and the risk managed best as we can. Two, understanding deformity. I think we have some advantages we're finding out in Louisiana and having access to the CO2 pipeline. So, that is non-trivial exercise. And the third point is getting out and understanding what the cost is on an ammonia plant. So, there is a couple of suppliers, it's going to be that $1 billion kind of range. So, you just don't walk up to the hardware store and buy an ammonia plant. So, we're doing our engineering and our work in citing issues and ensuring that we are on top of that. One thing we've done well, and that we're proud of and we stick to is, these large projects on phosphate, we've understood that if you do your pre-engineering, an extensive pre-engineering work, there is far less room for surprises on the capital spending. Our projects are coming in on budget, they're on scope and they're on time. And that's testament to the extent of pre-engineering that is done for this project. And this is much different from that. Hope that answers your question, PJ. JIM PROKOPANKO: Larry, you've been working on the carbon site more, do you --? LARRY STRANGHOENER: Well, as you've said we're in a particularly advantageous situation in New Orleans because of the existing ammonia plant we have. And so, we think that that's going to allow us easier access to the permitting that we need. With respect to carbon credits, I'm not sure I'm the right guy to ask. Joc, (inaudible) head on that. JOC O'ROURKE: Well, I think what Larry is saying is we have ways that we can obtain carbon credits from our existing plant that may facilitate an easier environmental permitting of our new plant if we were to go ahead. JIM PROKOPANKO: Okay, over here. JACOB BOUT, ANALYST, CIBC: Jacob Bout from CIBC. First question would be on phosphate permitting. As you look a little bit longer term going from the Hardy County into some of the other counties, what is the likelihood here that we can see further injunctions as you move from county to county? And then the second question would just be on the plant on our side. We're in a period here where we see continuing week potash demand, say, for the rest of the year, what is your ability to scale back in some of these brownfield projects? JIM PROKOPANKO: Rich, why don't you answer the question, Jacob's question about the permitting? RICH MACK: Sure. Primarily, in the future, we're going to be focused heavily in Hardy County and in DeSoto County when you start looking out ten, 20 years down the road. And I can say both of those counties are great partners of ours. I think they are both very friendly to phosphate mining. We've got great relationships with the Board Of County Commissioners in each of them. And DeSoto County will be moving into that for the very first time. But everything that we have experienced to date has been a very positive relationship with DeSoto County. They really want to have the jobs. As I noted in my comments, we're going to likely go the beneficiation facility down there that will employ hundreds of people. And so, it's a fairly enticing project for them. In terms of whether or not an injunction would be issued in the future, I think I would just refer back to my comments, and that is every permit is very site-specific. I do not ascribe to the philosophy that every time someone wants to challenge a phosphate mining permit, there is an automatic injunction that would necessarily follow. In addition, you have to take a look at what level of the challenges at. It could be at the local country level, it could be at the state level or as the most recent instance at South Fort Meade, could be at the federal level. And injunctions are high bars. And I would say that our experience and our assessment with respect to South Fort Meade is that should be classified as more an anomaly rather than a norm. And that's how we're going to approach it going forward. UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: (inaudible-microphone inaccessible) RICH MACK: Sure. The question was the relationship with the NGOs and the Sierra Club. And listen, I will say that over the course of the last 12 to 14 months, we have engaged in a lot of dialogue with the NGOs. Diana Jagiella who is here in the crowd, a person on my team -- I'll call her out specifically, has worked very diligently along with her team members in the permitting organization to develop that relationship. And I would describe it as professional. I would describe it as significantly better, more open than it was call it a year or to a year and a half ago. I would say that we're building trust. And as I've noted before in some comments I've had, we are not adverse to engaging with NGOs at all. We simply want people to be reasonable. We know that we will be reasonable and there's got to be mutual things that we can do together to allow Mosaic to do what we want to do and provide opportunities for these organizations to achieve their goals as well. JACOB BOUT: Joc, would you touch on the capacity to potash expansions, excuse me, as we go forward? JOC O'ROURKE: Sure. First of all, let me say, as Larry highlighted, our capital discipline is very strong. We're not going to build a project that doesn't meet our hurdle rates. Now, having said that, we do believe because of our cost benefit of using Brownfield expansion, we are the people best positioned to expand in this upcoming market. So, will we respond to short-term changes, I suspect not. It's a very large long-term changes. I suspect our capital hurdles may not be met and we could change our strategy. We do have the flexibility, but I suspect we will be building for a decade ahead and we will be looking at the long-term expectation of this market. VINCENT ANDREWS, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: Thanks. Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Larry, I just want to clarify your statement around potash volume and just make sure I understood whether you're talking about potash demand being down in totality for fiscal 2012 or calendar 2012. And then I have a follow up. LARRY STRANGHOENER: Yes, Mike will speak about this tonight at dinner. But our forecasted demand for potash with calendar 2012 is such that we expect it to be down slightly versus last calendar 2011. Mike will go into more details tonight. VINCENT ANDREWS: Okay. And separately, as a follow-up separately, on the perspective potential to buy back stocks from the trust that have the remaining shares, can you just remind us the limitation and the waiting period between now? And I believe it was May of 2015. Is that an IRS rule or is that a rule between you and cargo when this large transaction is structured? Is there any opportunity to speed up that timeline? LARRY STRANGHOENER: It's a combination with the larger and more relevant restriction with the IRS tax rules around a split-off transaction which will effect until May of 2013. There are some limited availability to do something within a basket that we've talked about and some $40 million shares. Can you speak to that basket? But doing that would require the consensus in both the trust and it's not likely to happen. So, it's really the tax restrictions that are most operable. VINCENT ANDREWS: Thank you. JIM PROKOPANKO: The one at the front row. UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you, Jim. Two questions, first, you've talked about the strength of your global distribution system. As you think about the capacity changes and shifts and mix that are coming in the next five years, is that still the right footprint? Well, I presume that already change the footprint. Is the footprint you have in distributions are right for print for the next decade or are you going to be spending money and shifting that around too? LARRY STRANGHOENER: Our distribution footprint, from a couple of dimensions, you can look at it from where growing Ag demand is. And that is in Latin America, Brazil, principally, Argentina, a little bit, and Central America. Then, you have Asian region, India, China, Indonesia, Malaysia. I recently just been through Indonesia and Malaysia and I just feel a lot better about Asia as a growing market being more than India, more than just China. Malaysia and Indonesia have tremendous pump plantations, agricultural development. Vietnam, that area. It really is a great story. And as I say, it gives me the confidence that this is more than just China and India. And so, we're in the right place. And I don't know that there are any more places to go at this point. Africa, there are some people better equipped. And I guess the second one, who are we most equipped to serve with the logistics channel? And that is the next dimension in the phase of phosphates, the western hemisphere is our home court advantage. Nobody can get phosphate to North America and South America more economically than can Mosaic. So, with this coming on on-stream is the modern project which we'll have some advantages going into the Indian market. So, we'll have some logistics advantages there and we'll go into India and we expect world phosphate growth to be 2.5%, 3% a year, and that will succumb this new production trends coming on. But, really, the home court is the western hemisphere. Those markets, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, they buy all year long. So it's not just one market that modern ten or the Middle East we're going to competing in their -- we may lose a little bit of share but I think we'll sustain or gain share in western hemisphere. UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Okay. Thank you. And just a clarification on the permitting process, it's my understanding now that we're relying on an overall environmental impact statement, will there be separate environment impact statements for the three permits that you have going? RICH MACK: We believe that as a result of getting our permits and submit it to the core engineers on a timely basis, the completion of the area EIS will fulfill a substantial part of the environmental assessment. If not, all of the environmental assessment that would be needed for our permits on owning a facility in (inaudible). And so, while it's burning some process, it can actually be a real facilitator for us going forward. JIM PROKOPANKO: We'll take another question on the left side. Gentleman at the front. ELAINE YIP, ANALYST, CREDIT SUISSE: Thank you. Elaine Yip of Credit Suisse. Question on potash Greenfield economics, you made a comment that $600 netback mine prices would need to justify such a project, does that pertain mainly to judicial shift mine and how do you think about solution mines and with net cost falling that would make that project team kind of more economical? What are your views on the Greenfield project that have been discussed in the market place? JIM PROKOPANKO: I'll just make some brief comment. I think that we had dropped some details and he's done some studying of the alternative mining technologies both alternative shift mining and solution mining. What we're seeing is, in our assessment, that a new Greenfield shaft mine is going to be at least $2500 of capital investment per capacity ton. And that's been confirmed by an Australian miner who published their own internal information that acknowledged this $2500 of ton for capacity. And I don't believe that goes as far as export facility that we would like to have, rail infrastructure that you might have to add, rail cars, which is going to be small change compare to the project. But it's been admitted by those studying Greenfields that it's at least $2500. And at $2500 you're getting north of $600 a ton. And the $2500 CapEx doesn't include find the reserves that there's been a billion plus spent on that already. So, 2500 I think is a low bar for what we're bringing on a new facility is. And from our experience, the K3 shaft, we just did not see a technology out there that can get viably produced product in much less than seven years. So maybe it's going to be six years if we really knock the ball out of the park. But let's take the 4 million ton mine, you spend $2500 a ton, anyway. So, that's $8 billion will be sunk to the ground, dead money for close to seven years. That's a long, long time that then you need the $600 a ton, at least, that Larry was talking about. Now, Joc, you might just share with some of your research showing on the alternative mining technology. JOC O'ROURKE: So, what you're asking as well is different with solution mines. I think from a capital perspective, what you have to understand is, well, you don't have the big sass in its traditional mine. A solution mine, you have to build big boilers, crystallizers, et cetera, to make this thing work. Plus, a bunch of mine fields where you pump the solution into the ground and bring it up. So, the infrastructures for a solution mine is actually as much as for and underground mine. So, you really don't have a capital cost advantage. The next question, is there an operating cost advantage? Right now with the price of natural gas, there probably is some operating cost advantage for Mosaic solution mines. But a new mine starting out, a new solution facility starting out would not have the benefit of our settling pawn crystallization which allows for natural crystallization of about a third of our potash. All of the crystallization from a new solution mine would be using big crystallizers which are a very high-energy input. So while they gain by the price of natural gas, they would lose by the high-energy input required at this stage. JIM PROKOPANKO: And on the other side of the room? Yes, sir? BILL CARROLL, ANALYST, UBS: Thank you, Bill Carroll from UBS. Do you announce the big increase of the dividend today although it was off of a relatively small base and it's still less than 1%? So it's lower than the market, lower than it appears. But as it approach to start at that small base and consistently grow it quarter-after-quarter through good times and bad and establish yourself that way and different yourself that way. JIM PROKOPANKO: Yes. Well, thanks for the question. And I was kind of underwhelmed by -- I sort of missed the cheers when I announced the $0.50. So I'm not surprised with your questions. And we discussed that ourselves. So please understand we've been an independent company, we have the majority shareholder for a short nine months here. And we went into our independence with a very robust balance sheet with intention. So the $0.50 two and a half times rate in the range of our peers. So we are not too far out in the middle -- in the middle of the pack. We've got a couple of items on our plate that Larry has reference, a potential $1 billion nitrogen plant. We are facing an opportunity in May 2013 where we can do some additional buybacks. And the net result was, you know, we're competitive here. It's easier to raise than to lower. So let's get this under our belt, you know, add another cake to satisfy you. Yesterday we announced the permit for -- today we two and a half times increased our dividend. He wants more. It is absolutely insatiable. Just let us -- let us work and move forward. And we understand. We have a balance sheet that's very strong as perhaps for this period of time not the most efficient news of our assets. And we are mindful of that. And we will address that as soon as we are comfortable doing. We've gone though, in nine months, became a fully independent company. We said the spin off was going to work well and it did. The split off was going to work well, it did. We said we were going to get this permit, in some form, in some way we did. And when we said we're going to return capital to shareholders and we just two and a half time increase of our dividend. And we and Larry has committed and I and the management team has committed that we will have an efficient balance sheet. We'll get there and we're committed to that. And it will be in a practical period of time. So we don't want to go down on our dividend ever. We'd like to have the capacity to raise it. We think we do have that outlook in the market, the balance sheet to do it. And we'll just see what the alternatives present over the next six months. Yes. Yes, sir? JOEL JACKSON, ANALYST, BMO: Thanks, Joel Jackson from BMO, a couple of questions. First, you know, mining inflation has been quite rampant in the mining world for the last little while. So I wanted to know from some of your CapEx projections for your three potash expansions, what sort of assumptions you've seen over the next, you know, seven to ten years for inflation and also for contingencies? And the second question I want to ask you about Bayovar. Maybe you can give a status on how ramped up Bayovar is currently? Have you gone ahead with your partners on deciding whether or not to go (inaudible) plants? And is your position with your partners to expand the mine beyond 3.9 million tons condition on improving the plantation site? JIM PROKOPANKO: Larry Stranghoener is the right person to answer both of those questions. LARRY STRANGHOENER: Okay. So let me get the first -- the first question was on... JIM PROKOPANKO: Inflation. LARRY STRANGHOENER: Oh, inflation, sorry yes. Look, yes, particularly for our potash mines inflation is high in Saskatchewan. The other risk factoring those is of course the currency exchange and the currency exchange has been quite volatile. So we do have some risk with respect to our capital because of both those factors, but in general we've been very careful as we said a number of times to make sure that the plants are robust. We've got fix bids. We can manage the capital risk. We can manage the currency. And we've gone forward on the projects on that basis. I think that way we minimize those risks. Now, certainly there's been pluses and minuses some of the projects which we started, you know, during good times. We've seen cost benefits on them. We look back at some of those contracts, but likewise we've had once that had gone against us. So unbalance has been working out because of long projects they tend to even out overtime. So that would be, you know, what I would say for those -- and we're not using anything other than normal projections for inflation that would be from the Canadian government or whatever. In terms Bayovar, Bayovar we have been successfully building up production in that operation. Our operating partner [Valey] has been building from pretty much on the timeline they said they would build production. They have themselves announced that, you know, they're very interested in expansion. However we have not have a final feasibility delivered yet and we won't make the decision to do that expansion until the final feasibility is completed. The final feasibility will most likely contain flotation to address some of the recovery issues of the future of the mine. But that is -- that is for the future. We're very keen if it's a good economic project to do with, but we'll have to wait for that final feasibility and a good mine planning and a good capital planning before we do. Okay. JIM PROKOPANKO: We'll move over here. KEVIN MCCARTHY, ANALYST, BANK OF AMERICA: Kevin McCarthy, Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. I just wanted to come back to your desire to become more fully integrated in nitrogen. Do you see opportunities to bridge your short position through acquisition, you know, as opposed to organic growth? And if there were assets that were available, what flexibility might you have to acquire them prior to May of 2013? JIM PROKOPANKO: On the -- so the question is when we buy versus build a nitrogen plant? And right now I don't see too many nitrogen producers that are shy about their ownership in the nitrogen plant. If somebody were interested in selling and it was in the right general geography for us and fit to supply our Louisiana and our Florida operations, we'd be interested in that. But I'm highly doubtful that anybody is likely going to be selling their nitrogen facility. I just don't see that happening. And if there where the -- help me here, I think we have a capacity on the restrictions related to the Cargill split-off. RICK MCLELLAN: No, restrictions with respect to anything done with cash or debt. JIM PROKOPANKO: Or debt. JOC O'ROURKE: Yes. I would also add, Jim, that, you know, part of our interest in an ammonia plant is to increase the total supply of ammonia. And so buying somebody else's ammonia plant doesn't accomplish that purpose. So that's as Jim said, that's not likely what we would follow. JIM PROKOPANKO: Yes, back, I see a hand at the back of the room. JEFF ZEKAUSKAS, ANALYST, JPMORGAN: Hi. Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. I think half of your collective bargaining agreements come up in 2012 for your hourly employees? Are there any dates that we need to keep in mind or what are the key agreements that you're focusing on of the -- over the, you know, the next six months. JIM PROKOPANKO: I guess it's both potash and so Joc and Bo you can address the labor contrast. JOC O'ROURKE: I guess, yes, in terms of labor contrast, we just settled with our self port need and Hookers Prairie people down here. That's just completed. We have coming up this spring our Colonsay negotiations will be -- will be this spring. I think the contract man in March or April of this year. And then the next Esterhazy contract will be coming up late fall early spring of this year as well. So, yes, they are coming up. In phosphates, I think our next big one is Four Corners and then New Wales. JEFF ZEKAUSKAS: Okay. Thank you, very much. JIM PROKOPANKO: Yes, gentleman towards our left. UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thanks, I appreciate that. Paul (inaudible) Securities. Just a first question on the part of sales slowly going, I just want to know what the impact is for your production curtailments. Is there something that would be immediate or is there a timeline you want to pass before you would make an adjustment on that or maybe not at all? JIM PROKOPANKO: Rick and Joc do you want to take that? RICK MCLELLAN: I'm going to hit it? JOC O'ROURKE: You hit it and I'll back you up. RICK MCLELLAN: We announced a potash curtailment back towards the start of the year. At this stage, we are carrying out that curtailment and we are going to keep within that range. And this change in guidance is really right in the same range as what we previously said we're going to curtail our production by. JOC O'ROURKE: Yes. Right now see no need to do anything further than what we announced. UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Okay. And I just -- a question from Larry earlier you're giving that framework on the hurdle base. So I'm just curious because you mentioned zero on the country external, this would be the US as an example? (Inaudible) on that side and project risk to zero to almost 10, where would you get the boundaries for that so that I will have an idea of what that is. RICK MCLELLAN: I'm not sure I understand the question, but so we would do, the US is having zero political risk with -- if we were to do something in Africa or in Kazakhstan that would be at the high end of that risk ceiling. We have assigned a specific number to any region where we look at a project that would range between zero and 4.9%. The other risk factor is a little bit more qualitative. We're just simply trying to evaluate whether or not we're trying to adapt a new technology of a new way of doing things, an unproven process and using our judgment in assigning a risk factor for that. UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Okay. RICK MCLELLAN: Does that address your question? UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: It does. If I can just narrow it down. So a greenfield potash project in Saskatchewan would range where? RICK MCLELLAN: A greenfield potash project? UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes. RICK MCLELLAN: Well since we're not entertaining a Greenfield project that we have not gone through that exercise, but Saskatchewan will have very low -- probably zero country risk. There are the some modest technology risks just because drilling a shaft or sinking a shaft is inherently risky. I'm wondering if any of my colleagues remember what were the methods we used for the K3 project? I think it was it around [13.7%]. JIM PROKOPANKO: Yes, just in the range of 13. RICK MCLELLAN: Thirteen to 13.5%. So a small risk because of the fact that it's inherently risky to drill a shaft. UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you. RICK MCLELLAN: Does it -- UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thanks. I had two follow ups. So Jim in your opening remarks you talked about the fact that you thought that the project dynamic would probably keep potash prices below the level you need to incentivize a new greenfield potash expansion. And at the same time Larry in your remarks you talked about an outlook for your earnings which earning growth outlook which incorporated utilization rates that were pretty healthy going forward. I'm wondering in light of the fact that you seem to think there's going to be sufficient supplier there to keep prices below that sort of level, how you think about what your capacity utilization should look like in coming years? JIM PROKOPANKO: With the various Brownfields that are coming on streams starting in 2012 including ours and really one of our stamping competitors had some coming on, we do see a period of time where there will be -- new production supply will exceed growth in demand. And when we look at our potash and our phosphates, the question we ask is will, in the case of potash, will demand keep up the supply. And we think this could be for a short period of time. But curtailing and not fully utilizing new potash capacity has very small impact to the cost of operating that mine. And so it's easy to curtail. In the case of phosphate, we ask the question will supply keep up with demand. And we think that's going to be a tighter situation. So we'll see more upside price support on phosphates than we do on potash. And commenting up the what level we'd like to be operating on, we don't forecast that. And maybe Mike, you might have some insight onto that this evening. But I'll just give you a rule of thumb that I will have. When we are 83%, 85% operating capacity, you see potash prices increasing and when you get to 90%, you have strong support for increase potash pricing. When you're operating at a 78% to 83% kind of range, and again, these are just my rules of thumb, you see stable pricing. If you get much below that 80%, below 78%, 75% you probably have weaker potash pricing dynamic. So depending on what happens with the US corn crop this year, what happens to grain prices, corn prices, bean prices, that's going to have a lot to do with the demand of the potash in the year and the years ahead. UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: And then just a follow up on the cost savings, cost efficiency program that you highlighted. In fiscal '11, you completely the $100 million, you have $100 million of savings. Your annual run rate as of December was $188 million and your target is $250 million by 2015. So that suggests as of, you know, in 2012 -- sorry -- between now and 2015, there's another $150 million you're going to book on your P&L, but you really only have call it $7 million you need to capture since your annualized run rate is $188 million. Second, on potash as an increment I think it was like $200 million of savings. So I guess what I'm asking is as we think about the, you know, incremental earnings to both your income statement, now you (inaudible) back up and running, are those cost savings at $188 million annualized, is that dialed back in which we expect to see new cost savings or you're really only targeting an incremental $70 million between now and 2015 on the phosphate side? JIM PROKOPANKO: What do you think, Larry? LARRY STRANGHOENER: I think that our phosphate team is running really hard and really successfully to offset natural inflationary cost increases so that they can keep cost flat as they have been doing for the last few years excluding the cost of raw materials, excluding the effects of self coordinate. And then those cost savings that Bo has targeted for the next three to five years are also intended to keep our cost flat. And so those savings offset inflationary increases we'll see in other areas. The self (inaudible) effects, we separately isolate it as having about four percentage points of margin in fact for the last 12 months or so. Eventually we should get that back in addition -- independent of these cost savings that both this drive. UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: So these cost savings are just offsetting other inflationary forces and shouldn't necessarily -- LARRY STRANGHOENER: I think in this environment and then in more detail some of the other -- the cost, the labor cost process came up across a whole host of cost continue to increase. And so the notion that a large industrial mining business such as those can maintain a flat cost structure in this environment is I think remarkable but it requires exactly the kind of work that Bo and his team have been doing. And as said in our comments, we now want to apply that same discipline to potash where we have seen cross street, where we have not seen the kinds of efficiency improvements, cost improvements that we need to see to keep our cost structure more flat. JIM PROKOPANKO: Vincent? VINCENT ANDREWS: Thanks, Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley again. I just wanted to ask a question on phosphate. You know after the South Fort Meade announcement last night, I got into a pretty good debate with somebody I consider to be a very good fertilizer investor and he suggested that, you know, how do we think about the DAP market from here? You guys were obviously a buyer -- an incremental buyer, third-party rock for awhile which must have an impact on rock prices and so forth. And as you sort of step back from that position, do we have to worry about DAP supply and demand incrementally and DAP prices incrementally as a function. So I guess the question is what impact do you think the sort of this period of time where South Fort Meade as a disruption to your rock production? What do you think that actually had on the market? JIM PROKOPANKO: Good question. So what does South Fort Meade Company do to rock pricing around the world. Right now, we've been buying and we've had continued for a number of years in a long period of time, buying a rock from Morocco. And we don't anticipate that this bringing South Fort Meade back on line is going to displace the North African rock that we buy. It's a good quality rock. It's a higher quality. We use that for blending purposes. And I don't that will change and provided that they want to keep selling to us and based on a long history we have with them, we'll continue to buy from them. Bo explained that we'll probably pull back in some of our -- pull back in the throttle on some of our other mines. And we think that the market is going to remain stable and strong on that. We have been running at about a 3 million ton inventory of rock which is getting low for us. We have as much as 5 million and 6 million tons. I don't know if it's been higher than that, Bo. So we have to build our inventory. We're going to expect to continue running at strong rates particularly once the spring season in North America starts and then Brazil and then India. So I just don't see at this point having South Fort Meade is going to weaken rock pricing. I just don't see that at all. VINCENT ANDREWS: Thank you. JIM PROKOPANKO: I don't see that all. Yes. UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Question on the Cargill transaction. You talked about some restrictions on your buy back stock from the trust in the first few years. What restrictions if any would the IRS impose on a third party buying Mosaic's stocks currently held by the public and/or the trust? This are full two-year waiting period for third party to buy controlling interest or is that only if they had substandard discussion with your owner before the (inaudible)? JIM PROKOPANKO: Yes, you're correct that any change or controlled transaction that would be proposed would be effectively cost prohibitive have there been any discussions prior to the spin off. So the IRS would likely deem such a transaction to have been a contemplated transaction which would in effect disallow the tax freeze status of the spin off. To the extent that there have been no discussion with us with Cargill. Such a party could make an offer and could effect finish a -- change a control transaction. They would have to take on that tax risk of the identification we have to Cargill for making them whole should the tax restrictions be violated. But presumably there maybe parties out there who would feel comfortable taking on that tax risk because of the history that they have. The presumption would be for that party to prove that there had been no substandard discussions and therefore it's a tax risk that they would be willing to take on. VINCENT ANDREWS: And then they would be looking for basically legal opinions that would provide some assurances to them if they were going to go down that path. JIM PROKOPANKO: The 24 months is pretty typical in this case, yes. And your other question on whether or not if there's any restrictions from buying the public shares, the other area where there will be a little tax friction is if we have a shareholder that would take on more than a 10% ownership interest for example from publicly (inaudible) shares. And so that's something that I think people would be monitoring as well. JIM PROKOPANKO: Okay, (inaudible) towards the back. Thank you. UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible) Investment Management. A question regarding the feasibility study on the ammonia plant, are you creating the option of future expansion into the feasibility because if you are right as you can lock in a long term gas price of three to five dollars and then -- it might make strategic sense to enter the nitrogen fertilizer industry. And on a related topic what the MicroEssentials business benefit from a better integration to nitrogen? JIM PROKOPANKO: Well so the question is if we could lock in natural gas with these kinds of levels, why wouldn't we and just get on with it? Well we've been struggling to find that producer that will sell us prepare to say, \"Hey, we give up. We've got free dollar gas going forward,\" and we continue to talk and we've talked with a wide range of producers about locking in gas and a variety of methods to do. But most directly to your question, we haven't found a gas supplier that's prepared to give us a multi-year midterm then supply plus a year kind of gas contract. Nobody is willing to do just yet. And we'll see if that changes with time. UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible-microphone inaccessible). JIM PROKOPANKO: Yes, a good question. So that means right now our view is to go as far as being a self sufficient with our ammonia. The question then is do we go further to be a merchant, a seller or a merchant of nitrogen. We're not the only one who thinks investing in a nitrogen plant right now is a good idea. And so that is something that we have to consider if there's a -- I got to believe that plenty of people when you look at what the margins have been on nitrogen and on ammonia this past year, there's a lot of people with gar or farmer or producer groups that are very interested in building an ammonia plant. So we're not there just yet to say being in the merchant nitrogen business is the right place to be. We're not saying no, but we feel confident that being self sufficient is the right thing to do and that's something we'll consider further as we go forward. Now doing that, we could build a plant. I've seen other people can build ammonia plants and the result is going to be cheap ammonia for everybody. And that might save us having to do with the ammonia plant. So there's a number of moving parts here, just isn't as simple as you might first think it would be. And the impact on the [MAP] -- RICK MCLELLAN: Same impact as you would have on BAP and MAP. You'd want to have the nitrogen as our own product. JIM PROKOPANKO: Yes. PJ JUVEKAR: Hi, PJ Juvekar. Just on your phosphate operations I think you've mentioned that you raise your mining efficiency from 41% to 65%? That 41 number sounded really low. Is 65 high or low? Have you done any benchmarking studies against other phosphate producers or other --? BO DAVIS: For utilization? PJ JUVEKAR: Yes. BO DAVIS: Yes. You know, draglines are, you know -- a typical dragline for us is about 700 million pound machine, very, very great heavy piece of equipment. A lot of moving parts, cable and gearing and it takes a fair amount of maintenance to keep those in good working shape. We also have shift changes. You have many other parts of routine maintenance and operator tier that goes into the machines. So out of the 24 hour a day if you're getting l6 solid hours of operation, that's a pretty good number. We look at across many industries, those coal as well as phosphate, 65% is a good number. JIM PROKOPANKO: I'll just add one thing. And having been also to the mine recently to see the coordination of the draglines now, I think you're getting notes of the mines, the wireless systems, the communication systems have been put in place to communicate from the dragline, from the beneficiation plant, to the wash pits, our chemical processing system, it's like an airport control tower. And so the technology that's been brought and the innovation and the IT that's been brought into this and brought to the dragline operations to coordinate them, going to the 61, 65% that's a heck of an improvement. And as Bo said, when you see the size of these, these things just don't run 24/7. There's other things they're doing, staging, preparing and shift changes and et cetera. So we're happy with that. We think we could probably squeeze out another couple of 10% over the next couple of years. But some tremendous innovation applied for that. We're going to take a couple more questions. We're just got to bring questions in. The management is going to be here all night. So it's not your last opportunity here. Gentleman to the left. DAVID BEGLEITER, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE: Thank you very much. David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Just a quick question on your (inaudible) inflow cost, they've doubled approximately over the past five years and you give a really good slide explaining where those costs go. Can you talk a little bit about the outlook before those costs, let's say, over the next five years? And I guess the second part of that question is how you see the flow rate evolving over the next couple of years as well? Thanks. BO DAVIS: Okay, let me answer the second question first, how the flow rate is going to evolve over the next couple of years? I think there's only one person or one entity that knows that. And I don't speak for him. But, I mean, we have seen a range of flows and what we've set up our system for is to make sure we can manage the maximum sustainable flow that we think is out there. So well I can't tell you what that maximum flow one day might be. I think we're managing what we think is a reasonable maximum. Where did the cost go? I think the cost as they are today, we've got the infrastructure in place to do what we need to do to manage that maximum flow. So from that perspective, I think that we've seen the top of the cost. You know, five years ago we weren't doing any back flowing. We got to back flow that operation to stabilize it. We didn't have anywhere near the pumping capacity we have today. We have to have that pumping capacity just to be sure. So we've done all of that. I think the cost stayed relatively constant from where they are except for with the exception of possibly this horizontal drilling or some sort of new technology that we'll try. And that could go either way. We could either spend more money to be more effective or we might spend more money and then all of a sudden find that we solve the problem and we become much less expensive throughout. So it could go either way. JIM PROKOPANKO: Okay, one last question. This is it. DAVID BEGLEITER: David Begleiter (inaudible) thank you again. A final question on based on economics of cutting production in potash, because the more you cut production, the more you increase unit cost. At which potash price are you in different in between cutting production and just running (inaudible)? JIM PROKOPANKO: Good question, we get a lot of that kind of questioning from our customers and from farmers. Speaking from Mosaic and I don't think this is a much different than any other producers, we produce to the capacity or to the demand I should say and we don't look at our price at which we will cut. We produce -- and this is the same kind of thinking that we look in our phosphate business. We produce approximately a capacity for call it 800,000 tons a month just for the ease of calculation, 800,000 tons a month. We have storage capacity for about 1.2 million tons that we can store approximately six weeks of production. When you start hitting the rafters and those warehouses, there's no way to put it and so you start cutting the prices. Now what we have found happens in this industry potash and phosphate, the same kind of economic supply, you cut the first $50 and the marketplace understands you have a capacity constraint problem they're going to wait for you to cut the next 50 and the next 50. And so this is a timing when markets are happening and when farmers are using the product. And as long as there is demand, we're going to produce. Our margins are great on phosphate -- on potash. Very, very good on phosphate. There's economics to keep producing, but if you can start because people aren't buying it and move it, you just stop producing. So we get the cost of production and you could do the math on that in the case of phosphate. Then we'll start thinking about curtailing production. But we're -- I could honestly say the price of the product has never come into conversation as to should we curtail or not. It's not because we don't like the price. It's because nobody is going to buy this stuff. And we know that we're just weeks away from the floodgates opening up in North America. DAVID BEGLEITER: All right, thank you. JIM PROKOPANKO: Larry? LARRY STRANGHOENER: Thank you for your time and attention. A special thanks to Laura Gagnon and Carmen Kilde. A lot of work goes into putting together this kind of a day.

Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada scientists in August found kochia in three fields in southern Alberta. The weeds were resistant to glyphosate, the active chemical in the world's top-selling herbicide, Roundup. Monsanto Canada announced the confirmation on its website. Glyphosate resistant weeds could mean higher weed control costs and lower crop yields for farmers. Kochia populations resistant to glyphosate have previously been confirmed in Kansas, Colorado and Nebraska. Two resistant weed species previously found in southwestern Ontario are giant ragweed in 2009 and Canada fleabane in 2011. This is the first time glyphosate resistant weeds have been confirmed in Canada's most important grain and canola growing region. What makes the Alberta case different is that the kochia does not appear to have developed in a field where producers regularly grew crops that had been genetically modified to tolerate glyphosate.

Unfortunately, even with regular soil testing and following the soil test recommendations, pH problems can develop as fields age, a Michigan State University extension expert says. Writing on the university s IPM web site, Norm Myers says the widespread use of the no-till system of production can speed development of pH problems in asparagus fields. Most nitrogen fertilizers are acid-forming by nature and, in no-till systems where these materials are applied to the surface once or twice per season, acid layers can develop in the teo to three-inches below the surface. Another cause of rapid development of low pH spots in asparagus fields is the sandy texture of soils. The pH drops more quickly in sandier, lower organic matter soils. Where the texture varies within a field, look for pH problems to develop first on the sandiest spots, he says. Growers often notice that asparagus fern growing on these sandier spots is shorter and that there are fewer ferns per crown. Developing pH problems are often easiest to notice from a highboy sprayer, Myers says. If the person in charge of spraying is not also the person in charge of soil testing, it may make sense to have the soil testers ride the sprayer once during fern season to spot these problems. Flagging tape or GPS positioning units can be used to mark these problem spots, and separate samples should then be taken to check the pH of the problem spots. Another, more expensive way, to identify these spots is to employ precision farming techniques where samples are taken on small grids, or in small zones, decreasing the chances of missing isolated pH problems, Myers says. Once the low pH spots have been identified, separate lime applications can be made to these problem spots."}, {"title": "Geospatial data project finishes pilot phase", "article": "December 20, 2011: Calgary, Alberta, Canada: December marks the end of a geographic pilot project, managed by Cybera, that improves researcher access to international environmental data drawn from more than 60,000 sensors and 2,800 web map servers. The Geospatial Cyberinfrastructure for Environmental Sensing (GeoCENS) project was created in 2009 as a 3D platform that enables researchers and citizens to gain access to, and share insights on, the Earth's climatic, hydrologic, and biotic systems and processes. The $1.1 million system was funded through CANARIE's Network-Enabled Platforms (NEP) Program. The GeoCENS cloud-based web platform collects and shares live and archived geographic data covering a range of topics, from soil erosion and ice thickness, to animal migration. This information is accessible through a virtual globe - similar to Google Earth and can be downloaded, analyzed and compared to other data sets. The open system works with a variety of data types, and enables researchers in the field to remotely upload their findings as they happen, both quickly and easily. The GeoCENS technology also allows for different applications to be built upon it, such as precision agriculture, groundwater monitoring, fleet management, or smart home maintenance. \"GeoCENS is changing the way scientists collect and collaborate on environmental sensing data,\" says Steve Liang, Assistant Professor in the Department of Geomatics Engineering at the University of Calgary, and Co-Principal Investigator for GeoCENS.

In Europe, for example, the United Kingdom was the first to go down this path, followed closely by France. AtlasFram member David Scott, who farms at Bedingfield Hall, Bedingfield, near Debenham, and is a director of the AtlasFram Group, started down the precision farming route several years ago and has already found it offers significant benefits. Following a company de-merger in 2005, David, his father Derek and brother Richard split the farm, with David taking on Bedingfield Hall, which he operates with his wife, Diane and which extends to 365 ha, with a further three farms farmed on contract. The total cropping on the home farm includes 190ha of winter wheat 80ha of oilseed rape, 40 ha of vining peas together with 40ha of sugar beet on a four-year rotation of wheat, oilseed rape, wheat, followed either by vining peas or sugar beet. They also contract fatten 2400 pigs. \"We've made a start down the precision farming route and already established considerable financial savings by enabling us to site our ELS area on poorer areas of the farm, through more efficient cultivations and savings in base fertilisers,\" he said. \"It will not be long before GPS and steering systems will be the norm on tractors and the next step will be full coverage of the area by RTK satellite guidance to give pin-point accuracy. This means we will be able to drill all our fields in the same direction every year which will in effect give permanent tramlines, then we can perhaps go to a \"Controlled Traffic\" or bed system to reduce damage to the soil structure by compaction of tractor wheelings. This should give us real yield benefit.\""}, {"title": "HEM Hemisphere GPS loses $1.55-million (U.S.) in Q3 2011", "article": "Hemisphere GPS Inc (TSX-V:HEM) Shares Issued 60,824,409 Last Close 11/1/2011 $0.60 Wednesday November 02 2011 - News Release Mr. Steven Koles reports HEMISPHERE GPS REPORTS 2011 Q3 RESULTS Hemisphere GPS Inc. has released its financial results for the third quarter ended Sept. 30, 2011. All currency amounts are expressed in U.S. dollars. The company notes that effective with the 2011 year, its financial results are reported under international financial reporting standards and as a result certain components, as well as 2010 comparatives, have been reclassified and adjusted within the financial statements to reflect the conversion. Details relating to the impact of the conversion were included in the financial statements and management's discussion and analysis documents for the first quarter ended March 31, 2011, which are available on SEDAR. For the three months ended Sept. 30, 2011, Hemisphere GPS reported record revenues of $14.1-million, an increase of 7 per cent compared with $13.2-million in the third quarter of 2010. The third quarter is seasonally the slowest sales period for Hemisphere GPS, and despite an early harvest, the quarter represented the highest third quarter revenue level in the company's history. Strong growth in all regions was offset by a decline in European revenues associated with uncertainty arising from the European debt crisis. \"The third quarter was the sixth consecutive quarter of recovery for our business coming out of the recession,\" stated Steven Koles, president and chief executive officer of Hemisphere GPS. \"Our sales are up 27 per cent for the first nine months of 2011 and we expect to meet our objectives of 25-per-cent revenue growth for this year. The very early 2011 harvest in North America impacted sales in the quarter given our direct-to-farmer business model which does not push inventory to distributors in advance of end-user sales. Grain prices, while volatile, remain above historical averages, and with U.S. net farm income projected to increase 31 per cent to $103.6-billion for 2011, we have been building up our product inventory for anticipated postharvest sales and the 2012 buying season.\" Gross profit contribution was $6.8-million for the third quarters of both 2011 and 2010. On a percentage basis, gross margins were 47.9 per cent compared with 51.7 per cent in 2010, affected by foreign exchange fluctuations which had a positive impact of 3.9 per cent in 2010 but which have stabilized in 2011. Two thousand ten gross margins were revised based upon the conversion from Canadian to U.S. functional currency under IFRS. Revised gross margins for 2010 are higher than originally reported under Canadian generally accepted accounting principles as a result of a strengthening Canadian dollar on the weighted average costing of Canadian inventories and cost of sales when using the U.S. dollar as functional currency. The impact of the strengthening Canadian dollar is declining compared with that seen in 2010 as the strengthening trend has ended compared with that seen in 2009 and 2010. Expenses increased at a slower rate than revenues in the third quarter in line with management's profitability objectives. Total operating expenses increased by 3 per cent year over year to $8.3-million in the third quarter compared with $8.0-million in 2010. Research and development expenses were lower by 1.0 per cent year over year at $2.7-million. Sales and marketing expenses for the quarter were up by 11 per cent to $3.2-million from $2.9-million in 2010, primarily related to one-time consulting costs incurred related to international sales activities. General and administrative expenses were down by 1 per cent to $1.7-million. Hemisphere GPS reported a loss of $1.6-million, or negative three cents per share (basic and diluted) in the third quarter of 2011 compared with a loss of $1.5-million, or negative three cents per share (basic and diluted) in the third quarter of 2010. For the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2011, Hemisphere GPS reported revenues of $55.5-million, a 27-per-cent increase from revenues of $43.8-million, for the same period in 2010. Gross margin for the first nine months of 2011 was 47.9 per cent compared with 49.7 per cent in the nine months of 2010, affected primarily by currency changes and also by increased component and shipping costs. Prior to one-time expenses of $800,000 related to strategic initiatives in the second quarter of 2011, year-over-year expenses decreased by $400,000 to $24.6-million. Through the first nine months of the year operating expenses have remained relatively flat compared with the growth in revenues, demonstrating the scalability of the company's operating model. Non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) profit for the first nine months of 2011, prior to the deduction of one-time expenses of $800,000 related to strategic initiatives, was $1.9-million, or three cents per share (basic and diluted), compared with a loss for the first nine months of 2010 of $4.3-million, or negative eight cents per share (basic and diluted). GAAP profit, after the deduction of one-time expenses related to strategic initiatives of $800,000, was $1.1-million, or two cents per share (basic and diluted) in the first nine months of 2011. At Sept. 30, 2011, the company held cash of $10.3-million, working capital of approximately $31-million and had 60,824,409 common shares outstanding. Product segment sales Sales of the company's air-based products grew by 39 per cent compared with the third quarter of 2010, led by the new Bantam aerial guidance system. Ground-based agriculture products, including the Outback Guidance branded products, increased by 5 per cent year over year. Record sales of $10.0-million for the agriculture segment increased by 5 per cent compared with the third quarter of 2010, contributing 71 per cent of total third quarter revenues, compared with 72 per cent in the third quarter of 2010. Record sales of $4.1-million for the precision products segment were up 10 per cent, contributing 29 per cent of total revenue in the quarter. Sales of Vector heading sensor products to the marine markets together with sales of GPS boards, receivers and development kits to OEM (original equipment manufacturers) customers and system integrators led the growth in this segment. Regional sales For the third quarter, total North American revenues were up by 17 per cent, Australian sales grew by 57 per cent, and sales to other international regions, which include South America and Asia, increased by 15 per cent compared with the third quarter of 2010. Hemisphere GPS continues to see good demand in these international markets. Healthy sales growth in these regions was offset by European sales decreases of 34 per cent compared with the third quarter of 2010, resulting from uncertainty stemming from the European sovereign debt crisis. CLAAS OEM partnership In early October, Hemisphere GPS and CLAAS Agrosystems signed an OEM agreement whereby Hemisphere GPS will develop next-generation precision farming solutions for integration into CLAAS machinery.

Premier Equipment, a John Deere retailer that formed in May 2011 as a result of the merger of Elmira Farm Service and AgraTurf Equipment, operates a precision farming division that sells global positioning system (GPS) and guidance technology. The company has administrative offices in Elmira and Woodstock, and has 10 locations, including branches in Elmira, Ayr and Listowel. \"That whole part of our industry has just grown significantly in the last couple years. What was an add-on to equipment in terms of the GPS and guidance technology is now becoming a staple in most of the big equipment,\" says Brett Barriage, chief executive officer of the company and former general manager of Elmira Farm Service. Dave Petheram is Premier's precision division manager. He has been working with GPS technology since he started at Elmira Farm Service in January 2004. Petheram, who grew up on a family farm and has an agricultural business degree from the University of Guelph, refers to himself as one of the \"elder statesmen of GPS\" in Ontario. He says the adoption of GPS technology in agriculture has accelerated in the last three to five years. He compares the different levels of GPS technology to buying a car - you start with a base system and building up. At the entry-level, it involves manual guidance. He cites the example of a light bar, which is a small screen with a row of lights along the top that farmers use to set the pattern they will drive in the field. The next option up is auto steer, technology that makes it possible for the tractor to basically drive the farmer. Petheram says waste and overlap on farms is reduced with auto steer technology, as well as features such as sprayers or planters that turn off automatically. Both of those guidance solutions can support the third major category of precision technology, which is product control. This allows farmers to control the rate and quantity of the product they are disseminating on their fields. Another branch of technology that Premier Equipment offers is documentation for record keeping, which allows operators to record where they are, what they're doing and on what day, what the weather conditions are like and any other observations they have. The ability to keep an archive of everything that happens is a significant benefit of precision technology, says Bryan Shantz, a partner of Rosendale Farm Ltd., a grain handling facility and agricultural services company located just outside of Kitchener. \"Now you can actually print off a map and look at areas of the field that are not producing,\" he says. \"Which you wouldn't know until you had technology like this.\" Petheram says that at the top end the technology has accuracy within sub-inches. \"The tractor is driving itself very precisely, within half an inch or less of where exactly it's supposed to be,\" he says. \"The unit is pretty much autonomous in the field. It just needs a weight and an operator in the seat to basically hit a confirmation button.\" This kind of technology simplifies the operation, making everything consistent because the machine performs the exact same way every time, he says. \"It allows a less experienced operator to do a ... better job because he doesn't have to worry so much about the minutiae of running the machine because the machine is doing it for him. He's just observing what's happening and making sure nothing's going wrong.\" Petheram says GPS technology plays a huge role in the way farmers plant their crops. \"There would be very few acres planted without some kind of GPS technology anymore, the majority of our large progressive producers are all using auto steer. You'd be hard pressed to find one that wasn't using this type of technology.\" He notes that the majority of John Deere tractors sold today are already equipped with auto steer. The price of these technological add-ons ranges from $2,000 for a light bar, to $25,000 to $30,000 for top of the line auto steering technology. Petheram says that five years ago, before the technology proved its value, there was resistance to it because the benefits weren't obvious and there wasn't data to prove its worth. Now farmers such as Shantz can see the value in GPS and guidance technology for their farms. \"The initial cost is fairly significant but I think once it's implemented the operators have found there's an added value to buying the technology for sure,\" Shantz says. He compares farming technology to other electronic products, saying it's getting better, faster and more accurate all the time. \"I think it would be very difficult to go back again to the way we were.\""}, {"title": "HEM Hemisphere to contribute tech to CLAAS farm machinery", "article": "Hemisphere GPS Inc (TSX-V:HEM) Shares Issued 60,824,409 Last Close 10/19/2011 $0.65 Thursday October 20 2011 - News Release Mr. Steven Koles reports HEMISPHERE GPS AND CLAAS ANNOUNCE OEM PARTNERSHIP TO DEVELOP NEXT GENERATION PRECISION FARMING SOLUTIONS Hemisphere GPS Inc. and CLAAS Agrosystems have entered a new original-equipment-manufacturer development agreement whereby Hemisphere GPS will develop next-generation precision farming solutions for integration into CLAAS machinery.

The objectives of this study were to: (i) quantify the spatial variability of D-s/D-o; (ii) decompose this variability into components at small vs. large scales relative to the size of the site; and (iii) analyze temporal changes at each spatial scale during the growing season of 2006 and the spring of 2007 at two depths in two sandy soils under potato (Solanum tuberosum L.)-corn (Zea mays L.) rotation,\" scientists writing in the Soil Science Society of America Journal report. \"The coefficient of variation of predicted D-s/D-o varied from 30% at 0.15-m depth to 101% at 0.30-m depth, possibly because of a change in soil horizons around the 0.30-m depth. The variability in the data on each sampling date was decomposed into small-scale (spatial and nonspatial) and large-scale (spatial) components using the coregionalization analysis with a drift method. Overall, the small-scale component was predominant at both sites, especially at the 0.15-m depth. Spatial structures were maintained during 2006 and partially carried over to the next year, particularly at the 0.30-m depth, except for the large-scale spatial distribution patterns observed at both depths at Site 1. These results indicate that variability between years may be higher than within a year, probably due to tillage, plant growth, and snowmelt. The study suggests that spatiotemporal variability of D-s/D-o should be considered in agricultural research and precision farming approaches,\" wrote J.A.

The public gets annoyed when a union goes on strike, but they never hear about what the union had to endure just to get into position to strike. Normally, the union's negotiating committee meets with the employer for at least a year, all the while operating on last year's collective agreement. Wages and benefits remain the same, while the cost of living goes up. Then, several obstacles are placed in the way of a settlement. A fact finder is appointed to report on the unresolved issues. Then a mediator is appointed and tries to get the parties to reach an agreement. When all else fails, there must be a majority vote of the members in favour of a strike. Only then is the union in a position to strike. The deck is already stacked against the union. The public gets annoyed with the strikers, but they don't get annoyed with the employer, who has stonewalled the process for months. Now, the Harper government steps in to legislate the union back to work, in accordance with its ideology of union-busting. It is no wonder the gap between the corporations and the workers is getting wider by the day, and the rich get richer while the poor get poorer. And with Stephen Harper in power, the situation can only get much worse. Douglas Frame Exeter Canadians giving their all to ease suffering in Africa Perhaps it's no coincidence that World Food Day comes on the heels of Thanksgiving. Both are celebrations of food, but they are as different as turkey is from beef. For me, World Food Day on Oct. 16 will never be the same because two weeks ago, I visited some of the neediest areas in the Horn of Africa as part of our relief work at Christian Children's Fund of Canada. I encountered individuals who are suffering from food shortages and struggling to stay alive in the midst of a severe drought. For example, I met children who receive their only meal of the day at school -- a single serving of protein mix for lunch. I met a beleaguered mother who said, \"When my children are crying because they are hungry, all I want to do is run away.\" I met children who lacked energy and were very quiet because they did not have enough to eat and observed babies with swollen feet due to malnutrition. I met a father who walks 40 kilometres to get potatoes to feed his family. I met two men who had walked for more than half a day to find food in a nearby town. And those who were able to secure food were often eating the same thing every day: maize, cooked wheat, wild cabbage or protein mix. But before I left Africa, I was encouraged through visits to projects that are being supported by Canadians. For example, we visited a Canadian-funded medical facility where children receive weekly checkups and receive food supplements and medication as well as a food distribution centre that provides for hungry families. So this World Food Day will be different for me. I am grateful for what we have in Canada, but I am inspired to do more for all the adults and children I met in the Horn of Africa. I also want to thank London residents for their support of organizations like ours. You have made a real difference in the lives of many vulnerable children who get to have a daily meal because of you. Mark Lukowski Chief executive officer Christian Children's Fund of Canada Killing pulls us two ways On the front page of the Oct. 12 London Free Press are two articles regarding two killings here in London, which say, \"When something terrible like this happens\" and \"the shootings highlight the growing problem of gun violence in London.\" Then in the Today section on Oct. 13, an article is headlined Thrill of the kill. The article contains the following quotes: \"Shooting, driving, shooting talking and more shooting\", \"(with which to more effectively kill)\" and \"To kill you friends\". I truly do not understand how on one hand we, as a society, are concerned and even fearful about the killings in our city and at the same time want games that encourage and even make killing seem OK. Sue Gaskell London Fanshawe should consider former school board office Fanshawe College president Howard Rundle has stated that he is looking for another building site in downtown London after the recent announcement that the former Royal Trust building was acquired for a downtown campus. Since it seems the concept of containing such educational institutions in a zone or established district is no longer in fashion, maybe Fanshawe or even the University of Western Ontario should cut a deal with the province to take over the old Normal School (most recently the London District Catholic school board office) at Wortley Rd. and Elmwood Ave. in Wortley Village. This would be within walking distance to downtown London, and the influx of students and staff would be welcome to the many businesses and bars, the local library and potential accommodations in the Old South neighbourhood. The province recently renovated that historic building extensively and it should be kept ready for a good tenant like a university or college. And we own it already. Rob Webb London Poll just doesn't add up In a poll done by Sympatico.ca,dated Oct. 7, the question was: \"Are you happy with the result of Ontario elections?\" * 14%: Happy * 22%: no, but it could be worse (how much worse could it be?) * 35%: Not happy * 7%: Indifferent. * 22%: not from Ontario (why are they participating?) I don't understanding something here. How is it that these polls show only 14% are happy? Apparently 57% are not happy. So how on Earth did the Liberal party gain 53 seats under these conditions? Very strange indeed. G. Black London Ontario voters denied tools It was disheartening to read Ian Gillespie's article Voter turnout disturbingly low (Oct. 8), but it doesn't come as a surprise. Civic engagement with municipal and provincial governments is not encouraged in Ontario. In British Columbia, the voting public can hold provincial politicians directly to account between election periods through recall legislation. Also, the act of petitioning is treated differently in provincial municipal acts. In Ontario, municipal councils are only obliged to act when citizens are requesting a change to their electoral boundaries. In Alberta, citizens can submit petitions on any topic that falls within a municipality's area of responsibility, with a guarantee of action. With the absence of tools to let voters hold politicians to account and share in the public agenda between elections, feelings of disenfranchisement and ennui can only continue to flourish. Oliver Hobson London Rural vote packs a wallop Political stories tend to be told from the urban perspective. Examples are plentiful. Most recently we have been told that if the Progressive Conservatives are serious about taking power, they need to break through in the 416 and mimic the success of their federal counterparts. As important as our big cities are, it is prudent to take a broader view. Truth be told, PC Leader Tim Hudak did as well as he did because of the rural anti-wind vote. If you're not convinced, just ask defeated cabinet ministers John Wilkinson, Leona Dombrowsky or Carol Mitchell. The anti-wind vote has grown into a political force that will demand ongoing attention. If Premier Dalton McGuinty continues to ignore the rural vote by forging ahead with unfettered wind turbine development in a desperate attempt to create an environmental legacy, he will simultaneously sacrifice any hope of a rural revival for his fellow Liberals. If Hudak takes the rural vote for granted, he will find that the road to the premier's office may be longer and harder than what he anticipates. As for NDP Leader Andrea Horwath, she will be looking to build upon the gains in Northern Ontario and will need the support of Southwestern Ontario for that to happen. If she expects her momentum to continue, she will need to listen attentively to rural residents who are becoming increasingly upset at seeing their communities taken over by foreign wind developers. Queen's Park politicians of all stripes need the rural vote. They ignore it at their peril. We should not allow ourselves to become disillusioned, despite the fact McGuinty has been given a reprieve. Mark Wagner Salem McGuinty fools us -- again What were the voters of Ontario thinking when they voted Dalton McGuinty in for the third time? McGuinty fools you once, shame on him; fools you three times, shame on you. If a salesperson sold you a product as bad as McGuinty's, would you purchase the same product two more times? At least there were two good things happening in the election: Nancy Branscombe and Cheryl Miller were not elected. In Branscombe's case, a law should be put in place that if a municipal councillor wants to run federally or provincially, they should have to give up their council seat -- not take a leave of absence -- and the person who came second would replace them. In Miller's case, if Progressive Conservative Leader Tim Hudak has the power to revoke party memberships to, he would show great leadership by revoking Miller's card. How dare she criticize her leader just before the election? The comment she made just could have cost Mr. Hudak seats. If you were the owner of a company and one of your employees criticized you in public, how long would he be in your employment? Ivan W. Kasiurak London Careful what you put online LOL! Wait, that's not funny. Who hasn't left a funny prank comment on a friend's Facebook wall, or had a friend upload a goofy photo of you at a less-than-flattering moment? It's all in good fun, right? Maybe not. What is posted online in jest could end up costing someone their next apartment, or even their job. Today's Internet user is a global publisher, spreading the latest gossip about their friends, relatives, and even customers, to unexpected audiences eager to learn more. Most social media users have no appreciation of the legal rights of other online users. And if you post something damaging about someone else, or if it happens to you, it may be impossible to redeem your online reputation. Yes, there is a growing industry of businesses who claim to be able to fix your online reputation, but our research has found these services may be prohibitively expensive for many or ineffective, so great care must be taken in choosing one. Don Mercer President Consumers Council of Canada Toronto Ask before you give, please The taxes we pay are to look after the necessary things within our city so why does the administration use it for other things, like the Youth Opportunities Unlimited or the University Of Western Ontario or many other operations that are registered not-for-profit operations? If I were to give them a donation, I would get a tax receipt for my gift and be able to deduct it from my income tax. I would at least have the right to choose who gets it. The taxes I pay are handed out to places and things I would never give to by the people I trusted with my money to look after the city. I feel I am entitled to a tax receipt for the money handed out to the not-for-profit operations that I am compelled to support through our city hall. No more gifts without asking us first. I want to know where my money is going and not to something that a councillor may have an interest in supporting. Enough of the hand outs. Douglas Flood London Young son's peanut allergy lets mom understand ban Regarding the article Peanut-butter replacement ban angers producer (Oct. 13). I am the parent of a child with a peanut allergy. Eating peanuts could kill my son. Therefore, my husband and I have taught him that it is not OK to share food with anyone, that he must ask if any food given to him may have peanuts, and that he must wash his hand before eating. He is under the age of six, and has been doing this since he was two years old. My son cannot live in a bubble, nor do I expect that everyone else in the world should cater to his misfortune. Any time people offer sympathy about his allergy, my reaction is \"Well, if I got to choose an allergy for him to have, this would be the one\". I can send him to school and, assuming that others follow the restriction on peanut products, rest assured that he will safely return home. I do understand the reasoning of the Thames Valley District school board's ban on peanut butter substitutes. I truly appreciate that the teachers, guardians of my child's life from 9:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., care so much, but where do we draw the line? One day I won't be there to pack my son's lunch for him, and there won't be a teacher there to monitor what everyone else is eating. It is the responsibility of the parent of the child with the allergy to teach the child safe practices, be it safe eating practices, or looking both ways before crossing the street. Melissa Stewardson Strathroy Canadians need to focus on shocking debt burdens Now that the election rhetoric and exaggerated promises are past, it's time to look at the fiscal realty facing the provinces and the nation. Having elected a minority provincial government has not done us any favours as hard choices will be more difficult to take. By our profligate lifestyle, exaggerated expectations and for the most part living on credit, both individually and provincially, we have accumulated a debt burden that approaches that of some European countries. Servicing the debt is requiring an ever-increasing part of the provincial budget. A modest proposal as to some of the things we might considers: * Raise the HST to 15%, with 1% going to the provincial government and 1% to the feds. No exceptions should be made, except perhaps fresh produce and fresh meat. If you buy and spend wisely, you pay less tax. * Make the 400-series highways toll roads. Why should those who never use the 401 pay for those who use it daily? Maybe 20 cents a kilometre would work, which would be about $40 to Toronto from London. Most of the highway infrastructure in the province dates from the '70s and '80s and will soon need to be upgraded or replaced. * All who receive income directly or indirectly from taxpayers should have any income over $50,000 a year reduced by 10%. That would include politicians, doctors, police officers, teachers, nurses, court officials etc., and the 7% fair share health surtax would be abolished. * Education money should be shifted from universities to community colleges and tenure abolished. All businesses and companies with 20 employees or more should have at least 10% of those employees apprentices or co-op students. * Electricity and water rates should rise to equal international levels and gasoline to $1.50 a litre. We will never conserve if it doesn't hurt not to. * Tommy Douglas said patients should pay part of their health-care costs to prevent abuse of the system and so a copayment scheme should be instituted with exceptions for significant financial hardship and catastrophic illnesses. * There should be a 1% wealth tax on personal wealth over $1 million with the exclusion of the primary residence. * Municipalities should have more taxing power such as a tax on individuals who live out of the city but work in the city and use city facilities. This could be administered through employers. Everyone will probably agree with much or part of this as long as someone else bears the costs. So there should be no cherry-picking. It's all or nothing. R.S.M. Eberhard London - - - Farming community faces immense hurdles everyday Have you ever thought about where your food comes from? I didn't -- until I started working in the agriculture industry nine years ago. I had a number of misconceptions about farming. I thought it was simple. You take a seed, you plant it, you watch it grow, you harvest it, and then you sell the fruits of your labour. This is the process, but the complexities are enormous. There are endless circumstances that need to be evaluated and responded to -- most of which the farmer has little control over. What other entrepreneur builds a business model without knowing what the selling price for their product will be when they bring it to market? Weather can make or break a season. Inside of a short 120-day window (which is the average number of frost-free days in Canada), the grower must get his crop from seed to market, despite whatever unusual weather patterns may be in the cue. Today, farming is more science than art. A grower has to be a climatologist, an agronomist, a commodities futures expert, a chemist, an electrician, a mechanical engineer, a banker and a trouble-shooter. So why get into this business? In many cases, farmers were born into agriculture and just don't know anything else. Ask them why they stay and you'll hear about the freedom that comes with being a steward of the land. They take great pride in raising animals and crops to literally feed the world. Interestingly, most farmers have convinced their children that farming isn't a viable career. As a result, a large percentage of farms are owned and operated by farmers in their 50s and older. Ever worried about the cost of food? Lost sleep about the price of your next loaf of bread? Probably not. We take for granted a plentiful supply of safe, healthy and inexpensive food every day. How does this happen with so many other things continuing going up in price? Successful farmers have had to build a business model based on economies of scale: become large enough to employ massive equipment to reduce your overhead costs and use high tech seeds and input products to maximize crop yields. Technology has been the biggest advancement in agriculture in the last 20 years. GPS technology has created precision farming, which has reduced input costs. Biotech seeds have dramatically increased yields in corn, soybean and canola. Crop protection products have also become more selective and are used less because of the biotech crop systems that have been developed. This also means growers must continually educate themselves on new technologies. While we all have images of farmers sunbathing in Mexico all winter, in reality they are going back to school constantly to learn about new technologies and management skills. They use down time to assess global markets to determine their next year's crops, decide what nutrients and crop protection products are required to ensure the best yields, manage their fixed costs of labour and equipment, and take inventory of their financial capital and supplier relationships. All with the anticipation of what Mother Nature will do to help or hinder their business goals. It's a thankless job. So the next time you see a farmer, give him or her a hug. Say thank you for the food they put on your plate. It's only because there's so much on their plate, that there's so much on yours.

People either want to decrease their fertiliser application and reduce costs or fertilise areas of the field more productively.

The ECa measurements made directly over the tile drains were smaller than those observed further away due to the presence of the drains.

We'll have presentations from management, followed by a Q&A session this morning. We'll then have a break at 8:45 Mountain. We'll resume again at 9 o' clock with the presentations from our business unit, followed by another opportunity to ask your questions. And, finally, we'll dismiss around 11 o' clock for our trip to our Ogden facility. So, we're looking forward to a very interesting, hopefully, and educational day. But, before we begin, let me remind you that today's discussion may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on the Company's expectations as of today's date, September 22, 2011, and involve risks and uncertainties that can cause the Company's actual results to differ materially. With that, I'll turn the podium over to Angelo. ANGELO BRISIMITZAKIS, CEO, COMPASS MINERALS INTERNATIONAL INC.: Great, thanks you, Peggy. I hope everyone can hear me okay. I'd like to welcome everyone this morning, good morning. I'm Angelo Brisimitzakis, CEO of Compass Minerals. I'd like to welcome you to our first ever Investor Day event. I hope you find it informative and helpful in your assessment of our company. Our objective today is to provide a detailed introduction to Compass Minerals for those who are new to our company, and a deeper perspective for those who have been following us. For both purposes, the place to start is with our company vision and mission statement. The core takeaway is that we are committed to being a leading mineral supplier, creating long-term, sustainable value for all our stakeholders. It's possible to trace our company as far back as 1844. But, the events that created Compass Minerals of today started in 1988, with the formation of North American Salt Company by the Harris Group. In 1990, North American Salt acquired Sifto in Canada, a transaction that included the Goderich mine. In 1993, Harris acquired Great Salt Lake Minerals, which brought the SOP business. In 1997, IMC Global acquired the Harris Chemical Group. Four years later, Apollo created Compass Minerals when it acquired the salt and SOP assets from IMC. Apollo spun out 60% of the stock in a public offering in late 2003, and sold the remainder of their stock in secondary offerings the following year. We started as a simple salt company. The Company that we will present to you today is a much larger, more integrated company built upon three essential minerals -- salt, sulfate of potash, and magnesium chloride, but still keenly focused on creating profitable growth and superior shareholder value. We have assembled the deep and talented leadership team. Today, you will hear from five members of our team, including Rod Underdown, our CFO, the leaders of our business units, and our functional leader in charge of manufacturing and engineering. The most conventional and familiar way to present our company is by our two operating segments; salt and specialty fertilizers. The salt segment is composed of three business units; North American Highway, which includes bulk deicing products for highway use, as well as bulk salts sold in industrial uses; our United Kingdom business unit, which encompasses our highway deicing business and deep store records management and waste storage businesses; and, our consumer and industrial business unit, which includes consumer and professional deicers, human and animal nutrition and water care products. Our specialty fertilizers segment, which is focused on SOP, is made up of our operations at the Great Salt Lake Minerals, and Big Quill Resources in Canada, which we acquired earlier this year. You can see our summary financials for the first 12 months ending June 30. We're about a $1.1 billion in revenue, $222 million in operating income, and a healthy 20% operating margin. A less familiar way to approach our company is to focus on the three essential minerals; salt, SOP and magnesium chloride, that form the basis of our businesses. We began as a salt company, and salt still provides the largest portion of our revenue. We produce salt through three district production processes. We mine rock salt for use in highway and consumer deicing and other applications. We create higher purity salt through mechanical evaporation for human and animal nutrition, water care and industrial uses, and we produce salt through solar evaporation for applications that include deicing, water care and animal nutrition. The second of our three essential minerals is sulfate potash, a high margin, specialty fertilizer, used primarily to improve the yield in quality of high value crops. We produce SOP through environmentally friendly solar evaporation at the Great Salt Lake, and by ion exchange at Big Quill Lake in Canada. Magnesium chloride is the emerging member of our three mineral family of products, which we sell through all three of our North American-focused business units. We produce Mag chloride as an SOP co-product by solar evaporation at the Great Salt Lake, and sell it in its liquid form as a specialty highway deicer and deduster, and in solid form as a premium consumer deicer. Mag chloride is also sold by our specialty fertilizer business as a crop nutrient. Our two primary products, salt and SOP, are naturally occurring minerals that are essential to living, safety, and overall quality of life. Because of its essential uses, salt tends to be recession resistant. And, because shipping cost is a significant portion of delivered cost for both deicing products, salt markets tend to be highly regional. While our salt is primarily used in deicing, salt is truly an amazing mineral, with more than 14,000 end uses. And, we serve in expanding array of those uses. Our SOP business differs from salt in that it serves more of a global market, about 25% of our SOP sales are for export markets, with particular strength in North America and Latin America. It also offers growth opportunities in a recovering economy, because SOP is a preferred product for high value fruits and vegetables. And, because SOP is primarily applied in the spring and fall, it helps to balance the winter concentration of our deicing business. The advantages shared by our salt and SOP products include relatively high margins, advantaged assets that typically give us lower production costs than our competitors and significant barriers to entry. In summary, our two primary products share important advantages, while exhibiting differences that generate an attractive balance of stability and growth potential. Put it together, and you have CMP today; a company based on essential products, advantaged assets, sustainable operations, and a strategy focused on profitable growth. And, as the slide shows, we derive nearly 50% of our revenues from highway deicing. And, about one-third from our consumer industrial business unit, approximately 18% from specialty fertilizer, and about 1% from our novel records management and waste storage business. We've been looking at Compass Minerals from a variety of perspectives, and this slide combines a couple of them. From the top down, it segments our products by their broad applications, deicing, water care and nutrition. From the bottom up, we start with our reporting segments. The two approaches meet in the middle in the markets we serve. The important point here is that while we serve a number of distinct and attractive markets, our company is organized to realize efficiencies and synergies in serving those markets, whether those are in production, marketing, or distribution. This is a slide that you've probably all seen before in some form. It summarizes our consistent strategy for turning our strength into long term profitable growth. In the balance of my presentation, I'll walk through each of these elements in our execution against them. One of Compass Minerals' most important competitive differentiators is our strategically advantaged assets. This slide summarizes those unique assets. The first picture is of our Goderich, Ontario mine, the largest salt mine in the world. It has the advantage of a thick salt deposit, 100 feet thick, compared to most of our competitors' mines that access seam that is only about 20 to 30 feet thick. That enables us to more efficient -- to use more efficient mining techniques and to extract more salt for each foot of advance. In addition, the mine is located on a deep-water port that gives it significant logistical advantages in serving key north American snow-belt markets. Perhaps our most uniquely advantaged asset is our facility on the Great Salt Lake, where we produce SOP as well as solar salt and magnesium chloride, for more than 40,000 acres of solar ponds. We are the only producer that can efficiently access the Lake's most concentrated brine. Products from the solar evaporation facility are sold through each CMP's three primarily businesses. Our SOP is sold to growers throughout the US and to strategic export markets. The solar salt is sold to highway deicing customers and is used in consumer and industrial applications, and magnesium chloride is used by all three business units. Our third advantage asset is our mine at Winsford in the United Kingdom, the only dedicated salt mine in the UK. The Winsford mine products rock salt for highway deicing, and gives us virtually unlimited storage space. Because, the vacant portions of the mine are for ideal conditions for our record management and way storage businesses, we gain significant advantage over our competitors who rely on surface facilities that require significant energy to achieve conditions that occur naturally in our mine. And, here's what we're doing to realize the value of those advantaged assets. Let's look at each of the three essential minerals. And, here's what we're doing to realize the value of those advantaged assets. Let's look at each of the three essential minerals. Salt. Last year, we completed a $70 million project to expand the annual capacity of our Goderich rock salt mine from $7.5 million tons to $9 million per year. We will tap this additional capacity as needed as we compete for both a larger share of normal market growth and for more spot sales during severe winters. The increased capacity will also support the needs of our consumer and investor business. Specialty fertilizer. At the Great Salt Lake, we are executing a three phased plan that will significantly expand our lower cost, pond-based SOP production, while meaningfully reducing our unit production costs over time. The acquisition of Big Quill Resources gives us the capability to produce higher purity SOP, and we're looking for ways to leverage that capability to expand our sales, specialty AG and non-AG products. Finally, the expansion of SOP production at the Great Salt Lake will also nearly double, with no additional investment or magnesium chloride coke product production capacity by 2015. Our second strategy element is to fully leverage the value of our products and competitive position by being selectively aggressive on pricing. As you can see from this slide, over the past five years, highway deicing prices have increased at about a 9% CAGR, C&I prices have increased by about a 7% CAGR, and 15% for specialty fertilizers. Of course, favorable weather and/or market conditions have assisted us in achieving these recent super-sized price increases, and therefore, we cannot count on these above normal trends continuing indefinitely. However, what you can count on is that CMP will price its products for maximum value within whatever market or whether environment we are selling in. Our third strategy element is to drive profitable growth through new products and new applications. We utilize a disciplined stage and gate product innovation process, which separates the product development effort into distinct stages, separated by management decision gates, to systemically and quickly move potential profitable new products from ideas to launch. It is both an effective and competitively important process. We expect it will enable us to develop new vitality products that will generate an increasing percentage of sustainable gross margins. I'd like to provide a bit more detail about magnesium chloride, since it's the least well-known of our minerals, and will be the focus of our efforts to develop new products and enter new markets. We currently produce about 550,000 tons of this mineral annually at the Great Salt Lake as a co-product with salt and SOP through the solar evaporation process. By leveraging our pond sealing technology, we will be able to double this capacity by 2015 with no additional capital expenditure. What we find intriguing about magnesium chloride is that it is in some form sold by each of our businesses. We sell Mag chloride in two forms; a brine -- our highway deicing business sells magnesium chloride is a high performance liquid deicer that melts at lower temperatures than traditional rock salt. We also use it as an additive to rock salt, to increase its deficiency in some specialty deicing applications, and is also sold as a dust control product. And, our specialty fertilizer business sells a liquid Mag chloride product as Chloromag, an additive for chloride deficient soil. In its crystal form, Mag chloride is sold as a packaged, premium consumer and professional deicing product. It is, in fact, the gold standard of deicing products, in that it is a high performance and environmentally friendly mineral product, safe for pets and lawns, and has very little damaging impact on hard surfaces, such as driveways and sidewalks. The fourth element of our strategy captures our emphasis on achieving operational excellence throughout our operations. In brief, the components of this effort include our continuous improvement process, CIP, which removes activities that don't add value and provide a variety of tools for improvement in manufacturing processes and safety. This strategy also includes best practice manufacturing process for maintenance of our plants and equipment, as well as our SOP yield improvement activities I referred to earlier. Jack will provide more details on these initiatives in his presentation. The fifth element of our strategy is to improve our financial structure. That improvement begins, of course, with the performance of our business segments. And, as this slide shows, our salt segment has achieved long term improvement in sales operating income and margins. Sales of this segment are primarily responsive to long term demand factors. The deicing business does experience short term fluctuation reflecting the severity of winter weather, which is why we provide pro forma results that reflect normal weather conditions, but is only slightly affected by the economic cycle. We have delivered even stronger profitable growth in our specialty fertilizer segment, although this segment did have the significant uptick in sales in 2008, when potash prices peaked, and, a subsequent downturn when the market quickly reversed. Sales in this segment tend to follow the broader agricultural economic cycle, which is loosely tied to the global economic conditions. And, here, are our consolidated CMP results. Our earnings and operating margins have been solid through a variety of economic and weather cycles. Our results in 2010 were an exception to that upward trend, due to some significant short term operational issues that are now essentially behind us. However, the new challenges we are now having to overcome from 2011 and 2012 are the effects of the severe tornado affecting our salt operations at Goderich, and a poor solar evaporation season at the Great Salt Lake, affecting our SOP harvest. These items will be covered by others later. Our strong performance, including robust cash flow from operations has enabled us to steadily reduce our leverage ratio. Since we became a public company in late 2003, we have reduced our leverage ration from 4.6 times adjusted EBITDA at the end of 2003 to about 1.7 times at the end of 2010. That accomplishment has been recognized with steadily improving debt ratings, thus providing us with increased financial flexibility as we move forward. The sixth and final element of our profitable growth strategy is making strategic acquisitions that synergistically strengthen our current businesses. In January of this year, we acquired Big Quill Resources, located in Saskatchewan, Canada, for $56 million. Big Quill Resources, with a current annual SOP capacity of about 40,000 tons utilizes a production process that produces a higher purity product that is appropriate for higher value specialty uses. Agricultural applications, which account for about two-thirds of its current sales, include drip irrigation and fertigation, as well as time release formulations. Non-agricultural specialty applications, which represent about one-third of Big Quill Resources sales volume includes abrasives, pharmaceuticals, food and other specialty applications. Sales are less seasonal than SOP sales for agricultural uses. Importantly, both AG and non-AG specialty applications offer strong synergies with Great Salt Lake minerals in the areas of logistics, production and sales. I began my presentation with our vision and our mission, which focuses on creating growing, long term value for all our stakeholders. As this slide shows, we have delivered on that promise. Since we became a public company, Compass Minerals total shareholder return has averaged about 36% per year, significantly exceeding key stock market benchmark indices. In the balance of the program today, I think you will gain a better understanding on how our combination of essential minerals, advantaged assets, and disciplined growth strategy will enable us to continue to deliver consistent, profitable growth in a variety of economic or weather conditions. With that, I'll turn the podium over to Rod Underdown, who will give us a financial overview. Rod? ROD UNDERDOWN, CFO, COMPASS MINERALS INTERNATIONAL INC.: Great. Thank you, Angelo, and morning, everyone. I'm going to spend the next -- about 20 minutes, walking through some target ranges that we believe are reasonable, possible outcomes for our business over the next four years. And, I'll discuss some of the major assumptions we've used at arriving at those target ranges. I also plan to discuss some areas of uses of cash flow and those priorities, and a little bit on enterprise valuation. But, before diving into those matters, I'm sure some of you are curious about the effects on the Company, of the recent tornado that we had in Goderich. And, so, I'd like to start there, and then move directly into our segment outlook. So, we'll take a look at those near term matters first. I'm going to give you some sense of the financial implications that there are for the tornado that touched down at the Goderich mine and the Goderich plant in August. Later, Jack Leunig will share with you what's happening operationally to regain full plant and mine capabilities. It is particularly interesting to note that the Goderich plant and mine are actually two distinct facilities in our portfolio. In fact, they're about two to two and a half miles away from each other, and yet the tornado did hit both of those facilities in a spade of bad luck. First thing I want to say about the financial implications of the storm is that we have a very comprehensive insurance policy in place. And, we expect our losses to both assets, as well as for the various losses related to business interruption to be fully covered, of course, subject to a small deductible. However, the interesting thing is that the timing of the insurance recovery, both the accrual for accounting purposes and the cash receipt, in comparison to the events that will give rise to those losses will not be in the same financial statement period. So, we'll regularly update our investors on the estimated loss incurred, along with what we've recorded for insurance recoveries, if anything in those interim periods, so that the impact can be considered in your assessment of what a more normal operating environment is. In terms of the financial effects, we do expect to incur losses from the storm, and our preliminary estimates for those are about $30 million in the second half of 2011, with most of those occurring in the fourth quarter. Now, there will be some residual effect into 2011 and we don't have an estimate of those yet, but our insurance is currently expected to fully cover those various kind of losses. In terms of the losses, there's several different kinds. There's impaired asset recovery. There's the cost of cleaning up the sites. There's the increase cost of manufacturing our products compared to what would have been the cost had we not had the tornado. There's the incremental cost of purchasing some products to serve customers instead of producing at our own locations -- our own facilities. There's the incremental cost of transporting products to customers from freight illogical locations by servicing it with our product. And, there's the earnings loss from business cancelled or foregone due to lack of product availability. Another interesting item to note is that both the impairment and the insurance recovery for our asset impairments will be recorded as income statement items. However, the cost to refurbish or replace the assets will be recorded as an asset addition in our balance sheet as a normal capital expenditure item. Now, many of those assets that were damaged in the storm were older with a relatively low book value in relation to the replacement value, which is what our insurance policy covers. Thus, it is entirely possible that the net impact over the full length of the insurance settlement could -- would result in a net book gain from the event. The time period involved in recognizing those losses and recoveries is likely to be more than a year. And, now, while it's hard to predict the outcome of the insurance recovery, with precision at this time, again, we will report the estimated losses and any recovery impacts each quarter, likely, as a special item in our results. And, that, hopefully, will provide you with greater transparency into our normal operations. To summarize, we expect there to be little long term impact associated with the tornado, though the near term impact will affect our operating results at least through the winter. We will record insurance recoveries as the accounting rules allow, and we'll report our expected losses and recoveries quarterly to keep you apprised of our normal operating results. So, having said that, that is certainly the most significant impact on our short term outlook. And, just to be clear, the outlook that you have in front of you here assumes no insurance recovery is recognized in our reported results. And, just to be clear, that does not reflect economic reality, since we do expect a full recovery. It's just that the accounting rules may prevent us from recognizing the benefits until we have a final settlement with the insurers. However, we expect to recognize some benefit in 2011, but that is not reflected here. With that in mind, we expect our reported results to show salt segment operating earnings in the second half of 2011 to be similar to the prior year period, again, significantly reduced by the insurable loss. Bid prices have continued to average solidly above 3% on our awarded business, and the bid volume did grow by 4% in the market. However, when the insurance -- when the tornado occurred, we did scale back temporarily some of our bidding in conjunction with that supply uncertainty. So, our awarded bid volumes are expected to be flat with prior year. Turning to our specialty fertilizer segment, we've similarly been dealt a bad hand by mother nature, as we reported to you in August. And, similar to our salt business, there shouldn't be any long term consequences to this event, but nonetheless, it will -- the 2011 second half and full year 2012 will show the effects of the wet, cool summer period that we've experienced here at the Great Salt Lake, compared to the more normal, typical hot arid climate. Ron Bryan will run through some of the operational details, but the more limited production -- but there is expected to be more limited production available for the next 12 to 15 months. And that has us adjusting to create the most value in the near term period. So, operationally, we're proceeding with pond sealing for full completion by the next solar evaporation period. Now, that won't affect the current fall harvest for 2011 or 2012 production in sale, but it should maximize production in 2013. With these constrained volumes our sales force is also focused on delivering the highest netback and strategic customer relationship, and now expect to sell approximately 70,000 tons in each of the next two quarters, and then, around 325,000 tons in 2012. The production limitation will also impact unit cost. So, we expect second half 2011 cost to be modestly higher than the first half, with a larger increase in the third quarter. Along with our expected $625 per ton average price for the rest of 2011, we expect acceleration in the expansion of our specialty fertilizer operating earnings per ton during the next two quarters. Beyond that, the lower production volumes in 2012 are expected to increase those per-unit costs by about $60 next year when compared to 2011. It's too early to predict 2012 SOP pricing, but it currently seems that there are no signs of price weakness in the market. Okay. So, back to more mid-term thoughts. On the next several pages, I will walk through with you the history of our results, which you've seen before. Now, it's helpful to understand the history and the context upon which we are building. Based on that understanding, we'll put forth some reasonable ranges or goal posts of our target, which show a range of possible outcomes by the end of the four to five year period. The ranges are not meant to capture the 2015 weather impacts of mild or severe winter. Rather, these goal posts are meant to provide management insight into a reasonable, forward growth ranges that are likely to be present over this period. Historically, salt revenues have grown steadily. Of course, each year has winter weather variability. Volume has been steady even through economic downturns, showing the true, recession-resistant nature of our highway deicing product that has no cost effective substitutes, and is an essential product for public safety. Over time, salt pricing has grown at 3% to 4%, but more recently, seemed to accelerate following a period where producers brought on less capacity than there was growth, and that created supply/demand drivers that favored producers. Going forward, we expect the longer term historical volume and pricing trends to continue, with pricing partially influenced by the relative severity of the winters. Specialty fertilizer for many years was characterized by relatively steady domestic and international demand increase, with a little more international growth led by China. History also shows a long period of stable pricing with SOP being priced at a premium to MOP. For years, the potash industry had essentially -- potash industry supply had outstripped demand, and large producers tended to stay disciplined with their production. This led to steady, predictable pricing. Now, this low investment over many years contributed to increasing fertilizer pricing and volatility as demand increased. This was significantly driven by crop demand factors, both food and non-food, which began driving fertilizer uses higher as farm incomes advanced rapidly in the last few years, following years of stagnation. As MOP pricing increased; therefore, so did SOP pricing. Coming off record pricing in 2009, but also depressed demand, the market seemed to find equilibrium in 2010, albeit at a price that was well above the history of the past decade. So, going forward, we expect potash fertilizers to continue to be strong and growing demand, and SOP should play a critical role in meeting those growing needs. The price achieved will be based on supply/demand factors, which in agriculture, always seem to be somewhat difficult to predict. The factors for SOP, such as demand for traditional SOP crops, penetration of SOP into other non-traditional crops, which could increase the slice of the potash pie that SOP holds, and farmer economics, which include some substitution. And how that impacts the price spread will all be relevant to the future. Given the value of SOP to growers of most any crops, we believe our current and proposed expansion should be essentially fully placed in the market. But, depending on SOP penetration into the domestic market for non-traditional crops and the resulting international mix, our average spreads could stay where they are, or they could contract versus the MOP price. The foundation of our price assumption includes a rational MOP market in the event new capacity comes online in chunks, while demand growth is more steadily rising. Significant short term pricing upside from here seems unlikely, again, in the very near term period. So, after considering all of these factors, the sales growth CAGR of only 5% seems meager but possible on the low side, while the 9% upside certainly seems attainable, given these market dynamics that I've just outlined. While the sales growth target follows more of a historical path in the high single digits, our operating earnings growth target could be noticeably higher than the sales growth rate as it has been historically, which would lead to expanding operating margin percentages. This earnings leverage is driven by several factors that could play out. First, 2010 salt production costs were impacted by low production at our North American mines due a strike and construction delays. And we've also had problems achieving efficiencies at our SOP plant that should be very attainable. As a result, our 2010 per unit costs were higher than historically, or we would expect for them to be in the future. In fact, our 2011 per unit salt cost were on track to achieve and get very close to the 2009 levels for the 2010 production year until the recent tornado swept through Goderich. While this is a temporary setback, we don't expect that impact to carry on past the '11/'12 winter. And, as a more normal operating environment returns in salt, and our marketing efforts are successful in placing the additional SOP tons with growers, our costs are expected to meaningfully improve to produce earnings growth rates that we would expect to significantly exceed sales growth rates. Additionally, when Jack Leunig takes the podium momentarily, you'll hear about how we're optimistic that our productivity initiatives are expected to yield significant benefits in the near term. The combination of these factors under most any reasonable scenario is expected to result in margin expansion by the time we reach 2015. The most likely outcome is for the margin percentage to land well above the 2003/2007 range by 2015. Of course, it wouldn't be a good financial discussion about CMP without having a discussion about cash flows in the future and what we intend to do with those to create value. I presented the history here of our cash flows from operations, and as you can see, the salt and fertilizer businesses both contributed to a significant step change in cash from operations beginning in 2008. Our 2009 levels were lower, as we invested in inventories to capture the full value of a short term favorability in a supply contract. That decision benefited cash flows in 2010 and is expected to favorably impact cash flows through 2012. I'll give an overview of our capital spending forecast next, but as we previously stated, there are relatively few acquisition candidates out there who are right in the sweet spot of what we do. We did acquire the only SOP producer in North America earlier this year. And, just finally, we also don't have a targeted capital structure, but for the relative stability of our salt franchise, any major transaction undertaken that you see up here could safely be completed by modestly increasing our leverage. Having said that, we prefer internal payback projects from this list. As you saw in the previous chart, our capital investment has consumed only about 40% of our cash flows from operations historically. Our spending includes our commitment to invest amounts necessary to safely operate our facilities in a reliable manner. And, this amount has averaged about $50 million over the past several years. In many asset intensive businesses, capital investment is a little lumpy, since major sustainable investment is necessary for critical infrastructure on a non-routine basis. We expect to make some of these non-recurring investments over the next several years to firmly secure our assets into the next decades. Right now, we would expect our outlook for this period to include about $25 million of such investment per year. We continue to be bullish about our advantaged assets. And, while the most significant investment in salt capacity have occurred, primarily at the Goderich mine, as has largely been completed and should take us to the end of this outlook period, we are likely to further invest in our SOP business, where high margin, solid demand, are creating a positive environment to continue to invest in this advantaged asset. Ron Bryan will discuss the specifics of our Phase II plans in a moment. The Phase II expansion of the Goderich -- or at the Great Salt Lake represents the majority of our payback spending over this outlook period. But, in addition, this outlook period includes a plan to invest in a continuous mining operation at the Goderich mine over the next couple of years. Again, Jack Leunig will discuss more details about that in just a moment. The Compass Minerals dividend has always represented an important part of the value story for our investors. While we were more of a yield play in the years immediately following our 2003 IPO, our dividend still retains its prominence. I believe our 10% dividend growth CAGR represents the balanced approach between direct cash returns, and at the same time, investing in our business to achieve more profitable growth. I might be stating the obvious, but our business is somewhat seasonal, and while the earnings from our non-seasonal consumer and industrial salt products and somewhat counter seasonal sulfate of potash business, had somewhat reduced our quarterly earnings fluctuations across the year, we tend to earn significantly more in the first and fourth quarters of the year, when demand for our deicing products is seasonally strongest. However, our cash flow and working capital seasonality is different. You'll notice from this chart that our working capital typically bottoms out during the second quarter, at which time we commence production of deicing salts for the upcoming winter season. Our working capital then tends to peak in the fourth quarter, when we've sold a portion of our deicing inventory, but have not quite turned many of those sales into cash. During the first quarter and early second quarter, a significant portion of those deicing inventories are converted into cash following the sell of those products. And, then, we begin the cycle all over again -- probably not news to you. But, you'll notice a couple of things here. First, the quarterly trends are somewhat predictable each year. Our trough to peak investment had been relatively stable at around $60 million to $70 million from 2006 to 2008. And, in 2009, we invested a large amount into the specialty fertilizer inventory during the fertilizer and broader economic malaise that existed then. We intend on liquidating that position during 2010 to 2012, which should result in lower trough to peak working capital builds as we showed that we can do in 2010. Beyond that, you can expect an increase to our working capital trough to peak investment over that medium term horizon, closer to our pre-2009 levels as we restore specialty fertilizers inventories to more normal levels, and expect our businesses to grow. Now, I know that there are a few new folks to the story in the room, so a common question that we get is, how do I value CMP, or what are the comps? And, as most of you know, there isn't a really good comp -- another public company, that has our portfolio mix. K+S is larger and has both salt and potash, but their potash mix is much than ours. A comparison to the potash fertilizer companies also seems logical. However, potash currently represents 20% to 25% of Compass Minerals. In many respects, our salt business is similar to aggregate. And, some of those attributes include that we both mine rock minerals, and because the value of those minerals is low in relation to its weight, shipping is a very expensive part, creating regional businesses with very predictable competitors in those markets. Both salt and aggregates are also fairly consolidated industries. So, I recognize while this isn't a perfect comparison, and I think our business model is a little more solid, aggregates valuations also provide a useful comparison. So, in summary, there are some short term weather effects that we'll be experiencing, and will be challenging to show significant earnings growth in the short term period. But, I really am excited about our prospects. We have advantaged assets, attractive markets, and to some extent, a fortress business. We're committed to executing the plans that we've laid out here today. And, so, with that, I'd like to turn the podium over to Jack Leunig, our VP of Engineering and Operations. JACK LEUNIG, VICE PRESIDENT OF MANUFACTURING AND ENGINEERING, COMPASS MINERALS INTERNATIONAL INC.: Thanks, Rod, and, good morning. Today, I'm hoping to give you a little greater understanding of some of the things that Angelo and Rod have touched on, a little more in depth explanation about what we do at our various assets, the products we make there and how we make them, the productivity programs that we're running, along with a couple of major productivity projects that we have on the table and we're working on. And, then, finally, a little more detail on the situation at Goderich and where we stand today. So, we have in total 15 production and packaging assets. We have three underground salt mines, one in the UK, one in Canada, and one in the US, four mechanical brine evaporation plants. And I'll give a little more detail on these as we go. In North America, we have the solar evaporation operation here in Ogden that you're going to get a lot of detail on today from Corey and on some tours. We have recently acquired ion exchange, manufacturing, location in Wynyard, Saskatchewan in Canada. Three packaging sites -- we do a little bit of screening and processing there, but primarily they just package product that we bring from other locations. And, then, we have a couple of records management storage locations in the UK. So, first, the underground salt mining. If you're familiar with mining in other kind of businesses, some of the ones that Rod talked about, potash and aggregates, there are some similarities. So, ours probably won't look that different or new to you, if you're not -- we'll give you some understanding of it. Today, we really have two that we operate. We do drill and blast process here in North America at both our Goderich and Cote Blanche facilities, which I'll talk a little bit more about in a minute. And, then, we have a continuous miner that we've been operating in the UK for a number of years. We just purchased the second replacement, and that's a technology that we're going to translate here. I'll talk a little more about that a second. We process -- in both cases, we process and screen and size the product underground, and then hoist it to the surface in hoisting equipment. We store at above ground only -- very little underground storage. We load it onto ships, barges and trucks, mostly for deicing highways, and also consumer deicing and a little bit into a couple of other applications. Our mechanical evaporation process -- it's a mining process too, but we inject water -- brine, actually, dilute brine down to the salt deposit. It extracts, it dissolves salt, which we bring back to the surface in a more concentrated brine. And, then, we run that brine through a mechanical evaporation plant that's typically fuelled by the kind of energy sources traditionally used in a lot of industries, natural gas, oil or electricity. And, we make a higher purity salt here. The salt gets crystallized and it goes into food applications, animal, nutrition. So, it's a higher purity than what we mine underground, and it's suitable for human and animal consumption. Solar evaporation, that's the process here at Ogden, it's just at a very high level. We, basically, pump brines that naturally occur in the Great Salt Lake. We put them in large shallow ponds where the sun beats down on them in a good year, and evaporates the water. As the brine is concentrated, various minerals precipitate out, and then we process those further in the plants that you'll see today to make either salt or sulfate of potash. And, at the tail end, we have Mag chloride coming off as a -- magnesium chloride coming off as a co-product that we also evaporate and turn into a solid or sell in liquid form. And, then, the newest facility that we have, at least our portfolio, is in Saskatchewan, as I said. It's an ion exchange process. It also uses naturally occurring brines from Big Quill Lake, which are rich in sulfate -- sodium sulfate. We combine them with potassium chloride and exchange the sodium and potassium and lined up with sulfate of potash, which would crystallize dry and package. It is the highest purity sulfate or potash that we produce, and it goes into a number of, kind of, specialty applications that Ron will talk about later. Productivity, as Angela said, it's a key driver for us, and we are focused on it. I'm going to talk about a couple of different things. We run a couple of processes that, kind of, incrementally are designed to continuously improve our cost position and our efficiency year-over-year. And then I'll talk about, in a little more detail, about a couple of major projects what I would call, kind of, step change efficiency improvements and continuous mining in the pond sealing here at Ogden. The first that I want to talk about is what we call our continuous improvement process or CIP. It is similar to programs other companies run. In fact, we took a cross section of employees from a variety of locations and looked at the tools that folks used in lean manufacturing and Six Sigma. We extracted those tools that we thought best applied to our operations, and we developed a standardized approach specifically for Compass Minerals, based on this employee input, developed training packages for it. And, over the last year, we've trained virtually 100% of our operator population on the fundamentals of those tools. And, we've trained a few hundred people on how to use those tools from a leadership perspective to lead events. It empowers employees, it engages them. It looks for non-value added work and inefficiency. They find ways to take it out. Management facilitates that when needed with money and support. We think it's a great way to drive improvement in a lot of our operations, which are fairly people intensive. You know, the processes that we run have a lot of human hands involvement, so they're the best folks to help us drive out waste and improve those processes. At the end of the day, I think we wind up with employees that perform better or are more engaged in their work and help us be more productive and efficient. The second kind of process that we're focused on is around maintenance. We call it RAM. The acronym stands for Reliable Asset Management. It's aimed at making our assets more reliable to try to move away from fixing things when they break in an emergency fashion, which has got the greatest impact on your operations and always is the highest cost. To maintenance of assets, detecting when they're about to fail or when failure is coming and take action proactively to make repairs so that they don't actually break down, do them on a plan basis -- always least impact on the operation on lowest cost. And, it should elevate the reliability of the asset, and allow us to produce more from the same base of equipment. We are taking practices from a variety of companies there. We have a third party that advises us, and we've developed, again, those processes to be specific to our assets and our plants to improve that reliability. And, then, a couple of exciting productivity projects, these are -- I've been doing this a long time. These two projects I'm going to talk about are really good ones. I feel great about them. I think the business units do as well, and the sites are engaged in them. The first is continuous mining. As we've said, we use it currently in our mine in the UK. We've used it for a number of years. So, we have a pretty good handle on how it works and how it can help us reduce cost and improve efficiency. We are going to purchase two of these continuous drum miners, we call them. And, basically, the front drum on that machine that you're looking at in the photo rotates. It has picks that, basically, fracture off the salt from the face. And, then, it puts that material into a couple of low profile haul trucks that move back and forth from that machine to a conveyor to convey the salt away from the face. It takes out a lot of steps. Our current process for doing the same work requires five machines versus this one where we undercut, overcut, drill and blast. And, it really -- most of the productivity comes from maintenance and the maintenance materials required. Really, in the long term, it's a lower capital approach as well, because there's less equipment to buy over time. The first step, we have some infrastructure improvements that we have to make in order to implement, but then going forward, it's a better capital approach. Fewer machines, easier to maintain. We don't use explosives. The blast fumes in an underground mine are always an issue that you have to manage around, so we eliminate a lot of those. And we also think it's going to reduce or eliminate something that we call scaling, which is where we have to be continuously ensuring that there's no loose material hanging on the ceilings and walls that can fall down and hurt somebody or damage equipment. And, we think the removal of those explosives takes a lot of stress out of the salt that we don't mine, so that we'll be doing a lot less of that scaling. So, exciting project for us, and technology we purchase and know how to operate. So, we're excited about it. And, then, we call it a sustainability project -- really, for a business like ours, anything we can do to produce more product from the same amount of reserve improves the sustainability of our business. We know that's important. We also have some products that we mine and we do alternative -- or that we produce that we think are -- better for the environment than standard products; some high end stuff that, probably, Keith will talk about. And, we use our unused spaces -- excuse me, the store waste or records in a couple of locations and make use of those caverns that we've created going forward. The one I want to talk a little more about is the pond sealing of the Great Salt Lake. We say that we had leakage. Probably seepage would be a better word. It's a real -- it's a relatively small amount of material that gets into the strata and migrates horizontally in the current system, the picture on the left. But, when you have the amount of acreage and the miles of dike area that we have, that relatively small seepage of material that you've already evaporated, that you've already put time and effort into, adds up to be a pretty significant impact for us. So, we use something called acre feet. It might not be familiar to everybody. The way I like to look at this project is we can from the same footprint -- from the same evaporation assets, produce about 60% more harvest. Now, we need a plant to produce -- to process it in, but that's a pretty significant increase in output from a fixed asset base. So, it's a great project for us. And, you'll see some more of that out there, I think, on the tour. Now, if I could go a little more to the instantaneous, everybody knows we had this tornado. It is bad luck that it struck both of our facilities a couple of miles apart. We had -- first, talking about the mine, we had significant damage on the surface. The underground assets, of course, don't see that wind. They're pretty far down, so we really had very little impact underground, other than the fact that we couldn't mine because we lost power. So, in addition to the structures that got knocked down, we lost our power distribution system. What's really helping us today, and we listed it under successes there, is that the expansion that we put in really increased our ability to produce from less assets, nearly the full expected output of the mine. So, the new expanded hoist was not damaged. The new large dome that we put in, and all the conveying equipment were, essentially, not damaged. So, once we got power restored, which the guys at the site did in really record time, and the ability to locate -- to load ships, to move material away from the mine, we were able to resume mining. And, as of today, we're expecting to produce about 85% of what we had planned to produce before the tornado. We've recalled nearly all of the workforce at 85%, which is a pretty remarkable thing when you look at the damage that we had there. We still have an awful lot of work to do to understand what to do about those assets that aren't operational, and it does impact our capability in terms of what we can load and what we can process on the surface. So, we're working hard on that, and we're going to restore those capabilities as rapidly as we can. And, then, the plan -- of course, the plant is entirely -- well, not entirely, the brine wells were not affected where we pump the brine into the ground and extract the salt. But, we had no plan to process or package in. We also lost power here. Fortunately, the bulk of the damage that impact our ability to produce was in the packaging equipment, which is a little bit simpler, easier to repair and acquire. We have a lot of roof to put back on. We obviously had a lot of clean up to do. Probably the greatest impact here was from water into the building. After the roof and siding blew off, we had a lot of electrical equipment there that were in the process of replacing. But, we are expecting to package on a limited basis some rock salt, starting either the end of this week or early next week. So, pretty happy about that. We have to get downstream processing up and running for our evaporated salt. But the evaporators, which would be a really long lead time, capital item if we'd had significant damage to them, the building around them incurred some damage. But, those are ready to operate as soon as we have the place to put the salt. So, we were fortunate in that respect that the really long-lead high capital item of the evaporator plant was not significantly damaged. So, we hope to be at full capability by the year end as it says on the slide there. We've got about half of the folks back at the plant doing work for us right now. With that, I think I'll turn it back over to Angelo. I hope I've given you a little greater insight into what's going on in the plant, what we do in manufacturing and engineering and productivity initiatives that we have underway. And, I guess, we're going to do questions and answers. Thank you. ANGELO BRISIMITZAKIS: Okay, thanks, Jack. I think we have about 15 minutes scheduled for Q&A. And, then, we take a break. So, probably this section of Q&A is probably more the broader discussion about Compass Minerals. I think after we come back from our break, we're going to get into the specific business unit. And then, have a specific Q&A session, maybe a little deeper dive into the business units. So, with that, we'll open it up to questions. Questions and Answers MARK GULLEY, ANALYST, TICONDEROGA SECURITIES: Yes, Mark Gulley, Ticonderoga Securities. Jack, particularly intrigued by the continuous mining discussion. I have not seen that before. Given the thickness of your salt face that we see in the slide there, can you talk about how you're continuous mining would compare to competition? And, are the margin benefits that you see in that activity reflected in Rod's margin expansion goals that we saw in 2015, or will it take a lot longer for that to play out? How long will it take to implement this fully at Goderich? JACK LEUNIG: Yes, I can talk about the thickness of the seam. In Goderich, we are not, at this juncture, planning to continuous mine the entire 60 feet that we take out. We do something called development, which is our highest cost, most complicated part of the operation. And, we are going to, initially, implement this in development, which products, I guess, roughly a quarter of what we mine. The drill and blast will remain for taking the bench, because at this point, we feel like that's a pretty efficient low-cost approach to take that large salt, once we've done the development. We will have machines in at the end of next year, and we expect to be fully operational in early 2013, and the benefit for the cost reduction should come on quickly during the year in 2013. So, it's not a three year roll out to see those benefits. We expect it to be fully impacting us in 2013. ROD UNDERDOWN: And, yes, Mark, I can confirm that the benefits of the projects are in the forward look that we gave. If you look there on the picture, what Jack was saying is where the men are standing up there, that 12 to 15 foot development area is the portion of the mining where the continuous miner will operate. MARK GULLEY: And, the bench is the -- ROD UNDERDOWN: The rest, yes. MARK GULLEY: So you see a lot of salt there. ED YANG, ANALYST, OPPENHEIMER: Hi, Ed Yang, Oppenheimer. Question for Rod on the second half salt earnings guidance. You mentioned that second half salt earnings should be flat year-over-year, but that doesn't include the insurance benefits that you should get. So, on a pro forma basis, excluding the impact from the tornado and any, sort of, foregone business, you've earned -- well, if we look back in the second half of '10, you earned $107 million in salt earnings in your -- the losses related to the tornado was $30 million. So, does that mean second half 2011 salt earnings pro forma should be $137 million? Just a clarification on that. ROD UNDERDOWN: Yes, that's the math. We're expecting $30 million. We expect flat without any insurance recoveries. And we expect -- so, yes, you would essentially add back that $30 million. Again, there may be some insurance recoveries allowed under the accounting rules in terms of -- to be recognized. So, we've just -- for that forecast, we just assumed zero, recognizing that it's hard to exactly predict what those recoveries will be over the next six months. ED YANG: Okay, and on the -- you mentioned that for the industry awarded volume -- bid volumes for salt are up 4%, but Compass, because of the tornado impact, is going to be flat year-over-year. So, does that mean that if you have an above average winter, your salt volumes sold should still be flat year-over-year at best? And if it is, does that mean your insurance would also cover the foregone volume that you would have gotten, if not for the tornado? ROD UNDERDOWN: Well, you might remember the last year, the salt volumes were about average in both the December quarter as well as the March quarter. So, the availability of salt would be greater than that. So, to the extent it's above average winter, we would have the ability to sell more, but only up to those maximum contractual commitments set forth in our customer contracts. So, the forecast assumes normal winter. Last year was also normal winter. So, you can see that there would be expansion of our earnings if it were normal winter, and that's what the forecast is based on. We do have volumes in excess of normal winter to service our existing customers. What we don't have -- what we won't have is the ability to surge above that normal winter and sell on spot basis in the event that it's an extremely severe winter over the course of the next six months. JOEL JACKSON, ANALYST, BMO CAPITAL MARKET: Hi, thanks, Joel Jackson from BMO. I just wanted to ask you, Rod, if you could review again what are the insurance buckets would be covered on a balance sheet and what would be covered on the income statement? And, then, also, I had a question -- if you're not going to have a continuous miners into 2013, would we not expect Goderich to have 9 million tons of capacity until 2013, or when should we expect to have 9 million tons? ROD UNDERDOWN: Okay, I'll let somebody else answer the capacity question. But, in terms of the buckets, the impairment of the asset -- so, to the extent they were severely damaged or destroyed, that remaining net book value would run through the income statement. Any other cost associated with the tornado, which would include clean up cost, higher production cost, freight illogical shipment, or the higher cost of purchasing salt from other suppliers, all of that runs through the income statement. Now, there is a part of the loss that doesn't, and that would be in the example of having to scale back our bids, or maybe losing some of our consumer and industrial orders, because we haven't been able to have adequate supply. Those kind of things wouldn't run through the income statement, per se, but they would certainly be effects that would be captured in an insurance submission. The part, though, that is interesting and that I was trying to indicate -- and I'll spend just another second here -- is some of our assets were older assets. And, the insurance policy, much like, maybe, your home policy, covers replacement cost. This is a replacement cost insurance policy. And, so, the recovery of insurance related to rebuilding an asset will be what runs through the income statement ultimately in an income kind of a way. So, if we had an asset, and I'm just going to use a hypothetical example, where the net book value was $2 million, but it cost $10 million to replace it, then what would run through the income statement over the life of this project would be $2 million of write-off run through the income statement, $10 million of recovery -- a net book gain from that. And, again, this is all just hypothetical. And the $10 million that it cost us to replace the asset would end up on our balance sheet as -- through capital use of cash, capital spending. So, I think, the important thing to know is just, we'll be very transparent about all of those income statement effects. And, if we're booking something, we'll tell you what we're booking, how much, why it's for. If something was run through the income statement, here's the -- in terms of cost. Here's how much that was very specifically. The part that we might not be able to capture as we're going is, kind of, that lost business piece, because that part of the insurance claim is, I guess, subject to more -- to more judgment. And, I think we'll be a little cautious about reporting that until we have a greater understanding with our insurance on the way they're thinking about it. So, those are -- I hope that gives you a greater sense of -- there's really three buckets; there's what we're going to recognize for cost, there's what we're going to recognize for accrual purposes for accounting and that timing is different, and then the cash advances from the insurance will be even different than that. There could be some advances that we would get cash in prior to even being able to recognize those through the income statement. So, as we get more clarity into that, we'll certainly communicate that and try to not make that a confusing aspect of how to think about our normal, recurring operations. UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Kind of the bigger picture on the tornado is if you could step back and look beyond the tragedy of the event, at the end of the day, we'll have the mine and the plant no worse than what we had the day before the tornado. And, likely better than what we had. This is an opportunity for us, on putting in assets, replacing assets, and the replacement assets would be better than the assets that went in, because we've learned something over the 50 years we've been mining there. By the end of the year, we'll have near full capability of both our plant and our mine. In fact, at the mine, we're already at about 85%. The plant is starting up this week with some limited packaging. And, we will protect our market share, although we may not enjoy some of the growth this season, we will meet our commitments and protect our customer base. There are a variety of sourcing activity that are, again, painful right now to do. We'll be recovered through the insurance. But, at the end of the day in the salt business, primarily, it's very important, since share doesn't move very quickly, to retain what you have. And, I think the team has done an exceptional job to safely bring those assets back. Now, we're in the design phase to make the mine and plant better than they ever were before and to protect our customers in the transition. The continuous mining discussion isn't really a capacity discussion -- kind of getting to the comment. The 9 million ton that we tout for Goderich mine is a capability. And, in mining, unlike maybe a chemical plant, you can run it at different rates. So, if it market demand requires 7 million tons out of Goderich, we'll produce 7 million. That means some trucks and some people will be idle. If we want to run at 8 million, we'll have more trucks and more people. So, we scale it up and down, depending on market demand, and our two ways of growing in deicing salt, one is getting a disproportionate amount of market growth. The market grows about 1% to 2% a year. And, historically, we've been able to capture a little extra market growth through that. And, the other way we grow is in that one in five years or so where we have an exceptionally severe winter, we attack the spot market and enjoy that. Those are the ways we grow. Share doesn't shift too much year to year. So, continuous mining will give us a better way to mine whatever capacity we need in a particular year and mine it more efficiently. And, we're putting it on a limited basis at Goderich to get started, as Jack explained, to take that first chunk that's up there on top. But, the rest of the mining will be what we do in the past, which will be bench mining and drill and blast. UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Yes, but just to clarify, the continuous miners would support a 9 million ton in terms of the capabilities, they just might not have to run that length of time in order to do that if we're mining [less] we're only going to take out the 20% -- continue to do the 20% of the development level. ANGELO BRISIMITZAKIS: Okay, we'll take one last question and then we'll take a quick break and try to get back on schedule. UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Perhaps you can do some math for us. Roughly how much North America supply was taken out by the tragic events of Goderich? How much will it tighten up supply, let's say, for the next winter -- not this one, but the next one? UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Yes, I mean, as you look at the full market capabilities, and Keith will talk about what that is here in a moment, but full rock salt capabilities are roughly around 40 million tons, and that is for a variety of uses. That's for not only highway deicing, but also for chemical and some other uses, such as we use a lot of our rock salt that goes into our consumer and industrial business. So -- and the other competitors do too. So, you're probably talking 2% of the capacity is roughly taken out of the market for the winter. So, not a huge impact. And market happened late in the bidding cycle. So, the market's reaction to it was therefore somewhat limited because the amount of bids that were remaining by the end of August through September were mostly placed by then. ANGELO BRISIMITZAKIS: Okay, so we can stay on schedule, maybe we can take about a 10 minute break and get back here around 9 o' clock, and we'll continue then. Thank you. (Break) ANGELO BRISIMITZAKIS: We are all ready to go? Okay. It's great to have everyone back and now we'll resume the second part of our program, which will be focused on our four businesses. And, again, we'll have our business unit leaders come up. Rod actually has two roles -- he's our CFO but also looks over our UK operations. But we're going to start with our largest business unit, which is kind of the core of Compass Minerals, which our North American Highway Business unit, and Keith Clark. (Presentation) KEITH CLARK, VP AND GENERAL MANAGER, COMPASS MINERALS INTERNATIONAL INC.: Good morning, everyone. My name is Keith Clark. I'm the Vice President and General Manager of the North American Highway Business unit. Today I would like to give an overview of the business in addition to talking about some highlighted key strategic initiatives and highlight some key product lines. As Angelo had mentioned earlier, the largest segment of Compass Minerals representing 48% of the Company total sales is Highway Deicing. Our sales in 2010 approached $516 million on a volume of about 10 million tons sold. These tons were primarily bulk deicing salt sold in North America. We also sell rock and solar salt to chemical customers, as well as a line up of specialty deicing products that I'll talk about later. The UK highway deicing is included in this segment, which Rod Underdown will speak of during his presentation. Notice on the slide our key service areas are in blue. We have included our Mountain West service area in this presentation, and we service that area with the solar salt that's produced at the Great Salt Lake. And you'll see that on your tour today. The five-year snapshot of our overall volume, price and revenue results, demonstrates the steady growth of our highway deicing business, despite weather variability and economic downturn. Sales grew at a CAGR of about 4% while price grew at a rate of 8%. This is higher than the historical average, which is in the 3% to 4% range. Together they produced healthy revenues of 13%. Now, let me turn to the North American bulk deicing segment, which represents 70% of our total highway deicing sales in 2010. Highway deicing is a leading use of rock salt and is the leading deicing product because of its quick-acting, easy use and it's economical. Most of the deicing rock we sell comes from one our two North American mines, where it is crushed, screened, and then treated with an anti-caking agent before it is shipped to our depots. The rock salt that is sold throughout North America to cities, counties, states, provincial government and private contractors who rely on it to de-ice roadways throughout the winter months. Industry-wide statistics are hard to come by as it is a very fragmented market. This chart provides a good approximation of the market in North America in terms of volume and its performance over the last 15 years. You can see the weather variability impact to sales volumes. And please note, from an earlier chart, our company's performance has tended to exceed this industry average. Bulk deicing salt is not a high growth particularly in terms of volume, which is weather dependent, but there are several fundamental factors that support steady growth. We think governments get it. We think governments understand the safety factor involved and are accountable for it. Governments are also increasingly aware that impassable roads cost them and their constituent's money in terms of lost wages, productivity and lost sales tax revenues. Suburban sprawl and growth also adds to the market as lane markets and vehicle miles are added. We also list a variable component and a negative driver as well. New technologies and products do compete with rock salt and they've made some headway. I'll talk about some of our own innovative products in a few minutes when I talk about our specialty product section. The good news is that many of these new deicing products use rock salt as a raw material source. And they also command a premium value as an added-value premium deicing product. There is some pressure on the use of salt and the environment but these are being addressed through best practices. In the use and storage of road salt many of these best practices have been put in place by the salt institute, the salt industry's trade association, working in conjunction with our North American customer base. This industry has a unique government bidding process that covers the majority of our rock salt business. The bids are transaction intensive as they require delivered price to many, many delivery points. The key takeaways in the bidding process is most of the bids have a mid-max purchase requirement. Bids become transparent after they are finished and awarded. The negotiations are prohibited. The customer gets the lowest price. On the supplier side, however, he ends up with a known and stable customer base for the season, a defined price and an established minimal contractual volume. Looking at mine production in North America this slide gives you an overview of the estimated annual rock production or capacity available in North America through our mine as well as the mines of our competitors. As you can see we have the most capacity in North America followed by Cargill and K+S, both of which augment their North American production with imports from the Bahamas and South America. Competition in the market is primarily regional because of the cost to transport salt is highly relative to the value of salt. Cost advantages are eventually eroded by transportation costs the further the customer base is from the producing location. Imports are limited for the same reason. They are primarily found on the East and West Coast, but severe winters can invite additional import activity. But with that, also comes increased prices. This is also a market in which capacity held by suppliers is somewhat constrained. Only Compass Minerals has undergone significant expansion over the last four or five years. In fact, our Phase I and our Phase II expansion at the Goderich Mine in size is larger than many of the mines that we actually compete with. Now let's transition -- on slide 63, let's transition to the business' strategic advantages. Our competitive advantage begins with our advantaged assets particularly in Goderich, Ontario and I'll talk more about that later. Our assets are also well positioned logistically to take advantage of water freight and water transportation and they're very convenient to the North American snow-belt. We have an extensive depot network to facilitate distribution to thousands of delivery points. We have a strong portfolio of specialty deicing products that I'll talk about later, which is another competitive edge. I also want to highlight when we talk about specialty products that we are vertically integrated for these product lines and we source, our raw materials source for these products from our operation. The large one being a key source, which is the Great Salt Lake where we obtained very low-cost magnesium chloride brine that Angelo talked about earlier, and we use that as our specialty deicer in a couple of products in that specialty product line. Now, let's look at the advantaged assets that we have with our reserve base in Goderich, Ontario. At the Goderich Mine we are mining a salt formation called the Michigan Basin. The A2 layer of salt in the formation presents itself at the 1,800 foot level. You can see this in a chart -- it's highlighted in red -- and it's approximately 100-foot thick. We are the only North American producer that is mining this seam. The thickness of the salt seam is important as it allows us mine at least three times the ore volume per linear foot of advance versus most of our competition. This allows us to control the footprint growth of our mines, which in any mine is very costly to maintain. This slide you've probably seen on a number of occasion but it illustrates the logistical advantages and locations of our depot network and the density of our depot network to service our customer base. Depots with water access are a key asset for this business and it's a necessary link to our customer base. Now, let's talk a little bit about specialty products. Specialty products are another one of our advantages. These products presently account for about 5% of our highway deicing sales. We like them because they are a higher margin and because they allow us to leverage all of our assets both our mines and the Great Salt Lake operation. In general specialty deicers are a collection of liquid and solid deicing products that either enhance the performance of rock salt or are natural alternatives to rock salt. They respond to some customers' needs and desires for an efficient and environmental friendly alternative to sand and plain rock salt. We expect this market to grow a bit faster than bulk rock salt, but currently represents about 6% to 7% of the overall highway deicing market in North America. Turning to slide 68 our specialty liquid deicer, magnesium chloride, which as Angelo explained is a co-product of our sulfate of potash process, SOP process, at the Great Salt Lake. As a deicer it performs at lower temperatures, is environmentally friendly and less damaging to concrete, application equipment and roadway infrastructure. We sell a similar liquid product as a dust control or a road stabilization solution. We're very excited about this product and the possibilities for this in the marketplace. We intend to expand the market by increasing awareness among municipal users, wherein they can control fugitive dust and preserve their unpaved roadways by using a product called, DustGard. DustGard can reduce the cost of maintaining an unpaved road by decreasing road maintenance, primarily road grading, while providing a safer and more user-friendly driving surface. Here's a slide that is recap of our portfolio of liquid and solid products in the specialty group. We also include their features and benefits. On slide 70, we show that several companies provide forms of specialty products, but as you can see we have the broadest product offering in North America. And we're the only provider offering a product in each of the categories of treated rock, premium liquid deicers and brine additives. Before turning to our strategies for sustainable success let's discuss the source of our remaining 10% of sales, and that's the chemical rock salt sales in North America. In the chemical sector, we sell salt that is properly sized and of the right quality, and in some situations mined in certain areas of our mine to meet the needs of the chemical industry. We also sell into that industry from the Great Salt Lake. We primarily sell into the chlor-alkali industry as many of you know, the chloride alkali industry is highly cyclical mirroring the ups and downs of the larger chemicals industry. Our customers, primary end use products are PVC, bleach, chlorates and aluminum fluxing agents. We like this sector as chemical customers provide a non-seasonal sale that helps offset weather variability in the rock salt business. In summary, we believe that we have several strategies in the business that will provide us with sustainable success. First, we expect to leverage our expansion of the Goderich Mine, as well as the addition of more magnesium chloride volume from a Phase II pond sealing project in Ogden to capture more organic growth as weather and market growth allow. We also expect to use the additional capacity in future years to take advantage of spot sales in the event of severe winters and where we can go cost effectively to move products into new geographies. We expect to maximize the specialty products line up we have by expanding this market through greater education of end users about the value proposition these products have to offer. We continue to focus on operational excellence initiatives like RAM and continuous improvement that Jack talked about earlier today. And, lastly, we will continue to strategically invest capital money in such projects like continuous mining at the Goderich Mine. And we're also looking to expand the Port of Goderich to provide enhanced operational flexibility and lower our transportation costs. And so, now what I would like to do is -- I finished my presentation, and have Rod come up and talk about the UK operations. ROD UNDERDOWN: Yes, thank you, Keith. I'm pleased to be back to talk about our UK business this morning. Now to think of our UK business as only highway deicing would be inaccurate. We actually have two other smaller businesses in the UK, but nonetheless are important, and I'll talk about those strategic importance in just a second. Again, three businesses in the UK, and as I've already mentioned the largest is definitely the UK highway deicing franchise. Our UK mine is the largest rock salt mine in the UK, and the only one there dedicated to rock salt production. Of further significance there is the mine stable geology, which has allowed it to remain open since its beginning in 1844. And that makes it Britain's oldest working mine, and I'll cover more on that in just a moment. So in addition our CMP-UK operations also include a records management business, and this business has its largest workings in the underground void spaces in the Winsford Mine. But we also there offer a London-based, more traditional above-ground storage option that gives us a somewhat unique capability to offer same-day and next-day retrieval services to our London customers. There's a third business, which provides services to a leading waste management company and allows that company to access our mine and store inert solid waste materials for a fee. Importantly, the Winsford Mine has ample capacity to facilitate growth of these or other businesses given its long history, which has left behind literally mines of unused spaces there. Our UK operation has several unique attributes, which when utilized are competitive assets. Our main [asset] at the mine is shallow. It's only about 500 feet in depth below the surface and that creates a very stable underground environment, and that stability is what allows our mine to be used in ways that most other mines can't be used. In fact, and this is important, every single mined out space since 1844 in this mine can be still be accessed today and that's by any underground mining standard kind of a truly remarkable fact. The mine is located in the northwest of England and compared to our salt competitors has the best access to the population centers in England, including London, Birmingham, Leeds, and Manchester. We've also been a leader in selling the full value of our salt. One example is we've bundled some services -- some unique services with our product offerings to entice our customers to choose us a more strategic partner there than purely a commodity for their highway deicing needs. Now while the UK highway deicing market performs the same function as our North American counterpart that you just heard from Keith Clark, there are a number of notable differences. First, snowfall is not as common in the UK. When snowfall does occur, however, and several different events, demand is significantly impacted. The majority of the sales in the UK are really attributed to the damp climate, where because of that wetness as temperatures approach the freezing point black ice forms on highways so temperatures at or below the freezing point routinely result in deicing usage in the UK even though it has not snowed. Thus, temperature is more of a demand driver in the UK than is snowfall. And deicing is particularly important in the UK because the populations there are very dense, and so mobility is significantly hampered in the event of ice forming on highways. The other significant different between our UK and North American franchises is that our UK business does contain a higher degree of sales variability. The chart that you see on this page shows the past 20 years of volume indexed to the average over that 20 years. And you'll note that the range in the UK is from less than 50% -- a little less than 50% to more than 150%. By comparison, in North America our average sales, our sales history would have that range being closer to 80% to 120%. So, the UK market is more variable. That actually does contribute some less attractiveness to imports because of the potential for salt to be landed and then established there for a number of years until it can be sold. However, at its core the highway deicing market is very similar to the North American market in that the same regional competitive dynamics apply. Competition does tend to be very regional since the cost of transportation is a large component of the delivered cost. So, you can see on the map there that we tend to compete against one or two others depending on the location. And based on those factors, as you would expect the market is very freight logical as opposed to the US, where the highway system runs typically east and west, in the UK it's more of a north-south trunk lines. And so, the result is that -- you can see from the map there that those regions where we have best north-south access to tend to be ones where we have the highest amount of the market share in those particular county regions in England, and likewise over on the east coast where our largest competitor there, Cleveland Potash, has a larger presence. Now turning to alternative mine uses, as I previously mentioned, the unique aspect of our Winsford Mine gives us the ability to consider how we can use those previously mined out spaces for alternative uses. The one we've talked about most is our DeepStore records management business. We've dedicated whole areas of the mine for the construction of underground warehouses as space for records storage. We've supplemented this underground mine storage with two above-ground storage sites in London and that allows us to access the bigger, more lucrative London market. And the unique aspect of our business is that it allows us to offer same-day service as well as next-day retrieval solution to our customers, who want to distinguish between urgent records management needs and non-urgent records management needs. Of course, we price the service there to be commensurate with that need. We also provide services as I previously mentioned to Veolia, a large, waste management company in Europe for the disposal of inert waste into the mine. The waste is packaged in super sacks and deposited in specialty constructed rooms in the far corner of the mine and where permitting has been obtained. Other alternative mine use opportunities may also be developed in the future. We would only undertake those opportunities if we expected them to be profitable immediately and if they would not reduce our focus on our core salt mining operations. And importantly, we will tell you when there are any opportunities that you should think of as a step change in our results. So the cash flow and profits of these alternative mine use businesses are underpinned by the mine conditions, which offer an excellent climate and security that's more expensive to replicate in more traditional environments above ground. We've also had an extreme focus there on quality and bring our storage businesses online. The DeepStore business has achieved ISO 9001 recognition for quality and, in fact, our customer surveys there undertaken as part of our normal customer feedback consistently demonstrate very high levels of customer satisfaction. And we are the only records management company in the UK that has earned the ISO 14001 certification, which recognizes leadership in environmental management. So in summary, our CMP UK business is small, but is a vital part of Compass Minerals' business portfolio. So now, I would like to turn the mic over to Jerry Bucan. Jerry is our VP of Consumer and Industrial business, where he'll walk through the final part of our salt business with you. JERRY BUCAN, VP AND GENERAL MANAGER, CONSUMER & INDUSTRIAL, COMPASS MINERALS INTERNATIONAL INC.: Thank you, Rod. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for coming today. My name is Jerry Bucan. I'm the General Manager of the C&I business unit, Consumer and Industrial. What I'd like to do today is enhance your understanding about this business unit. As we go through the presentation I'll point out some areas where this business unit is distinct from some of the other businesses that you've been looking at. So, C&I is about 33% of Compass Mineral's revenue. We produce this product at about eight locations across Canada and the United States. The sales mix breaks down between deicing and non-deicing as you can see, and in the non-deicing businesses we compete in seven categories. Each of these categories is very distinct. So, one of the ways in which this C&I business unit is different is we're a portfolio of businesses. Each of those product categories has its own competitive dynamics. This business has done very well over the last five years. Volume has generally been steady. The increase that you see in 2008 was due to a very severe winter that occurred in late 2007, early 2008. Volumes went up, and we call that the 30-year winter. As a result of that winter some supply and demand imbalances were created in the marketplace. Prices were able to be increased. Those price increases have generally been sustainable but dampened mildly with the recent effects of the Great Recession on certain aspects of our business. But as you can see, generally we've lifted the top line of the business up quite dramatically. So in this I'm going to tell you a little bit about the industry. It's going to map onto how our how our market looks, or how our business looks. It's about a 13 million ton market, and you can see all the different uses of the market or of the product. The largest product groups are water conditioning, industrial, animal nutrition, deicing and food grade. And this business unit uses all three types of salt, the evaporated -- the mechanically evaporated salt, the rock or the solar. And it's another area where this business unit is different. It's where the mechanical evaporation and solution mining occurs. This is a -- there's a different go-to-market mechanism here and it's a more complex selling process. And part of it's driven by a good portion of this business is in the transactions are small so a large number of users. Therefore, it makes sense to use intermediaries. You can see we have three end user segments here. They're each distinct. Consumers are people like you and me and our households. We buy food salt, water conditioning salt, we use it in our homes. Industrial users think of a big name-brand food company that makes food products that require salt. That would be an example of an industrial customer. And professional segment, think of landscaping companies that perform deicing services for commercial properties. Those are the three end-user segments we sell into. Usually, one or more of those categories into each segment and we have these intermediaries that we use to efficiently get to the end user segments. There are some fundamental market drivers here, obviously population growth I think is intuitively obvious. The more population growth salt consumption across almost all salt categories increases. We have some items, some areas that are variable, the economy, weather and user behaviors. Weather, I think, is pretty clear. It affects our deicing business. It affects our fishery and pool business. The economy can have a mild effect on our water conditioning business and our industrial business. And then, of course, user behaviors because part of our selling proposition is to again, people like you and me. So depending on how they're thinking about their personal finances, how they're thinking about the environment, how they're thinking about how they eat will affect this business to some extent. And, of course, there's always regulatory issues. I've presented a few here that we're challenged with. So this market -- 85% of this market in North America, United States and Canada, is accounted for by five principal competitors. And the like in the North American highway deicing business, Morton and Cargill or K+S are key large players, but we're very large too. And we feel well positioned to compete very effectively against all of these companies. Now, what do we think gives us our competitive edge? Well you've heard this before, superior assets. We monetize some of the salt that comes out of the Goderich Mine, and you've heard a lot about that today. We monetize salt that comes out of the Great Salt Lake operation. And you're going to hear from Ron after me, and you're going to see a tour of the facility. And by the way, we also sell the salt -- the rock salt that is mined out of our Cote Blanche mine. So, we leverage these superior assets. We have a very, very strong product portfolio. The products are broad as you might imagine. It needs to be given all the different user segments and the different kind of product categories. We have strong brands, robust private label offerings, and in the last five years we've become very good at renewals and innovation. And I'll show you a couple of slides later on where we've done that to strengthen our product portfolio. Quality and service, are always key and when we do a lot of things right we get balanced execution and solid results. What this slide says, if you believe in asset utilization, is we utilize our assets. Just about everything we can pull out of any asset we have we pull out of it. So you see to the right of the slide you see our evaporation plants. They make almost all the products, and then we pull out of the [brines] and we pull out of the solar evaporation facilities. And then, as somebody mentioned earlier, we have three packaging facilities, one in Duluth, one in Kenosha, Wisconsin, one in Chicago, Illinois, where we package rock and solar products for distribution into the local geographic markets. So asset utilization, asset leveraging is key for us. Something a lot of people lose sight of and it's understandable is that we've got quite a history, and presence and good brand equity in Canada with the Sifto brand. It traces back to 1866. It's mostly well-known for food and deicing and water conditioning products and we cover all of Canada from one coast to the other. So, we are category leaders in consumer deicing. And here's a slide that I think is you can read what's on it, but what I'm going to tell you is this an example of some of the innovation and renewal we've done in the last five years. This product line like many of the product lines that we are upgrading is designed to perform specific things and some of the features that you'll see here is you'll see a master brand phase step. You'll see a product line that is designed to facilitate the purchase decision, so when users are in the stores figuring out what product they need we help them get them the right product. That enables them to go back to their households and use the product in a way where they have a favorable usage experience, which should increase the probability of repeat, continuity of purchase, and then brand loyalty, which is what you're looking for. We also use packaging -- just the nature of the packaging and the information content on that to do that. The formulations are specifically designed for different usage requirements. We use rock salt. We blend in magnesium chloride, calcium chloride in varying amounts. And I'll use this opportunity to say again that we believe that magnesium chloride is the supreme, the premium all-around deicing product. So, you'll see we've put an environmentally friendly offering in our line, and we've also put a magnesium chloride-based pet safe product in our line. It's a similar story in animal nutrition. We have the American Stockman brands and the Canadian Stockman brand. We upgraded this line in the last two years and what happens here is ranchers and farmers feed their herds salt in various forms because it results in healthier animals, faster and better weight gain, better milk production as the case may be. The salt is fed directly or it's combined with other essential nutrients, and so we've recently brought up the new American Stockman line, and we think that's the category-leading line in the United States. And we're launching a similar thing in Canada with the Canadian Stockman line, and we think that's going to be the supreme line in Canada. We lead in water conditioning. 85% of households in America have hard water and imagine -- we'd assume if it's a random sample, 85% of you know what hard water is. It's created by calcium. And when it's not removed from the water the most notable thing is it will change the taste of the water. But it also has a negative impact on the efficacy, the efficiency and the longevity of certain plumbing fixtures and appliances. So there's value in being able to take that out cost-effectively and nobody has been able to come up with a better mousetrap yet -- a better, more effective mousetrap than simple water softening products. So we have wide range of products, a wide range of price points for different user segments whether it's an industrial user or a commercial user or a consumer user. Now there's a lot more in the product portfolio. So, we've got a robust food salt line. I'm particularly proud of our Sifto line. This is another one we've upgraded in the last two or three years. It's a full line and it includes sea salt. It includes low sodium and no-sodium offerings and that works very well for us in Canada and the United States in food we compete principally in private label and we have a very good private label program. There's numerous industrial applications we sell salt into. One example is in the leather production process where you cheer and tan the hides. Salt is used there, the hides are brought in. One customer we have lays them out on a floor on a layer of salt and then another layer of salt is put over the hides and it dries out the hides. And because the salt takes out the bacteria that's one of the first steps in creating leather. Fish processing, there's a great fishery business on both coasts of Canada so we supply them. And then, we have an innovative product for the saltwater pool market. We've branded it Pristiva. It's got proprietary patent pending formulation technology in it. It's designed to extend the life of the saltwater generator while having a meaningfully superior usage experience in a saltwater pool, the salinity of the water. So we've established good initial distribution in the United States over the last two years, and this year we've launched into Canada with Pristiva. So like any good strategy it's pretty simple. We want to optimize the product and the customer mix. The emphasis here for us is on value-added products. We'd like to migrate more toward package. We'd like to migrate more toward premium. But it's higher value-add, higher margin products. Jack Leunig talked to you about continuous improvement, reliable asset management by taking cost out of every part of the value chain will be critical to our strategy. And then, we're going to continue to refresh and innovate. I gave you some examples of what we've done in the past. Angelo talked about the stage and gate process earlier for new product. We have a couple of ideas percolating through there that are very exciting and so that's what we're going to do. So, thank you. I hope you found this informative and interesting, and now Ron Bryan who is the General Manager of the GSL Fertilizer business is going to speak to you. Thank you. RON BRYAN, VP AND GENERAL MANAGER, FERTILIZER, COMPASS MINERALS INTERNATIONAL INC.: Good morning. I appreciate the opportunity to have a chat with you about the specialty fertilizer business, an exciting segment of Compass Minerals. Part of our scope -- we're about 18% of Compass Minerals revenue in 2010. We have two production sites, one in Ogden, Utah that you'll see later this morning, the other in Wynyard, Saskatchewan, about two hours east of Saskatoon. Our sales mix you can see we're about 90%-plus into the agricultural sector, which there's a subset of that called the highly soluble portion that goes into drip irrigation and fertigation, and about 5% in industrial applications. Now this next slide is very interesting. You can see our sales in 2009 they were down because of the dramatic increase in fertilizer pricing that went through the fertilizer segment including potash and SOP. But I think it graphically shows our need to expand our facilities which we'll talk about. But, broadly our pricing follows the potash segment. You can see since 2006 we've had around a 15% CAGR for price increases. And then, this leads naturally to growth in revenue. And, in fact, this makes us the fastest growing segment within Compass Minerals portfolio. So, I'd like to now talk a little bit about the industry itself. First, to talk about SOP in particular there are multiple forms of potassium nutrients, all plants, animals and, in fact, humans need potassium. And we think this is one of the premium forms of delivering that potassium, going mainly on the chloride sensitive crops but also high-value crops. And there are many advantages that SOP has on these crops and you can read some of these. There's the balanced time nutrient content. It helps the uptake of other nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphates. It increases drought tolerance. But very importantly, it increases the yield and the shelf life of all the products that we see. For instance, in potatoes it has a dramatic impact on the yield and shelf life of potatoes. This graph at the bottom gives our estimate of where SOP goes into in the North American market, around 25% into vegetables, 30% into tree nuts, such as almonds and pistachios, 15% into fruit and 30% into other, which includes the items listed here including potatoes. Now this is a remarkable statistic here, but as you define SOP crops as those that I just defined, they constitute about 3.7% of the acreage that's harvested in the United States. But yet, those 3.7% are 37% of the revenue for all acres in the United States. So, it's a ten to one multiplier. That's the market in which we serve. Now I'd like to compare SOP with other forms of potassium. Potassium sulfate obviously is SOP and if you recall your high school chemistry course, K2SO4. We also are in the market with potassium chloride known as MOP, a muriate of potash potassium chloride. SOP its real value is that it's low in chloride and low in salt index. And chloride is also a micronutrient just as potassium is a nutrient, plants need chloride as well but they need it in small quantities and there are crops that are sensitive to this and it has several deleterious effects. It can build up in the tissue of the plant or the root and hurt it. Those crops usually demand and require sulfate of potash. At the same time that we don't have the chloride we're also adding another essential nutrient, sulfur indeed is listed as the fourth largest nutrient requirement of our plants. So SOP provides a sulfate -- a sulfur in the ready form of sulfate. And because of that we generally sell at a premium of $100 to $150 compared to potassium chloride. Now the bar graph on the right gives some sense of how SOP stacks up against other potash sources. You can see the left bar, in China, which is approximately half of the world's sulfate of potash consumption, it's about 30% of their potash demand, and the rest of the world is around 4%, and on the weighted average around 10%. Now this graph gives estimates for SOP worldwide consumption since 1990. And you can see a nice stable growth of 3% or so. We have data that precedes this back into the '60s and the same stable growth continues. And this is also the same sort of growth we see in the markets that we serve, which is North America and Western Hemisphere. We expect this growth to continue in both these markets and in our markets. And I will note that we're the largest producer of sulfate of potash in this segment. So, what is driving this growth? There's two big drivers. One is population; it grows around 1%. And two, is the improving diets. You've heard this before in the context of fertilizer industry. But as incomes improve, diets improve. As diets improve, people usually consume more fruits and vegetables. And we have data that is not shown here, but over the last two or three decades, per capital consumption of fruits and vegetables and potatoes has grown about 1.5% per year for decades. And we expect that to continue as well. There are two other sub-trends here going on. Conservation strategy. As industry gets to more precision agriculture, you get more precise application of fertilizer and water. We think SOP will prevail into that. One example of that is strip tilling where you apply the fertilizer and seed together. SOP is a safer form of potassium. It doesn't hurt the seedling. We're seeing a growing trend in that area. The second trend is sulfur buildup, particularly in the coastal areas as saltwater intrudes in particular irrigation water SOP tends to grow. And this is particularly in Florida, California, and we've seen some in the Bootheels of Missouri. There is a small negative trend underway. SOP is not quite as soluble as other forms of potassium, a small but growing segment of the industry is the use of drip irrigation. And having said that we do have a more soluble form of SOP so we are in this segment and it is growing as well. So I'd like to give a little bit of an overview of the industry. There are three broad technologies by which SOP is made. Now the big one is solar evaporation, which there are three producers in the world. You can see we're one of them. The second one is a company that produces SOP from ore mining. And thirdly, everyone else -- and this about 60% of the world's SOP production is made by the chemical reaction of sulfuric acid and potassium chloride. To our knowledge, all of these producers are not basic in potassium chloride so they have to buy from the open market and react it with acid. So these technology differences lead to differences -- dramatic differences in cost. We believe that the solar-based production method is the cheapest in the world followed by the ore mining, but dramatically different from the potassium chloride and sulfuric acid route. This stands to reason because, as I mentioned, all these producers, we think, have to buy the potassium chloride, which in today's pricing is in the mid 500s and then react this with acid and sell it. So it leads to a dramatic difference, and we think we have a huge competitive advantage against most producers, in fact, all producers. Because SOP is an attractive market there's a lot of interest in this segment. We ourselves are quite proud to announce and I'll talk in some detail about our expansions, Phase I, II and III. Our Phase II, which we're engaged in now we'll add 220,000 tons through 2014, 2015. There are a couple of other companies that have announced and appear to be in the feasibility study. I don't think these are formally announced projects, but virtually all of the other production that's being discussed is in China. China as you know is a net importer of potash. They have a strong interest to be more self sufficient. They're growing rapidly in the SOP market. We believe all of this tends to stay in China because that's another potash source and ultimately reduces their imports of MOP. So, I'd like to change a little bit and talk about our strategic advantages. We think there are three. One is, our world-class advantage to assets, i.e., the low-cost production that we see at the solar ponds. And in Big Quill we think we have a unique process that lends itself to the highest quality SOP in the world and this allows us to enter and in fact, we're in some niche applications that other SOP producers cannot enter. We're well positioned -- we think the North American market is one of the best markets so we have logistical advantages in that market. And finally, we have, we think, the broadest product offering of all producers. One of those key ones is being OMRI-certified organic. We're one of the few SOP producers that's an organic SOP and that's because we don't do any chemical reactions. Everything is a naturally occurring product. We think we have a broad product offering both at GSL and Big Quill as well. And at Big Quill we're able to make custom specifications. So our strategy is to take advantage of these assets. For these, one, we want to take advantage of our key asset, i.e. the Great Salt Lake, which spans this facility, and I'll talk about that. We will have a phased approach that allows us to grow with the market. We are increasing our production of magnesium chloride and that's being sold in all three business segments, as you've heard. As Jack has mentioned, we do have a strong focus on continuous improvement at every area. We have dozens of activities going on at Ogden right now, to improve everything from the bottom up. We're quite excited about that. At Big Quill, we are engaging to work to convert more of the production to ion exchange, which gives simultaneously higher quality and lower costs. And, finally, we want to increase our usage of targeted crops. And I'll talk more about this. I'm quite excited about that. On educating our customers about the benefits of SOP and using this broad product offering that I've mentioned. Let me talk a little bit about the expansion. We're excited about these. As we announced, some time ago, we are in the middle of and close to completing Phase I, which is both a yield and capacity expansion at the Great Salt Lake plant. This will add 100,000 tons of pond-based SOP. We have also started our Phase II and this has started in two ways. We're sealing the perimeter of the east ponds. We have two big pond systems, west and east. We're engaged in sealing the eastern ponds, on the perimeter. This allows us to make, we think, around 220,000 more SOP equivalent tons out of the same footprint. You'll see that sealing activity today and it's underway. It will require an SOP extension of the plant, but will also add 220,000 tons of solar-based production. We've also started our Phase III. Now this would be an expansion of the pond system itself, up to 75,000 new acres. And to do this, we need the land, which we've gotten the leases for these incremental acres. We need water and we need a permit. This permit activity has been underway for some time, with the Army Corps of Engineers, who is the lead agency. It's now undergoing an environmental impact statement and it will also require a plant expansion as well, but it's -- the good news is this can easily double our production in the future. So let me talk a little bit about the status of these three phases. Rod has mentioned a little bit about the Phase I status. The equipment is approaching design rates. We have had some challenges with the material handling portion of that. We know what happened. We know what to do to fix it and we're working through those fixes. We do expect to reach the full design rates in early 2012. Now, as has been mentioned, simultaneous to that, we have seen wet, cooler evaporation season that we'll have to deal with as well. I'd just mention the Phase II, the sealing is underway and in fact we'll start to see the benefit of that next year and the following years. The plant expansion, it's a sequence following Phase I. It's been delayed a bit with the timing of Phase I. But we are in the design phase of this, expect this to be operational in 2014. And as I mentioned with Phase III, we're undergoing the environmental impact statement with the Army Corps, the timing of which is in the government's hands. I want to talk a little bit about a new product for us and in the last couple of quarters, with Rod and Angelo and the earnings call, you've -- we've made some brief mention of a specialty fertilizer. That fertilizer is a new magnesium chloride product called Chlori-Mag, and it'll serve new crops and new regions of this country. This product will be targeted in the Great Plains region of the United States. And these soils, and they tend to be those states that Kansas northwards, are naturally high in potassium. So they don't get a lot of potassium chloride added to them, and because all plants need chloride in their uptake supply, they tend to be chloride deficient. There's 20 years of research that says that if you add a bit of chloride to that, you can get a fairly dramatic increase in yield. So we're targeting and have launched a marketing campaign that's underway now, to sell more magnesium chloride into this segment. It can have dramatic impact, you can -- it can reduce disease and increase the yield. And this can be five to 10 acres -- or bushels per acre of wheat, which in today's wheat prices, that's fairly dramatic. So it is a low-price product in SOP, but it's very cost effective for the farmer and has higher margins for the farmer. Now I want to conclude my remarks with what is one of the most exciting segments, to me, about the future of sulfate of potash. We have now, in place, a fully staffed, professional marketing group, both in training and experience, whose job is to go out and grow our business. They're doing so by helping us to define the SOP value equation. We know that SOP brings great value to certain segments of the market. We have, for many years, conducted crop trials. We're continuing those and accelerating those to help us have the data that we can take to our dealers and growers to help to find the equation. This marketing program is backed up by professional market research that helps us understand why dealers and growers buy or don't buy SOP. And what we found is there is a tremendous opportunity to educate the farmer in the value of SOP. So our target markets would be those crops that we now serve, and this market research suggests that there is lots of opportunity to sell more SOP into those same crops, and new crops. And to that end, we have undertaken a professional marketing campaign that's underway now, and this follows the traditional marketing of print ads and trade shows and so forth, but also the newer digital media activities that you can see. So, we're quite excited about this and very confident that this can grow our business. And the last thing is, we do have this diverse product offering. We're also -- the same marketing program, but obviously different output, would be to leverage Big Quill. They are serving different markets. And we have also got a full-time marketing effort underway for Bill Quill assets. So thank you for the opportunity to talk about specialty fertilizers, and I'll turn it back to Angelo for Q&A. ANGELO BRISIMITZAKIS: Thanks, Ryan. CMP has had a great, almost, eight year run as a stand alone public company. And our best years are still ahead of us. This belief is built on some real asset and market strengths, as well as exceptional people. Thank you very much for joining us today for our presentation. We'll now take some time for some Q&A and then after the Q&A, I'll hand the podium over to Corey, Ogden's site manager, who will explain more about our advantaged assets at -- in Ogden. And then we'll hand it over to Theresa, who will outline this afternoon's tour program and the all-important logistics about where we have to go and when. So I think, Peggy, you have the mic. I think we're ready -- or Theresa has the mic. We're ready for questions. And now, obviously, the business unit questions are on the table, but if anything else that's broader for Rod or myself, or Jack, I would be happy to entertain them now. Questions and Answers JOEL JACKSON: Okay. Thanks, Angelo. Joel, again, from BMO. I had a couple of questions. I just wanted to read through some of the data from Ron's presentation. Should I extrapolate that Compass expected to produce maximum 250,000 tons of SOP in 2013? And also, what is your production range for 2012, from Great Salt Lake as well? ANGELO BRISIMITZAKIS: Go ahead, Ron. RON BRYAN: I'd like to address that. Yes, we expect this Phase I to reach design rates in 2012, as I mentioned. We have had, and are seeing, the impact of the solar evaporation season. Rod gave some guidance earlier about what we expect the results of that to be in 2011 and '12. But beyond '13, you can see the information that we presented earlier and I think that would be the basis on which you can go forward. JOEL JACKSON: Okay. And -- ANGELO BRISIMITZAKIS: And again, we have 40,000 tons coming from Big Quill. So you were just referring to the Ogden portion. RON BRYAN: Right. JOEL JACKSON: I had a question for Jerry as well. I wonder if you could talk about the five main C&I buckets; water conditioning, some nutrition, or animal nutrition, food and nutrition, just deicing and maybe help us rank them in terms of the average selling price. And possibly looking at sort of the price performance of C&I versus highway deicing over the last several years. Talk about what's happened in mix among those different key C&I product groups, or -- and what you expect to happen the next few years? UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: If I could just interrupt there, we haven't talked about selling price by product. It can vary dramatically, even within a sub-sector. So AG isn't the same price, depending on the products, water conditioning isn't the same price, based on the variety of different kinds of products that exist in those sub-segments. So with that I'd -- Jerry, go ahead and talk through it. But I just wanted to make sure he had that context. JERRY BUCAN: So, I'm not going to reveal the pricing of the individual products or product lines. I think the second part of your question had to do with how the mix has been working in the business and how it projects forward. The first thing to bear in mind when we talk about the mix in this business is the last three to four years have been unusually tumultuous by historic standards in the salt industry, with the combined effect of the 30-year winter that started before the great recession, but overlapped with it, and then the great recession starts to have an impact on the business. So we have seen several, but mild, mix changes in our business. The economy, we think, is encouraging people -- or to purchase lower margin -- lower priced products and lower priced retail formats. We have also seen an opportunity in very -- we've been very opportunistic in filling a market need for bulk products, which have a lower price per ton basis. So we've tried to exploit those opportunities when we've seen it. Our mix, in my opinion, our mix does not change versus -- has not changed meaningfully versus historical rates. What has happened in the last three years is there's just been a lot of up and down, if that helps at all. Going forward, I think we're going to have a fairly consistent mix. You'll see a slow -- what I would like to engineer is a slow migration towards more packaged, more higher priced, higher margin, premium value-added packaged products. Does that help? UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Staying on the salt side for a sec, you guys mentioned that you expect the salt cost structure to return back to 2009 levels. Could you just talk about how you think about the prospective cost structure and if your ability to offset, if there are sources of inflation, and how you think about the efficiencies that you mentioned, in terms of your ability to offset those costs? UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Yes. Sure, I'll take that. The largest cost component that we have in our salt operation is man power. And that comprises about 50% of producing rock salt. It's a little less than that on the evap side, as -- while our solar facility is large, our evaporated -- mechanical evaporated plants use a little bit more energy and so that's kind of the next biggest cost component. And just, if I can cover energy for just a second, the -- we have a hedging program that isn't meant to hit the peaks and valleys of the costs, but it's meant to provide some opportunistic, but more stable costs over time in the evap area. So in terms of the cost structure, I think the last couple of years, we've -- because of the lower volumes and the way in which the production has needed to happen, we've been much less efficient with our man power at our mines. And where we were headed, and where we had achieved here and kind in the middle of 2011, was a per unit cost that was very close to where we have historically been in the kind of '07, '08 and '09 periods. We were producing at a very efficient rate and our man power -- the man power efficiencies went along with that. As you go through the rest of 2011 and 2012, there will be less efficiencies because of the factors that you heard about this morning. But, again, those are certainly recoverable under the insurance and we would expect that as we get into 2012 and have full mine capabilities, after the winter season, that we'd return to those kind of levels. So hopefully, that answers your question about when we can achieve that. UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi. A couple of questions about -- well, first on SOP. If a grower skips a season, as we saw some do last year, due to the importance of that crop, in terms of the dollar value, and the magnification of 3% to 37%, how long can they go without applying SOP to their crops? Can they skip a second year if you have another cool year? Or, do they have to start applying it next year? UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I am not an agronomist, but I have an opinion. And obviously plants need nutrients, they need potassium, so this is something that cannot continue. It seems to be a slight and then an ever-accelerating impact on the plant. So I think more than two seasons will be very difficult. We're now in the third year of dramatically changing prices. We are hearing a lot of anecdotal evidence across the board about impacts on yields, both in SOP and in fact in the broader potash market. So I think, personally, that the farmers have to apply. They have a dramatic effect on the yield. And this is the third year, if you consider 2009, '10, and now '11. Tracking has changed. So I think we're back in the business here. So it seems to be somewhat of a slowly and then ever increasing impact as you go over time. UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Okay. And a question on magnesium. What -- should we be think -- what margin should we be thinking for that business, over time? Is that corporate margins or can we have a range there? ROD UNDERDOWN: Yes, this is Rod. Magnesium chloride pricing is -- has a wide variety of prices, and therefore a wide variety of margins. It is probably most akin to our highway deicing business, in terms of the quantities and the kind of average pricing and margins that we experience. So it's -- and as we expand that, if we're successful, as we expect to be, with placing many of those additional tons that are available to us, the incremental cost of producing those -- many of those products is very low. So, we think of the margin on a percent basis as similar to salt. More similar to salt than fertilizer. So it's good and on a per ton basis, because the incremental cost of producing those liquid brines is very minimal, it should have good leverage in terms of the percent. UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Sorry, just back on the salt side for a sec. Can you talk through how much it would cost to build a new salt mine and the amount of annual tons you would expect to extract from that? UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I could probably take that. I mean, there hasn't been a new mine built in awhile. And the equivalent of a new mine was built in Goderich from the period of 2006 to 2010. And it cost us something like $80 million and we got the equivalent of 2.5 million tons of capacity, which, Keith, I believe, mentioned, is a larger increment than many of the competitors that we compete with. If you were starting from scratch and you had to go find a site and develop it, some of the estimates we've come up with is to get a mine in that category of 2 million tons, would be about $250 million. And it would probably take you four or five years from the day you said let's start to the day you were fully producing. And it might even take you a few more years to penetrate the market. Because, of course, the market's fully served today and then there is a significant amount of product that Compass Minerals has capacity on that is not being placed. So you would basically have to spend $250 million, wait four or five years, and then fight your way in before you ever had a chance of getting any kind of cash flow that would be attractive. So we believe that the actions we've taken have been both tactically important for us to have sustainable growth, but strategically important to make sure that that reality doesn't occur. Of course, they may reach a point at which the profitability of salt changes and becomes even more positive, which would change those dynamics. But you also have the ability and theory to import salt into North America. And there's probably a price -- selling price of salt at which imports become more viable. So somewhere between a new mine and an incursion of imports is probably the area in which we operate today, below. UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: And, sorry, just on the specialty potash side, can you talk about -- you mentioned the $100 to $150 historical premium. Could you talk about what the economic drivers, either from a value-add or from a yield perspective or from a substitution perspective, how -- what are the drivers of that spread and how those have evolved over time? Thanks. UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Well, the key driver is from the farmers' view point, is that they get higher yields, almost across the board. They get longer shelf life for their products. So they can afford to pay, and do pay, a premium over potassium chloride. So the big driver is the fact that the farmer is making more money using his sulfate of potash than not, in these instances. We have seen this dramatically, say, for instance, in potatoes, where the yields can be dramatically higher. They get the higher number one potatoes. Most potatoes are produced and stored, so coming out of storage, you get a -- up to 15% or 20% higher mass of potatoes coming out. Those are the economics that drive our business, that $100 to $150 spread compared to potassium chloride. UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: (inaudible question - microphone inaccessible) UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Well, there is, that is its value equation that I mentioned. In fact, part of the marketing group, which contains an agronomist, is for us to define that more precisely by crop. How many more bushels or whatever the measure is per acre, per crop and then the value of that crop? We sell it. We can see an example in this Chlori-Mag, and we know after 20 years of research from universities, five to 10 bushels per acre is there today. Wheat is $7 a bushel. So we can see -- a farmer can see a $35 per acre increase using magnesium chloride. So that same sort of effect manifests itself by crop. So we have data by crop. So that's part of the marketing campaign. It's to more -- precisely define that equation. Educate the grower, for them to use more SOP. ANGELO BRISIMITZAKIS: The other dimension of the kind of the SOP pricing is one that Ron mentioned in terms of the cost that the majority of the production comes from. I mean, the majority of SOP production comes from MOP plus sulfuric acid. So in essence, you have a floor on SOP pricing, which is MOP cost and then you have a ceiling, if you may, on SOP pricing, which is the amount of value you can convince the grower that he is obtaining. So somewhere in that zone, the market has settled at around $100 to $150. However, each crop has its own value equation. So it's pretty complicated. And then a lot of the distribution to the AG market goes through dealers or distributors, who may be selling to growers of multiple crops. So how do you differentiate a different crop when the source of supply is through a common dealer. So, those are some of the marketing challenges that we have. UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi. Maybe a question or clarification for Ron. Just looking at -- the claim is you are the largest producer in the Western Hemisphere of SOP. So on chart 107, you have your capabilities at 400,000 tons going to over 600,000 tons through 2015. There's another company here listed, IC Potash, based out of New Mexico, with 660,000 tons estimated new capacity for the Western Hemisphere. Who is that player and if that -- if I'm reading that right, wouldn't that be a big potential competitive threat to you guys? What am I missing? RON BRYAN: Well, IC Potash is a -- is in a feasibility study. It's a very small company. It's looking to build an SOP facility in New Mexico. So when we say we're the largest, we are the largest producer in the western hemisphere, with the other competitor being SQM in Chile. So we're by far the largest today. So I've mentioned that. They're out there. They're talking. They're looking at the economics. What you can say is obviously they realize the value of the SOP market and they're attempting to build a business, so -- . ANGELO BRISIMITZAKIS: Yes, I think you have to look at a start up versus an established player. I think that we've been in the market for 41 years, 42 years. And I think we're the only producer in North America today of SOP. But obviously the global attractiveness of potash has attracted folks from the mining industry, from the metals industry, from the start up companies, people that are looking to flip things. Will all these projects get built? Probably not. Will some get built? Probably yes. We're not picking winners and losers here. But I think it's a statement to the attractiveness of potash, as being -- there's three primary nutrients. And of the three, I think potash is the most attractive and I'll let others talk about MOP. I think as a market leader, Potash Corp does a very good job presenting that. But we believe SOP is kind of the crown jewel of the potash segment. Because as Ron has explained, not -- we get an $150 premium today for our potash versus commodity potash. And in some of the applications that Ron talked about, and particularly if they can be developed domestically, it's a great leverage for us from a profitability point of view. OLGA GUTENEVA, ANALYST, JPMORGAN: A question on SOP costs. So your cost per ton in 2010 was probably around $280. In the first half of this year, I don't know $300 per ton. And I remember, you were talking about $180 or $200 going forward, sometime in the future. Could you outline the steps, how you view these costs? So I guess, second half this year is going to be even higher -- more than $300? Then you were talking about $60 per ton additional costs? How are you planning to get to $180 or $200 per ton and when? UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Sure. Thanks, Olga, for that question. The cost -- the facility itself is a somewhat fixed cost facility. We have to pump the same amount of brine, it's more of a chemical plant and that the man power needed to run it is somewhat fixed. And with the lower expected production volumes, we're managing the plant to run at lower levels between now and the end of the year, plus next year. And so, those are all affecting the costs in the very short term. And the amount of product that we're running through there is significantly less, the harvest was a very significant decline from what would be a normal harvest or a past harvest. And all of those things affect the costs in the short term. So again, we believe that the cost, based on our assessment of how we're going to run the plant the rest of the year, plus during 2012, at reduced rates, are going to result in lower costs -- or in higher costs, including a step-up in the second half and an incremental $60 next year, when production will be much lower than it is -- than it has been this year. In terms of how we get to the lower cost level, I think we've described our current 350,000 tons as in -- if we're operating in a normal manner, we should be able to be at $225 per ton. Now, the expansion is expected to get us below the $200 range. So when that fully comes online and, as you've seen from our expectations, that's in the '14, '15 kind of time frame. That's when the cost step-down will occur. Now in terms of our costs for 2012, we've talked about those, 2013 should be much more consistent with that 225 level than what we're going to experience over the next 18 months. So there's a -- those are kind of the step changes that you should expect. Of course, you can't -- there's also an SG&A component. So when you look at our costs, there's a component in there that includes SG&A. And then we do have some royalty costs that aren't included in that, but are also recorded in our costs as well. So there's another couple of components of our -- of what runs through from net sales down to operating earnings that aren't included in those numbers. But we feel confident we can get there. Yes. ANGELO BRISIMITZAKIS: And some of the numbers that are being communicated by other companies may or may not include those same components. We've seen numbers like $160 a ton or $180 a ton put out there. You need to check to make sure that depreciation has been included or royalties have been included, or SG&A is or is not. What you see from us, in our financial statements, is kind of the all-in costs and what you might see from others might be more of a production cost and not the fuller costs. And we don't mind paying royalties. Usually when we pay more royalties, it means our selling price has gone up. So while costs will go up, just as our royalties go up, that'll be a good thing. What we really want to focus on is the actual production cost leverage that we get from the increased volume and from the increased efficiency that our Phase I and Phase II investments will provide. And we have been slow to achieve that. And the weaker solar evaporation season will delay that, again we don't have the feedstock to run through our facility. OLGA GUTENEVA: I apologize, what are those royalties, once again? ANGELO BRISIMITZAKIS: I'm sorry? OLGA GUTENEVA: What are those royalties? What is that? UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Yes. Sure, we --. We pay a royalty for extracting SOP from the Great Salt Lake, and it's paid to the state. So it's a state royalty amount that -- . OLGA GUTENEVA: How much is that? UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: It's typically around 5% of the revenue, is what royalty rate is. UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Last conference call, you provided a heuristic on diesel pricing changes and the effect on salt profitability. What -- could you remind us of that again? UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Yes, I don't remember the specific guidance that we gave, Ed, but I do know that last year, there was a bottoming out of oil prices in the late second quarter and the early -- during the third quarter. I want to say oil was in the $70 to $75 range at that point. And oil is typically a good surrogate for diesel, although there is some difference there because of WTI versus Brent crude. But it's a pretty good surrogate. And then last year, the price went up fairly dramatically in the fourth quarter. It was in the $85 to $90 range. And that's currently what we're seeing now. So I think what I said -- I think what we said at the last call is that we continue to see where our per unit shipping and handling costs are going to be higher in the third quarter than they were last year, and every, roughly, $10 of oil translates into about -- a little less than a dollar per ton. That's just a rough approximation, but that's a general way to think about it. By the time we get to the winter, to the extent oil prices stay where they are, or diesel as a surrogate, we would expect that to be -- to flatten out. Maybe not come all the way down to prior year, but certainly to flatten out versus that big differential that will exist in the third quarter. UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: And your updated guidance from today, that reflects diesel costs as of today or are they higher or lower than they are today? UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: That does reflect the diesel costs as of where they are, generally, today. Oil actually -- I mean, has fluctuated around, but generally its stayed kind of between that $85 and $90 range. So that's kind of what the forward forecast is. UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Okay. And shifting to chlor-alkali, have you seen any effect on demand from Chinese slowing or PVC demand? UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: No, no, we haven't in recent times. There have been some fluctuations with PVC with the housing market, but that's been over the last couple of years. Actually we're -- what we hear from some of the industry is that shipping resins from the Gulf of Mexico, where you've got a real stable natural gas price, is positive as you look at -- as you look forward. But that's going to shake out over some time. UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: But near term, you haven't seen any fluctuation. UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: No. UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: In operating range. UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: No. And in fact, we see the uptick after we came out of the great recession and now we're seeing that leveling off. But we're actually back to the rates, in our business, that we were before the recession. UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you. UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes, Ron, over here. I had two questions regarding volume growth. One, can you size the opportunity that might be presented by those marketing efforts, the agronomic efforts, you talked about all the specialty crops. Can you give us some idea as to how much more volume you might ship in North America if those folks were successful in their agronomic efforts? And then I was intrigued by the wheat thing. I wasn't quite sure, though, why a wheat farmer wouldn't add MOP to get the chloride as a micronutrient. Why would they use SOP to do that? I'm a little confused by that whole wheat thing you talked about. RON BRYAN: Well, let me answer the wheat thing first. This is a magnesium chloride. UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: (inaudible question - microphone inaccessible) RON BRYAN: So it's a lower cost product than potassium chloride. So, yes, he could add potassium chloride, but that's a much higher value cost than magnesium chloride is. And the soil doesn't need the potassium. So we believe -- in fact, we're now selling this product. This isn't brand new. We're already in some year or two ago started selling this product, so we know it works. We've had commercial sales and quite excited that this will work in the Midwest part of the country. So back to the marketing thing. Let me put it this way. We have our Phase I and II announcements, and you see the volumes that we see there. We're very confident we can sell that incremental volume, most of which is in the United States market and that's what we're assuming, based on the market research that we've seen, I think there's that much opportunity to grow the pie bigger, if you will. Because we know where we sell SOP, so we can calculate equivalent acres, if you will. We know from the USDA how many acres there are in potatoes and almonds and fruits and vegetables. And there's a big difference between the acres that we're now selling and those acres that exist. We think that difference can partially be captured with this marketing campaign, by understanding and communicating the value equation. So I would characterize our marketing effort by saying we've got our expansion coming. I'm fully expecting to be selling most of that volume in the US market. UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Mark, if I could just add to the first answer, just keep in mind the magnesium chloride is a co-product of our evaporation facility out here and you'll see, I believe, see the Mag chloride pond today. But it's essentially after the -- all of the evaporation has occurred, it's what's left at the end of the process. Now we don't price -- we don't cost it like a byproduct. We cost it with some co-product costing mechanisms there. But it -- but -- so while we -- so you were trying to figure out the price point, why would the farmer be interested in applying this as opposed to MOP, the Mag chloride would be much more cost effective for them. But our costs are also similarly much lower than, say, a potassium chloride producer would be of [KCl]. So the margins on it are good. And to the extent it becomes larger, which we expect that it will, we'll then kind of separate that out and that way you'll be able to understand it a little better than just including it in as SOP volumes and our statistics and talking about that. Because it could -- it has the potential to get a little confusing as to what our SOP -- real SOP prices are to the extent it grows and the way that we think it could. UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: (inaudible question - microphone inaccessible) UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Yes. Yes, that's right. ANGELO BRISIMITZAKIS: The Mag chloride that's sold by -- . UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Fertilizer. ANGELO BRISIMITZAKIS: The fertilizer business. UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Yes. ANGELO BRISIMITZAKIS: The Mag chloride that's sold by our C&I business is in our C&I segment and the Mag sold by our highway business is both dedusting and deicing, is showing up in our highway business. That's what I'm saying. It really is the most broad-based mineral we have. We haven't talked a lot about it, and it was really the SOP expansion that drove it to prominence and we're very excited that all of our businesses have embraced Mag chloride. And it's a hell of a mineral. OLGA GUTENEVA: Yes. Just to follow-up on the previous question. In terms of new SOP sales, following your expansion, because you are so big in the domestic market, do you think that the domestic SOP market is pretty mature and your new tons you will be selling internationally? Or you still think you will sell it domestically? Like how are you planning to sell your new SOP volumes? UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Well, back to the earlier point, we do expect to sell most of this incremental volume in the US markets and therefore grow the pie bigger. And I'll make a point, again, that we know where we sell SOP, so we can calculate equivalent acres of crops. This goes on to the USDA has very good data by the county level on every one of these crops. And we see where we're selling and equivalent acres, we see what's out there, and there's a huge difference. So there's a huge opportunity. And so part of what this market research has done for us is to say well, why is there such a gap? And the biggest single gap is the education at the farmer level. Farmers, and again, I'm not a farmer either, but farmers tend to do what farmers have always done. And we've seen this time and again in this new marketing campaign where if you can educate that farmer, and he can see the benefit of this, then they'll buy SOP. I had this one anecdotal data point, I was at a conference here two months ago and a potato farmer who had grown potatoes for 20 years had barely heard of SOP. Which I find remarkable. But it's an opportunity to educate him and we know it. So we're confident we can grow this in -- mainly in the US market. There will be some growth in the export markets. But our focus is here. So market asked to kind of calibrate around the volumes here. I think we say we've got Phase II coming and the time, most of that will stay in the US market, through our efforts here. UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: I just wanted to follow-up a little bit on SOP and the mining of SOP. K+S is doing it from ore. How does that compare in terms of costs relative to solar evaporation? How's the quality. What are the differences? UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Okay. Obviously, we don't really know K+S's costs. I mean, these estimates that I showed was made from a study that was done some years ago. They mine an ore body called [Hart Salts], which they basically make potassium chloride and kieserite, which is magnesium sulfite. They then convert that to [shonite] and make the SOP. We think their costs are more than ours. Part that is part of the labor costs they do have and they do report the number of employees that they have in their potash segment. It's a fairly large number of people there. And we think their costs are higher than the sulfur-based production. And so, we're fairly confident that the data presented up here is correct in the sense that it's on a total basis the cheapest we think the world. UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: (inaudible question - microphone inaccessible) UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Much lower, yes. UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: What did you say? UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I think it's much lower. Yes. UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Much lower? Okay. So then with -- just talking about IC Potash, if that was to ever come on, in looking at what their feasibility study might say or their process, does that look similar to what K+S is doing? Or, do you see anything different there that would make them be higher, lower? Just curious. UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: That's an area we're still looking at. I'm not sure, based on the latest data, that they've completely solidified on the process technology that they do plan to use. It -- SOP has never been produced from polyhalite before, so this would be a new commercial venture. So we're not sure of the technology, and therefore, we can't comment on the cost impact. But I would add -- Angelo's one point, you should look carefully at the costs that are reported. We report cost of goods sold, which is all costs, royalties, depreciation, and so forth. Obviously, we have underlying production costs. You have to look carefully at whether these people are including all costs. ANGELO BRISIMITZAKIS: And just on that polyhalite discussion, I think Ron hit a good point, K+S, established producer, very fine producer, we compete with them on salt also. That's an established mineral ore-based process. Some of these new projects, which includes the two projects that have been mentioned in the UK, and the ICP project that is in New Mexico, is based on polyhalite, which has never been proven commercially. UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Right. ANGELO BRISIMITZAKIS: To produce SOP. Now there is work that has bee done 40, 50 years ago that says it's theoretically possible. But it -- there is no commercial facility that takes polyhalite today and produces SOP. So we've got apples, oranges and pears going on here. We have the proven pond-based SOP processes, which we practiced for 42 years., which you can find in Chile and you can find in China. Well established. The well established mining process that K+S practices. We think it's slightly more expensive than the solar pond base. But competitive. Then the majority of commercial production today is with the KCl plus sulfuric acid process, which we think is the high-cost environmentally unfriendly, because your byproduct is HCL. And then you have these new ideas all around polyhalite, which have yet -- none of them have been proven yet, but potentially are a major threat if they get proven or potentially they never materialize. And we're just uncertain. Obviously, we're studying it. But I think there's a lot of uncertainty around the polyhalite approach. Would you agree, Ron? RON BRYAN: I would certainly agree. UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible). You guys -- a question for Rod on capital expenditure. 2012, '15, you expect it to reach $150 million. Why is your maintenance CapEx going down? Is it because of the efficiency synergies? Can you make a comment on that? And out of those $150 million total, what's Phase I and Phase II in SOP? ROD UNDERDOWN: Sure. So, just so you know, we did present a range there. I know the bar goes all the way to $150 million. The range of average could be anywhere between $130 million and $150 million, just to be clear. The maintenance CapEx has averaged around $50 million over the last four years and so we've presented it on an inflated basis of $55 million here. It's been a little bit higher in 2011, but that number that we presented in the future average is higher than it was for the 2008, 2010 average. So it's just a way to think about it is somewhere between $50 million and $60 million, and I think it's meant to be $55 million on this chart. So the -- in terms of the future costs of the other significant pay-back projects, as we have talked in the past, there is about $160 million associated with the Phase II expansion. And of that, we're spending about $40 million between -- well, we really started it in 2010, but then 2011 and a little bit into 2012 as well. So that's the pond sealing part of the Phase II. The additional, roughly, $120 million, and we're still finalizing that number exactly, but that is included in this four-year average of 100 -- from 2012 into 2015. And that makes up the majority of the amount that gets close to $130 million. We also are spending multiple tens of millions of dollars related to the continuous miner. And then there's other possibilities that we'd undertake in that outlook period, depending on market conditions and this work. UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: A question on your capital structure. You guys are getting a pretty good look into what you think the companies are going to look like in 2013, but you should be generating a decent amount of cash flow out in those years. You've done a great job in terms of raising the dividend over time. What do you think the capital structure of the Company is going to look when we get out to those years? ROD UNDERDOWN: Well, what I would expect is that our earnings are going to significantly rise over this period of time, as you've seen the ranges of projections. And I don't expect that we'll use any of the cash flow to actually pay down debt. I think debt is relatively cheap and it doesn't really warrant a pay-down. Plus, our leverage ratio at the kinds of numbers that we're looking at, would be in the forecasts, would certainly fall from where it currently is. So as I mentioned, I think our focus over the next couple of years is to get the investment projects that we have, the internal investment projects, lined, or completed. And it would be at that point that if there hasn't been any strategic M&A arise, that we'd be in a position to talk about other financial kinds of transactions. But -- and I think I mentioned that those kind of M&A or any financial transactions, to the extent they add leverage to where we would be at that point in time, shouldn't be viewed as negative. So it's -- I don't want to get into the specifics, in terms of what the leverage ratio will look like, but if our earnings go up and we're not paying down debt, with that excess cash flow, then our -- just the rise in earnings will reduce our leverage. And I think it would be unusual for us to pay down debt further from here. So that only leaves really a couple of different options. Either additional internal investment, which could be in the form of Phase III at the SOP, strategic M&A that needs to be right in the sweet spot of where we are and accretive and strategic, or financial transactions. So those are the options. UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes, I just had a two-part question on SOP. I guess the first part would be for Ron. Can you just give us a sense for either the people or dollars, just the incremental efforts that you are making to reach out to farmers and how specifically you're doing that? So relative to what you would have a year ago, what it looks like now and what it might look like a year from today? And then, my other follow-up would just be on IC Potash. I mean the body language I'm getting is that you guys maybe think that's a bit of a long shot. And if that's true, I guess, why do you feel that way? Thanks. UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Okay. Let me talk about question one. We have three full-time personnel that we've newly hired that constitute our marketing group. So our main customer base are dealers who then buy other products and sell to farmers. So we're reaching both to the farmer and the dealer. We want to reach through our dealers and to the farmer as well. We're doing that in multiple ways. One, first, with the dealers themselves. We sell to people who are very small. We sell to people who are very large. Some of these larger accounts have hundreds of sales people and we're partnering with them to take our people and educate, in many cases, 50 salesmen at a time or 100 salesmen at a time. We've done that and our dealers want to do this. They want to grow their business as well. So we can leverage our assets. We can take and work with some of these national chains and educate hundreds of salesmen to go out and promote SOP across the US. Secondly, we're, as I mentioned, we are following the traditional print ads, trade shows, that sort of thing that cater to the individual farmer by crop. And these are all crop-specific. Every almond grower has his own industry and trend. Potatoes, alfalfa, other crops. So we're targeting those crops specifically. Part of this market research that we did is how does one reach the farmer? Do they read ads? Do they follow emails? I mean, part of the market research is what's the most effective way to reach that farmer in that market? So we're tailoring these campaigns based on the research on what's the most effective way. So with that, we're really excited about the prospects of this. And we've already seen some results which are buried into some of the sales we've seen in some new markets and penetration of the other crops. And the second one, I think as Angelo mentioned, we do, of course, follow what we -- what ICP Potash reports, as do others, and we make our own internal assessments. We're not going to speculate today and talk about our final assessment of that whole venture. It is new, obviously. I think the polyhalite, as we've mentioned, has never been proven before. That doesn't mean it can't be done, but it is an issue. So us, K+S, others use methods that have been around for decades. This is a new one. I think it also kind of indicates the interest in potash and sulfate, but potash in particular. ANGELO BRISIMITZAKIS: So I think we'll take one last question and then we'll move over to Corey's presentation on the site. UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes, it's going to be a quick one. ANGELO BRISIMITZAKIS: Sure. UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Just wanted to get your views on the salt market in general. Because you talked, like in the past, it's -- the market shares are pretty stable, because it doesn't make sense to move the stuff around too far. But with a new entrant to the market, recently, have you noticed any changes? Like are they willing to sell for lower margins to gain more market share? ANGELO BRISIMITZAKIS: Yes, I mean, I'll take that. That's a good final question. I mean, there was no net addition of production capability in North America. K+S has been in the salt business, probably, as long as we've been in the salt business. And in fact, the way we compete with them in Europe, historically, in salt. So they're well known to us and K+S had a salt business in North America that was an import business, where they imported Chilean salt through their east coast distribution arm. So what happened when K+S acquired Morton was just kind of the marriage of two existing players in North America. No new production came in. No new people really came in. No new products really came in. It was a very logical transaction for them and it pointed to the attractiveness of the North American market. Its' kind of like the SOP discussion, is it's the ultimate compliment when everyone comes rushing to your party. So like we've seen players rush to SOP, we've had all that discussion about whether it's IC Potash or CPL or Sirius, or whoever the SOP potential player is, it points to the attractiveness of the North American market. We haven't seen, nor do we expect to see, any dramatic change in macro strategy of what was Morton and what was K+S. I'm sure there's small things that will change, but the way you get better is by competing against better competition. So I think we'll raise our game accordingly and I would be very surprised if this story is very different in the years to come. So, we'll ask Corey to come up. I think we'll have to turn this mic on for Corey and he'll tell us about what we'll see at our Ogden facility. (Presentation) COREY MILNE, OGDEN SITE MANAGER, COMPASS MINERALS INTERNATIONAL INC.: Good morning. Is that all right? And welcome to the Valley of the Great Salt Lake. When Brigham Young entered this valley in 1847, at a location just east of us, leading the band of pioneers that ultimately settled this state, he said this is the place. And we believe this is the place. This is truly an advantaged asset for Compass Minerals. We are delighted to share with you today, on a tour of this facility, we have a great passion for what we do. We operate this facility on your behalf as owners and just delighted to share with you that today. We'll give you an overview, help you understand what you'll see today, we'll travel to Ogden together, a bus tour, a view from the helicopter and help you get an appreciation of what this is. As it's been mentioned, we have three products that we harvest from the Great Salt Lake. Salt, sulfate of potash, or SOP and magnesium chloride. And you've seen, through the presentations today, how those products are interlaced throughout the three North American business units that sell these products. Our salt product is sold both in bulk and in package. Deicing and water softening, animal uses, the highway business and the C&I business will sell that. The sulfate of potash business, the crop nutrients, we talked about it. And then the magnesium chloride, in all three business units. So this satellite view is what you would get if you took that last space shuttle flight over the Great Salt Lake and looked out your window and took a photograph. If -- when you arrive at the plant, if you were to get in the truck with me and drive from the plant area on the east side, and across our ponds and across the causeway of the railroad that divides the north and the south, you see the red and the green color there, and go all the way to the western side of our ponds, about 50 miles, it would take us five hours to make that round trip. So today, we'll see just a portion of that. When you go up in the helicopter, then you'll get a little bit better idea of how vast it is. We'll stand out in the middle of one of these ponds, but I really can't help you appreciate how large the area is just showing you this picture. Now, you look at the Great Salt Lake and it's divided into two major arms. The north arm, that red color, is the true color of the lake. The red color is because of the natural algae and bacteria that thrive in the higher concentration in the northern arm. In the late '50s, the railroad constructed the causeway across the lake and where you see that brown line where we depict the Behren's Trench, that actually covers up the causeway that you can't see in the photograph. That causeway separated the lake and actually created, essentially, our first solar pond. There is no freshwater inlet in the north arm of the lake. That all comes into the south arm, it concentrates, and then it flows north through the causeway to the northern arm. The green color is just the green algae of the lower concentration brine of the south arm. As mentioned earlier, we are the only company that takes advantage of that higher concentration on the north arm. So on the west side, we pump into our ponds. And it takes about a year, but that brine concentrates in those bonds. The Behren's Trench is a canal. Just like the farmers that we sell our SOP to, that use water canals for irrigation, we have a huge underwater canal that flows just like water above ground, except this flows along the bottom of the Great Salt Lake, beneath that waters of the Great Salt Lake. And we rely on the density difference of this concentrated brine that is higher in density than the lighter brine above it. And that transfers across the pond. So -- you changed it for me. Thank you. And so as that -- that's about 21 miles to go across those ponds. And about seven days. So the picture that you see right here is looking down the Behren's Trench. And you see that red color and that brine. We're transferring the more concentrated brine across to our east pond. I want to back this up and have you look at those, the east ponds. Now the east ponds, we're feeding them after concentrating from the west and if you look in the east ponds, you can see some faint green color and some faint pink color. The pink color is on the upper part and the green color there. A little bit faint, but that's -- that green color is when we begin to concentrate and make our potassium minerals. So then on the east side of the ponds, the brine pump there takes about two years to concentrate and make the minerals that we will harvest. You ask, why does it take so long? It's the quantity of brine that we're moving. It's a very, very large quantity and it takes that long to move through the system. The first mineral to deposit is sodium chloride. We deposit sodium chloride on the west side of the lake and on the east side of the lake. Most of the area on the east pond is sodium chloride that's deposited. We only harvest a small quantity of that. The next mineral that naturally deposits as the brine evaporates are potassium and magnesium sulfate salts. Co-precipitating with that is sodium chloride. So that is the latter part of the eastern ponds and that is that greenish color that you saw. And when you go out on the bus today, you will see some green colored brines and some pink colored brines that you'll recognize. At the end of the process, when we've evaporated as far as it will naturally evaporate, we've deposited our salt, we've deposited the potash salt, then we have a brine that is an amber color. That is our magnesium chloride. These colors are all natural. We don't add anything to them. It's high in magnesium chloride. Those are our three products. And you can see here, where we're harvesting the potash. Now this graphic that you see breaks out our three products and our three processes that we'll show you. And I know your handout there is very small. When you get to the plant, we will give a little handout that it expands that and I'll have you take that around on your tours for reference and help you understand what you're seeing through the process. So first is our salt process. And we harvest the salt that's deposited in the solar ponds. Some of that salt, we take directly to a stockpile and we ship that as a final product for highway deicing. Most of it, we take it through a washing process, and we wash some of the other minerals off of that, some of the color. That product, at that point, we can sell into the chemical industry. So that is -- so the highway salt and the industrial salt is sold through our North American business units. The washed salt is further processed, by taking it into the salt plant, where we dry it, we'll screen it, we'll crush it, compact it, make it in blocks. We will process it into the different forms that we need. Now some of that product, we will ship as bulk. Some of it, we will package. We can ship it by rail and we can ship it by truck. The material that is dried in the plants, most of that is sold through our consumer and industrial business. Some of that, through our highway deicing. Now our second process is the SOP process. And this is the order that they deposit in the solar ponds as well. So we harvest the minerals, and that one picture you saw was harvesting the material from the ponds. The ponds are evaporating during the summer months, June through August. During the fall, winter and spring months, we're harvesting those minerals and feeding them to our plants, the salt plant, the SOP plant or magnesium chloride. So this material fed into the SOP plant is crushed, it's sized, it's mixed with the brine in the plant to make a slurry. There's several minerals that come in with the harvest salt. We convert all of those minerals into a single intermediate mineral called shonite. It's a potassium, magnesium sulfate salt. We then take that material, filter it and send it to a crystalizer, where we add hot water and make our final product, potassium sulfate. Now that can sold in a crystalline form or we can then further process it by compacting it and making it into larger granules. So we sell it in different sizes, so that we can meet our different customers' needs. And then our last product line is the magnesium chloride. Like I said, this is a liquid material that we harvest from our ponds. It's what's left over after we pump in thousands and thousands of acre feet of brining from the Great Salt Lake that is a very small percentage of the brine we start out with. Now this material, we can ship it directly as a dust suppressant. This is our DustGard product, without any further refining. Typically, that sells in the summer time. This same product can then be refined, de-sulfated, so that we don't get salt precipitate in the winter time, and it ships in the winter, so that we can use it for anti-icing or for deicing on the roads, as Keith as mentioned. Those products are sold through the highway business. This brine can be further refined, color can be removed, it can be evaporated, and then we cool it and we make a solid product, magnesium chloride, and this is a specialty deicer and this is sold in our consumer and industrial business, Jerry mentioned that. It's a high value specialty fertilizer -- specialty deicer that works at lower temperatures. So that is the process that we'll show you later today and Theresa is going to help us through the logistics of how we'll do that.

Schreiner says the Green Party will work with the food and agriculture sector and other levels of government to develop regulations which recognize the different sizes of farms and food processors, eliminate tax penalties, reduce zoning restrictions, and improve income stabilization programs. \"The Green Party of Ontario is absolutely committed to supporting family farmers and local food processors and we think over the last decade, in particular, our family farmer and local food processors have gotten forgotten at Queen's Park,\" said Schreiner. Schreiner says too many regulations were developed with the needs of larger operations in mind. \"To expect smaller food processors to meet those regulations is unrealistic, and frankly, inappropriate for the size and scale of an operation like Metheral Meats,\" said Schreiner, while at the Dunedin processing plant. \"What we're calling for is what we call 'smart regulations.' Regulations that take the size, the scale, and the location of an operation into account to ensure food safety, but with an appropriate expectation on the local food processors so we don't put such a burden on them that we essentially regulate them out of business.\" About 70 % of small and medium size processors have closed within the last decade. \"We're starting to lose our local food processing infrastructure and that hurts our farmers because it limits the options to market access,\" said Schreiner. Schreiner says the Green Party will ensure all Ontarians have access to healthy, local food. Metheral Meats owner Neil Metheral says the amount of food safety paperwork required by the government puts a burden on small processing plants. \"Most of my workers here, by the end of the day, they don't want to do paperwork, they just want to go home -they're done for the day,\" said Metheral. \"The cost of regulations imposed on processors will most affect the profit for the farmer and the price for the consumer,\" said Metheral in a news release. \"With better support we could hire a student to oversee HACCP to assess our quality at a decent wage. In most plants we can't keep up with these cost.\" Metheral says the farming industry needs to attract more young farmers, but doesn't think it will happen because they will not be able to afford to get into the business. Metheral, whose farm has seen eight generations working on it, and who opened the processing plant about 20 years ago, says farming has been good to him. \"But I've seen it, in the last few years, getting a lot harder for young farmers to make a living for their family -they've got to have a job off the farm, a good job, to support the farm and I don't think that's right,\" said Metheral. \"Farming should be looking after itself.\" - ksmith@theenterprisebulletin.com"}, {"title": "HEM Hemisphere GPS promotes updated Outback products", "article": "Hemisphere GPS Inc (TSX-V:HEM) Shares Issued 60,824,409 Last Close 8/30/2011 $0.83 Tuesday August 30 2011 - News Release Mr. Jeff Farrar reports HEMISPHERE GPS ANNOUNCES NEW OUTBACK GUIDANCE SOLUTIONS FOR INCREASED PRECISION FARMING PERFORMANCE Hemisphere GPS Inc. has introduced new Outback Guidance solutions that deliver high-level precision-farming performance and productivity to all sizes of farm operations. Farmers continually strive for increased yields and efficiency and those efforts translate into a need for improved accuracy and performance regarding field operations. Now, combining new eDriveX features with Outback S3 spray and rate control and new long-range RTK receivers A320/A321, customers will have the most practical precision-farming solution available from Hemisphere GPS. Farm operations of all sizes appreciate the affordability and versatility of Outback Guidance system performance. New eDriveX features Hemisphere GPS introduces two advancements in eDriveX with eTurns functionality for customers seeking precision steering and control performance: reverse steering and slow speed control. Reverse steering provides customers with the ability to reverse course under certain circumstances. Slow speed control allows eDriveX users to operate their equipment in demanding, slow-speed conditions down to 0.25 mile per hour -- crucial for many specialty crop operations. Additionally, eDriveX now supports 35 installation kits covering 335 vehicle models, including such manufactures as Case IH, John Deere and New Holland. The hydraulic steering installation kits come complete with all the necessary hoses, fittings and brackets. Detailed, yet easy to use, vehicle-specific step-by-step instructions enable customers to install the system themselves with no special training. Typically, the entire hydraulic installation can be done in just a few hours. A320 and A321 GPS and GLONASS smart antennas The A320/A321 RTK smart antennas offer affordable, versatile and portable positioning solutions with centimetre-level accuracy. They are powered by the company's Eclipse II GNSS (GPS and GLONASS) receiver technology and combine the receiver, antenna and optional radio modems, all in one rugged package. With dual-serial, CAN and pulse output options and support for GPS and GLONASS RTK, L-band HP/XP/VBS/G2 and SBAS, A320 and A321 are ideal for all types of precision-farming applications. The performance is upgradeable through authorization codes so users can choose an entry-level version A320 and upgrade the performance in the future. A320 is compatible with nearly all types of network RTK systems including most CORS networks. With the company's patent-pending SureTrack technology, A320/A321 improve GNSS performance, particularly with RTK and GLONASS applications. Benefits include extended and more robust RTK solutions as the rover RTK receiver will process all available signals even if they are not common with the base receiver. Users have the option of a 900-megahertz-radio portable-base solution, a five-watt 400-megahertz-radio fixed-base solution or a cellular data modem. The 400-megahertz long-range radio allows farmers to expand their areas of operation of up to 18 miles or more and complete more work in less time. For even greater range, the optional cellular modem can be configured to receive RTK corrections from the Internet -- from a single base station or a network of base stations. For larger farms, these options result in less time spent moving equipment and subsequently less time in the field completing the same amount of work. A320 is designed to be mounted on a variety of farm machinery for kinematic positioning and navigation applications, while A321 can be used as a portable base station mounted on a tripod or riser. Outback S3 and AC110 spray and section control Hemisphere GPS is continually developing solutions for reducing input costs and increasing yields, and the latest is section and rate control for both new and existing customers of the widely popular Outback S3 guidance terminal. The new AC110 application controls ECU, combined with Outback S3, provides rate control for one product and section control for up to 10 sections. As the first offering in what is expected to be a series of rate/section control products, the S3 with AC110 provides an onscreen display of sections with section override, support for eDriveTC and eDriveX, an external report viewer, and interface kits for Raven (440/450, 4400/4600) and Teejet (854) models. \"Our Outback line of products is designed to provide farmers affordable and simple solutions that improve productivity,\" said Kip Pendleton, senior vice-president and general manager, agriculture, of Hemisphere GPS. \"These new features provide farm operations of all sizes the ability to be more precise and get the most out of their operations. As a result, we'll reach a larger market of customers and enhance the benefits for our existing customer base.\" Outback eDriveX with eTurns and the new reverse steering and slow speed control features are available now through Outback Guidance sentres and through Hemisphere GPS distributors worldwide. A320/A321 smart antennas and S3 section control will be available in the fall of 2011.

My name is Danny and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Hemisphere GPS Inc. second-quarter earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Corey Pala, investor relations, please go ahead Sur. CORY PALA, IR, HEMISPHERE GPS: Thank you and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our 2011 second-quarter conference call and webcast. This call can also be heard live over the Web by accessing the webcast link on our website at hemispheregps.com. The call will be archived there for later review. My name Cory Pala. I'm the Investor Relations Manager and on the call today is President and CEO Steven Koles and Cameron Olson our CFO. A reminder that some statements made in today's conference call may be forward-looking and subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions concerning future conditions and other factors. These are all outlined in the Company's regulatory filings. Forward-looking statements may prove to be inaccurate or differ materially from actual future events and results. To discuss our second-quarter results and the outlook for the back half of 2011, I will hand the call over to President of Hemisphere GPS Steve Koles. Steve? STEVEN KOLES, PRESIDENT AND CEO, HEMISPHERE GPS: Thank you, Cory, and good morning, everyone. As you can see from our second-quarter financial results this morning, the recovery that began for us 12 months ago has become a growth Phase for us as the demand for our global agriculture and Precision Products has continued. Our sales for the first six months are 35% ahead of last year, giving us comfort in continuing to exceed our forecast for the year. Based on shipped and open orders today along with the product requirements communicated to us by our key customers and dealers provides us continued confidence for the year. As such despite the recent turmoil of the capital markets and the macro global economic situation uncertainties, our expectations remain for a minimum 25% revenue growth for the year as a whole. The three months that made up the second quarter were quite straightforward for the business including expected revenue growth, continued flat operating expenses and the resulting operating income increase without many stand-out items to discuss today. But in our income statement, you'll likely notice an unusual nonrecurring expense line denoted Strategic Transaction Investigation Costs in the amount of $800,000. This expense relates to the investigation and negotiations of a potential M&A transaction we undertook earlier in the year. While the initiative was enticing, unforeseen transactional complexities could not be overcome and it became necessary to terminate the pursuit of the initiative late into the effort. Both parties are regretful the initiative was not able to move forward at this time. I cannot provide further details on the transactions other than to specify that this was not a negotiation for a sale of Hemisphere GPS. Both parties are bound by nondisclosure agreements, so I will not be able to provide any more detail on our question-and-answer portion of this call. Cam will speak more to the posting of these expenses as per IFRS reporting versus a one-time expense item under GAAP. For Hemisphere GPS, M&A is a component of our overall growth strategy. Since the Company's inception, we have successfully acquired a number of businesses and we are always on the lookout for partners or target companies that are a good strategic fit for our business to complement our organic growth prospects. And as the players in the global positioning and the precision agriculture sectors have evolved in the past few years, we believe that scale matters in these markets and that we can be a driver in industry consolidation as we drive forward with profitable growth. And indeed backing out the $800,000 nonrecurring expense in the second quarter, we have delivered nearly $3.8 million in net profit for the first half of 2011. And through this return to growth, we see the scalability and profitability of our business reemerge as through this revenue growth our expenses remain flat as we prudently manage costs as we committed to do so. Agriculture sales made up 81% of revenues in the quarter driven by our eDrive autosteering portfolio and our newer high-accuracy GNSS products. The remainder of our revenues come from our Precision Products business for marine navigation, OEM as well as GIS and survey applications. Also a global business, worldwide sales of our Precision Products division increased to a record level in the quarter led by continued strength for our Vector heading sensor portfolio in both the industrial and leisure markets and particularly in the European region. In terms of the outlook for the US agriculture, we see continued improvements on the economic front and also in farmer optimism which is substantially driven by the stronger grain commodity prices during the year. The USDA projects farm income to increase approximately 20% for 2011 to $95 billion. This year adjusted for inflation, net farm income is expected to reach its second highest level in 35 years. The slower start to the planting season in some North American regions due to wet or flood conditions and the drought conditions in the South has not had a significant impact on our business nor on the relative crop health condition such as grains for corn, soybeans or wheat. North America, our largest market, showed continued signs of economic recovery particularly in the agriculture industry with both Canada and the US up nicely at 36% over the second quarter of last year. The United States alone made up most of half of our total sales in the first half of the year, so the US ag economy remains the biggest influencer to our results. I'm pleased to report this is perhaps one of the strongest business segments in America right now. International sales continue to show strong growth with European sales up 45% and Australia up 42%. These regions have been consistently strong for the year in agriculture, marine and GIS survey businesses. Our other international markets which include South America and Asia actually decreased year over year by 16%. One of the reasons is that we are comparing to a very strong doubling of sales in the second quarter of 2010. Yet on an annualized basis, these are still expected to be our highest growth markets as they have been over the past few years. Sales in these markets tend to be seasonally stronger during the second and third quarters due in part to the reversal of the agriculture seasons. And while international sales did not jump in the second quarter as they have in the past, we do see strength in the remainder of the year. It's still early days for us in emerging regions such as China and India, but we are pleased with progress to date including moderate success on some China-based state farm equipment bids. Operationally, we were able to us work through the market supply shortages of component parts and successfully deliver all open orders during the quarter. While market predictability still remains somewhat challenging today, as previous stated, our business outlook for the remainder of 2011 supports our continued enthusiasm and confidence for a minimum of 25% revenue growth for the year as a whole. Now to discuss our financial results in more detail, I'll hand off the call to our CFO Cameron Olson. CAMERON OLSON, SVP AND CFO, HEMISPHERE GPS: Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. I will provide a brief overview of the second-quarter financial results. Revenues in the quarter were up by 29% to $20.1 million from $15.6 million in 2010. Revenues from all of our product segments were up in the quarter. Revenues in our agriculture segment were up 28% over 2010 with strong growth in our retail oriented outback businesses in North America and Australia and in our air business. Precision Products revenues were up by 35% compared to 2010. The vector product line continues to show strong growth as do sales of OEM products and GNSS receiver products predominantly in the GIS and survey markets. North American revenues grew by 36% in the second quarter with particular strength in Canada as the North American agriculture buying season moves north over the planting season. International revenues grew by 19% in the quarter with Europe leading the growth at 45% followed by Australia with 42% growth. Our other international markets which included South America and Asia declined by 16% compared to 2010 which as Steve explained was a very difficult comp given that our international markets more than doubled in the second quarter of 2010 compared to the same quarter of 2009. Gross margins were 47.3% in the second quarter down from 48.5% in second quarter of 2010. I will remind you that our 2010 results have been restated to conform to IFRS and as a result, there was a revision in our 2010 gross margins arising from our change in functional currency from the Canadian dollar to the US dollar. Revised quarterly results for 2010 were included in our MD&A that was filed on SEDAR for the first quarter. As explained in detail in the first-quarter MD&A, the change to US dollar functional currency resulted in an increase in our 2010 gross margins compared to that previously reported under Canadian GAAP because cost of sales when reflecting the weighted average historical foreign exchange rates have been positively affected by the strengthening Canadian dollar trend over the last couple of years. This was opposite to the impact that this trend had on our cost of sales using a Canadian dollar functional currency. Comparing the second quarter of 2011 to 2010, the impact of this factor on cost of sales has declined compared to 2010 as the strengthening trend has softened over the last year. We expect that this factor will have a smaller impact on future quarters unless there's a significant move in foreign exchange rates from where they are today. Gross margins have also been negatively impacted by higher material and freight costs associated with component shortages driven by the recessionary conditions in 2009 and 2010 and the Japanese earthquakes. Operating expenses in the second quarter were $8.7 million, up from $8.5 million in 2010. Research and development costs of $2.1 million were down 19% from 2010. In 2011, R&D costs in the second quarter were reduced by approximately $350,000 of refundable scientific research and development tax credits that are refundable in our Canadian income tax return. There was no such reduction in our 2010 research and development costs as this is a recently introduced program from the Alberta government and this is our first claim under that program. Sales and marketing expenses were higher by 12% in the second quarter of 2011 versus 2010 as a result of advertising costs, higher sales commissions from higher revenues and increased travel expenses. At the beginning of 2011, we implemented a hedging program to fix the US dollar exchange rate on a large portion of our Canadian and Australian denominated operating expenses. As the Canadian and Australian dollars continued to strengthen against the US dollar, so far this year, we have received hedging payments of approximately $175,000 in the quarter that have been netted against the hedged expense categories. The marked to market on our operating expense hedge transactions at June 30 is a gain of $333,000 and under IFRS is reported as other comprehensive income for the first half of the year as these hedge transactions are settled [and be] recorded against the appropriate operating expense categories. Steve commented on the strategic transaction investigation costs of $800,000 reported in the second quarter. I can't provide any additional color on these costs except to state that we believe we've captured all of the costs associated with the initiative and do not expect any material additional cost in future quarters. Prior to the implementation of IFRS, we would've likely presented these costs in a separate section of the statement of operations along with foreign exchange interest and other unusual items such as restructuring costs. IFRS was much more restrictive regarding the treatment of these types of costs and therefore they're presented in the statement of operations along with our regular operating expenses. However, we have included them as a separate line item so that it's clear that they represent unusual expenses that are not expected to be incurred on a regular basis. We remain committed to the prudent management of operating expenses and the return to profitability on an annual basis. Over the first half of 2011, we've earned a net profit margin of 8% prior to the deduction of the strategic transaction investigation costs. This is an improvement from a negative margin of 9% over the first half of 2010. Our balance sheet also remained strong with a cash balance at June 30 of $13.3 million, up from $12 million at March 31. Our total working capital is $32 million. Cash generated by operations during the quarter was $2.1 million. Tangible capital expenditures were $333,000 and intangible capital expenditures were $390,000. That is my report. Back to you, Steve. STEVEN KOLES: Thank you, Cam. We are pleased to see elements of market strength across all of our lines of business. Our objectives for 2011 remain consistently to leverage our scalability, manage our cost levels prudently, capture the emerging outside agriculture cycle opportunity and increase innovation and commercialization. At this point, I will ask the operator, Danny, to assist us in opening the call to any questions. Questions and Answers OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Spencer Churchill, Paradigm Capital. SPENCER CHURCHILL, ANALYST, PARADIGM CAPITAL: Just on the component supply issues, I'm just wondering if things have returned to normal post the earthquake. Are you starting to see some greater flexibility in the supply chain? STEVEN KOLES: You know, it's a great question, Spencer. There's really two parts to the supply shortages. One was the physical availability of the components and then the second part becomes the pricing. I can say on the former that we have returned to a more normal situation for some of the components that were in high demand and were showing shortages before. The pricing hasn't necessarily normalized back. I mean what happens typically, you get into the broker situation where there will be hoarding and gray markets start to emerge. We're not quite through some of the impacts of the pricing gyrations through the supply shortages, but we expect those will normalize over the coming quarters. SPENCER CHURCHILL: Great, thanks. And maybe if we could just talk about some of the other markets category, I noticed that Brazil was one of the regions that some of the OEMs were saying where they were seeing softness. If you sort of break out that category between say Brazil and Asia, are you seeing a little bit of that? More strength in the Asian side and less so on the Brazilian markets? Or is it -- do you see that from your perspective? STEVEN KOLES: Certainly as a number of OEMs actually reported sort of flatness particularly in South America, I would say it's about the same. I mean certainly we see some flatness out of those key markets in South America. And because we're still in early days in the emerging areas in Asia, the revenue line gets a little spiky. So again we had some good shipments in Q2 of 2010 that made it a little bit more of a difficult comp. But in both markets, Asia and South America, we are looking for some renewed strength into the back half of the year. We have some very large orders in Asia that are pending to go out here in second half of the year, and we're doing some great work with some of our partners in South America as well and expect to see some good generation of revenue in the back half of the year with them as well. SPENCER CHURCHILL: Certainly, that's -- I think that's what we're seeing from an overall perspective, it echoes what Trimble was saying on their call. Just in terms of as you said despite the uncertainty, you're still seeing some pretty strong order flow coming through to the back half of the year. At which point do you think you would be able to talk a little bit more specifically in terms of the bottom line impact in the back half of the year? I suppose that's also -- I know it's a function of operating expenses and gross margins as well. But it seems like you're doing a very good job holding the operating expenses in line. Is there any reason why we should see any variation as we head into Q3/Q4 or is it going to be kind of run rate-ish plus a couple hundred thousand here or there? STEVEN KOLES: It certainly will be our expectation to continue how we've been managing costs and the predictability I think from the operating expenditure side will be there. If we can maintain kind of the revenue profile through the back half as we hope, we certainly will be able to provide more color on the overall kind of full-year profitability. It's certainly our objective to be at least I think we said in the past a minimum breakeven on the back half. So we certainly are looking to exceed that. SPENCER CHURCHILL: I guess that was my last question -- are you more confident now I guess than you were before given we are further on in the year and things still look good, but we could see potentially breakeven or better for the back half of the year as a whole? STEVEN KOLES: That is certainly still our objective. Where I can't answer the question is of course the whole sort of uncertainty from a more global and macroeconomic perspective. But I certainly don't want to see what happened in 2008, although I think conditions are quite a bit different now than they were then. And so we certainly have more confidence being able to look back on that as lessons learned. OPERATOR: Peter Prattas, Fraser Mackenzie. PETER PRATTAS, ANALYST, FRASER MACKENZIE: Can you please provide us with an update on how your Earthworks business is performing and whether you see it potentially being material by next year let's say and where exactly you are making your sales? STEVEN KOLES: Thanks, Peter. Good question. Admittedly we are still in early days on the Earthworks side, working on continued channel development and getting representation to actually sell our product set. We have been getting interesting success in various niche markets, actually particularly in areas like [snow caps] is a good example which we include in the Earthworks area. I think it will be some time before it's a material breakout for us from a business division perspective, but it certainly will not happen in 2011. We'll see how that progresses into 2012. OPERATOR: Pardeep Sangha, PI Financial. PARDEEP SANGHA, ANALYST, PI FINANCIAL: Just on the international side, I was just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more in terms of like you talked about with the state farm bids and can you sort of give us a sense of how big these are in terms of dollar value? I think you've talked in the past as to how big they are in terms of the size of farms. But potential dollar value? And how many of these are you sort of getting bids at and sort of maybe some activity levels in terms of how many of these you are looking at? STEVEN KOLES: It's a great question. There's always been a little bit of -- or actually a lot of mystery about how these bid processes actually work and it's tough to have full clarity on where they have come through. To date, we have been pretty -- or moderately successful as we won pieces of a number of the equipment bids. These are largely tractor bids and with an erring to the side of the domestic tractor manufacturers that are trying to increase their portfolio with fuller high-horsepower tractor lines. So we've been successful in tagging along guidance and steering along with their bids as they look to sweeten themselves or differentiate themselves in the direct bid. I think to date, we have -- some of these bids have been in order of magnitude a quarter -- three, four -- $0.25 million, $300,000 or $400,000 per bid. Like you said, these state farms, these are supporting our large operations but still completely untapped as it relates to adoption. And this builds its own momentum by getting more of our product out into these operations the more that has the tendency and propensity to be able to spread into other state farms as part of other bids. PARDEEP SANGHA: Just want to know in terms of volume of number of bids, are there a lot of these that you're seeing right now or --? STEVEN KOLES: I'm sorry, I would say that they come in less numbers in terms of the number of bids but large orders per bid. PARDEEP SANGHA: Okay, I'm just wondering with regards to the back half of the year in terms of what your view would be in terms of Q3 versus Q4 revenue split, do you anticipate one being any stronger than the other or anything like that in terms of seasonality at all? STEVEN KOLES: I think we have had some traditional seasonality that we're seeing through this year reemerge where we have a very strong Q1, close but not quite as strong Q2, a seasonably less strong Q3 and then a start of a rebuilding of strength into Q4. I think we'll see that same sort of seasonal pattern and it seems to be there in our forecast, the way our orders are starting to stack up as well. So it all depends on some of the global uncertainties to ensure that that same seasonality continues to emerge. But I would suggest that you are going to see that more traditional seasonality from us as in previous years. PARDEEP SANGHA: And then going into fiscal 2012 as we're looking forward, you have talked about having sort of less seasonality going forward. I mean in fiscal 12 can we expect less seasonality maybe because you're able to get more diversity in terms of products or international revenues from different seasons or Earthworks picking up or -- comment on the fiscal 12 seasonality. STEVEN KOLES: I think as years continue to go by, from our organic growth perspective, we stated fairly deliberately that we have a diversification strategy both from a regional perspective, from a portfolio perspective, even within precision agriculture trying to broaden our portfolio to other segments of the marketplace. So having that all in place and with the -- certainly with the drive that we've put into emerging international markets and seeing our revenue split from the North American international perspective continued to evolve to in a couple of years maybe even around 50-50. I would certainly expect to see our -- significant seasonality that we've had largely from the North American buying season continue to settle down. OPERATOR: Robert Winslow, National Bank. ROBERT WINSLOW, ANALYST, WELLINGTON WEST CAPITAL INC.: Two things for me this morning, Steve. First on the gross margins, I think in the past, the Company -- management has talked about the potential to get back to 50% gross margin over time perhaps by the end of 2012. I'm wondering what your thoughts are. It seems there's always something coming up. I'm wondering if maybe that ceiling on gross margins may be coming down over time here faster than you can do cost improvements and so forth, and I guess that's the commentary. My question therefore to you is what is your level of confidence? Is it higher or lower that you can get back to sort of 50% gross margin on an annualized basis? STEVEN KOLES: I'll comment first and then turn it to Cam for maybe some additional insights. Certainly to get back to 50% gross margins, we're going to need to increase scale to the business that helps lift and utilize overhead, helps us with cost curves and the like. I think the past conversion to IFRS and some of the pricing challenges as I commented earlier on, things like component shortages in the marketplace, have all contributed to our ability to manage back to 50% gross margins. Certainly FX has been a big part of that as well as the conversion to IFRS. I can say that we are looking at this very discreetly on both sides of the gross margin equation, whether taking a look at discrete price points where appropriate price increases actually are appropriate, by product and by portfolio as well as where there is continued scale available that we can focus on as the lower hanging fruit from a cost curve perspective. Those are some of my comments, I will ask Cam to chime in here as well with some of his insights. CAMERON OLSON: Thanks, Steve. I guess continuing on what Steve said, I mentioned during my comments that we have had a bit of a lift from foreign exchange under US functional currency that as the Canadian dollar is stabilizing is expected to decline and actually it has declined. This quarter we had around a 1% impact, positive impact, from foreign currency. On the other thing Steve mentioned, we've got a number of projects specifically focused on gross margins. We are looking at a variety of things -- our current approach to manufacturing and efficiencies that we can gain. So we certainly have over the last couple of years with the difficult conditions seen a bit of pressure on margins from where we were that has caused us to perhaps reset a little bit. We are targeting still to get back to the 50% level and doing a number of things to try and do that. ROBERT WINSLOW: That target, Cam, what would be the timeline on that approximately? CAMERON OLSON: It probably has been pushed out. So 2012 would probably not be realistic. But in the sort of midterm two to three years, that would still be something that we would be working towards. ROBERT WINSLOW: Okay, good, thanks. (multiple speakers) second question I have is back for you, Steve, talking about the headline risk, economic headline risk for farmers. Now we all recall back in 08 -- granted the grain prices collapsed too, but when the grain prices started to recover, farmers are still reading the same newspapers that you and I read. So at the margin they will pull in spending despite what grains might be doing. They do pull in spending when the broader economy is a little bit soft or there's risk of it softening. Given that and what we're seeing in the markets today over the last couple few weeks [admittedly it's all relatively new] what's going on now. You've reiterated your sales outlook for 2011 of at least 25%. Clearly given what's going on in the macro world, you must have some extremely high confidence in the next one or two quarters to be able to reiterate that guidance i.e. you're not just -- you must see at least I don't know 10% better growth in the number you're guiding, otherwise -- I just want to get your level of confidence on that 25% number given what we're seeing in the macro. STEVEN KOLES: Appreciate that, Robert. To put it in context, of course we're halfway through the year. We're at 35% growth with most of our revenue generated in the front half of the year. So I still see our 25% full-year growth as semiconservative. So I am taking into account by stating that, that who knows? There could be some market gyrations from the capital market situation right now. I will say I think conditions are quite a bit different versus 2008 in terms of the housing market, interest rates, financing, commodity bubbles. Like there was a lot of other factors that I think are quite a bit different than they are today. And I can say through the third quarter so far, at least end farmer demand, we're not seeing the headline impacts. Now I'm knocking on wood here, Robert, to make sure that that doesn't occur. Because you are right, farmers do read Wall Street Journal, they do read the same headlines that you and I do. Although the last downturn certainly was recent enough that I think people have recognized some degree of overreaction and expect that as long as commodity prices remain strong on the grain side, income is going to remain strong on the end farmer side, that therefore demand and investment into things like precision agriculture should remain. OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) David Delleo, Canaccord. DAVID DELLEO, ANALYST, CANACCORD GENUITY: I apologize up front. I missed the prepared remarks and the beginning of Q&A as I'm trying to juggle a few calls this morning. So I apologize for repeat questions. I guess just to start off, what color have you provided or are you able to provide on the news of the strategic transaction, specifically what broke it off and then are there other opportunities in the pipeline? Just more color around that would be great. STEVEN KOLES: Yes, we did -- I tried to address some of that in the opening comments, David, and no apologies necessary. I mean certainly we were investigating the potential M&A transaction. We thought it was an enticing opportunity, but unforeseen transactional complexities really could not be overcome. It was necessary to call it off late into the effort, unfortunately. I think both parties are regretful that we weren't able to move it forward at this time. Unfortunately we are under pretty strict NDAs. So we're not going to be able go into a lot of detail other than to say that listen -- M&A is definitely going to continue to be a core part of our overall growth strategy. I think good management teams should always be pursuing these types of opportunities. It's all about scale and we think that we have a great opportunity to drive some potential industry consolidation opportunities in all markets that we operate in whether that be regionally or by business unit. We are well down the path on this specific transaction but as many people have seen, you're not over the goal line until you are. And that's -- unfortunately happens often and we will move on to other opportunities. DAVID DELLEO: Okay, that's helpful. So I gain from the last question asked that you guys did reiterate the topline growth of 25% or more. How about profitability for the full year? Still targeting breakeven profitability for 2011? STEVEN KOLES: Correct. I think we even reiterated a couple of questions ago that we would -- our objectives to the back half assuming all -- the revenue line maintains its strength that we would be then back half breakeven. So that would certainly maintain the profitability that we generated for the first part of the year. And who knows? Hopefully even better. DAVID DELLEO: Okay, great. Just following up from last quarter. You guys were talking about strong open orders at the end of last quarter. Are you still seeing that trend at the end of this quarter? STEVEN KOLES: Well, yes, to be fair, I think I did comment that we shipped everything in the quarter, so we didn't carry over a backlog of orders we had hoped to deliver in Q2. I'll say we've had some nice big orders that we've already pursuit or delivered on here in the third quarter and continue to see pretty good evidence of the open order situation maintaining its strength. DAVID DELLEO: Okay, great. Cam, maybe a question for you. The R&D credit in the quarter, is that something that was kind of a one-time event for the quarter or would that be recurring throughout the rest of the year? CAMERON OLSON: That would be a one-time event for the quarter. So it wouldn't reflect that sort of on a quarterly basis certainly. We do expect that we will receive credits on an annual basis when we do our filing and we will accrue them as we have comfort as to what the amounts would be. $350,000, based on what I understand of the program I think is at the higher end of what we would expect on an annualized basis. DAVID DELLEO: Sorry, I missed that last part. CAMERON OLSON: The credit that we recorded this quarter was $350,000 against research and development and I think that was at the higher end of the range of what we would expect on that program on an annual basis. DAVID DELLEO: Got it. Just lastly, international down this year but obviously against a very tough comp. Does the picture continue to look good otherwise, specifically Brazil and China? Any other additional color on those two markets, better traction or as expected? CAMERON OLSON: As expected. We have said that I think we continue to expect these are going to be our higher growth markets. [They're still much lower] in total their gross revenues compared to some other markets and we do expect some good strength out of both, specifically as you mentioned Brazil and Asia here in the back half of the year. OPERATOR: There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Koles, I turn the call back over to you. STEVEN KOLES: Thank you, Danny. I'd like to thank everyone for their continued support. We look forward to discussing our continued progress throughout the rest of the fiscal year on subsequent calls. Thank you very much. OPERATOR: This concludes today's conference call.

Soil spatial variation can be partitioned into frequencies (scale) and positions (location) by the wavelet transform.\" \"This review focuses mainly on different applications of the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) for the identification of the scale and location dependence of soil attributes. We discussed both wavelet spectra and wavelet coherence in our analysis of soil spatial variation. Global wavelet spectra, being the sum of wavelet spectra over all spatial locations at a scale, can be used to examine the dominant scale of variation. Furthermore, some variations at a particular scale persist over all locations (termed global features), whereas others are present at only a few locations (localized features). Wavelet spectra can be used to identify both localized and global features. The combination of localized and global features provides a complete picture of the scale-location information of different processes in the field and may provide better guidance in designing efficient management practices. Wavelet coherency partitions the total correlation between two variables into correlations at different scales and locations, while also revealing the scale- and location-specific relationship between those two variables,\" wrote A. Biswas and colleagues, University of Saskatchewan. The researchers concluded: \"This relationship may be helpful in developing predictive links between one property and another.\" Biswas and colleagues published their study in Mathematical Geosciences (Application of Continuous Wavelet Transform in Examining Soil Spatial Variation: A Review.

(the \"Company\") announced its plans to build a state-of-the-art, greenhouse located in Monahans, Texas during 2011. This project broke ground in early June, it will be the fifth greenhouse built by the Company in the State of Texas, and will be based on the Company's innovative proprietary technology termed; GATESTM, and is expected to begin production in early 2012. The first of its kind, the Company's GATESTM greenhouse has successfully operated over the past four years in nearby Marfa, Texas. Phase one of the Monahans greenhouse will incorporate a 30-acre production greenhouse in addition to various other service buildings including an advanced technology packing, sorting, and distribution facility. The long term plan is to build a total of 120 acres, on the 320 acre site. The Monahans greenhouse will initially employ 80 to 100 people and bear a capital cost of approximately US$42.0 million, which includes certain infrastructure improvements for future phases. Each consecutive phase would contribute approximately 30 acres of production area. The Company is considering financing options and will finalize its plan in the coming weeks but expects to use mostly debt, cash and ongoing cash flow to fund the initial phase. The Company may raise equity, in the future, to provide equity capital for the additional phases or other greenhouse developments it is working on. The Company's existing GATESTM greenhouse in Marfa, Texas has proven to be a highly efficient, year round, precision agriculture, production facility allowing the Company to produce 365 days per year, with demonstrated yields exceeding 100 kilos per square meter per year. In 2007, in its first year of operation the Marfa GATESTM greenhouse broke the world record for production of tomatoes. The new Monahans greenhouse will provide year round supply and enhance the Company's product offerings for its existing local and existing customer base. The additional capacity will also enable the Company to diversify and expand its product offerings at its existing 122 acre facilities in Marfa and Fort Davis Texas. Michael DeGiglio, CEO of the Company stated, \"Currently we face increased demand for our U.S. product because of the 'buy local' food movement. Given the momentum of this cultural change, our new facility is well positioned to support our customers in this increased demand for regionally grown fresh premium produce. We are very excited about this next project not only because it is in the State of Texas but also because it will be one of most advanced commercial food producing greenhouses built to date.\" The Monahans greenhouse will be based on a highly resource efficient hydroponic growing system. In keeping with the Company's \"good for the earth\" sustainability philosophy, the project is focused on water conservation, land preservation, food safety, integrated pest management, and reducing the overall carbon footprint. The greenhouse will recycle its water up to five times and utilize 86% less water compared to field tomato farming. Higher yields per acre equate to less land for producing greater quantities of food, up to 30 times more food per acre compared to field farming. In addition, the Monahans greenhouse will receive a portion of its electricity needs from renewable wind power. This state of the art facility will operate within a fully enclosed system mitigating outside contaminants and unwanted crop pressures in order to ensure the highest food safety standards and crop vitality available this day. In addition to its other next generation technologies the Monahans' greenhouse will use supplemental lighting and be among the first greenhouses in North America to use diffused roof glass capable of increasing yields over conventional clear glass. The Company (in conjunction with its technology partners Verbakel Bomkas BV and Hortimax BV, both headquartered in The Netherlands) has developed advances in highly efficient growing systems enhancing our \"from seed to fork\" integrated business model, built with proprietary intellectual property strengthening our position as a leader in the industry. The Monahans greenhouse will be the twelfth greenhouse that the Company has developed, built, acquired or operated over the past 22 years, including projects in Pennsylvania, New York, Virginia and Texas. In addition, the Company owns and operates the largest greenhouse in Canada located outside of Vancouver British Columbia. Conference Call There will be a conference call on Tuesday, June 14, 2011 to discuss the Company's new development and first quarter 2011 results. The teleconference will begin at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Standard Time, (1:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time) and will be hosted by Mr. Michael DeGiglio Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Stephen Ruffini, Chief Financial Officer. To participate in the teleconference, please dial into the call a few minutes before the start time: 1-888-231-8191 or 647-427-7450. We look forward to having you participate in our call.

Things are normal this year and that's a bit unusual of late. His 7,000-acre farm near the Australian town of Cootamundra is testament to the plight facing farmers around the globe: increasingly wilder weather is making food production more unpredictable. It's the new normal they must prepare for. Bragg's farm in New South Wales state has been in the family for generations and has weather records for the area stretching back 110 years. After seven years of costly drought, the weather switched last year to unseasonably wet with flooding rains. \"It's screaming to me that things are getting hotter and drier at different times of the year,\" said the 40-year-old Bragg during a recent visit to his property, about two hours drive to the west of Canberra, the Australian capital. \"Our summers are getting wetter and if this trend continues, then we will have to find different means of farming,\" he said. Across the globe, rising temperatures and more intense droughts, floods and storms are forcing a rethink in how to grow food, from breeding hardier crop varieties and changing planting times to complete genetic overhauls of plants. Growing populations, changing diets and insatiable demand for grains, meat and vegetables is putting pressure on global food production and prices like never before. Soaring food prices, civil unrest and worries about weather have spurred a global race to create more productive crops that can thrive in a warmer -- and more prosperous -- world. The World Bank estimates 925 million people are hungry in the world today. The figure has been rising since 1995-97 due to rising food prices, a succession of economic crises, and a neglect of agricultural innovation, especially relevant to the poor. It is going to get much worse for the hungry because global food prices will more than double within 20 years, aid agency Oxfam International said in a June 1 report. Flat-lining yields, a scramble for fertile land and water, and environmental crises are reversing decades of progress against hunger, it said. The challenge is to speed up the creation of new crops more adaptable to climate change and capable of much greater yields. A laboratory in the leafy heart of Canberra could hold some of the answers. Inside, hundreds of seedlings on a conveyor belt file through a high-tech chamber, each plant bar-coded and scanned for signs of genetic superiority. A selection process that took months in the past, now takes a fraction of the time. \"I call this digital agriculture,\" said plant scientist Bob Furbank of Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). The 3-metre high PlantScan chamber uses 3D laser radar and other devices to measure size, growth and water use. \"It's like the plant Olympics. We have to rapidly pick the best of the best,\" Furbank, scientific director of CSIRO's Plant Phenomics centre in Canberra, said on a recent visit to the laboratory brimming with high-tech equipment after a multi-million dollar refit. The centre is part of renewed global efforts to create a new generation of crops that will dramatically boost yields, particularly for wheat and rice. Investment into creating a new generation of staple crops, especially wheat and rice, has lagged since the Green Revolution of the 1960s, which led to years of bumper harvests, easing worries about lack of food. The new green revolutionaries must find ways of doubling yields as the global population, set to hit 7 billion later this year, heads for 9 billion by 2050, with greater affluence changing diets and triggering ever greater demand. THE HEAT IS ON To feed 2 billion more mouths by 2050, food production will have to increase by 70 percent, the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) says. Climate change is perhaps the greatest threat to meeting the target as rising temperatures and droughts dry out farmlands or more intense floods and storms inundate them. \"What we expect in the future is there will be much more unexpected events, much more extreme climate change,\" said Concepcion Calpe, a senior economist with the FAO in Rome. Boosting yields has become almost an obsession with governments, seed companies such as Syngenta and Monsanto, and scientific bodies such as Australia's CSIRO. Global yield growth of wheat and rice has stagnated at 0.6 percent to 0.7 percent annually over the past 10 years -- about half the production growth rate of 1.2 to 1.4 percent annually needed from now to 2050, the FAO says. Scientists say they are running out of time to boost yields. With greenhouse gas emissions rising quickly, the world is already on track to exceed a 2 degrees Celsius threshold that scientists say risks triggering dangerous climate change. The planet has already warmed about 0.8 degrees Celsius on average since 1900. Unless emissions growth is slammed into hard reverse, the world could be 2 to 3 degrees warmer on average by 2050, and much more by 2100. Computer climate models show large areas of Australia, Africa, the United States, eastern Brazil and southern Europe drying out in the coming decades. But Russia, Canada and Indochina would become wetter, potentially benefiting crop production or allowing new crops to be grown in previously cooler climes. Overall, for many major cereal crop-growing regions, the future will hinge on drought and heat-tolerant varieties, better weather forecasts and a likely shift in cropping to new areas. A U.S. study published last month in the journal Science found climate change was already exerting a considerable drag on the yield growth of crops. The authors used crop yield models with and without changes in temperature and rainfall to show global falls in wheat output of 5.5 percent and 3.8 percent for corn as a result of climate change from 1980-2008. That was equivalent to the entire annual corn crop of Mexico, or the wheat crop of France, the European Union's biggest producer, it said. SEEDS OF CHANGE The global forecast is for increasingly bad weather, amid spiralling demand from an expanding global middle class. \"2.5 billion people entering the world's middle class is a lot more important than climate change,\" said Jeffrey Currie, global head of commodities for Goldman Sachs in London. The World Bank's food price index, which measures global prices, jumped 36 percent in April from a year ago to near its 2008 peak, before dropping again. \"While it might not be the primary cause, it definitely is an underlying cause for some of the instability you're seeing in North Africa and the Middle East right now,\" said Rick Leach, chief executive of the World Food Program USA. \"The very poor can spend up to 80 percent of their income on food,\" he said, adding: \"We're now moving into a period of extreme worry in terms of the implications of food price increases.\" More than 680 million people in Asia and the Pacific region live on less than US$1.25 a day, the International Fund for Agricultural Development, a U.N. agency, says. More than 70 per cent of these are in South Asia -- Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan -- making the region among the most vulnerable to food price inflation and climate [20110613 021342 GMT] change. The World Bank in February said rising food prices had pushed an estimated 44 million more people into extreme poverty over the course of eight months, triggering unrest. That is putting ever mounting pressure on governments, agronomists and the farm industry to come up with ways of growing more food on less land and under harsher conditions. \"Everything we do in terms of developing our technology, bringing that to growers worldwide, is really about addressing the need to grow more from less,\" said Davor Pisk, chief operating officer for Syngenta, the world's largest agrochemicals firm. The Swiss firm's seeds business has flourished, growing to $2.8 billion in 2010, out of total sales of $11.6 billion, in large part for demand for Genetically Modified (GM) seeds to meet soaring demand in the United States for corn ethanol and for soyoil and soymeal in China. Corn and soy, major elements of animal feed and biofuels, have attracted significant investment for new GM food varieties that have substantially boosted yields. Corn and soybean are also much simpler genetically than wheat and rice. Syngenta has developed corn and soy varieties that repel pests, fungi and are tolerant to a range of chemicals that kill weeds -- all threats expected to get worse during climate change. It has also just released a hybrid called Agrisure Artesian that has resistance to drought. \"What we're confident of being able to demonstrate is that we can achieve a 15 percent decline in percentage of losses due to drought. So if you like, we get 15 percent yield preservation,\" Pisk said. The next generation of varieties would aim for 25 percent. GM is just one part of a suite of technologies growers need to meet demand and fight the impact of climate change, he said. The problem is knowing just what sort of future lies ahead for farmers and exactly what varieties were needed for different growing areas. Computer climate models have become quite good at showing how temperatures will change across the globe, but are less precise on how rainfall and storm patterns will change, particularly at local levels. SEARCH FOR BETTER YIELDS If you can't predict the weather then you can try to beat it -- with new genetic strains of grain plants that will boost yields. But crop yields would have to rise a lot faster than they have been. Scientists say yields will have to increase by around 1.5 percent a year to match the growth in the world's population of around 1 percent a year. That may sound small, but the current pace of yield growth is well below that. Overall, rice yields have more than doubled over the past half-century from 1.85 tonnes per hectare in 1960 to 4.29 tonnes in 2011/12, USDA data shows. But the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in the Philippines says rice yields will have to rise another 11 percent to about 4.8 tonnes per ha by 2018/19 just to keep rice prices steady. By comparison, corn yields have risen from 1.95 tonnes per ha in 1960 to 5.22 tonnes in 2011/12, propelled by soaring demand for animal feed and ethanol. Wheat yields have gained more modestly to 3 tonnes in 2011/12 from 1.15 tonnes in 1960. The production of rice, the staple for more than half the world's population, has kept pace so far with consumption, thanks to advances made in the Green Revolution. But yields will have to keep rising and stocks kept at healthy levels to avoid the kind of panic purchases by governments and export restrictions that helped drive the food price crisis of 2008. The danger is that climate change could cause yields to drop, in some cases dramatically so, according to a study by the International Food Policy Research Institute. Its modelling of the impact of climate change on cereal crops showed yields in 2050 are likely to be lower than they were in 2000, with the most vulnerable being wheat. But developing a new variety of higher-yielding wheat takes a minimum of seven to 10 years, mostly because it has highly complex genetics. It's one reason why wheat, and to a similar extent rice, have fallen behind in yield growth and investment.     \"In breeding new varieties for use in 20 years' time, we need to have the necessary genes now. And I think that's going to be tricky,\" said Greg Rebetzke, a wheat breeder for CSIRO in Canberra.     One trick is to boost the early growth of wheat plants. The dwarfing genes that triggered the Green Revolution cut the height of wheat plants and allowed the plant to focus on filling the grain head.     But the shoot that emerges from the seed is too short, limiting planting depth and access to water deeper in the soil. Rebetzke said CSIRO has found \"alternative dwarfing genes\" with no negative effects on early growth, which are \"a major thrust in our breeding effort\". FUTURE RICE PLANT To the north of London, the world's oldest agricultural research station is working on ways to boost British wheat potential yields to 20 or even 25 tonnes in the long-term, far above the 8 tonnes produced there now. The 1.6 ha Broadbalk field on Rothamsted farm dates back to 1843 when its founder, John Bennet Lawes, decided to test the power of artificial fertilisers. He had built the world's first fertiliser factory a year earlier. Walking in the same field where those trials started, project team leader Martin Parry explained how his team at Rothamsted and in the United States were looking at ways to super-charge photosynthesis in wheat by doubling the amount of CO2 inside the plant. Parry, like many agronomists, believes a new global effort akin to what happened in the 1970s is needed to feed the world, beyond the promise of technology. \"We're going to have to do it much more effectively. We're going to have use our resources like fertiliser much more efficiently and we'll have to do it with less land,\" he said. Developing countries will be a big focus in those efforts. According to the USDA, yields for major crops, including corn, wheat, soybean and rice, are more than 40 percent lower in developing nations than rich nations, highlighting the paradox that production is lowest where demand is greatest. The biggest breakthrough on the yields front could come in creating a new type of rice plant, the staple for many countries in the developing world. \"We expect the weather conditions and temperature to be more severe in the coming years,\" said IRRI Director-General Robert Zeigler during a recent open day at the institute, near Manila. \"That's why we need to develop more rice varieties that can tolerate flooding, drought, higher temperature, and can also tolerate salt water,\" he said as farmers chatted with scientists at the institute to learn about new varieties. IRRI has already released commercial varieties that are drought and flood tolerant, limiting losses during bad weather. Salt-water tolerance will also be crucial as seas rise and more powerful storms push seawater further into fertile river deltas, such as the Mekong Delta in Vietnam and large areas of coastal Bangladesh. Faster growing varieties can also help farmers get in a crop before the typhoon season starts. IRRI, the CSIRO, as well as researchers in Britain and elsewhere are working on creating supercharged rice to try to double yields, by boosting the rate of photosynthesis. The project, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, could take 20 years, said CSIRO's Furbank, but will also lead to new ways to ramp up wheat yields as well. Crucial as well to bridging the yield gap is better agronomy, or farm management practices.     Syngenta has developed a way to boost rice yields in India by an average of 30 percent as well as cutting labour. Its Tegra system uses seeds coated with an insecticide, mechanical planting of seedlings and training for farmers.     That can make a huge difference in a country [20110613 021342 GMT] of 1.2 billion people where two-thirds of the population are employed by the farm sector and where a failed monsoon can send shockwaves through international markets.     \"It should be an agronomy revolution,\" Calpe, the FAO economist said. \"This has been missing tremendously in a lot of countries.\" (Additional reporting by Gerard Wynn in London, Erik Dela Cruz in Manila, and Naveen Thukral in Singapore; Editing by Bill Tarrant; david.fogarty@thomsonreuters.com; +65 6403 5662; Reuters Messaging: david.fogarty.reuters.com@reuters.net) [20110613 021342 GMT]"}, {"title": "VFF Village Farms to build Monahans greenhouse in Texas", "article": "Village Farms International Inc (TSX:VFF) Shares Issued 19,433,394 Last Close 6/10/2011 $1.26 Monday June 13 2011 - News Release Mr. Michael DeGiglio reports VILLAGE FARMS EXPANDS U.S. GREENHOUSE OPERATIONS Village Farms International, Inc. plans to build a state-of-the-art, greenhouse located in Monahans, Tex., during 2011. This project broke ground in early June, it will be the fifth greenhouse built by the company in the state of Texas, and will be based on the company's innovative proprietary technology termed GATES, and is expected to begin production in early 2012. The first of its kind, the company's GATES greenhouse has successfully operated over the past four years in nearby Marfa, Tex. Phase one of the Monahans greenhouse will incorporate a 30-acre production greenhouse in addition to various other service buildings including an advanced technology packing, sorting and distribution facility. The long-term plan is to build a total of 120 acres on the 320-acre site. The Monahans greenhouse will initially employ 80 to 100 people and bear a capital cost of approximately $42.0-million (U.S.), which includes certain infrastructure improvements for future phases. Each consecutive phase would contribute approximately 30 acres of production area. The company is considering financing options and will finalize its plan in the coming weeks but expects to use mostly debt, cash and continuing cash flow to finance the initial phase. The company may raise equity, in the future, to provide equity capital for the additional phases or other greenhouse developments it is working on. The company's existing GATES greenhouse in Marfa, Tex., has proven to be a highly efficient, year-round, precision agriculture, production facility allowing the company to produce 365 days per year, with demonstrated yields exceeding 100 kilos per square metre per year. In 2007, in its first year of operation the Marfa GATES greenhouse broke the world record for production of tomatoes. The new Monahans greenhouse will provide year-round supply and enhance the company's product offerings for its existing local and existing customer base. The additional capacity will also enable the company to diversify and expand its product offerings at its existing 122-acre facilities in Marfa and Fort Davis, Tex. Michael DeGiglio, chief executive officer of the company, stated: \"Currently we face increased demand for our U.S. product because of the 'buy local' food movement. Given the momentum of this cultural change, our new facility is well positioned to support our customers in this increased demand for regionally grown fresh premium produce. We are very excited about this next project not only because it is in the state of Texas but also because it will be one of most advanced commercial food producing greenhouses built to date.\" The Monahans greenhouse will be based on a highly resource efficient hydroponic growing system. In keeping with the company's \"good for the earth\" sustainability philosophy, the project is focused on water conservation, land preservation, food safety, integrated pest management and reducing the overall carbon footprint. The greenhouse will recycle its water up to five times and use 86 per cent less water compared with field tomato farming. Higher yields per acre equate to less land for producing greater quantities of food, up to 30 times more food per acre compared with field farming. In addition, the Monahans greenhouse will receive a portion of its electricity needs from renewable wind power. This state-of-the-art facility will operate within a fully enclosed system mitigating outside contaminants and unwanted crop pressures in order to ensure the highest food safety standards and crop vitality available today. In addition to its other next-generation technologies the Monahans's greenhouse will use supplemental lighting and be among the first greenhouses in North America to use diffused roof glass capable of increasing yields over conventional clear glass. The company (in conjunction with its technology partners Verbakel Bomkas BV and Hortimax BV, both headquartered in the Netherlands) has developed advances in highly efficient growing systems enhancing our \"from seed to fork\" integrated business model, built with proprietary intellectual property strengthening the company's position as a leader in the industry. The Monahans greenhouse will be the 12th greenhouse that the company has developed, built, acquired or operated over the past 22 years, including projects in Pennsylvania, New York, Virginia and Texas. In addition, the company owns and operates the largest greenhouse in Canada located outside of Vancouver, B.C.

All currency amounts are expressed in U.S. dollars. The Company notes that its financial results are reported under International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\") for the first time this quarter. While the conversion did not have a significant impact on the Company's results, certain components, as well as 2010 comparatives, have been reclassified and adjusted within the financial statements to reflect the conversion. The most significant change resulting from the conversion to IFRS is the change in the Company's functional or measurement currency from the Canadian dollar to the United States dollar. For the first quarter ended March 31, 2011, Hemisphere GPS achieved revenue growth of 41%, reporting $21.2 million in revenues, compared to $15.1 million in the first quarter of 2010. Revenues from all market segments increased in the first quarter. \"The recovery in our business that began in the back half of last year continued and strengthened in the first quarter of 2011 with a return to profitability,\" stated Steven Koles, President and CEO of Hemisphere GPS. \"Traction from new products, stronger grain prices and signs of global economic recovery contributed to stronger growth in every geographic market, and all of our product lines.\" Gross margins were relatively consistent year over year at 48.5% compared to 49.2% for the first quarter of 2010, which have been revised based upon the conversion from Canadian to US functional currency under IFRS. Revised gross margins for 2010 are higher than originally reported under Canadian generally accepted accounting principles as a result of the impact of a strengthening Canadian dollar on the weighted average costing of Canadian inventories when using the US dollar as functional currency. Although revenues grew 41% in the first quarter, total operating expenses for the quarter were flat year-over-year at $8.4 million, in-line with Management's objectives. This demonstrates the scalability of the Company's business model. Effective January 1, 2011, Management implemented a hedging program focused on mitigating the impact of foreign currency changes on Canadian and Australian operating expenses. Hedging gains earned in the quarter were offset against the related operating expenses, mitigating the impact of stronger Canadian and Australian currencies in the first quarter. Research and development expenses for the first quarter remained unchanged year-over-year at $2.4 million, and were down by approximately $0.4 million from the fourth quarter of 2010. As a percentage of revenues, R&D expenses decreased to 11% of revenues for the first quarter of 2011, as compared to 16% of revenues for the first quarter of 2010. This is in line with Management's general objectives of investing approximately 11% to 12% of total revenues into R&D. Sales and marketing expenses for the quarter were lower by 1% to $3.3 million. General and administrative expenses were unchanged, at $1.8 million. In accordance with IFRS, stock-based compensation is not reported separately and has been allocated to the functional expense categories for both 2011 and 2010. Hemisphere GPS reported a first quarter net margin of 9%, resulting in net income of $1.8 million, or $0.03 per share, a significant improvement from a net loss of $1.0 million, or ($0.02) per share, for the first quarter of 2010. Comprehensive income of $330 thousand in the first quarter, represents the mark-to-market gain on hedging instruments put in place to hedge operating expenses for the remainder of 2011. There were no outstanding hedging instruments in place at March 31, 2010. The Company generated $3.0 million in positive cash flow from operations before working capital changes during the quarter, compared to $50 thousand in the first quarter of 2010. In addition, during the first quarter of 2011, the Company completed an equity financing for net proceeds of approximately $7.5 million. At March 31, 2011, the Company held cash of approximately $12.0 million and had working capital of approximately $31 million. At March 31, 2011, Hemisphere GPS had 60,824,409 common shares outstanding. Product Segment Sales Review Total sales for the Agriculture segment increased by 40% compared to the first quarter of 2010. Sales of the Company's ground-based agriculture products, including the Outback Guidance((r)) branded products, increased 47% year over year. Agriculture revenues contributed 83% of total first quarter revenues, consistent with the first quarter of 2010. Sales of the eDrive auto-steering portfolio, including the new Outback eDriveX(tm) and Outback eDriveVSi(tm) offerings helped to drive growth in this segment. Total sales for the Precision Products segment were up 44%, contributing 17% of total revenue in the quarter in both comparable quarters. Sales of Vector heading sensor products to the marine markets and GPS boards to OEM customers continue to lead the growth in this segment. Regional Sales Review Total revenues from the United States and Canada grew by approximately 32% each. The US remains Hemisphere GPS' largest market, contributing 49% of revenues in the first quarter. Combined with Canada, the two markets contributed 66% of total revenues for the first quarter. European sales increased 78%, contributing 17% of total first quarter revenues. Australia sales increased by 186% from the first quarter of 2010, contributing 5% of total revenues. Sales to Australia showed the strongest relative performance resulting from the 2010 launch of an Outback sales network in Australia, modeled after the existing Outback sales network deployed in North America. Other international sales, including South America and Asia among others, grew by 13%, contributing 11% of total revenues. Sales in the Southern Hemisphere are seasonally stronger during the second and third quarters due to the reversal of agriculture seasons. International sales growth for the quarter was primarily driven by customer growth in Asia, where the Company has been successfully partnering with distribution and OEM partners. International exports of ground agriculture products increased by 95% overall compared to the same period one year ago. International sales continue to become a larger percentage of total revenues due to the higher growth rates. The percentage of total revenues derived outside North America in the first quarter 2011 increased to 34% from 30% for the first quarter of 2010. \"We were pleased with our results in the first quarter. In addition, our total open orders at March 31 were up significantly from last year, providing confidence in the near term quarters as well,\" stated Mr. Koles. The deadline for the filing of Financial Statements with notes and Management's Discussion and Analysis (\"MD&A\") has been extended by securities regulators by one month in order to provide companies and their auditors sufficient time to complete additional work related to the conversion to IFRS. The Company will file its financial statements and MD&A prior to the deadline. Readers are cautioned that there may be some revisions to the financial information reported in this press release as a result of the final application of IFRS standards or the completion of the review engagement by the Company's auditors. Patents Awarded Hemisphere GPS' commitment to research and development has resulted in the awarding of two new patents. The patents are the latest innovations in precision farming and for new GNSS compass technology used primarily for marine navigation. Specifically, the Company was awarded a patent for a comprehensive guidance, navigation and control system for precision farming, comprised of a GNSS receiver, inertial sensors, a steering control module and user interface. The patent is based on Hemisphere GPS' exclusive Vector(tm) technology and includes a multiple GNSS antenna configuration for accurate position, heading, pitch and roll of a vehicle. The patent also covers the positioning and independent guidance and control of a farm implement and individual nozzle control of a spray boom. The patent is incorporated into Hemisphere GPS' precision farming product line including the Outback Guidance((r)) branded products. The second patent was awarded for its method of combining elements of a GNSS compass onto a single printed circuit board and is utilized in the world's most compact all-in-one vector products announced by Hemisphere GPS earlier this year; the V102(tm) GPS compass and positioning system and the H102 OEM board. Marine and land-based users and system integrators benefit from the value of such a compact and accurate GPS compass solution. \"Hemisphere GPS' continuous focus on innovation has generated over 70 pending and issued patents,\" said Dr. Mike Whitehead, Vice President, Technology at Hemisphere GPS. \"Through these innovations we enhance the capability and performance of our positioning, guidance and machine control solutions in the marketplace.\" Conference Call A conference call and Web cast for shareholders, analysts and other members of the investment community has been scheduled for today, May 19, at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time (9:00 a.m. Mountain Time) to discuss the financial results and provide updates on operations.

The Ontario Research and Innovation Optical Network (ORION) celebrates Ontario researchers and innovators who are leveraging cutting-edge technologies to support research, education and discovery in Ontario and on the global stage. These projects and leaders will be recognized today at the ORION Awards Presentation at the MaRS Discovery District, part of the 2011 ORION Summit. \"This year's award recipients illustrate the power of being connected to ORION, Ontario's backbone for research and innovation,\" says Dr. Darin Graham, President and CEO of ORION. \"Ontario is rich in research and leadership talent and the ORION Awards are our way of celebrating those key individuals and projects that are helping put Ontario on the map in fields such as technology, scientific discovery, teaching and learning.\" Iain Klugman - Winner of the ORION Leadership Award Iain Klugman's 20-year career in marketing and technology management has made him one of Canada's foremost experts in innovation and commercialization. Since coming to Waterloo Region to lead Communitech as President and CEO, Mr. Klugman has joined his commitment to supporting technology businesses on the front lines with a sophisticated understanding of building successful regional economies. Under his leadership, Communitech pioneered Canada's first executive-in-residence program at a not-for-profit organization; launched a youth outreach strategy to engage more than 20,000 secondary students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics; left no stone unturned in the quest for talent to fill more than 2,000 open positions in the Region's technology sector; launched a national digital media network; and built The Communitech Hub - a $100 million strategy dedicated to the growth and success of digital media and ICT companies in Ontario. Today, Communitech works with more than 700 tech companies representing over $22 billion in revenue - all in a community of just 500,000 people - a community now widely acknowledged as Canada's leading tech cluster. Building the \"Global Campus Network\" - Winner of the ORION Learning Award Ryerson University's School of Radio and Television Arts is pioneering the development of a CNN-style network for universities around the world using bidirectional high-definition video streaming technology broadcast over IP networks. Led by Professor Richard Grunberg, the project presents a collaborative, international student perspective of worldwide events and creative endeavours. The unique nature of the technology being developed permits the connection of fully bidirectional HD video content with intercom, IFB (earpiece audio for interview scenarios), 4 channels of audio, all with imperceptible delay for live interactivity. Over this system it would be possible to share, feed and derive feeds for raw, pre-packaged and live news, current affairs and entertainment programming, and to develop a collective of research content producers for potential access to 4,100 universities around the world. With the intent of building a cost-effective \"CNN\" of the university world, Ryerson's School of Radio and Television Arts hopes to garner participants and connect university channels and digital signage systems around the globe, to build a Canada-wide cable TV and trans-media platform, and to connect related researchers everywhere. PrAgMatic - Winner of the ORION Discovery Award The PrAgMatic data management system enables vineyard owners and managers to take advantage of the latest remote sensing technology in an economically feasible way to address the challenges of modern day viticulture. For this project, each individual vine in each participating vineyard was GPS located, tagged and recorded into a database of the PrAgMatic system developed by Niagara Research at Niagara College. Large data sets collected by sensors are three-dimensionally mapped and researchers involved in the project at other institutions are able to access the results over the ORION network. Vineyard owners are then able to access real-time, remote-sensed data that allows them to better manage and control operations, inputs and yields.

About SQUEEZETRIGGER.COM WWW.SQUEEZETRIGGER.COM is a service designed to help bonafide shareholders of publicly traded US companies fight short selling. SqueezeTrigger.com has built a proprietary database that uses Threshold list feeds and short sale time and sale data from NASDAQ, AMEX and NYSE to generate detailed and useful information to combat the short selling problem. For the first time, actual trade by trade data is available to the public that shows the attempted size, actual size, price and average value of short sales in stocks that have been shorted. This information is valuable in determining the precise point at which short sellers go out-of-the-money and start losing on their short trades. SQUEEZETRIGGER.COM has built a massive database that collects, analyzes and publishes a proprietary SqueezeTrigger for each stock that has been shorted. The SqueezeTrigger database of nearly 2.5 billion short sale transactions goes back to January 1, 2005 and calculates the exact price at which the Total Short Interest is short in each stock. This data was never before available prior to January 1, 2005 because the Self Regulatory Organizations (primary exchanges) guarded it aggressively. After the SEC passed Regulation SHO, exchanges were forced to allow data processors like SqueezeTrigger.com to access the data. The SqueezeTrigger database collects individual short trade data on over 7,000 NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ stocks and general short trade data on nearly 8,000 OTCBB and PINKSHEET stocks. Each month the database grows by approximately 50,000,000 short sale transactions and provides investors with the knowledge necessary to time when to buy and sell stocks with outstanding short positions. By tracking the size and price of each montha'a\"s short transactions, SQUEEZETRIGGER.COM provides institutions, traders, analysts, journalists and individual investors the exact price point where short sellers start losing money and a short squeeze can begin.

Beginning with The Precision Management Process(TM) which is a fully integrated mutli-product, precision ag program, Agri-Trend will extend its services including its agrology processes, through selected John Deere dealerships by supporting and expanding their capability. The alliance will mean that Agri-Trend will train and support in-house dealership personnel who will work directly with farmers and will provide a linkage between technology, equipment and agronomics. \"This business arrangement builds on each other's strengths.\" Explains Peter Lacey, CEO of Cervus Equipment Corp. \"As a group of John Deere Dealers, we will leverage Agri-Trend's extensive knowledge base to help farmers implement new technologies now available in John Deere equipment. We respect the work that Agri-Trend has done over the past decade and believe they are the right group to provide leadership to farmers seeking to implement precision farming techniques.\" Robert Saik, CEO of Agri-Trend adds, \"This alliance will make it easy for a farmer to adopt variable rate application, merge layers of yield maps with soil zones or use GPS information to drain a field. Agri-Trend will provide the expertise through an expanded Network of Geo-Coaches(TM) and Agri-Coaches(TM). The John Deere expertise will provide equipment and technology necessary to make these ideas come to life in the field.\" \"For example, Agri-Trend Geo Solutions Inc has successfully integrated satellite and aerial imagery with John Deere's GS2 and GS3 variable rate sprayers to create prescription pesticide maps based on in-season vegetative intensity.\" says Saik. The John Deere dealerships involved in the channel arrangement to date include Agro Equipment (Alberta), Farm & Garden (Saskatchewan), JayDee Agtech (Saskatchewan), Maple Farm Equipment (Saskatchewan), Martin Deerline (Alberta), Prairie Coast Equipment (Northern Alberta and British Columbia), South Country Equipment (Saskatchewan) and Premier Equipment (Ontario). The new service offering will be launched this spring with a series of information meetings and training sessions.

All amounts in this news release are expressed in US dollars. For the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2010, Hemisphere GPS reported $12.2 million in revenues, compared to $12.1 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2009. Revenues from all market segments increased in the fourth quarter with the exception of OEM sales in the Agriculture segment which were 31% below 2009 due to timing of order receipts. Specifically, OEM revenues increased by 20% during the second half of 2010, driven by high deliveries in the third quarter which increased 106% over 2009. In the fourth quarter, however, expected OEM orders were deferred into the first half of 2011. Despite deferred orders, the fourth quarter of 2010 still represents the second highest fourth quarter revenue in the Company's history and the last half of the year is the strongest on record for Hemisphere GPS. \"We experienced a general recovery that strengthened through 2010, with second half revenues that grew by 20% year-over-year, after a decline of 6% in the first half of the year\" stated Steven Koles, President and CEO of Hemisphere GPS. \"The recovery led us well into 2011 where we have seen improved momentum in the first quarter supporting a return to growth and profitability. Traction from new products, stronger grain prices and signs of economic recovery are believed to have contributed to stronger purchasing since the second quarter of 2010.\" A weaker US dollar softened gross margins and increased operating costs during the fourth quarter. Incremental inventory reserves also lowered margins during the quarter. Hemisphere GPS reported a net loss for the fourth quarter of $3.8 million, or $(0.07) per share (basic and diluted), compared to a net loss of $2.5 million, or ($0.04) per share (basic and diluted), in the fourth quarter of 2009. The percentage of total sales that were made outside North America in 2010 increased to 40% from 32% in 2009. Sales to Australia showed the strongest relative performance in 2010 with a year-over-year increase of 77% resulting from the launch of an Outback sales network in Australia modeled after the existing Outback sales network deployed in North America. Sales to other markets, excluding Europe, grew by 67% for the year, with particularly strong growth in Asia and South America. In 2010, North American sales declined by 8% for the year given the slower recovery compared to international markets. Following a decline in North American revenues of 17% in the first half of the year, revenues grew by 8% in the back half of 2010. Agriculture product sales in the Company's Outback North American and Australian networks grew by 22% during the fourth quarter compared to 2009, driven by sales of the new eDriveX auto-steering product and the launch of the Australian network during the year. However, sales to OEM and International distributors declined by about 30% from the fourth quarter of 2009. Purchasing by these customers was up by 20% over the last half of 2010 as a result of a third quarter increase of 106% over 2009. The particularly strong third quarter deliveries combined with the deferral of some expected fourth quarter OEM customer orders into 2011, resulted in lower than expected fourth quarter revenues. Growth of 18% in the Precision Products segment during the fourth quarter was led by sales of Vector heading sensor products, including strong sales of the newly released Vector II OEM board. Fourth quarter gross margins decreased to 40% compared to 43% in 2009. Lower margins were largely attributable to incremental inventory reserves recorded in the quarter totaling 5.5 percentage points. In addition, gross margins were negatively impacted by the impact on cost of sales of a weaker US dollar which reduced margins by about 1.5 percentage points in the quarter. Operating expenses were $8.9 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of $1.5 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, impacted, in part, by a weakened US dollar and by 2009 cost reduction initiatives that were not in place during the fourth quarter of 2010. Research and development expense for the quarter increased by $0.3 million to $2.7 million. Sales and marketing expenses increased by $0.8 million from the fourth quarter of 2009 as a result of foreign exchange, consulting costs associated with international sales activities, and the deployment of the Australian Outback distribution network. For 2011, management has implemented foreign currency risk management transactions intended to mitigate the impact on operating expenses of future foreign currency fluctuations. At December 31, 2010, Hemisphere GPS held cash of $5.3 million, as compared to $8.4 million at the end of 2009. Working capital was $22.3 million. Subsequent to the close of 2010, Hemisphere GPS closed a bought-deal financing of 5,228,759 common shares at a price of $1.53 per share for gross proceeds of approximately $8.0 million. For the 2010 year, Hemisphere GPS reported revenues of $56 million, a 4.4% increase from revenues of $53.6 million in 2009. Gross margin for the 2010 year was 44%, compared to 48% in 2009. The weakening of the US dollar had a 2.5 percentage point impact on gross margins for the year and the inventory reserve had a negative impact of 1.2 percentage points. Rising Canadian and Australian currencies versus the US dollar were responsible for approximately half of increased year-over-year expenses of $3.4 million, or 11%, to $33.8 million. Increased investment in research and development contributed the majority of the remaining increase. Average headcount of 229 during 2010 was down by 18 employees from 247 for 2009. The Company reported a net loss for 2010 of $9.4 million, or $(0.17) per share (basic and diluted), compared to a net loss of $5.9 million, or ($0.11) per share (basic and diluted) in 2009. \"Since mid-2010 we have experienced recovery and strengthening in all of our markets,\" said Mr. Koles. \"This strength has continued in the first quarter, and year-to-date revenues in 2011 are ahead of the same period in 2010 by 40%. Our current sales forecast predicts better than 25% growth for 2011 and supports a return to profitability.\" Operational Highlights Throughout 2010, Hemisphere GPS capitalized on product and technology innovation and expanded its sales channels and partners.  New applications and market verticals were introduced during the year.

For the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, 2010, Hemisphere GPS reported $12.2-million in revenues, compared with $12.1-million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2009.

The percentage of total sales that were made outside North America in 2010 increased to 40 per cent from 32 per cent in 2009. Sales to Australia showed the strongest relative performance in 2010 with a year-over-year increase of 77 per cent resulting from the launch of an Outback sales network in Australia modelled after the existing Outback sales network deployed in North America. Sales to other markets, excluding Europe, grew by 67 per cent for the year, with particularly strong growth in Asia and South America. In 2010, North American sales declined by 8 per cent for the year given the slower recovery compared with international markets. Following a decline in North American revenues of 17 per cent in the first half of the year, revenues grew by 8 per cent in the back half of 2010. Agriculture product sales in the company's Outback North American and Australian networks grew by 22 per cent during the fourth quarter compared with 2009, driven by sales of the new eDriveX auto-steering product and the launch of the Australian network during the year. However, sales to OEM and international distributors declined by about 30 per cent from the fourth quarter of 2009. Purchasing by these customers was up by 20 per cent over the last half of 2010 as a result of a third quarter increase of 106 per cent over 2009. The particularly strong third quarter deliveries combined with the deferral of some expected fourth quarter OEM customer orders into 2011, resulted in lower-than-expected fourth quarter revenues.

Research and development expense for the quarter increased by $300,000 to $2.7-million. Sales and marketing expenses increased by $800,000 from the fourth quarter of 2009 as a result of foreign exchange, consulting costs associated with international sales activities and the deployment of the Australian Outback distribution network. For 2011, management has implemented foreign currency risk management transactions intended to mitigate the impact on operating expenses of future foreign currency fluctuations. At Dec. 31, 2010, Hemisphere GPS held cash of $5.3-million, as compared with $8.4-million at the end of 2009. Working capital was $22.3-million.

For the 2010 year, Hemisphere GPS reported revenues of $56-million, a 4.4-per-cent increase from revenues of $53.6-million in 2009. Gross margin for the 2010 year was 44 per cent, compared with 48 per cent in 2009. The weakening of the U.S. dollar had a 2.5-percentage-point impact on gross margins for the year and the inventory reserve had a negative impact of 1.2 percentage points. Rising Canadian and Australian currencies versus the U.S. dollar were responsible for approximately half of increased year-over-year expenses of $3.4-million, or 11 per cent, to $33.8-million. Increased investment in research and development contributed the majority of the remaining increase. Average head count of 229 during 2010 was down by 18 employees from 247 for 2009. The company reported a net loss for 2010 of $9.4-million, or negative 17 cents per share (basic and diluted), compared with a net loss of $5.9-million, or negative 11 cents per share (basic and diluted) in 2009. \"Since mid-2010 we have experienced recovery and strengthening in all of our markets,\" said Mr. Koles. \"This strength has continued in the first quarter, and year-to-date revenues in 2011 are ahead of the same period in 2010 by 40 per cent. Our current sales forecast predicts better than 25-per-cent growth for 2011 and supports a return to profitability.\" Operational highlights Throughout 2010, Hemisphere GPS capitalized on product and technology innovation and expanded its sales channels and partners. Hemisphere GPS announced its first OEM alliance in China with Foton Lovol International Heavy Industry Co., Ltd. to launch Outback Guidance precision farming products in China. Foton Lovol is a leading manufacturer of tractor, harvester and construction machinery in China with sales of $2.04-billion (U.S.) in 2009. Foton Lovol annually manufactures approximately 200,000 tractors. Hemisphere GPS also formed an OEM joint venture with Chinese manufacturer, YTO Group, to complement its series of agricultural vehicles with Outback products in China. In Europe, CLAAS Agrosystems launched eDriveX under the CLAAS brand, GPS pilot, as a part of its precision automated steering solution that also includes the Hemisphere GPS Outback S3 guidance terminal and BaseLineX GPS base station. In Brazil, Hemisphere GPS and Stara S.A. Industria de Implementos Agricolas launched eDriveX under the Stara brand, SPEED DRIVEx. Stara, one of the world's largest agricultural equipment manufacturers, is offering SPEED DRIVEx as a part of its precision automated steering solution. When combined with Outback S3 and BaseLineX or A220/A221 RTK GPS systems, the system automatically steers farm machinery to centimetre-level accuracy. The new system is being sold throughout Stara's distribution network that includes over 1,100 resellers. Also in Brazil, Hemisphere GPS announced that Technomaster, a marine electronics engineering firm in Brazil, had integrated Hemisphere GPS's new LV101 GPS compass into a state-of-the-art marine navigation autopilot system. The LV101 GPS compass is paired with Technomaster's exclusive navigation technology to create an autopilot system suitable for large vessels and small pleasure crafts. In Canada, Hemisphere GPS and UFA Co-operative Ltd. partnered to sell the Outback Guidance S-Lite GPS system in UFA's 35 farm and ranch supply stores across Alberta. Innovation through research and development is a core focus at Hemisphere GPS. Commitment to R&D investment through the economic challenges of 2008 and 2009 resulted in the highest number of new product announcements ever by Hemisphere GPS for a single year, in 2010. Based on new Hemisphere GPS firmware and ASIC designs, Hemisphere GPS introduced its next-generation Eclipse II GNSS receiver technology and released the Eclipse II OEM board -- the first product incorporating these technological advancements. Eclipse II provides improved RTK performance, GPS, GLONASS, SBAS and OmniSTAR support, and reduced power consumption. In addition, the miniEclipse was unveiled, the smallest precision dual-frequency (L1/L2) OEM module available in the market today. Innovations for the Outback product line included new software that allows users to configure and operate Outback AutoMate from the Outback S3 user interface. The most notable new product in 2010 was the remarkable high-precision Outback eDriveX. The Outback eDriveX was launched through the Outback Guidance dealer network in early 2010. When combined with Outback S3 and BaseLineX or A220/A221 RTK GPS systems, eDriveX automatically steers farm machinery to centimetre-level accuracy. The most demanding farm practices including high precision planting, strip tilling and bedding are improved through the reliable and repeatable performance of eDriveX. As a result, farmers achieve more uniform treatments, reduced waste and fuel conservation all while reducing driver fatigue. Subsequent to the close of 2010, Hemisphere GPS has introduced the latest advanced feature to for Outback eDriveX -- the agriculture industry's first auto-turn solution available for multiple brands of farm machinery. eTurns enables farmers to automatically execute a turn at the end of a row, increasing efficiency and reducing driver fatigue. New applications and market verticals were introduced during the year. Hemisphere GPS launched its new Earthworks business unit that designs and manufactures products for the construction market. The Earthworks product line is focused on machine guidance and control of earth-moving machinery. Hemisphere GPS has adapted its proven technology and applications currently used in agriculture, aerial application, marine and survey markets, to meet the needs of the construction industry. Hemisphere GPS entered the Earthworks market with the launch of its X200 full two-dimensional machine guidance system in March, 2010. The company followed with the Earthworks X300 excavator guidance system later in the year. The X300 measures and displays three-dimensional excavator positioning to operators, vastly improving excavation proficiency and accuracy, and greatly reducing rework. Three new Earthworks dealers were added to the company's distribution network, serving the mid-Atlantic and Western United States; Rocky Mountain Laser, Print-O-Stat and Engineering Supply Company. Each channel partner represents the Hemisphere GPS Earthworks product portfolio, including the X200 and X300 excavator machine guidance systems. Hemisphere GPS applied its S3 Outback guidance technology to the oil and gas industry through a customized version of the S3 in partnership with Summit Liability Solutions. The resulting product, the S3-S Navigator, provides a drilling waste disposal solution that manages the ever-increasing regulatory pressure to be environmentally compliant. The S3-S uses Hemisphere GPS's Crescent GPS receiver technology in combination with a Hemisphere GPS eDriveTC for tilt control to precisely apply drilling fluids to a disposal area and is designed to eliminate most of the human error currently present in drilling waste disposal services. In the third quarter, Sunshine Village ski resort began outfitting its entire Snow Cat fleet with Hemisphere GPS's new snow grooming guidance systems. Sunshine Village operators can use the guidance systems to record boundaries and set flags on the screen to map tree lines, out-of-bound limits, winch holds, hazards or other areas of interest. With Hemisphere's snow grooming guidance systems, maintenance managers are able to review job files for operator and machine performance and concerns. It is easy to plot speed, position, area covered and time. \"We experienced productivity improvements immediately with Hemisphere's snow grooming guidance systems,\" says Rod Chisholm, maintenance manager at Sunshine Village ski resort.

About SQUEEZETRIGGER.COM WWW.SQUEEZETRIGGER.COM is a service designed to help bonafide shareholders of publicly traded US companies fight short selling. SqueezeTrigger.com has built a proprietary database that uses Threshold list feeds and short sale time and sale data from NASDAQ, AMEX and NYSE to generate detailed and useful information to combat the short selling problem. For the first time, actual trade by trade data is available to the public that shows the attempted size, actual size, price and average value of short sales in stocks that have been shorted. This information is valuable in determining the precise point at which short sellers go out-of-the-money and start losing on their short trades. SQUEEZETRIGGER.COM has built a massive database that collects, analyzes and publishes a proprietary SqueezeTrigger for each stock that has been shorted. The SqueezeTrigger database of nearly 2.5 billion short sale transactions goes back to January 1, 2005 and calculates the exact price at which the Total Short Interest is short in each stock. This data was never before available prior to January 1, 2005 because the Self Regulatory Organizations (primary exchanges) guarded it aggressively. After the SEC passed Regulation SHO, exchanges were forced to allow data processors like SqueezeTrigger.com to access the data. The SqueezeTrigger database collects individual short trade data on over 7,000 NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ stocks and general short trade data on nearly 8,000 OTCBB and PINKSHEET stocks. Each month the database grows by approximately 50,000,000 short sale transactions and provides investors with the knowledge necessary to time when to buy and sell stocks with outstanding short positions. By tracking the size and price of each montha'a\"s short transactions, SQUEEZETRIGGER.COM provides institutions, traders, analysts, journalists and individual investors the exact price point where short sellers start losing money and a short squeeze can begin.

Robotic farmhands are helping farmers keep costs in check as they struggle to compete with global rivals. The new farm-bots are harvesting tender fruit, milking cows - even planting greenhouse flowers - for owners who are under pressure from the larger-scale operations, longer growing seasons and lax labour practices of factory farms in the United States, Mexico, South America and Asia. At the same time, low interest rates and the high Canadian dollar are making it cheaper to import the latest in high-tech machinery from the United States and Europe - machinery that can perform repetitive tasks without the crop damage of earlier models. \"The thing that surprised me is that robots are a lot cheaper than I thought. You know, $40,000 to $50,000 - rather than millions,\" said Jim Brandle, chief executive officer of Vineland Research and Innovation Centre in Vineland Station, Ont., a not-for-profit organization that assists horticulture farmers with innovation. The push for greater efficiency through technology comes at a crucial time for Canadian farmers: Despite a heavy reliance on temporary foreign workers, labour costs are increasingly pinching profit margins as offshore growers turn to even cheaper, and often illegal, workers. And farmers have been grappling with the added pain of high energy costs, which have been soaring in recent weeks in response to unrest in the Middle East. For Ontario dairy farmer John Walker, high-tech machinery such as \"Lely\" the feed-pushing robot, and a computerized \"milking parlour\" help reduce labour costs and boost production. Mr. Walker and his family own two dairy farms in Aylmer, Ont. With about 2,500 cattle, including 1,100 lactating cows, their dairy business ranks among Canada's largest. Last fall, Mr. Walker imported a $25,000 robot from Germany that allows his cows to basically feed on demand - no matter the hour. \"It can go all day, all night, when no one is even there. It is pushing feed in, which helps increase milk production.\" Well-fed cows produce more milk. A couple years ago, the family installed the computerized milking parlour. Resembling a large carousel, it slowly rotates as the cows get on and off. Each cow is equipped with a transponder. When a cow enters the milking parlour, its transponder number is read. The computer then records the amount of milk it produces. While the high-tech milking parlour doesn't go as far as some robotic milkers on the market - some even clean the cow's udder before milking - it can flag cows that are sick or in heat. The transponder tracks how many steps each animal takes during the day: When a cow is in heat, it moves around a lot more, whereas a sick cow will have a noticeable drop in activity. The parlour holds up to 50 cows at a time, allowing 250 to 300 cows to be milked per hour. That compares to a maximum of 90 cows per hour under the old system. \"Nothing is ramming [them]. They just kind of roll at their own pace,\" Mr. Walker said. No one is suggesting robots will ever entirely replace human workers, but rising labour costs are forcing farmers to sharpen their focus on innovation. About 65 per cent of all farms earn gross revenues of less than $100,000 a year, according to the Canadian Agricultural Human Resource Council. In that context, \"wages are definitely a big issue,\" executive director Danielle Vinette said. In 1999, Canadian farms spent $3.1-billion on wages, room and board. By 2009, that had risen to $4.3-billion - with more than half that amount earmarked for non-family wages. That's precisely why horticulture farmer Robert Bierhuizen sees investing in robots as a \"matter of survival.\" He produces 1.2 million potted flowering plants a year at his greenhouse in Vineland Station, and uses robotic technology to automate potting and pot spacing. He's now looking at investing in a vision-based robot that can be programmed to do more intricate tasks such as examining a pot, counting its flowers and judging whether it is suitable for shipment. The robot alone costs $40,000 to $100,000, but a complete system, including all the necessary hardware and software, is as much as $250,000. \"I'm not saying that it can totally replace people ... But it will help people because it will increase their production level,\" Mr. Bierhuizen says. Economic factors are also making it easier for farmers to step up their game. Canadian farmers spent more than $4.2-billion on imports of agricultural machinery in 2010 as the loonie marched toward parity. That compares to total outlays of $3.2-billion in 2000 - a year when the loonie traded between 63.97 and 69.84 cents (U.S.), according to data from the Bank of Canada. Experts say the high dollar and low borrowing rates should buttress more spending this year. Most high-tech equipment is imported from the United States and Europe. Manufacturers include U.S.-based Harvest Automation and Lely Holding, which is headquartered in the Netherlands but active in more than 60 countries. Virginia Labbie, a senior policy analyst for agri-business with the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, says farmers' capital spending plans have been \"above average\" for the past few months. \"It's not surprising that more farmers are investing more in capital [expenditures] given the high Canadian dollar and the shortage of qualified labour,\" Ms. Labbie said. \"Really, our ag members have to be ahead of the curve to stay competitive.\" Phil Tregunno, who produces grapes, peaches and other tender fruit on his family farm in Niagara-on-the-Lake, uses a high-tech packaging system that can photograph each fruit, measure its size and look for damage. He recently returned from the Fruit Logistica trade show in Berlin, where he ordered a new system that records other food safety information such as a fruit's originating orchard and harvest date. That set him back about $100,000, but the higher loonie took out some of the sting. David Rinneard, national manager of agriculture at Bank of Montreal, said more and more farmers are employing high-tech solutions to reduce labour and input costs. Wheat and corn farmers have for decades benefited from the use of self-propelled combines, since grain crops are more uniform in size and less susceptible to damage than tender fruit and vegetable crops. But now they're also using satellite imagery and GPS technology to enhance their yields. Such \"precision agriculture management systems\" maximize acreage use, while curbing waste of seed, fertilizer and herbicide. For example, the technology is connected to \"auto-steer\" mechanisms on tractors to ensure perfectly straight rows. It can also constantly measure nitrogen levels in the soil to ensure the appropriate amount of fertilizer is used. Mr. Tregunno says European fruit farmers are much more advanced with the use of robotics for harvesting and hopes the technology will be eventually employed in Canadian orchards. \"Europe has changed a lot ... We're not there just yet but we need to be there,\" Mr. Tregunno said. Other than tractors and other vehicles, \"out in the orchard, it is still basically done the same way as the last 100 years.\" *** IMPORTING LABOUR There is a growing urgency for farmers to slash labour costs because rising energy prices are poised to drive up other expenses like transportation and the prices of key inputs like fertilizer. Consumers, meanwhile, are increasingly interested in buying local food, providing farmers with added incentive to cut their costs so they can effectively compete on price. \"Our advantage in Canada is we can innovate,\" said Jim Brandle, chief executive officer of the Vineland Research and Innovation Centre in Vineland Station, Ont. Labour costs vary by farm and crop. Faced with a shortage of Canadian agricultural labour, farmers have increasingly employed temporary foreign workers since the late 1960s. In 2009, 23,372 workers exclusively from Mexico and the Caribbean entered Canada under the now 45-year-old Seasonal Agricultural Worker Program. Between January and September of 2010, that tally hit 23,860. Full-year results are still being compiled, but that compares with 16,710 in 2000. Migrant farm workers from those and other countries can enter Canada under the agricultural stream of the Pilot Project for Occupations Requiring Lower Levels of Formal Training. A total of 1,575 did so in 2009, up from 115 in 2002, when the program started.

Already European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) certified for use in more than 27 European countries, plus Canada, Mexico and New Zealand, the LRS Series radios offer superior RF link budgets through higher RF receive sensitivity, rather than increased RF output power. The resulting lower power consumption of the LRS radios not only makes them more suitable for remote installations and solar power than other licensed spectrum products on the market, it also allows for significant cost savings. As true serial data radios, the LRS series radios provide optimum use of the available bandwidth in narrow-band UHF channels without the protocol overhead of native-IP radios. The LRS series, including the new ETSI approved radios, operates in licensed UHF frequencies (406 - 430 MHz and 435 MHz to 470 MHz) for exclusive, non-shared use of the RF spectrum, decreasing the likelihood of congestion or interference. The radios are housed inside an industrial-grade, small and rugged enclosure that offers mounting and installation versatility, including a DIN rail mounting option, with all connectors conveniently located on one side of the enclosure. \"The LRS series radios are an ideal solution for mission critical data transmission in narrow-band licensed spectrum and offer both superior performance and the proven reliability and quality that our customers have come to know and expect in our products,\" said Matthias van Doorn, product manager, Ethernet & licensed radio systems at FreeWave. \"Customers who deploy these radios in remote locations that depend on battery power and solar charging will appreciate the industry-leading RF receive sensitivity and performance to support longer links even without high RF output power and associated high current draw that other products in the market require,\" van Doorn explained. \"And unlike native-IP radios, the LRS Series does not get burdened with protocol overhead for its serial data communication, resulting in better throughput, faster polling cycles and an increased number of remote radios that can be polled from the same master site. This results in significant savings for our customers and may help explain why FreeWave LRS radios will fast become the preferred choice for narrow-band licensed spectrum applications worldwide.\" Availability, Configurations, and Pricing The LRS-455 EU Series is available now and can be purchased in multiple configurations, including point-to-point and point-to-multipoint, slave or repeater.

They say new precision farming approaches, using advocacy more effectively and dramatically modifying financing approaches are all key options. Dr. Leo den Hartog,director of research and development at Nutreco in Netherlands, says sustainable precision livestock farming is an emerging trend led by Europe. He says the concept takes a broad approach to precision management and advocates harnessing innovations from areas such as genomics, microsystem technology, nanotechnology and information and communications technology. (The Canadian Press) (Dehorning) The Beef Research Cluster is strongly recommending livestock producers dehorn calves as early as possible. The first reason is that the procedure is less invasive in newborn calves, so growth performance is not affected as much. Second, common sense and science both say that removing an established horn from an older animal is much more painful than removing the unattached horn bud from calves. The other way to dehorn cattle is to use polled genetics. A reliable D-N-A test for the horned/polled gene has not yet been developed, but most breeds do have polled bloodlines. A pair of Canadian studies published in 1996 and 1998 found miniscule difference in backfat depth between horned and polled bulls, but no differences in birth, weaning or yearling weight, pre- or post-weaning growth rate, scrotal circumference, carcass weight, marbling score, ribeye area or lean meat yield.

There's still room for improvement, though, if Canadian producers and processors use technology to get ever more efficient and reliable results. Reducing waste is an important first step. Every year, an estimated $27-billion worth of Canadian food ends up in landfills and composting, according to a new study from the George Morris Centre. This wasted food represents approximately 40% of all the food produced in Canada, and is equal to about 2% of the country's GDP. It's also higher than the combined GDP of the 32 poorest countries. \"We found a lot of hidden waste that could be reduced by greater collaboration between businesses along the value chain,\" says Martin Gooch, director of the Value Chain Management Centre and one of the study's authors. Margins are thin in the food business, so this waste is very bad for business at all levels. One of the culprits is the lack of uniform use of IT and business analytics in the food industry. At the retail end of the spectrum, where businesses generally deal directly with consumers, market pressures have been the most effective, and there is less resistance to change. At the other end, producers have been more conservative, and less willing to change practices that have proven themselves over time. \"This tension leads to distrust,\" says Mr. Gooch, \"and a lack of willingness to share information - and this doesn't create a can-do attitude.\" Implementing technology solutions can increase the accuracy and timeliness of food purchasing systems, and decrease waste, but only if the relationships between stakeholders are strong. The potential for these improvements is tremendous. Precision farming uses GPS tracking on tractors to record information about soil type, and seed and fertilizer distribution, and fogging and spraying patterns. Greenhouses are able to monitor every element of their environments, both to ensure safety and boost outputs. Tracing technologies also mean that any necessary recalls can be issued quickly, and also as narrowly as possible, so that only tainted food is recalled, and not entire shipments, which may contain only a few tainted items. John Johnson is the Commercial Fish Program Coordinator for the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, which is developing a whole-chain traceability project for fish from the Great Lakes. \"The system can trace the fish from Lake Erie to when it enters La Nassa Foods [the Canadian company participating in the project], and they can track it from the processing plant through the various stages of processing, freezing and shipping it to their customer in the U.S.,\" says Mr. Johnson. The ultimate goal is real-time, complete tracking \"from source to fork,\" which would make food safer, fresher, and more efficiently produced."}, {"title": "SE, AGCO, SLM, ATML, VRSN, PCX Expected To Be Up Before Next Earnings Releases", "article": "Symbol Company # of Reports Quarter Release Date SE SPECTRA ENERGY CORP 6 Quarter Q4 02/03/2011 AGCO AGCO CORP 6 Quarter Q4 02/08/2011 SLM SLM CORP 12 Quarter Q4 01/19/2011 ATML ATMEL CORP 6 Quarter Q4 02/07/2011 VRSN VERISIGN INC 6 Quarter Q4 02/03/2011 PCX PATRIOT COAL CORP 6 Quarter Q4 02/02/2011 This technology is designed to help the stock trader identify those companies that seem to have a consistent pattern of movement before or after the earnings release date, based on the history of earnings releases for that company.

About SQUEEZETRIGGER.COM WWW.SQUEEZETRIGGER.COM is a service designed to help bonafide shareholders of publicly traded US companies fight short selling. SqueezeTrigger.com has built a proprietary database that uses Threshold list feeds and short sale time and sale data from NASDAQ, AMEX and NYSE to generate detailed and useful information to combat the short selling problem. For the first time, actual trade by trade data is available to the public that shows the attempted size, actual size, price and average value of short sales in stocks that have been shorted. This information is valuable in determining the precise point at which short sellers go out-of-the-money and start losing on their short trades. SQUEEZETRIGGER.COM has built a massive database that collects, analyzes and publishes a proprietary SqueezeTrigger for each stock that has been shorted. The SqueezeTrigger database of nearly 2.5 billion short sale transactions goes back to January 1, 2005 and calculates the exact price at which the Total Short Interest is short in each stock. This data was never before available prior to January 1, 2005 because the Self Regulatory Organizations (primary exchanges) guarded it aggressively. After the SEC passed Regulation SHO, exchanges were forced to allow data processors like SqueezeTrigger.com to access the data. The SqueezeTrigger database collects individual short trade data on over 7,000 NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ stocks and general short trade data on nearly 8,000 OTCBB and PINKSHEET stocks. Each month the database grows by approximately 50,000,000 short sale transactions and provides investors with the knowledge necessary to time when to buy and sell stocks with outstanding short positions. By tracking the size and price of each montha'a\"s short transactions, SQUEEZETRIGGER.COM provides institutions, traders, analysts, journalists and individual investors the exact price point where short sellers start losing money and a short squeeze can begin.

Tremblay and co-authors in the area of fuzzy logic published", "article": "2010 DEC 31 - (VerticalNews.com) -- According to a study from Montreal, Canada, \"A fuzzy inference system (FIS) was developed to generate recommendations for spatially variable applications of N fertilizer. Key soil and plant properties were identified based on experiments with rates ranging from 0 to 250 kg N ha(-1) conducted over three seasons (2005, 2006 and 2007) on fields with contrasting apparent soil electrical conductivity (ECa), elevation (ELE) and slope (SLP) features.\" \"Mid-season growth was assessed from remotely sensed imagery at 1-m(2) resolution. Optimization of N rate by the FIS was defined against maximum corn growth in the weeks following in-season N application. The best mid-season growth was in areas of low ECa, high ELE and low SLP. Under favourable soil conditions, maximum mid-season growth was obtained with low in-season N. Responses to N fertilizer application were better where soil conditions were naturally unfavourable to growth. The N sufficiency index (NSI) was used to judge plant N status just prior to in-season N application. Expert knowledge was formalized as a set of rules involving ECa, ELE, SLP and NSI levels to deliver economically optimal N rates (EONRs). The resulting FIS was tested on an independent set of data (2008). A simulation revealed that using the FIS would have led to an average N saving of 41 kg N ha(-1) compared to the recommended uniform rate of 170 kg N ha(-1), without a loss of yield,\" wrote N. Tremblay and colleagues. The researchers concluded: \"The FIS therefore appears to be useful for incorporating expert knowledge into spatially variable N recommendations.\" Tremblay and colleagues published the results of their research in Precision Agriculture (Development and validation of fuzzy logic inference to determine optimum rates of N for corn on the basis of field and crop features.

In this country to update the latest advances being adopted by Australian producers, he toured a number of farms in south east Queensland to keep abreast of the latest initiatives being adopted by local farmers. \"Controlled traffic in Canada is relatively small and when I say small, I may be the only farmer practicing it,\" he said. \"Although there may be one other gentleman in northern Alberta. \"We are just at the beginning and that's why we are here.\" As far as Steve is concerned it is \"the efficiencies\", including machinery efficiencies, also moisture use efficiency gains, plus the ability to \"stay precise\" that is the underlying appeal. As part of his tour of south east Queensland farms, Mr Larocque needs no convincing of the economic gains that can be sheeted home to accommodating the latest broadacre cropping trends. \"A gentleman I visited this morning said he had basically doubled sorghum yields in the last 15 years since he first started,\" Steve said. \"That's what intrigues me. \"If I can double the amount of yield I can get, even increase it by 20 per cent, then I'm in front.\" Explaining this was his third tour of Australia in recent years, on the back of visiting both New Zealand and the United Kingdom to monitor controlled traffic traits, the noted agronomist said it was important to gauge their worth in both wet and dry environments. \"We are basically the same (as Australia) in that it is often too dry, or too wet,\" Steve said. \"So I am taking on board the information I have learned over here, especially the way you set up your gear.\" Back in Alberta Province he has set up a \"three-to-one system\" encompassing a 9.1m (30ft) header front, 9.1m drill and 27.4m (90ft) boomsprayer. Wheel equipment is standardised on 3.1m (10ft 3in) with all paddock running gear able to follow down the same 58cm (23in) tracks. For the present, the operation does not operate a chaser bin with the preference to unload the header at the property's headlands. \"At the moment we can't justify a chaser bin so we put it (grain) straight into a truck,\" Steve said. His 292ha (640 acre) farm, compared to Alberta Province's average 809ha (2000ac) enterprise, requires him to maximise the potential of his wheat, barley and canola rotations. \"I want to be able to double my profits,\" Steve said. \"An average wheat yield used to be a little under 3t/ha but now we are averaging closer to 4t/ha. \"I'm content with that but I am not satisfied because we can certainly do a lot better.\" Interestingly, rather than purchase new equipment, the Larocque family chose to modify existing machinery. \"The expense of the equipment changes was between $5000 and $6000,\" he said. \"The technology, including hands-free steering, probably came in at between $16,000 and $18,000 to give us the right mapping, the right GPS and the right RTK system.\" Alberta farmers still largely pursue traditional cultivations methods, angled towards two-thirds cropping, one-third fallow every year. But there is growing community awareness of the benefits associated with zero-till and controlled traffic farming approach garnering \"some strange looks\" on the part of neighbours. \"Everybody's still quietly looking,\" Steve said. \"The last big revolution was zero-till but the adoption rate is now about 60 per cent. \"And now we have this new practice called controlled traffic offering the potential of even more gains. \"If you look at the adoption rates of controlled traffic farming in Australia it's about 20pc in the last five years and that's pretty big. \"It's going to take a lot longer for us in Canada.\" Meanwhile, Precision Agriculture's Tim Neale, who hosted the 11-strong Canadian contingent around south east Queensland, said visitors picked up useful information on the farms they visited. \"Australia leads the world in controlled traffic farming and at around 20 to 25pc uptake, we have the highest adoption rate in the world,\" he said. \"These guys have come to learn how to do it properly.\" The point being made by Mr Neale is that Canadian farmers have the ability to \"leapfrog\" their way to a more rapid uptake. \"They can short-cut the 15 years of pain we have been through to get there in just one or two years,\" Tim said. \"These guys can quickly learn what not do do, also what to do properly and get up to speed very quickly.\""}, {"title": "HEM Hemisphere GPS signs OEM agreement with FOTON", "article": "Hemisphere GPS Inc (TSX-V:HEM) Shares Issued 55,561,676 Last Close 12/7/2010 $0.98 Thursday December 09 2010 - News Release Mr. Steven Koles reports HEMISPHERE GPS ANNOUNCES FIRST OEM ALLIANCE IN CHINA FOR OUTBACK GUIDANCE PRECISION FARMING PRODUCTS WITH FOTON LOVOL Hemisphere GPS and FOTON LOVOL International Heavy Industry Co., Ltd. have reached their OEM (original equipment manufacturer) agreement to launch Outback Guidance precision farming products in China.

Their fears surfaced when a group of precision agriculture enthusiasts, including agronomist Jay Bruggencate (pictured), took time out to brief the hard-pressed Warra community about the reality of coexisting with Canada's huge oil and gas industry. Conceding he was not an expert on surface rights issues, Mr Bruggencate nevertheless is in an ideal position to detail some of the impacts on farming communities. The noted agronomist pointed out his family farm had been dealing with Alberta Province's oil and gas companies since 1966. Top-of-mind concerns, mirrored across Australia, include the devaluation of land, the well-being of underlying aquifers, and safety factors relating to the network of gas pipes beneath affected paddocks, as well as compensation. \"In fact, in Alberta we have been dealing with oil and gas for decades on agricultural land. It's the largest eco-nomic industry in the Province, with many large and powerful companies, generating a lot of money for export,\" Mr Bruggencate said. While Alberta produces vast amounts of coal-bed methane, shale gas and coal gas, Mr Bruggencate said they were all subject to a number of \"extremely complex\" regulatory authorities. These included one with a brief to sanction individual well licences, the depth of drilling and royalties. Meanwhile, a different board tackled compensation, while the impact on land, including water-related issues, remained under the auspices of another agency. Today, Mr Bruggencate says hundreds of thousands of oil and gas wells probably have been drilled in Alberta since the 1920s. \"During 2007 we were drilling 1200 wells a year in the Province.\" Licensed land agents visit farms, ostensibly to represent both sides affected by oil and gas industry activities, according to Mr Bruggencate. \"They are supposed to act in the interests of both parties, but they really work for the oil companies,\" he said. While, at one stage some 5000 to 6000 land agents worked within Alberta Province, only about one dozen were deemed to be working on the part of farmers. \"Oil and gas developments do impact on agricultural land, and farmers only own the surface (of their land), with oil and gas companies able to purchase the rights to mine the minerals below from the province of Alberta,\" Mr Bruggencate said. Asked whether any farmers had been successful in preventing oil and gas companies accessing their properties, Mr Bruggencate gave a cautious nod, adding, however, it was \"not an easy process\". \"You have to be very, very wise.\" Interestingly, oil and gas companies can buy different layers, or bands, beneath properties to access oil, shal-low shale gas and coal-based methane, according to their requirements. Presently there is a limit to the number of wells that can be drilled on individual properties, but there are moves to lift the numbers, thereby further impacting on farm operations. Warra residents were surprised to hear that once wells had ceased pro-duction, permanent 5m easements remained in force around each well head, limiting farm development into the future. At this point the shake of a head by one local producer and the quiet comment that \"it's just not fair\" summed up the frustration being felt by the Warra community, which remains hugely concerned about the vast coal-mining venture earmarked for Wandoan. l A video interview with Jay Bruggencate can be seen at the FarmOnline website. On whether land impacted by oil and gas industry operations can ever be returned to its former productive state, Mr Bruggencate doubted such a scenario. As far as offering advice to Australian farmers affected by oil and gas company developments, he underscored the importance of developing five, 10-year, even 20-year plans to better understand the likely impacts. \"Use these plans to determine where these wells should be, perhaps in areas of least amount of impact,\" Mr Bruggencate said. \"Get it all in writing, including where they want to put their compressor stations,\" he added. Canadian farmers, likewise, have had to deal with access issues steming from the spread of weeds from mining-related machinery, also disease worries like the spread of Club Root in canola. Mr Bruggencate underscored the importance of producer groups working together to become \"a much stronger\" force. \"It's important for producer groups to raise awareness (levels),\" he said. \"You (producers) own your land, take control,\" Mr Bruggencate said. - Story, picture: GRAHAM FULLER. *A video interview with Jay Bruggencate can be seen by turning to the FarmOnline website.
