[{"title": "Universities rethink as students navigate careers of the future; Focus on climate change, cybersecurity reflect 'changing marketplace'", "article": "As automation and artificial intelligence continue to transform Canadian workplaces, post-secondary institutions across the country say they are working to prepare students for jobs that may not even exist yet. Climate change, data science and cybersecurity are increasingly in the spotlight at Canadian universities as they adapt their offerings to address \"the needs not only of a changing marketplace but of a changing society,\" Paul Davidson, president of the association Universities Canada, said in a recent interview. Forecasting can prove difficult, however. \"There are numbers like 50 per cent of the jobs (of the future) have not yet been defined, and so how does any organization ... prepare for that kind of change?\" Davidson said. A research paper from 2018 showed that automation will affect half of Canadian jobs in the next decade, and \"human skills\" such as critical thinking and problem-solving will be key to remaining competitive and resilient in an era of disruption and artificial intelligence. The study conducted by RBC Economics found Canada's education system is inadequately designed to help young people navigate the new skills economy. It recommended that every undergrad have the opportunity for placements such as apprenticeships and internships before graduation. Universities, however, say they work constantly with faculty, experts and industry leaders so students are prepared for the changing economic and labour landscape. This \"future-proofing\" is a complex process that involves more than just creating new degrees and programs, says Susan McCahan, vice-provost of academic programs at the University of Toronto. It also involves rethinking existing curricula with an eye to future career trends, particularly in fields with major exposure to artificial intelligence, she said. Pharmacy, for example. \"They are imagining that within a fairly short time-frame here, the work that pharmacists do will be really vastly different ... than what we experience right now,\" McCahan said. \"How do you train pharmacists to do effective client care, and what does that mean in a world in which your prescriptions are delivered to your home and you don't walk into the Shoppers Drug Mart to find the pharmacist? Or maybe there's a vending machine where your prescription is waiting for you.\" At the same time, McCahan said, not every program needs an AI component, and universities have to be careful not to jump on every fad. While some traditional programs get an overhaul, new programs have also surfaced in recent years as institutions address what they see as significant and emerging needs in society and the workforce. Toronto's York University, for example, recently unveiled a disaster and emergency management program it's calling the first of its kind in Canada, saying crises like the 2016 wildfire evacuation in Alberta demonstrate a pressing demand for qualified experts in the field. The U of T, meanwhile, has begun offering what it calls the country's first undergraduate engineering program in machine intelligence, specializing in the study, development and application of algorithms that help systems learn from data. The University of New Brunswick opened a cybersecurity institute in 2017 in hopes of establishing an educational hub for a pivotal issue of the digital age. At the University of Guelph's Ontario Agricultural College, dean Rene Van Acker says AI has led to renewed interest in precision agriculture - the use of data to allocate resources more efficiently, among other things. The practice can also help reduce farming's impact on the environment, combining two major trends in education and work, he said. \"The overapplication of fertilizer, for example, is a problem in watersheds,\" Van Acker said. \"Technology that could help us to refine our applications to make them more precise would then benefit the environment.\" Many schools say they focus on underlying skills - particularly teamwork, communication and project management - that will allow students to navigate technological changes in their fields. These skills, they say, are in growing demand among employers. \"That is what the university is uniquely situated to provide, because we don't think about job training, we think about developing the skills and interests of people,\" Alice Pitt, vice-provost academic at York University, said in a recent interview. Developing those skills often means collaborating across fields, she said. A new pilot program run by faculty in the university's dance department and engineering school, for instance, is \"really oriented toward the future of work.\" It brings together fourth-year students in interdisciplinary groups to tackle problems pitched by industry and non-profit groups, focusing on skills and abilities needed to address those challenges, Pitt said. Collaboration is also needed in coming up with new courses to prepare students for the issues they'll face in the workplace, she said. \"The philosophy department is creating the ethics course that the business people and the engineering people who are doing AI will be exposed to, which is a much deeper, deeper way of thinking about it,\" Pitt said. The Canadian Press"}, {"title": "FAA wants to start tracking drones; While technology aims to enhance safety, security, some fear loss of privacy", "article": "The Federal Aviation Administration proposed sweeping regulations last Thursday that would require that all but the tiniest drones incorporate technology that would enable them to be tracked at all times while flying in U.S. airspace. \"Remote ID technologies will enhance safety and security by allowing the FAA, law enforcement and federal security agencies to identify drones flying in their jurisdiction,\" the federal transportation secretary, Elaine Chao, said in a statement. As drone operators, manufacturers and others involved in the rapidly expanding drone industry began sifting through the 319-page proposal last week, responses varied wildly. While some applauded the FAA for finally creating a system to rapidly identify owners of rogue - and potentially deadly - drones, others declared that this was going to drastically hinder drone efficiency and cost effectiveness. Since 2015, operators of all drones that weigh more than half a pound have been required to register their devices, by submitting their names along with their email and home addresses to the FAA. Some federal facilities - prisons, for example - are authorized to use systems to detect the presence of drones, said Reggie Govan, a former chief counsel to the FAA who now teaches at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. But, at the moment, officials do not have a quick way to identify the owner of a given drone or to track the location of drones that have been registered by a particular person. Even airports and power plants currently lack the legal authority to track drones, Govan said. At the simplest level, the proposed regulation requires all drones more than 0.55 pound to emit a very particular kind of signal. \"Once you have drones that are emitting an identifier, then you can have a system that can track all drones,\" Govan said, adding that he applauded the regulations. Brendan Schulman, vice-president for policy and legal affairs at DJI, a Chinese company that is one of the leading manufacturers of small consumer drones, said that for the past several years, industry leaders and government stakeholders had tried to figure out how to create a sort of drone \"license plate system.\" He said that the proposed system could make sense. His primary concern is that the cost and burden to drone pilots and operators remain low - something he is still evaluating. But for Paul Aitken, a founder of DroneU, a drone pilot training company in New Mexico, the costs immediately struck him as excessive. The new regulations require all registered drones within 36 months to begin carrying a specific type of remote identification system that broadcasts over the internet. Often finding an internet connection is not feasible in the locations where drone operators fly, Aitken said. According to his reading of the rules, if you don't have cellular service or another way to connect to the internet, operators will have to limit flights to 400 feet laterally, which is roughly to the end of a block - and back. Search and rescue missions often require going at least four times that distance, he said. \"People will literally die from these rules,\" he said, adding that other \"industries that are thriving with drones like utility inspection, precision agriculture, land surveying, ranch management and even some construction management would suffer greatly\" given that the rules undermine efficiency, which for many is part of the appeal of drones. He is also concerned that drone pilots will have to publicly disclose their locations. \"Pilots need privacy to protect them from fear-based citizens who think that drones are spying on them,\" he said. A New York City councilman, Justin Brannan, said he thought this was a step in the right direction, however. It is illegal to fly a drone in most of New York City. The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, as the proposed legislation is called, will be open for a 60-day comment period. At that point, the regulations become law."}, {"title": "Automation, climate change, AI: schools prepping students for jobs of the future", "article": "Abbotsford News -- As automation and artificial intelligence continue to transform Canadian workplaces, post-secondary institutions across the country say they are working to prepare students for jobs that may not even exist yet.

The future estate gift will be integrated into the Olds College Smart Farm, which is a cutting-edge learning environment for students with a focus on enhancing productivity and sustainability of farming with new technologies. George and Marge Steckler who live in Olds, about 96 kilometres north of Calgary, have been farming in the area since 1973 and have since retired. Marge's parents met at Olds College in the 1930s, making the gift even sweeter as the legacy of both farming and family will continue. \"Farmland is really quite close to people's hearts,\" said Patrick Machacek, vice-president of development and strategy at Olds College. \"Any farm family that has put their lifeblood into buying, maintaining and building up a successful farm - it's never an easy thing to transition away from that. The fact that they have made that gift to the college is really quite astounding.\" Machacek said the Steckler farm will be a welcome addition to the college's existing 800 hectares of farmland near the university that's retrofitted with smart farm technology. He said Olds College is one of only a few, if not the only post-secondary school, committed to farms of the future. \"It's our intent to make sure it's one-of-a-kind within the country, so there is a learning environment there that is second to none. For instance, in 2020, we will have autonomous farming happening on the smart farm,\" Machacek explained. The Olds College Smart Farm launched last year after faculty met with industry advisers in Alberta and other jurisdictions about the future of farming. Stakeholders made it clear that the industry is shifting and the need to test and validate new farming technology is vital to meet increasing demand for food as the world's population rises. \"It's the wave of the future,\" said Machacek. \"They were all saying that the speed of technology and how it's changing the agriculture industry is very daunting.\" The college took up the challenge, he said, to test and justify new technologies and educate students who can then adapt the new technologies to benefit modern farming. The program uses equipment like drones and autonomous vehicles, in addition to sensors in the fields, to collect data and, in turn, generate an understanding of new agricultural techniques. Marge and George said they are excited to help the next generation of farmers. \"We had a great life on the farm. It provided us with independence to work for ourselves. I can't think of anything better than for us to provide a gift of land and funds to support students attending Olds College,\" said Marge in a press release. \"It feels right to help the next generation, and it's nice to know that our name will continue on through this donation.\" The inaugural Steckler bursary was awarded to a student earlier this month and the college has already begun installing smart farm technology on the gifted parcel of land."}, {"title": "Companies Outside Tech Jump Into AI Research; John Deere, LG Electronics, National Grid and others are setting up labs in key tech hubs to help them tap AI's potential", "article": "Corrections & Amplifications John Deere Labs works on the John Deere Operations Center, which is a cloud-based app. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated John Deere Labs helped design the John Deere Operations Center, which was incorrectly referred to as a machine-learning app. (Dec. 20, 2019) Corporations in industries beyond technology--ranging from real estate to farm equipment--are setting up artificial-intelligence research centers in and around Silicon Valley, Toronto and other technology hot spots. They include Robert Bosch GmbH, Anheuser-Busch InBev SA, Deere & Co., JPMorgan Chase & Co., LG Electronics Inc., National Grid PLC and Realogy Holdings Corp., among others. Companies outside tech are opening AI labs to gain more experience with the technology and realize its potential, said Svetlana Sicular, an analyst at research and advisory firm Gartner Inc. Many of these companies flocked to Silicon Valley, Ms. Sicular said, because of the large talent pool and the opportunity to collaborate with others in their industry. Agricultural-equipment maker John Deere, for instance, said it has found it easier to attract systems engineers and data scientists at its John Deere Labs outpost in San Francisco than at its headquarters in Moline, Ill. The northern California location has also given it the opportunity to work closely with dozens of other agritech companies in Silicon Valley, said Alexey Rostapshov, the head of digital innovation at John Deere Labs. Still, recruitment remains challenging because of competition from tech giants such as Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Apple Inc., he said. Located in San Francisco's SoMa district, John Deere Labs is playing a key role in shaping the company's plans to support data-driven precision agriculture. Founded two years ago, the 12-person facility works on the John Deere Operations Center, a cloud-based app used by farmers to analyze the data gathered by their Deere vehicles on some 150 million acres under cultivation. The digital platform serves as an online farm-management system that enables growers to farm more acres in less time. It runs on tractors, combines and other Deere vehicles, which act like giant moving sensors. They feed huge volumes of data into the operations center, which analyzes it to provide insights on crop yields, field utilization and other metrics. The system also allows farmers to track their vehicle locations and monitor field work. Like Deere, Realogy was drawn to Northern California because of the size of the talent pool and the proximity of other companies engaged in AI research. Realogy, which provides residential real-estate services to brokers and home buyers, has 70 researchers and data scientists at its AI lab in Emeryville, Calif., near Silicon Valley. The AI team there works in two-week sprints to build applications based on feedback from the company's agents, brokers and partners. One app was developed to help identify and recruit the most productive sales agents. Since it was rolled out 18 months ago, agent production has steadily increased, said Tom Morgan, Realogy's chief data officer. National Grid, a supplier of electricity and natural gas to more than 20 million people in New York, Massachusetts and Rhode Island, also is exploring AI-related opportunities at the technology incubation office it opened in San Francisco earlier this year. The office is part of National Grid Partners, a $250 million venture-capital fund started by the utility in November 2018 and geared toward helping it tap into technology innovations. The company has used its fund to acquire some of the expertise it needs. Earlier this year, it took a $10 million stake in Copperleaf Technologies Inc., a Vancouver, British Columbia-based developer of AI software that runs complex what-if analyses. These enable National Grid to spot potential power grid problems before they cause outages. \"We've got three petabytes of data that we've collected from our customers' homes,\" said Lisa Lambert, chief technology and innovation officer at National Grid and president of National Grid Partners. \"The opportunity for us is to get insights from that data and then apply it to better service our customers.\" Toronto--home to the Vector Institute, one of the world's leading AI research centers--has become another destination for AI labs. Nine months ago, LG Electronics, which has had an AI lab in Silicon Valley since 2013, opened another research center in Toronto. Formed in partnership with the University of Toronto, the new facility has a staff of 20 and is investing $1 million a year on research into deep and machine learning. AI figures heavily into plans by the South Korea-based maker of home appliances and other electronic devices to build smarter and more intuitive products. Yet much of the work at the two research centers isn't directly product oriented. Many of the projects are what Darin Graham, director of LG's Toronto lab, calls \"directed discovery,\" aimed at making breakthroughs in such areas as machine vision, voice recognition and video motion detection. The advances are expected to eventually find their way into the company's products. Access to a deep and growing talent pool was a key reason for the expansion into Canada, Dr. Graham said. \"Researchers love to work with other great researchers,\" he said, \"and our proximity to Vector and the University of Toronto allows us to attract and retain the talent we need.\" As companies across all industries look to tap AI's potential, the scramble for top talent is likely to intensify."}, {"title": "Wanstead Farmers Co-op shares profits with its farmer-owners", "article": "FOR: WANSTEAD FARMERS CO-OPERATIVE WYOMING, Ontario, Dec. 19, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Wanstead Farmers Co-operative Co., Limited announced it will pay $120,000 in patronage to be shared with its more than 500 farmer-owners.

MISSISSAUGA, Ontario and SACRAMENTO, Calif., Dec. 11, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bee Vectoring Technologies International Inc. (the \"Company\" or \"BVT\") (TSXV: BEE) (OTCQB: BEVVF) today announced that it has filed an international patent application for the latest version of its honeybee hive dispenser system that the Company has tested and is bringing to market. This application strengthens the patent protection for the honeybee system by building on the previously filed application (BVT Press Release March 2, 2017). This system is computer-controlled, enabling metered and uniform delivery of plant protection products to crops using commercial honeybees. This is the latest product addition to BVT's natural precision agriculture system. Patents are one of BVT's key strategies to ensure legal protection as the Company continues its post-US EPA approval commercial expansion. \"The agricultural industry is in the midst of a new green revolution, and the Company's more cost effective and highly targeted delivery systems will assist with the increased adoption of new biological compounds currently being developed to replace more chemicals. The cost to growers will be reduced as only minimal amounts of natural product is required, less than 1% of the amount used in conventional spraying, since bee vectoring enables the delivery of product to where it will do the most good, the blooms,\" says Ashish Malik, CEO of Bee Vectoring Technologies. The new honeybee system is part of BVT's growth strategy to increase its addressable market fully to include the entire estimated 2.5 million(1) commercial bee hives in the US and 91 million(2) worldwide. Leveraging both honeybee and bumblebee systems extends the Company's market reach of crops in all markets, which means the Company can address 100% of the bee vectoring market for flowering crops. This includes high volume crops such as almonds, sunflowers and apples and high value crops such as blueberries, melons, strawberries and raspberries. \"For the Company's continued commercial sales efforts in the US following the EPA approval this past summer, the initial BVT system is designed for use with bumblebee hives and is currently being marketed for crops grown east of the Rockies - where we've already announced a number of grower deal successes. This new honeybee system is critical for BVT's immediate market expansion into western US, where there are currently no commercial bumblebees approved for sale either for pollination or bee vectoring,\" adds Mr. Malik. A third of all the food we eat depends on pollinators like honeybees, and they play an essential role in global food production, where 75%(3) of commercially grown crops require pollination. Honeybees are already used to pollinate close to $20 billion(4) worth of large-acre outdoor crops in the US. In California alone, there are almost a million acres of almond trees that rely on approximately a million honeybee hives every year. This new honeybee delivery system, along with BVT's proprietary crop protection products, represents a significant market opportunity for the company with its own biological product and other partners. BVT continues to pursue an aggressive IP strategy, with over 65 patents granted worldwide and over 35 pending, including the new honeybee system. Consisting of six patent families, the patents cover North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Australia. \"Secured patents safeguard the Company's competitive advantage,\" continued Mr. Malik. \"And since most companies prefer to work with proprietary and patent-protected technologies, they allow us to develop vital partnerships with those interested in introducing our system to growers worldwide, scaling our operations quickly and efficiently.\" About . BVT, an agriculture technology company, is a market disruptor with a significant global market opportunity in the $240 billion crop protection and fertilizer market. BVT has pioneered a natural precision agriculture system that replaces chemical pesticides and wasteful plant protection product spray applications by delivering biological pesticide alternatives to crops using commercially grown bees. BVT's award-winning technology, precision vectoring, is completely harmless to bees and allows minute amounts of naturally-derived pesticides (called biologicals) to be delivered directly to blooms, providing improved crop protection and yield results than traditional chemical pesticides - and improving the health of the soil, the microbiome and the environment. Currently, BVT has over 65 granted patents, over 35 patents pending in all major agricultural countries worldwide, and has US EPA registration of its VECTORITE(tm) with CR-7 (EPA Registration No. 90641-2) for sale as a registered biological fungicide for use on the labeled crops.

So much so that each of them eats an average of 253 eggs annually - an increase of about 68eggsperpersonoverthelastdecade.Baked, hard-boiled, poached, scrambled, or fried - we just can't get enough, and for good reason. Eggs are kitchen staples that are convenient, versatile, andpackedwithnutrition. Interestingly enough,they'realsoeco-friendly! While the demand is growing and egg farmers need to produce more eggs to meet the Canadiantasteforeggs, their environmental footprintisdecreasing.Andit'spossible because sustainability is a core tenant of the egg industry. Sustain ability as a core value The Canadian egg industry has responded remarkably to the growing demand for eggs. Between 1962 and 2012, eggproductionincreasedby50percent,andduring this same time the industry also managed to achievea50percentreductionofitsenvironmental footprint. Canadian egg farmers now produce 68 percent fewer greenhouse gas emissions and use 81 percent less land, 41 percent less energy, and 69 percent less water. What has driven such impressive results? \"It's a combination of every input that goes in,\" says Tim Lambert,CEO of Egg Farmers of Canada.He says that every thing from the genetics of the hens to their diets to hen housing advancements and better health management has played a role.\"Our farmers have been able to invest in new technologies which help them be more efficient,\" says Lambert. That includes initiatives like solar and wind tur bine-powered farms, precision agriculture, and smart barns that monitor egg output from individual hens, optimal lighting levels, and temperature. \"Sustain ability has always been part of our DNA,\" says Lambert. \"We'reavery progressive industry.\" Quality assurance The egg industry's commitment to sustain ability matters to Canadians, who are increasingly interested in knowing where their food comes from and how its production is affecting the environment. \"People can buy Canadian eggs knowing that this is an industry dedicated to minimizing our impact on the environment while producing to the highest possible standards of food safety, quality, and animal welfare,\" says Lambert. \"They can buy our products and feed their families knowing that we care about the same things they do.\" Continuing innovations Dr.Nathan Pelletier,Egg Farmers of Canada's Research Chair in Sustain ability and Industrial Research Chair for the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) has spent over a decade researching the science of sustain ability. He recently conducted a benchmark study using lifecycle analysis. \"Essentially, I look at the system of egg production as a whole,\"he explains. His research has yielded encouraging data on the industry's sustain ability.\"Farms are increasingly well-managed and the hens are becoming increasingly efficient,living longer, and having fewer health issues.This improves the efficiency all the way back along the supply chain,\" he says. Dr. Pelletier's current research is focused on developing a farm-level sustain ability assessment tool that individual farmers can use to calculate their environmental footprint. They will also be able to compare it against benchmarks from other farmers in their region. \"It's taking a huge body of research and complex models and distilling this information into a practical tool that can be on the desktop of every Canadian egg farmer,\" he says. In its ongoing efforts at innovation and its impressive sustain ability achievements, the Canadian egg industry has created a model that works for Canadians now and into the future."}, {"title": "Digging Deeper: Dirt Is Part of Our Climate Change Solution", "article": "The trouble with soil is that it's just not sexy. In fact, it's downright plain, unremarkable, and messy. Most people think it's simply a mixture of broken rocks and minerals. But soil is so much more than that. Healthy soil is full of living organisms and quite the environmental workhorse in the benefits it provides to us all. Let's start with biodiversity Soil contains one quarter of the Earth's biodivers ity. One hectare of soil can include 2.5 million earthworms, trillions of fungi, bacteria, and protozoa, and billions of arthropods and algae. That's a lot of biodiversity for 2.5 acres of dirt. Then there's soil carbon sequestration Agricultural land sits on large stocks of stored carbon and has the potential to sequester more ca rbon, unlike most other sectors. Granted, grow ing crops contributes to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from fertilizers, manure, and tillage. However, with the adoption of Best Management Practices, crop rotation and cover crops, rota tional grazing, precision agriculture, and no-till practices, there have been significant increases in soil carbon storage over time. Consequently, GHG emissions on Canadian croplands have sharply declined since the 1990s. So, let's keep the carbon in the soil and out of the air. Finally, regenerative agriculture provides the whole package The regenerative agriculture system improves soil health, reduces GHG emissions, and increases the carbon content of soils. This is because of the system's best practices, which drive carbon into the soil and keep it there. The resulting car- bon-enriched soils are healthier, demonstrating better resilience to extreme weather, improved water permeability, increased microbial divers ity, higher yields, lower input requirements, and more nutritious harvests - all of which improve the land and the farmer's bottom line while miti gating climate change. At the Canadian Agri-Food Policy Institute (CAPI), we're leading the way in developing policy options to improve soil health and maintain nat ural capital so that agricultu re can contribute even more as a solution provider to climate change. Throughout history, civilizations have pros pered or declined as a function of the availability and productivity of t heir soils, and now t he very soil we walk on offers us, as well, the possibility of saving the planet from global warming.

These producers will be using Bee Vectoring's proprietary bee delivery system and U.S. EPA-registered product, Vectorite with CR-7, on their blueberry crops. The blueberry growers will be using Bee Vectoring on an estimated 500 combined acres of conventional and organic fields for the 2020 blueberry season in Georgia, where blooming starts in February. Blooming marks the beginning of the blueberry season, when the Bee Vectoring system is used, but crop season continues until harvest, which occurs in the spring and summer. All but one grower are first-time users, who will be piloting Bee Vectoring on a small percentage of their total acreage with the expectation that they will progressively add Bee Vectoring across their entire operations over two to three seasons. The growers farm on a combined total of about 1,500 acres. \"The company's growth strategy in the blueberry market consists of three key activities: initial market penetration, customer retention and expansion through exceptional customer service, and leveraging the initial experiences to gain new customers,\" said Ashish Malik, chief executive officer of Bee Vectoring Technologies. \"Currently in Georgia, the company is focused on closing deals with growers that are prominent early adopters of new technologies in their communities, and these initial growers are all key influencers. Over time through delivery of exceptional experiences, BVT expects adoption of its system to increase to 100 per cent of these farmers' acres through building loyalty and positive word of mouth. Lastly, the company continues to on board new, additional growers as we move closer to the next growing season. This is the strategy that will be executed in each region, as the growing season progresses geographically across the [United States]. \"Historically, growers start by using BVT on 10 to 20 per cent of their acreage, and within three years, they usually progress to 100 per cent. In alignment with the company's strategy, these growers were chosen because they are highly influential. While their initial 500 acres can grow to 1,500 acres in a couple of years, we expect other growers in Georgia will take notice and adopt the BVT system in the near future. This will increase the company's overall market share across the state through new customer adoptions while also increasing BVT's share of the wallet with these initial growers,\" continued Mr. Malik. Blueberries flourish in North America from April through October, and imports from South America stock grocery shelves from October to March. North American consumers love blueberries and drive demand all year long (1). The state of Georgia grows 15,000 acres of cultivated blueberries, which are only about 17 per cent of the 90,000 (2) acres cultivated nationwide across the U.S. \"With U.S. EPA approval completed this past summer, the opportunity for the company to capture significant U.S. market share in blueberry cultivation is just starting,\" said Mr. Malik. Bee Vectoring's natural precision agriculture system uses biological pesticide alternatives delivered directly to blueberry flowers by commercially raised bees, increasing yields by up to 29 per cent (3), enhancing disease protection, and reducing the use of water and fossil fuels -- all with a fraction of the product required for traditional spray applications. \"Blueberries are grown all over North America, with different growing seasons based on local weather, which gives BVT the runway to cement even more deals soon,\" continued Mr. Malik. \"Next, the company is expanding its sales efforts to the Pacific Northwest and Michigan, where the season is about to start, and we are expecting multiple new order commitments over the next several weeks.\" Michigan, Oregon and Washington have a combined 45,000 (4) acres of cultivated highbush blueberries. The three states represent 50 per cent of the U.S. market, of which the 90,000 acres nationwide are about 30 per cent of the 270,000 (5) acres of highbush blueberries cultivated worldwide.

According to news reporting originating from Ottawa, Canada, by VerticalNews correspondents, research stated, \"Remote sensing has been recognized as a cost-effective way to detect the spatial and temporal variability of crop growth and productivity. In this study, multispectral RapidEye images were used to delineate homogeneous zones of soil and crop development in two fields in Ontario, Canada, one planted with canola (Brassica napus L.) and the other with spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.).\" Financial supporters for this research include AgriFlex project of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Canadian Space Agency, Northern Ontario Heritage Fund Corporation of Canada. Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from Ottawa Research and Development Centre, \"The two fields received different levels of nitrogen (N) treatments during the pre-planting land preparation phase. Soil textures, mineral nitrogen content and crop yield were used to interpret the results of zone delineation. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests revealed that the high-resolution RapidEye data, particularly the imagery acquired at peak crop growth stages (i.e. when leaf area index (LAI) is high), provided valuable information for delineating within-field variability of crop growth and yield. Further analysis showed that for both crops, the spatial patterns of crop growth condition varied throughout the growth cycle, revealing different impacts of soil properties and N fertilization on the crops. In particular, during peak growth stage, the within-field variability was most strongly affected by the pre-planting N application and had the strongest correlation with crop yield.\" According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"These results suggest that high-resolution satellite data (e.g., RapidEye) could assist in making decisions on optimal N fertilization for enhanced crop productivity.\" The news editors report that additional information may be obtained by contacting J.L.

Phase 2 field studies on three of those products will commence shortly. The goal of the project is to open new market opportunities and fast-track additional revenue for Bee Vectoring. Because these microbial candidate products control a different spectrum of crop pests than Bee Vectoring's proprietary Clonostachys rosea strain CR-7, they can be used on their own in crops where pests controlled by CR-7 are not present, or along with CR-7 on crops that have multiple pests affecting the flower area. Adding third party products to existing CR-7 applications is achieved by stacking two or more microbes together, a practice already common in seed treatment applications. Using the new products on new crops creates additional revenue streams and will increase revenue from crops that already use CR-7. As part of the company's in-licensing project, the products were initially lab tested for compatibility with its formulation of Vectorite powder and its beneficial microbe CR-7, and to evaluate if commercial bumblebees could carry the spores of the micro-organisms directly to plant blooms. Based on favourable results, Bee Vectoring has shortlisted three of the products to be used in the coming field studies. \"Moving to phase 2 trials with three products is a significant step forward in allowing BVT to develop multiple revenue streams,\" said Ashish Malik, chief executive officer of Bee Vectoring Technologies. \"The products are all commercially available and are already registered in either the [United States] or the European Union. The partner companies are keen to see how effectively their products can be distributed through our highly efficient and environmentally friendly delivery system. Phase 2 tests will be done in 2020, with results expected in the summer.\" Continued Mr. Malik: \"Growers will see multiple diseases and pests addressed through this highly efficient, stacked system for precision agriculture application. These product extensions will help BVT significantly increase its share of the $20-billion market for bee vectoring, foliar application and seed treatment.\" Through Bee Vectoring's delivery system, the third party biologicals will control these crop issues in a much more precise and natural way compared with traditional spray application methods. Bee Vectoring's natural precision agriculture system uses commercially managed bees to carry product directly to blooms (the process of bee vectoring), which means less waste and much higher efficiency. Growers would benefit in terms of crop protection and yield, and further reduce the chemical pesticides they use through traditional spray applications. An additional benefit includes using much less product and therefore recognize cost savings, since bee vectoring uses only a fraction (typically less than 2 per cent) of what is required with spraying. In bee vectoring, one or more biostimulants, plant amendments and biological controls (biocontrols) are formulated with Vectorite ingredients to create a layered powder mixture that bees pick up on their way out of the hive and deliver right to plant blooms. The flower is the primary entry point for many diseases and insects, making the bloom the ideal place for active ingredients to inoculate the plant. With bee vectoring, protection products are continually (and naturally) delivered throughout the bloom period -- far more precisely than intermittent spraying, which can miss some blooms entirely. Stacking multiple protection products also means growers can further reduce water consumption and the use of fossil fuels (by eliminating even more spraying), making the Bee Vectoring system an option that checks two major boxes: excellent plant protection for increased yields that are good for business, and an environmentally friendly, non-toxic solution that is good for consumers and the planet.

But what if scientists could train computers to precisely analyze digital images of plants and routinely identify traits related to plant growth, health, resilience and yield? Crop breeders would be able to more efficiently introduce new, improved varieties, and producers would have the information they need to make reliable crop management decisions (such as how much fertilizer and pesticide to use) during key growth stages to improve yield or respond to environmental changes. This transformation is underway through innovative research at the University of Saskatchewan (USask). Computer scientists are teaming up with plant scientists, remote sensing specialists and crop breeders to apply machine learning techniques to plant breeding, with a focus on wheat, canola and lentils. \"Science has generated lots of information about the genetics of plants, but tying genes to specific plant traits is the next big challenge,\" says USask computer scientist Ian Stavness, who leads the team creating new image analysis tools for identifying desired plant traits (phenotypes) linked to specific DNA variations. Brought together through the university's Plant Phenotyping and Imaging Research Centre (P2IRC) at the Global Institute for Food Security, the team is one of only half a dozen in the world doing this type of cutting-edge \"computational agriculture\" work. \"With enough information to breed for specific traits, such as higher yield or resistance to drought, crop breeders can adapt quickly to changing climatic conditions,\" he says. \"And if we give farmers better information, then they will be able to grow better crops. A lot of farmers have started to own drones to provide images of their crops, but the issue is: How do you get useful information out of these images?\" Part of the answer is a new software program the team has developed called Deep Plant Phenomics, a reference to both digital phenotyping and \"deep learning,\" a class of machine learning techniques. Through the software program, a computer can \"learn\" to recognize an object or a specific pattern within a set of data derived from drone, sensor or satellite images of crops - similar to what recognition software programs can do for human facial features. \"This deep learning software program is a neural network that can be trained by giving it a number of examples,\" he says. Once trained and presented with new images, the computer can then analyze thousands or even millions of images to \"predict\" how many wheat heads are in a plot of wheat, how many plants have emerged within a canola plot or how many leaves there are on a canola plant, to cite just a few examples. Leaf number is important in determining a plant's developmental rate and when it will flower. How well does the automated approach of machine learning using the new software program compare with manual trait identification in predicting these key crop indicators? \"The software program is about as good as manually counting, and of course it saves a lot of manual work,\" says Dr. Stavness. \"The data we are producing at P2IRC - the images combined with phenotypic information - constitutes some of the largest and most specific datasets that exist in the world for plant breeders.\" For USask wheat breeder Curtis Pozniak, who monitors tens of thousands of university research plots across the province, the new software program gives him additional information to improve the precision of selection, reducing site visits and aiding crop development decision-making. Similarly, USask plant breeder Kirstin Bett is applying the new tools to lentil breeding, and Sally Vail, a research scientist at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, is using them in canola breeding. Key plant trait data is recorded through sophisticated non-invasive imaging. Steve Shirtliffe, a USask plant scientist whose research includes state-of-the-art applications of drones for imaging crops, is identifying new plant traits that were previously impossible to measure. The research is starting to benefit farmers. \"The main benefit so far is that farmers are getting new types of canola and wheat that will produce higher yields in a wider range of growing conditions,\" says Dr. Stavness. \"Eventually these same datasets and analysis techniques could be used by farmers who use drones to look at the health of their crops and influence how they manage them during each growing season.\" While some companies provide information such as how healthy crop fields are, the team's work \"provides more precise information down to the specific plant, such as how each individual plant is doing,\" Dr. Stavness says. His team has also developed another software program, PlotVision, which makes it easier for breeders and scientists to get images of individual plots from aerial images captured by drones. The tools have been demonstrated in the computer lab, and efforts are underway to build knowledge among potential users. \"We are on a push to make these open-source tools available around the world,\" says Dr. Stavness. \"We think our research has a bigger impact if it doesn't just sit on the shelf but is used by plant scientists both regionally and in other parts of the world.\" The P2IRC research program is funded by a $37.2-million federal Canada First Research Excellence Fund awarded to USask in 2015. \"We would not be doing this valuable research without this funding,\" says Dr. Stavness. The team of 10 faculty and six software developers also involves 14 graduate students and two postdoctoral fellows. \"We're training some of the next generation of computer scientists who can work in the agricultural sector,\" says Dr. Stavness, who has a PhD in computer engineering and completed post-doctoral work at Stanford University in bioengineering. \"Many agricultural companies will need to bring in highly trained people, and we're definitely training the top people in the world to do data analytics in agriculture for breeding and precision agriculture.\" P2IRC program director Andy Sharpe, who helped sequence the genome for bread wheat, says P2IRC is leading the way in Canada and beyond in the areas of plant phenotyping and imaging. \"The collaborative nature of our work across so many disciplines and our partnerships with academia, government, industry and international development organizations are paving the way for the discovery of new technologies that will contribute to food security in Saskatchewan and around the world.\""}, {"title": "BEE Bee Vectoring arranges $1M special warrant offering", "article": "Bee Vectoring Technologies International Inc (TSX-V:BEE) Shares Issued 78,899,829 Last Close 11/21/2019 $0.435 Thursday November 21 2019 - News Release Mr. Ashish Malik reports BEE VECTORING TECHNOLOGIES ANNOUNCES SUPPLEMENTARY NON-BROKERED PRIVATE PLACEMENT OF SPECIAL WARRANTS Bee Vectoring Technologies International Inc. has arranged a supplementary non-brokered private placement of up to 2,857,143 special warrants at a price of 35 cents per special warrant for gross aggregate proceeds of up to $1-million.

Multiple Florida strawberry growers, including a second top-tier producer to adopt the technology, will be using the system on a combined 150 acres of conventional and organic fields. New product launches in the agriculture industry are often done through an allocation process to make sure the supply chain can adequately service the growers' needs. The company plans its allocation on a forecast of the hives that it expects to sell and service with the Bee Vectoring system in a specific region, for a specific crop and for each bloom season. These plans ensure the company is able to professionally service and support the growers' adoption of its groundbreaking new system, giving it the best chance to retain the customer in future growing seasons. \"Having recently received U.S. EPA approval, we want to ensure success in this initial commercial phase of our operations,\" said Ashish Malik, chief executive officer of Bee Vectoring Technologies. \"With carefully planned allocations, we prevent shortages and can confidently fill orders and service the growers well, creating exceptional experiences that build loyalty and word of mouth.\" Bee Vectoring planned this particular allocation and ordered the bee hives more than 12 weeks in advance and prior to receiving EPA approval. The lead time is required to allow its commercial bumble bee supplier partners to grow the hives to maturity to ensure strong, healthy bees are available to pollinate blooms for the current strawberry season. Florida fields are planted in October, and the plants start to bloom in late November. The hives with the Bee Vectoring system are carefully timed to coincide with that blooming period. They will be in place on growers' fields starting in late November. Strawberry producers in Florida do not have it easy. While the Florida production window is traditionally from December through March, an increase in strawberry imports from Mexico in recent years during March is further shortening this window and putting both pricing and profit pressure on them. The Bee Vectoring system is allowing growers to maximize disease protection while increasing yields and quality during this tightening window, which increases their market competitiveness. \"Florida growers can use all the help they can get to increase yields and combat disease, and that's where BVT comes into play,\" said Mr. Malik. \"December and January are the most critical months for them. It's when the price of strawberries is highest and so is the opportunity to generate profit. That's when they want to maximize yields, and BVT is helping them do that. \"With the growing demand, we expect that allocations for the Florida strawberry market will be forecasted progressively higher for future seasons,\" continued Mr. Malik. \"Our team continues to make strong inroads within our second commercial crop market in blueberries. We look forward to sharing additional news over the next several weeks.\" Bee Vectoring's natural precision agriculture system uses commercially managed bees to carry its all-natural plant protection product, Vectorite with CR-7, directly to blooms. The system increases yield and protects against disease while using only a fraction of the product required with traditional spray applications. For producers using the Bee Vectoring system, water consumption and use of fossil fuels are significantly reduced as well, making it an option that checks two major boxes: excellent plant protection for increased yields that is good for business and an environmentally friendly, non-toxic solution that is good for consumers and the planet.

And Mark Twain is credited with saying that you should never let the truth get in the way of a good story. But when you get into the midst of an election campaign, or engage on social media or want to capture a slogan for a bumper sticker, two things inevitably happen: matters get oversimplified, and the full truth is the first casualty. This is a particular problem when talking about agriculture in the context of the climate change discussion. Globally, agriculture has been blamed as a major contributor to the planet's warming climate. In the United Nations'Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) recent Special Report on Climate Change and Land (SRCCL), also known as the Special Report on Climate Change, Desertification, Land Degradation, Sustainable Land Management, Food Security and Greenhouse Gas Fluxes in Terrestrial Ecosystems, it states that farming around the world contributes 23 per cent of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Similarly, the recent EAT Lancet Report argues that a plantbased diet will save the planet because cutting out meat will reduce the GHGs from livestock production. These sound like convincing arguments. Unfortunately, they are also a significant over-simplification of agriculture's role in climate change that are not, particularly in the Canadian case, supported by facts. For example, the 23 per cent of the global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reported by the IPCC report includes activities beyond just agricultural production, such as forestry and other land uses. In its new report Efficient Agriculture as a GHG Solutions Provider, the Canadian Agri-Food Policy Institute (CAPI) describes how current agricultural practices are improving Canada's environmental footprint and can help agriculture be a \"solutions-provider\" for climate change. Canada only contributes between 1.5 to 1.7 per cent to global GHGs. Since our agriculture emissions account for about 8.4 per cent of the Canadian total, less than 0.2 per cent of the world's GHG emissions come from Canadian agriculture. Second, Canadian agriculture is super-efficient in terms of producing food with a modest environmental footprint. For example, Canada is in the top 10 per cent of the most GHG-efficient livestock producers in the world. This effort has seen emissions from Canadian livestock production drop by 11 per cent since 2000, and soil organic carbon sequestered in Canadian soils increase by 40 per cent. These improvements have been achieved through basic changes like zero-tillage, crop rotations, cover crops and 4R fertilizer application. Canadian farmers have adopted more advanced innovations too, like new livestock genetics, increased feed efficiencies for beef and dairy cattle, precision agriculture allowing variable rate applications of fertilizers and crop protection products, and improved plant genetics that produce higher yields with similar or lower levels of inputs. There has been an increased awareness of the role of soil health in improving both crop and animal yields and in reducing agriculture's impact on the environment. As well, in improving environmental outcomes, one must keep in mind agriculture's important role in enhancing biodiversity, improving water, soil and air quality and the role that livestock plays in maintaining natural spaces and species. The rise in the number of farmers practicing regenerative agriculture is a sign of further improvements to come. And we are continuing to innovate to become more efficient in production, processing and waste reduction. Rather than Canada reducing our food production and depending on the world for our food, the world would benefit from coming to Canada for efficiently produced, safe and nutritious food. This also sets us to be global leaders in agricultural environmental initiatives. By sharing with the world the technologies and best practices that have helped Canadian farms operate more efficiently, we can help other countries reduce their emissions. So when it comes to throwing agriculture under the bus - or the food truck for that matter - let's not oversimplify. Agriculture and food production is essential for our country and for the world. Canadian agriculture not only produces safe, nutritious and affordable food, it is also part of the solution for dealing with some very difficult global issues like climate change, the preservation of biodiversity and natural landscapes and managing the health of our soil, water and air. So before you stop eating meat or you retweet that tweet that proposes that food production is the baddie in the climate change dialogue, consider that such responses might be just a little too simplistic. If you look at the facts, Canadian agriculture today is a hightech industry that takes seriously its role in providing solutions to environmental challenges while meeting basic human needs. It's that simple, but no simpler.

The program was applied for and will be led by Destination Greater Victoria, who received significant support this past spring during the application process. Supporting contributions to this initiative included CRFAIR (Capital Region Food and Agriculture Initiatives Roundtable). This program will have both a leisure marketing component to drive travellers, and also a capacity building and training component to help industries who are interested to learn about and prepare to meet the demand for the very lucrative conference and incentive travel business segment. For example, representative companies that reflect this burgeoning agri-tourism industry include Country Bee Honey Farm (countrybeehoney.ca), 10 Acres Farms & Restaurants (10acres.ca/bistro) and the Fickle Fig Farm Market (theficklefig.ca). We have spent the last several years examining issues specific to the manufacturing sector on the Peninsula, includuing affordable workforce housing, skilled trades and transportation options. I will focus numerous upcoming articles examining agri-tourism, the exciting and burgeoning new industry sector on the Peninsula, understanding and explaining what they do and how these advocacy issues impact their operations.

AGRIS Stoney Point joins AGRIS Cottam, FS PARTNERS, Thompsons Kent Bridge, and Setteringtons as part of the growing list of agri-retailers in Ontario to achieve 4R Certified status. The 4R Nutrient Stewardship Certification Program is a voluntary program that certifies nutrient service providers across Ontario that apply or make recommendations on fertilizers in accordance with 4R Nutrient Stewardship principles, using the Right Source of nutrients at the Right Rate, at the Right Time and in the Right Place. Program participants must go through an independent, third-party audit of 37 standards to demonstrate they not only understand 4R principles, but also follow them. \"Fertilizer Canada congratulates AGRIS Co-operatives continued commitment to the growing number of service providers in Ontario becoming 4R Certified, providing the highest standard of nutrient management advice to their grower customers,\" said Garth Whyte, President & CEO of Fertilizer Canada. \"The Certification process offers us the opportunity to capture acres managed under 4R Nutrient Stewardship, thus quantifying the industry's commitment to sustainable agriculture solutions.\" AGRIS Stoney Point is prepared to provide their grower customers with proven 4R best management practice (BMP) advice to both maximize their customers financial resources and create long-term positive impacts on water bodies associated with agricultural production areas. \"While all of our AGRIS locations continue to work towards certification, AGRIS is proud of the efforts of our Essex County team to lead our organization in becoming 4R Certified,\" says Jim Campbell, General Manager of AGRIS Co-operative. \"We are also pleased with the broader industry support of this initiative, demonstrating Ontario agricultures commitment to nutrient stewardship,\" added Campbell. 4R Certified retailers are equipped to provide a value-added service to growers, as 4R Nutrient Stewardship is scientifically proven to improve yields and economic return while minimizing environmental impacts such as greenhouse gases and losses to water. For example, research funded by the North American 4R Research Fund has shown that growers in Ontario can reduce phosphorus run off by 60 per cent by applying 4R BMPs. Farmland managed by 4R Certified retailers is counted towards Fertilizer Canada's goal of verifying acres under 4R Nutrient Stewardship, which quantifies the advancement of sustainable agriculture in Ontario and Canada as a whole. There are currently 29 retail sites in Ontario that have completed a 4R Certification pre-audit and are on track to become fully 4R Certified in the next year. The 4R Certification Program is funded and guided by a 4R Ontario Steering Committee comprised of a diverse set of stakeholders from industry, government, conservation authorities and grower organizations including Fertilizer Canada, the Ontario Agri Business Association (OABA), Grain Farmers of Ontario (GFO), the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA), the Ontario Federation of Agriculture (OFA) and the Christian Farmers Federation of Ontario (CFFO) and Conservation Ontario. AGRIS Co-operative Ltd. is a 100 per-cent farmer-owned grain marketing and farm-input supply company that serves more than 1,000 farmer owners in 14 locations in Essex, Kent, Elgin, Middlesex and Lambton Counties. It is a leader in precision farming technology, seed, agronomy and petroleum services. The co-operative is a partner of Great Lakes Grain, a grain merchandising company.

The communications industry will play a pivotal role in bringing these prospects to light.\" As Canada gets closer to national 5G deployments, the report reveals the estimated economic impact will reach $40 billion of annual GDP uplift by 2026, with 250,000 permanent jobs added to the economy in the same timeframe. The report examines key benefits likely to be realized in these select use case deployments, including: *Transportation & Mobility: large-scale smart traffic management applications. *Precision Agriculture: innovation technologies for crop and soil management. *Energy Management: smart grid sensor densification and smart street lighting. *Rural Connectivity: efficient broadband rollout to underserved areas. \"It's exciting to watch as the advantages of 5G technology come to life in ways that will benefit all Canadians, regardless of whether they are living in urban or rural areas of our country,\" said Robert Ghiz, President & CEO of CWTA. \"Many people assume that new network technology will only benefit residents and businesses in our largest cities, however this report shows that this is clearly not the case. The examples explored in the study prove that 5G has the potential to improve everyone's quality of life, no matter where they live or work. So long as government policies encourage investment in wireless infrastructure and boost collaboration with communications providers, we will see 5G wireless services make a positive difference in the lives of all Canadians.\" The report details the role that the Canadian government can play in accelerating 5G deployment across Canada  by encouraging innovation in advanced technologies, supporting investment in wireless infrastructure, and enabling collaboration with the communications industry in deploying innovative use cases.

A fire in 1989 destroyed three banquet buildings but new ownership in 2004 renovated the property and added a farmers'market that attracted dozens of small business vendors. Durham Properties purchased it in 2012, but while negotiations were underway for its sale to Capexco another fire swept through the buildings in early 2017 and they were all lost. But the sale went through and Capexco, a Calgary-based real estate developer, principal investor and asset manager, has since been planning not only to resurrect the popular farmers'market but also develop the entire 12.5-hectare site area with a master plan that will include residential, commercial, office and park use. Located in a huge growth corridor north of Sage Hill and part of the new Glacier Ridge community, at build-out it can accommodate 1,540 residential units, 350,000 square feet of office/institutional space and over 200,000 square feet of retail/commercial. Not a task for the faint of heart but the principals of the company have lots of experience and currently are also developing a major mixed-use project on the northern outskirts of San Diego, negotiating to purchase a heritage building in the city's downtown core and building an 18,000-square-foot retail centre in Orange County. Executive chair and founding shareholder of Capexco, Dave Hall, has 15 years of active experience in real estate and was general partner of a 55,000-squarefoot hospitality development in Canmore. President Marco DeDominicis includes in his work experience 30 years in commercial concrete cast-andplace and residential formwork, and CEO Trent Claughton has been a founder, principal or partner for a number of successful investment and financial services companies across North America and Europe. The new Symons Valley Ranch is earmarked as a community activity centre and in seeking to preserve the site's ranching and agricultural legacy will raise the awareness of how food and nutrition play such an important part in our well-being. Land use has been approved by the City of Calgary and the next step will be to apply for a development permit to begin construction of the new farmers'market that is designed as a 40,000-square-foot food hall on a walkable high street, supporting local ranching and agricultural jobs. Part of a Sustainable Economic Evolution District vision the market will complement Capexco's plan to attract academic and research institutions, agri-sciences and health services companies in a business campus that will also include mainstream office and retail. Claughton has been collaborating with Chris Paterson, Xarvio Digital Farming Solutions lead for North America at BASF, who feels the Symons Valley Ranch development could be a real plus for Calgary. \"We have the best concentration of agricultural companies in North America,\" he says. \"Symons Valley is well located within easy reach of Olds College, the international airport and lots of farmers; an innovative cluster of companies involved in agricultural research and development would be a great boost.\" The vibrant innovation hub will also offer a variety of housing choices allowing the future workforce to reside within the community. DeDominicis and Claughton have spent a lot of time touring like developments in southern California and throughout the U.S. in search of the best community enhancement development ideas for their Symons Valley concept. An example of their findings will see a parkade structure hidden between multi-family and office buildings and the village shops and farmers'market that will be a pedestrian-only area. Capexco has contracted the local commercial real estate firms of Roman Real Estate and Schell Brothers Real Estate to bring in development partners for the commercial and high-density residential components of the exciting project. Wrapped around the new market, Symons Valley Ranch is destined to become a vibrant and energetic community where people can come to live, work, play and celebrate health, wellness and how food gets from farm to table.

And Mark Twain is credited with saying that you should never let the truth get in the way of a good story. But when you get into the midst of an election campaign, or engage on social media or want to capture a slogan for a bumper sticker, two things inevitably happen: matters get oversimplified, and the full truth is the first casualty. This is a particular problem when talking about agriculture in the context of the climate change discussion. Globally, agriculture has been blamed as a major contributor to the planet's warming climate. In the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) recent Special Report on Climate Change and Land (SRCCL), also known as the Special Report on Climate Change, Desertification, Land Degradation, Sustainable Land Management, Food Security and Greenhouse Gas Fluxes in Terrestrial Ecosystems, it states that farming around the world contributes 23 per cent of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Similarly, the recent EAT Lancet Report argues that a plant-based diet will save the planet because cutting out meat will reduce the GHGs from livestock production. These sound like convincing arguments. Unfortunately, they are also a significant over-simplification of agriculture's role in climate change that are not, particularly in the Canadian case, supported by facts. For example, the 23 per cent of the global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reported by the IPCC report includes activities beyond just agricultural production, such as forestry and other land uses. In its new report Efficient Agriculture as a GHG Solutions Provider, the Canadian Agri-Food Policy Institute (CAPI) describes how current agricultural practices are improving Canada's environmental footprint and can help agriculture be a \"solutions-provider\" for climate change. Canada only contributes between 1.5 to 1.7 per cent to global GHGs. Since our agriculture emissions account for about 8.4 per cent of the Canadian total, less than 0.2 per cent of the world's GHG emissions come from Canadian agriculture. Second, Canadian agriculture is super-efficient in terms of producing food with a modest environmental footprint. For example, Canada is in the top 10 per cent of the most GHG-efficient livestock producers in the world. This effort has seen emissions from Canadian livestock production drop by 11 per cent since 2000, and soil organic carbon sequestered in Canadian soils increase by 40 per cent. These improvements have been achieved through basic changes like zero-tillage, crop rotations, cover crops and 4R fertilizer application. Canadian farmers have adopted more advanced innovations too, like new livestock genetics, increased feed efficiencies for beef and dairy cattle, precision agriculture allowing variable rate applications of fertilizers and crop protection products, and improved plant genetics that produce higher yields with similar or lower levels of inputs. There has been an increased awareness of the role of soil health in improving both crop and animal yields and in reducing agriculture's impact on the environment. As well, in improving environmental outcomes, one must keep in mind agriculture's important role in enhancing biodiversity, improving water, soil and air quality and the role that livestock plays in maintaining natural spaces and species. The rise in the number of farmers practicing regenerative agriculture is a sign of further improvements to come. And we are continuing to innovate to become more efficient in production, processing and waste reduction. Rather than Canada reducing our food production and depending on the world for our food, the world would benefit from coming to Canada for efficiently produced, safe and nutritious food. This also sets us to be global leaders in agricultural environmental initiatives. By sharing with the world the technologies and best practices that have helped Canadian farms operate more efficiently, we can help other countries reduce their emissions. So when it comes to throwing agriculture under the bus - or the food truck for that matter - let's not oversimplify. Agriculture and food production is essential for our country and for the world. Canadian agriculture not only produces safe, nutritious and affordable food, it is also part of the solution for dealing with some very difficult global issues like climate change, the preservation of biodiversity and natural landscapes and managing the health of our soil, water and air. So before you stop eating meat or you retweet that tweet that proposes that food production is the baddie in the climate change dialogue, consider that such responses might be just a little too simplistic.

Blueberries represent the second crop that the company has penetrated into commercially. These two new deals follow closely behind Bee Vectoring's recently announced commercial deal with a top-tier grower in the strawberry market. BVT is currently in discussions with more than 10 additional blueberry growers in Georgia, as well as in other blueberry growing regions, and is expecting additional order commitments over the next several weeks. \"The blueberry market push for BVT has been very well received since we received our U.S. EPA approval,\" said Ashish Malik, chief executive officer of Bee Vectoring Technologies. \"We are progressing very well, executing on our commercialization strategy, and we're excited to have these two growers as our first partners in the blueberry market, building on the momentum we are seeing in the strawberry market. We look forward to announcing further updates as we progress toward the late winter and early spring blueberry season, which starts in Florida in January and February, and then expands to Georgia, North Carolina, New Jersey, Michigan, reaching the Pacific Northwest states of Oregon and Washington in April and May.\" The two signed blueberry growers will be using Bee Vectoring on a combined 250 acres of conventional fields for the coming 2020 season. In conventional fields for commercial crops, growers traditionally use only spray applications of chemical pesticides for disease control. The addition of Bee Vectoring's natural precision agriculture system, which uses biological pesticide alternatives delivered directly to blueberry flowers by commercially grown bees, is expected to increase yield and protection against disease while using a fraction of the product required with traditional spray applications. Water consumption and use of fossil fuels are also significantly reduced for producers using the Bee Vectoring system. It is a proven approach that benefits crops, growers and consumers: In a 2019 open field demo in Georgia, using Bee Vectoring increased yield by 29 per cent on a high-bush blueberry crop. Bee Vectoring's naturally derived fungicide, otherwise known as a biological, helps with disease and pest control in both low- and high-bush blueberry crops, improving crop yields through better pollination, offering greater fruit set (more berries per stem) and bigger berries. For this coming season, one of the contracted blueberry growers will adopt Bee Vectoring on 100 per cent of their fields, after trials on progressively larger sections in past seasons. The second grower is a first-time user this season, adopting Bee Vectoring on 25 per cent of its acreage to start. As is typical with growers, it plans to progressively add Bee Vectoring to its entire operations over two to three seasons. \"Our sales strategy allows for controlled, progressive adoption, with highly trained personnel, who build grower confidence and ensure an exemplary experience,\" continued Mr. Malik. \"In past seasons, we've observed that growers initially adopt BVT on a small fraction of their fields. Once they see the successful results in disease control and improved yields, they'll commonly expand to a greater portion of their farm in the second season and reach full adoption by the third. Neighbouring growers also frequently end up placing orders. So, when we get sales commitments this early in the adoption cycle, we are very pleased because we anticipate a multiplicative effect in future seasons.\" Blueberries are a major market that is ripe for a change. A high-value commercial crop, blueberries fetch up to $18,000 (U.S.) (1) in revenue per acre. North America grows 54 per cent of the world's blueberries, with close to 300,000 acres cultivated in the United States and Canada, representing a total farm gate value of $1.1-billion (U.S.) (2). The commercial blueberry market is widespread across the two countries, with key growing regions in Washington, Oregon, Georgia, Michigan, California, North Carolina, New Jersey and Florida in the United States, and the Atlantic provinces and British Columbia in Canada.

And Mark Twain is credited with saying that you should never let the truth get in the way of a good story. But when you get into the midst of an election campaign, or engage on social media or want to capture a slogan for a bumper sticker, two things inevitably happen: matters get oversimplified, and the full truth is the first casualty. This is a particular problem when talking about agriculture in the context of the climate change discussion. Globally, agriculture has been blamed as a major contributor to the planet's warming climate. In the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) recent Special Report on Climate Change and Land (SRCCL), also known as the Special Report on Climate Change, Desertification, Land Degradation, Sustainable Land Management, Food Security and Greenhouse Gas Fluxes in Terrestrial Ecosystems, it states that farming around the world contributes 23 per cent of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Similarly, the recent EAT Lancet Report argues that a plant-based diet will save the planet because cutting out meat will reduce the GHGs from livestock production. These sound like convincing arguments. Unfortunately, they are also a significant oversimplification of agriculture's role in climate change that are not, particularly in the Canadian case, supported by facts. For example, the 23 per cent of the global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reported by the IPCC report includes activities beyond just agricultural production, such as forestry and other land uses. In its new report Efficient Agriculture as a GHG Solutions Provider, the Canadian Agri-Food Policy Institute (CAPI) describes how current agricultural practices are improving Canada's environmental footprint and can help agriculture be a \"solutions-provider\" for climate change. Canada only contributes between 1.5 to 1.7 per cent to global GHGs. Since our agriculture emissions account for about 8.4 per cent of the Canadian total, less than 0.2 per cent of the world's GHG emissions come from Canadian agriculture. Second, Canadian agriculture is superefficient in terms of producing food with a modest environmental footprint. For example, Canada is in the top 10 per cent of the most GHG-efficient livestock producers in the world. This effort has seen emissions from Canadian livestock production drop by 11 per cent since 2000, and soil organic carbon sequestered in Canadian soils increase by 40 per cent. These improvements have been achieved through basic changes like zero-tillage, crop rotations, cover crops and 4R fertilizer application. Canadian farmers have adopted more advanced innovations too, like new livestock genetics, increased feed efficiencies for beef and dairy cattle, precision agriculture allowing variable rate applications of fertilizers and crop protection products and improved plant genetics that produce higher yields with similar or lower levels of inputs. There has been an increased awareness of the role of soil health in improving both crop and animal yields and in reducing agriculture's impact on the environment. As well, in improving environmental outcomes, one must keep in mind agriculture's important role in enhancing biodiversity, improving water, soil and air quality and the role that livestock plays in maintaining natural spaces and species. The rise in the number of farmers practicing regenerative agriculture is a sign of further improvements to come. And we are continuing to innovate to become more efficient in production, processing and waste reduction. Rather than Canada reducing our food production and depending on the world for our food, the world would benefit from coming to Canada for efficiently produced, safe and nutritious food. This also sets us to be global leaders in agricultural environmental initiatives. By sharing with the world the technologies and best practices that have helped Canadian farms operate more efficiently, we can help other countries reduce their emissions. So when it comes to throwing agriculture under the bus - or the food truck for that matter - let's not oversimplify. Agriculture and food production is essential for our country and for the world. Canadian agriculture not only produces safe, nutritious and affordable food, it is also part of the solution for dealing with some very difficult global issues like climate change, the preservation of biodiversity and natural landscapes and managing the health of our soil, water and air.

Tolerance-exempted products, such as CR7, give growers an economic benefit by allowing them to capture greater value for their crop and/or by reducing the risk of an unplanned rejection with the U.S. government. Most crop protection products on the market currently do not have this exemption, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, as well as some food companies and supermarkets, regularly tests for pesticide residue levels on harvested crops. With this tolerance exemption, unlike with chemical pesticides, there is no requirement to test for residues of CR-7 on harvested crops to see if they fall under an allowable limit. Residue tests can take several days, and if a grower waits for results before shipping, it can eat into the shelf life of the produce, thus lowering the value of the crop. Alternately, if the crop is shipped without test results, the grower runs the risk of the crop being rejected if a test later shows that there was a residue exceedance. Residue tolerances (also known as maximum residue limits, or MRLs) are established for crop protection products that pose a potential hazard to human health. Products without residue testing exemptions carry a risk that anywhere along the food value chain -- wholesale distributors, market retailers, and food companies selling packaged or processed foods, as well as the end consumer -- could fall outside the safety limit in a test could lead to product rejection and recall. All these stakeholders are increasingly concerned about chemical residue on food. In short, this encourages growers to select products, such as CR-7, to apply to their crops to mitigate risk, which in turn should accelerate adoption of the Bee Vectoring system. The tolerance exemption decision applies to all registered end use products based on CR-7. This includes Vectorite with CR-7 for delivery using bees and future products currently in development by Bee Vectoring for delivery through traditional foliar spray, soil drench or seed-coating methods. The global fungicide market, which includes foliar and soil application, is currently valued at $16-billion (U.S.) (1). The global seed treatment market is valued at $7-billion (U.S.) (2) and is expected to reach $12-billion (U.S.) by 2024 (2). \"Exempting CR-7 from testing for residue tolerances underscores the safety of CR-7 and provides growers comfort that safety extends to their customers, as well as farm workers,\" said Ashish Malik, chief executive officer of Bee Vectoring Technologies. \"This additional EPA ruling will also positively impact Bee Vectoring's market expansion strategies, which include registrations in other key global markets, sprayable product formulations and uses on new crops, where having zero tolerance is a key requirement, such as in cannabis.\" The exemption applies to crops treated with CR-7 that are grown and consumed in the United States, as well as crops that are grown outside of the U.S. and subsequently imported into the country. This tolerance exemption complements the recently announced EPA approval and OMRI organic certification for Vectorite with CR-7. The company also reports that it has granted incentive stock options to certain members of the board of directors, management, staff and consultants, entitling them to purchase up to 5.65 million common shares at an exercise price of 31 cents per common share, pursuant to the company's stock option plan and subject to all regulatory approvals.

If successful, the partners expect to provide an improved, efficient, modular and readily deployable system to grow vegetables or terrestrial plants using the latest advances in precision agriculture and vertical farming. Cubicfarm is commercializing industrial-scale vertical farming systems for multiple industries worldwide. The Cubicfarm platform consists of an automated, environment-controlled system where trays of high-value crops like leafy vegetables and herbs follow a patented, undulating path that ensures ideal growing conditions. Pond has developed a growth platform for algae and terrestrial plants using proprietary lighting, controls and artificial intelligence. Pond has granted PaiGE an exclusive licence for the application and further advancement of this technology for terrestrial plants. As part of the MOU, Cubicfarm and PaiGE envisage a multiphase study to test the improvements from retrofitting the Cubicfarm system with PaiGE technology. Each phase shall compare plant growth and resource input in a PaiGE-equipped growth cube against a standard unit -- first incorporating proprietary lighting, then sensors, and finally a precision nutrient and water dosing system. In each phase, PaiGE shall provide the engineering design, co-ordinate equipment manufacturing and installation, and run and assess trials. If the trials prove successful and Cubicfarm decides to incorporate PaiGE technology into its growth cubes, Cubicfarm agrees to pay PaiGE licensing fees for its technology. PaiGE shall retain intellectual property developed by it throughout the joint project. Cubicfarm chief executive officer Dave Dinesen commented: \"Our commercial-scale modular Cubicfarm growing machines allow our partner farmers to increase local production of nutritious vegetables, herbs and many other crops, helping to address both food security and the environmental footprint associated with transportation. We're excited to incorporate PaiGE precision technology with the goal of improving resource efficiency and crop yields.\" PaiGE chief executive officer Steve Martin stated: \"The partnership with Cubicfarms allows us to demonstrate Pond's growth technology in the terrestrial environment, potentially opening the door to a whole new category of applications. Cubicfarms is the ideal partner for us to evolve the PaiGE technology as their growth cubes provide a fully controlled environment -- similar to Pond algae bioreactors.

On Sunday, AERIUM Analytics, on behalf of EIA, flew a Microdrones mdLiDAR1000 to collect Lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) and imagery data of EIAs runways. The data collected will be used to more accurately predict when to conduct preventative maintenance on runways, taxiways and aircraft handling aprons, enhancing safety. The Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS or drone) operation was approved by Edmonton Airports in collaboration with Nav Canada and is part of the ongoing AERIUM RPAS operations at EIA, which is one of the only airports in Canada using this technology. Microdrones has developed an end-to-end LiDAR solution combining a drone, a LiDAR payload, a fully integrated software workflow, and world class support to consistently provide quality deliverables.The mdLiDAR1000 is a fully integrated system for producing 3D point clouds optimized for land surveying, construction, oil & gas, and mining applications. RPAS technology is advancing quickly and is more and more useful to EIA, says Steve Maybee, EIA VP of Operations and Infrastructure. Thanks to the hard work of our Operations team and our partners in Nav Canada and AERIUM Analytics, our airport is a leader in this field, and we are fast approaching the point where drones are just part of the regular flight operations at EIA. EIA has 2 million square feet of runways, taxiways and aircraft handling aprons to maintain. The nationally recognized EIA maintenance program requires annual pavement inspections. This is the fourth year that AERIUM Analytics has operated RPAS at EIA, beginning with Robird robotic falcon flights to control bird activity. So far AERIUM has conducted well over 3,000 safe airport flights. AERIUM drones conducted the first ever night airport flight at EIA and their RPAS effectively help airports control bird migration, conduct construction and maintenance surveys, and calibrate equipment as well as working with the energy and forestry industries. We are honored to be able to work with Edmonton International Airport on groundbreaking projects in the RPAS industry in Canada. Yesterdays flights are the result of months of planning and would not have been possible without the support we received from the airport and coordination with NAV Canada. We are looking forward to reviewing the data collected to aid the airport in future runway maintenance and infrastructure development, says Jordan Cicoria, VP of Operations at AERIUM Analytics. About Edmonton International Airport Edmonton International Airport is a self-funded, not-for-profit corporation whose mandate is to drive economic prosperity for the Edmonton Metropolitan Region.

Other main investors include Saudi Agricultural and Livestock Investment Company (SALIC) and the British investment firm Downing Ventures. Founded in 2016, Hummingbird Technologies has developed a technology platform to evaluate the condition of agricultural fields. Hummingbird's unique artificial intelligence, deep learning and imagery analytics solution uses proprietary algorithms driven by aerial images captured from satellites, planes and unmanned aerial vehicles. It processes image data to create precise harvest forecasts or accurately calculate how much fertilizer is needed. With its high-resolution system, Hummingbird can also locate potential pest infestation, plant diseases or planting gaps. These tools deliver real-time actionable recommendations, which both improve performance on farms through precise targeting of operations and inputs, as well as provide evidence-based justification and return on investment (ROI) proof for decision-making. Within 24 hours, Hummingbird can provide farmers and their advisers with in-field zone maps that help them specifically target the application of fertilizers, crop protection products and growth regulators, as well as selectively manage subsequent plantings. The main customers are progressive farm businesses which use this technology to manage their existing fields more efficiently and thus achieve significant yield increases and cost savings. There are approximately 2.2 billion hectares of agricultural land available worldwide. Key areas for the use of advanced crop analytics include Russia, Ukraine, China, the United States, Australia, Canada and Brazil, but also the United Kingdom. \"We are delighted to have received investment from BASF and Telus Ventures. The investment will allow us to augment our leading position in core international markets, to pursue expansion opportunities that involve API (application program interface) software integration, and to extend our machine learning advantage at both a team and code level.

The local version of the Canada-wide 100 Debates on the Environment featured most local candidates with the exception of Christian Heritage Party candidate Tom Laird. People's Party candidate Brian Everaert, Conservative candidate Marilyn Gladu, New Democrat candidate Adam Kilner, Liberal candidate Carmen Lemieux, and Green candidate Peter Smith were asked about key actionable items in their platforms as well as water pollution, farmland, parks and wildlife, and Sarnia's all-important petrochemical industry. If nothing else, the conversation was a testament to an ongoing push across the country for a clear plan concerning the environment. Gladu stressed a \"regulatory approach\" for heavy emitters, while incentivizing green solutions at home - and touting nuclear power, solar, and hydro electricity. Kilner, meanwhile, pushed job creation as an essential aspect to climate change solutions while Lemieux touted the Liberals as \"the only party with a price on pollution,\" referencing the Liberal's carbon tax plan. Everaert was the only candidate to push back on climate change itself, calling some solutions \"kneejerk reactions\" while espousing a number of his own ideas and proposals, such as a call to reevaluate controversial neonicotinoids - a pesticide suggested by numerous studies to be detrimental to bee populations. \"We want to pull out of the 2030 Paris accord,\" Everaert said in his opening remarks. \"Canada is a sovereign nation and should be making (its) own rules on the environment. We want to make the decisions in Canada.\" \"The decisions are being made in Canada,\" Green Party candidate Smith responded. \"The carbon tax works.\" Candidates were given two rebuttals each, red challenge flags to keep the discussion moving while allowing some back-and-forth (many were left unused). Fireworks were very limited; after one question on wildlife conservation Smith admitted \"a lot of our answers to this are probably going to be the same.\" Gladu, who won the riding in 2015, spoke confidently on local issues including Asian carp in the Great Lakes and how precision agriculture can limit farm runoff - if farmers get better rural tech support. All candidates spoke to Sarnia's unique position as a community buoyed by a petrochemical industry long scrutinized for its environmental footprint. \"We have a plan to make sure major industrial emitters reduce their emissions,\" Gladu said. \"One of the things we have in our side is Lambton College... that's going to be very helpful in our transition strategy.\" \"There doesn't have to be a reduction in jobs,\" Lemieux said, touting the Liberal Party's record on the environment multiple times throughout the night. \"If you're an electrician or a pipe fitter you'll still have a job (in our green economy).\" The only hint of controversy came when Everaert questioned the actions of young environmental activist Greta Thunberg, suggesting \"extremists\" were using her as a \"shield\" by financing her - a comment that drew derision from some people in the crowd. Those boos were quickly quieted by debate moderator Blake Morrison who later applauded the candidates, and the crowd, for remaining largely cool and collected through the evening. \"I think it's really sad it's taken the youth to come to this stage to galvanize the adults, but I thank them for their support,\" Smith said, adding the \"demonization\" of Thunberg suggests climate change deniers \"don't have any answers for the questions she's asking.\" The two-hour debate was one of nearly a dozen in Sarnia-Lambton leading up to the upcoming Oct. 21 election. While each party has a different series of solutions for a changing climate, many of those solutions look and sound similar - such as reevaluating single-use plastics, retrofitting homes, and transitioning to clean energy. \"I look at some countries in Europe that work with coalitions,\" Kilner said, stressing the need to work together on climate change. \"We cannot do anything substantive without all agreeing that there is a climate crisis to begin with.\""}, {"title": "Profound Positioning Inc. Patent Issued for Method And System For Performing Precise Point Positioning (PPP) Ambiguity Resolution Using GNSS Triple Frequency Signals (USPTO 10,422,884)", "article": "2019 OCT 7 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Journal of Engineering -- From Alexandria, Virginia, VerticalNews journalists report that a patent by the inventors Gao, Yang (Calgary, CA); Wang, Min (Tustin, CA), filed on February 26, 2015, was published online on October 7, 2019. The patent's assignee for patent number 10,422,884 is Profound Positioning Inc. (Calgary, Canada). News editors obtained the following quote from the background information supplied by the inventors: \"The era of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) triple-frequency signals is approaching. Not only is this due to the modernization of United States (U.S.) Global Positioning System (GPS) and Russian GLObal NAvigation Satellite System (GLONASS), but also due to the emergence of other GNSS constellations including Galileo and BeiDou. Even with different frequency plans, each of the four GNSS systems may provide signals at more than three frequencies: L1/L2/L5 from GPS, L1-CDMA/L2-CDMA/L3-CDMA/L5-CDMA from GLONASS, E1/E5a/E5b/E6 from Galileo, and B1/B2/B3 from BeiDou. \"Triple-frequency signals for different GNSS systems are generalized as GNSS-L1, GNSS-L2 and GNSS-L5, as listed in FIG. 1. As depicted, GPS L1, Galileo E1, BeiDou B1 and GLONASS L1-CDMA are represented as GNSS-L1. Similarly, GPS L2, Galileo E5b, BeiDou B3 and GLONASS L2-CDMA are represented as GNSS-L2. Additionally, GPS L5, Galileo E5a, BeiDou B2 and GLONASS L5-CDMA are represented as GNSS-L5. Three types of wide-lane (WL) combinations can be formed as shown in FIG. 2, with the maximum wavelength of 4.57-9.77 m using GNSS-L2 and GNSS-L5, and the minimum wavelength of 0.75-0.85 m using GNSS-L1 and GNSS-L5. \"GNSS systems typically include three major components: earth-orbit satellites, ground control and tracking stations, and GNSS receivers. GNSS receivers have been used in various applications, including automobile navigation, emergency and location based services, tracking systems (e.g., for vehicles, persons, pets, or freight), marine navigations (e.g., for boats and ships), aircraft autopilot systems, real-time mapping, machine guidance at construction sites, mining, precision agriculture, land surveying, and deformation monitoring. Depending on the application, positioning accuracy requirements for the GNSS receivers may differ. For example, meter level accuracy is desirable for consumer grade receivers used for recreational and navigational purposes, while sub-meter level accuracy is desirable for mapping grade receivers for Geographical Information System (GIS) feature collection. Centimeter level accuracy is desirable for survey grade receivers. Currently there are two major GNSS precise positioning techniques used to achieve centimeter level accuracy: Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) and Precise Point Positioning (PPP). \"As an alternative GNSS precise positioning technique to RTK, PPP is defined as the state-space solution to process pseudo-range and carrier-phase measurements from a single GNSS receiver by utilizing satellite constellation precise orbits and clock offsets determined by separate means. There are three key factors for PPP: precise orbit and clock, precise error source modeling, and the use of carrier phase measurements. PPP differs from RTK from several perspectives. Firstly, PPP eliminates the spatial operation limit because it has no regional base station requirement. The determination of precise GNSS orbit and clock to support PPP requires a global reference network, but its baseline length is normally hundreds to thousands of kilometers, which differs from RTK. Secondly, error source modeling of PPP is typically more complex than RTK. RTK uses the regional base station information to generate a double-difference, in which a majority of the error sources may be eliminated. Because local base stations are typically not available, the error sources affecting GNSS navigation accuracy in PPP have to be considered, such as atmospheric effects, relativistic effects, site displacements, antenna phase center corrections, and phase wind-up effects. Thirdly, PPP is a global positioning approach because its determined position solutions are referred to a global reference frame, and the corrections to support PPP (e.g., precise orbit and clock) are globally valid. However RTK provides local position solutions relative to the local base stations especially when the base coordinates are not precisely determined. Therefore PPP may provide better long-term repeatability and consistency than RTK. PPP has several advantages over RTK, but PPP requires a long time to converge the float ambiguity in order to ensure the centimeter level positioning accuracy, so this largely limits its adoption to real-time. \"In Wang and Rothacher (2013), an ambiguity resolution method for triple-frequency geometry-free with an ionosphere-free combination for long baseline RTK was tested with real data. The data was not applicable to PPP because there was no consideration of the fractional biases for PPP ambiguities. Therefore, the triple-frequency GF IF linear combination methods discussed by Wang and Rothacher are insufficient for resolving PPP ambiguity in real world conditions. \"In Li et al. (2013), consideration of PPP ambiguity resolution with GNSS triple-frequency measurement was discussed. After fixing the L2/L5 Extra Wide-Lane (EWL) and L1/L2 WL ambiguities, the new formed ionosphere-free measurement with L2/L5 WL and L1/L2 WL carriers was applied to improve the dual-frequency NL ambiguity resolution. However, Li's final PPP fixed solution still fully relies on the dual-frequency carrier phase and NL ambiguity resolution with .about.10 cm wavelength, which is not achievable reliably within a short period of time and is not satisfactory for industry grade GNSS product development. Therefore, Li does not show how to resolve PPP ambiguity using triple-frequency methods. \"In Geng and Bock (2013), the PPP ambiguity resolution approach for GPS triple-frequencies was investigated independently, but based on their result the ambiguity fixing also needed several minutes, which failed to compete with RTK. For example, Geng summarizes that when multipath effects become stronger, the performance of triple-frequency PPP ambiguity resolution is deteriorated considerably, and the correct ambiguity resolution is at 78% of all epochs. The consideration of the ambiguity fractional bias (i.e., UPD) follows the conventional approach, in which the fractional bias is modeled as one value for each satellite. The conventional approach does not handle high measurement noise issues at triple-frequency ionosphere-free carrier phases. Therefore, the methods discussed by Geng and Bock are also insufficient for resolving PPP ambiguity in real world conditions. \"In Shen and Gao (2002), a smoothing technique was applied to improve the PPP float solution performance. However Shen and Gao apply a smoothing technique only for the code measurement. Accordingly, the prior art still fails to provide a robust triple-carrier ambiguity resolution method for PPP that is capable of rapid ambiguity resolution in a variety of noise conditions.\" As a supplement to the background information on this patent, VerticalNews correspondents also obtained the inventors' summary information for this patent: \"Methods and systems for performing Precise Point Positioning (PPP) ambiguity resolution using Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) triple frequency signals are described.

People's Party candidate Brian Everaert, Conservative candidate Marilyn Gladu, New Democrat candidate Adam Kilner, Liberal candidate Carmen Lemieux and Green candidate Peter Smith were asked about key actionable items in their platforms, as well as water pollution, farmland, parks and wildlife, and Sarnia's all-important petrochemical industry. If nothing else, the conversation Thursday night was a testament to an ongoing push across the country for a clear plan concerning the environment. Gladu stressed a \"regulatory approach\" for heavy emitters while incentivizing green solutions at home - and touting nuclear power, solar, and hydro electricity. Kilner, meanwhile, pushed job creation as an essential aspect to climate change solutions while Lemieux touted the Liberals as \"the only party with a price on pollution,\" referencing the Liberal's carbon tax plan. Everaert was the only candidate to push back on climate change itself, calling some solutions \"knee-jerk reactions\" while espousing a number of his own ideas and proposals, such as a call to re-evaluate controversial neonicotinoids - a pesticide suggested by numerous studies to be detrimental to bee populations. \"We want to pull out of the 2030 Paris accord,\" Everaert said in his opening remarks. \"Canada is a sovereign nation and should be making (its) own rules on the environment. We want to make the decisions in Canada.\" \"The decisions are being made in Canada,\" Green Party candidate Smith responded. \"The carbon tax works.\" Candidates were given two rebuttals each via red challenge flags to keep the discussion moving while allowing some back and forth. Many were left unused, limiting the fireworks. After one question on wildlife conservation, Smith admitted \"a lot of our answers to this are probably going to be the same.\" Gladu, who won the riding in 2015, spoke confidently on local issues, including invasive Asian carp in the Great Lakes and how precision agriculture can limit farm runoff if farmers get better rural tech support. All candidates spoke to Sarnia's unique position as a community buoyed by a petrochemical industry long scrutinized for its environmental footprint. \"We have a plan to make sure major industrial emitters reduce their emissions,\" Gladu said. \"One of the things we have in our side is Lambton College. ... That's going to be very helpful in our transition strategy.\" \"There doesn't have to be a reduction in jobs,\" said Lemieux, touting the Liberal Party's record on the environment multiple times throughout the night. \"If you're an electrician or a pipe fitter, you'll still have a job (in our green economy).\" The only hint of controversy came when Everaert questioned the actions of young environmental activist Greta Thunberg, suggesting \"extremists\" were using her as a \"shield\" by financing her - a comment that drew derision from many people in the crowd. Those boos were quickly quieted by debate moderator Blake Morrison who later applauded the candidates, and the crowd, for remaining largely cool and collected throughout the evening. \"I think it's really sad it's taken the youth to come to this stage to galvanize the adults, but I thank them for their support,\" said Smith, adding the \"demonization\" of Thunberg suggests climate change deniers \"don't have any answers for the questions she's asking.\" The two-hour debate was one of nearly a dozen in Sarnia-Lambton leading up to the upcoming Oct. 21 election. While each party has a different series of solutions for a changing climate, many of those solutions look and sound similar, such as re-evaluating single-use plastics, retrofitting homes, and transitioning to clean energy. \"I look at some countries in Europe that work with coalitions,\" said Kilner, stressing the need to work together on climate change. \"We cannot do anything substantive without all agreeing that there is a climate crisis to begin with.\""}, {"title": "Olds College launches agriculture technology programs", "article": "Olds College, known for its agriculture programming, has launched a new focus on ag tech with support from oilfield industry leader and philanthropist David Werklund.

According to news reporting from Guelph, Canada, by VerticalNews journalists, research stated, \"Characterizing the spatial variability of soil thermal properties and quantifying their relationships with commonly measured soil physical properties is important for successful implementation of precision agriculture practices. However, such information at field scale is scarce.\" Financial supporters for this research include FRQNT (Fonds de recherche du Quebec Nature et technologies), NSERC (Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada). The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from the University of Guelph, \"This study aimed to characterize the spatial variability of soil thermal properties and to quantify their spatial relationships with soil physical properties at a field scale. Measurements of soil water content (SWC) and thermal properties were carried out at 80 locations using a time domain reflectometry (TDR) probe and a heat pulse probe (Decagon KD2 Pro), respectively in a cultivated cornfield in southwestern QC, Canada. Soil texture and total organic carbon (TOC) at those locations were also determined in the laboratory. Both coefficient of variation (CV%) and variogram range showed a weak to moderate variability and spatial dependency for the soil properties which was attributed to the homogeneity of the soil, crop, and land management practices. Results of principle component analysis (PCA) indicated that the soil thermal properties and soil water content (SWC) had strong correlations with principle component 2 (PC2). The variogram ranges indicated that the soil thermal properties varied on a similar spatial scale as the SWC in the field. Cross variograms indicated strong spatial correlations between SWC and thermal properties, particularly thermal conductivity (k) and thermal diffusivity (D). Overall, results of this study showed that the SWC had a stronger influence on the spatial variability of soil thermal properties than the other properties such as TOC and soil texture at the field scale. Therefore, the results of this study could be useful for accurate modeling of the soil thermal regimes and mass-energy exchange processes at the field scale as well as developing successful agricultural management strategies such as precision irrigation.\" According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Future studies should explore the relation. ships between the thermal properties and other soil properties such as bulk density under various cropping systems.\" Our news journalists report that additional information may be obtained by contacting A.

Spark Niagara and the Town of Lincoln are teaming up to host its inaugural Agritech Hackathon from Oct. 18 to 20 at Beamsville District Secondary School. The event invites computer coding enthusiasts - or hackers - to problem solve issues in agriculture with the use of technology. Organizers hope to see real solutions come out of the three-day event, with an eye toward commercializing some of the top ideas. \"We're trying to bring those two worlds together,\" said Nicole Smith, events and communication co-ordinator for Spark Niagara, which maintains a Beamsville location. While many may still think of farming in the more traditional sense, the industry also cultivates innovative technology. Organizations like Vineland Research and Innovation Centre and Niagara College have developed precision agriculture tools, and robots that pick cucumbers or monitor conditions in greenhouses. The organizers for the Agritech Hackathon believe there's much more that can be done, too, by bringing together those in the farming and tech industries. \"Hopefully we'll have a product that the business community can use,\" said Francia Salazar, education partnership associate with Spark Niagara. Salazar is eager to see what the competitors come up with, recalling younger years working in greenhouses and thinking, 'there must be a better way to do this.' Organizers sought out the expertise of those in the agriculture sector, talking to people in horticulture, greenhouses and other areas to see what challenges they're facing. They then settled on five subject areas: soil erosion and depletion, diseases and pests, infrastructure, ecotourism and sustainability, and production and environment. But while competitors know the subject areas, they won't be given the specific challenge questions until the event kicks off on Oct. 18. There will be two divisions who will be tackling the challenges: one for youth from Grade 7 to 12, and one for post-secondary students and professionals. Cash prizes are up for grabs for both divisions, but more importantly there is a chance to turn an idea into a viable product. Smith and Salazar said they'd love to be able to come to next year's event with a product that was conceived at this year's hackathon. They expect to see some great ideas. \"People who get involved in hackathons take it seriously. They're all in all the time,\" said Smith. They've already got some interest, with students from Brock University, Niagara College and local school boards registering to compete. Competitors will hear from members of the business and agriculture industries throughout the weekend, including Grape Growers of Ontario CEO Debbie Zimmerman and Greg Baiden, CEO of Penguin Automated Systems Inc. On Friday evening, participants will receive their challenge and begin working on solutions. Their work continues on Saturday, where the public is also invited to check out the action and attend a morning vendor market fair. On Sunday, teams will present to a panel of three judges, who will pick winners in each age group. Prizes include a first-place cash prize of $3,000, as well as cash awards for second and third place. Organizers are still seeking coding enthusiasts who want to take part. Registration costs $20.

One Saskatchewan farm, Northerly, is using the latest in precision farming to grow sustainable, direct-to-consumer grains. There's no doubt that the current food system is broken. Despite living in one of the most prosperous eras of human history, millions of families across North America struggle with hunger on a daily basis. In fact, 1 in 8 Canadians and over 41 Million U.S. residents do not have consistent access to healthy food. Still, 1 billion tons of viable food-a third of the global production-is wasted every year. With corporations that value profits over people, there's been a marked uptick in greenhouse gas emissions, long supply chains, and overfarming that depletes valuable soil nutrients and leaves large swathes of land barren. Northerly's sustainability mission means growing high-yield, nutritious crops, supporting local economies and communities, and championing for farmworker safety. By using AI, robotics, automation, and IoT technology, Northerly is able to use the land more efficiently, with less pollution, less waste, and higher quality, higher yield crops. Sustainable agriculture is about feeding the future while growing strong communities. Northerly has also built transparency into its business model, connecting directly with consumers who are frustrated with corporate farms and nameless, faceless farmers. By putting crops, from seed to table, into consumers' hands, Northerly is restoring the connection between people and their food and raising awareness about the myriad issues modern farming faces. About Northerly Farms Northerly Farms is a Saskatchewan-based farm committed to sustainable, precision agriculture.

This debate is an opportunity to raise awareness about modern agriculture and promote the work of farming families.\" Innovating since 1922 La Coop federee has been in innovation mode ever since it was founded. Its actions demonstrate that it is possible to produce more with fewer pesticides. Today, Sollio Agriculture's agriculture platform, launched in 2017, serves over 11,000 connected farms. It is a diagnostic tool used to assess soil health and comprehensively collect fertilization and crop protection data. It has made possible precision agriculture, which enables the right product to be applied at the right time, in the right amount and at the right place.  In their brief, La Coop federee and Sollio Agriculture propose measures to allow Quebec agriculture to meet the demands of consumers: *Ensure respect of riparian and sensitive areas in fields: Many farmers continue to farm these areas, though this practice has proven negative impacts. *Advance precision agriculture: Technologies are making it increasingly possible to collect data on crop protection product use. However, new agricultural practices are slow to take hold on the ground. *Facilitate precision application: To apply what is needed when it is needed, farmers require costly equipment that enables localized product application. *Promote custom spraying: Audits are facilitated when retailers perform spraying; however, 49% of Quebec farmers prefer to spread pesticides themselves. *Audit crop protection product and fertilizer retailers: the key to compliance lies in on-file agronomic recommendations that provide for cross-checking. Agronomists active in distribution networks: A strong link \"Because La Coop federee is a cooperative, it belongs to farmers and acts on behalf of its members,\" said Gaetan Desroches, Chief Executive Officer of La Coop federee. \"The agronomists we employ in our network are required to follow their order's code of ethics. For us, that's non-negotiable.\" Agronomists have a responsibility to make the best agronomical recommendation for a given situation, whether that means applying an organic or inorganic product, intervening mechanically, using a technological solution, or doing nothing at all. It is crucial to respect the profession and avoid creating two categories of agronomists. Agronomists who work with distributors are a conduit for knowledge transmission to farmers, as they leverage our research and manufacturers' innovations on a daily basis and are familiar with their customers' realities. Thanks to them, pesticide alternatives are making their way onto farms. Pesticides: Promoting plant health \"Sollio Agriculture has access to most traditional and organic products, as well as technological crop treatment solutions,\" explained Mr. Leveille. Sollio Agriculture knows that farmers work hard to make their farms sustainable, as they wish to pass their land down to their children one day. \"We don't know of any farmers who would needlessly spend money on an agricultural input,\" Mr. Leveille added. \"Consumers are the ones who decide; they vote with their wallets,\" he concluded. \"The challenge is to farm at a competitive cost because, otherwise, people will turn to food produced elsewhere, where we have no control over the crop protection products used.\" About La Coop federee Founded in 1922, La Coop federee is the largest agri-food company in Quebec, the only Canada-wide agricultural cooperative and the 24th-largest agri-food cooperative in the world. It represents more than 120,000 members, farmers and consumers in nearly 60 cooperatives in several Canadian provinces. It employs more than 14,000 people and has sales totalling $6.5 billion. Including its affiliated cooperatives, La Coop federee boasts nearly 19,000 employees and combined sales of $9.5 billion.

WASHINGTON -- U.S. Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) today discussed his work during the August state work period, which he spent traveling throughout South Dakota, meeting with constituents, visiting fairs, and he even held a Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation field hearing on rural broadband in Sioux Falls. Thune's remarks below (as prepared for delivery): \"Mr. President, it was a good August. \"While I head back to South Dakota almost every weekend, August gives me the chance to spend multiple uninterrupted weeks back home, visiting with South Dakotans and traveling to the far corners of the state. \"August is also fair season in South Dakota. \"And there is nothing better than a South Dakota fair. \"This year I got to attend the South Dakota State Fair, the Brown County Fair, the Sioux Empire Fair, and the Turner County Fair. \"And as usual, I had a great time at all four. \"The people are the best part of course. \"Although the fair food isn't far behind. \"I'm still dreaming of the Tubby Burger I had at the Brown County Fair. \"They don't have burgers like that in D.C. \"Agriculture is the lifeblood of South Dakota, and as always, a lot of my conversations over August were centered around agriculture. \"Farmers and ranchers have had a very rough few years, and addressing the needs of our agriculture community is one of my top priorities in Congress. \"One big concern for our producers is ethanol and biodiesel. \"While we received some good news this year with the approval of year-round E15 sales, the ethanol industry is still facing significant challenges owing to the excess of small refinery waivers that have been issued. \"Perhaps the biggest concern for our farmers right now is trade. \"Multiple protracted trade disputes have exacerbated an already struggling ag economy and have left farmers and ranchers unsure how markets are going to look going forward. \"While ranchers received some good news in August with the announcement that the administration has reached a deal to increase U.S. beef sales to Europe, that's just a tiny fraction of what we need to do trade-wise. \"Each time I speak with the president and his administration, I tell them what South Dakota farmers have told me: We need to conclude negotiations on the various trade deals we're working on as soon as possible to open new markets and expand existing ones - and to give agriculture producers certainty about what the playing field is going to look like going forward. \"One of my priorities right now is pushing for passage of the United States-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement. \"The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement will preserve farmers' access to two of our nation's most significant agricultural export markets - Canada and Mexico - and substantially expand market access for U.S. dairy products in Canada. \"Negotiations on this agreement have already been concluded. \"We need Democrats in the House to indicate their willingness to take it up and pass it. \"Mr. President, August is always a great time to share with South Dakotans what I'm working on in Washington and get their feedback, which is why I'm glad I had the opportunity to host four town hall meetings, tour numerous local businesses, and visit nearly every corner of the state. \"As South Dakotans know, I'm a long-time member of the Senate Commerce Committee. \"I served as chairman of the committee in the last Congress, and I currently chair the Commerce Subcommittee on Communications, Technology, Innovation, and the Internet. \"This has given me the chance to address a number of issues facing Americans, from the frustration of illegal robocalls to the data privacy concerns we all face in the internet age. \"It's also given me the chance to focus on digital issues that affect rural states like South Dakota - particularly the lack of high-speed internet access in rural areas. \"To residents of large cities, being without access to high-speed internet is unthinkable. \"But for families in rural areas, which lack the telecommunications infrastructure of cities and suburbs, even basic internet access can sometimes be a struggle. \"Broadband access is frequently just a dream. \"And that has real consequences for these Americans. \"It's not just a matter of being able to stream Netflix without interruption. \"In our digital economy, a lack of reliable, high-speed internet access means losing out on opportunities to grow your business. \"It means fewer educational opportunities. \"It means fewer health care resources, in areas that already lack easy access to specialty care services. \"Telehealth promises to reduce some of the geographic barriers to care for individuals in rural areas, but it depends largely on high-speed internet access. \"Then there's the rapidly developing field of precision agriculture. \"Precision agriculture, which uses tools like robotics and remote monitoring to help farmers manage their fields, promises to help farmers substantially increase their yields while reducing their costs. \"But once again, it depends on reliable access to high-speed internet. \"That's why I've made this issue such a priority. \"Nationwide, the digital divide is shrinking, as more and more Americans gain access to broadband. \"And in South Dakota, we're ahead of the curve, thanks to people like Sioux Falls Mayor Paul TenHaken, who has worked aggressively to remove barriers to telecommunications investment in Sioux Falls. \"And I was very encouraged by the Federal Communications Commission's recent announcement that it will invest $705 million over the next decade to bring broadband to rural areas in South Dakota that currently go without. \"But there's more work to be done. \"And I'm committed to pushing this issue until reliable broadband access is standard for rural America. \"During the last week of the August break, I brought the Commerce Committee to Sioux Falls, to conduct a field hearing on rural broadband. \"We brought an FCC commissioner with us so that he could hear directly from South Dakotans who are on the front lines of rural broadband expansion and leading the innovations that come along with it. \"It was a great hearing, and I'm very encouraged by the progress we're making on this issue. \"And I look forward to doing more work on this issue in the coming months. \"I'm energized by the time I spent with South Dakotans during the August break, and I'm looking forward to continuing to fight for South Dakota's priorities here in Washington this fall. \"Mr. President, before I close, I want to take a minute to recognize one of the people who has been instrumental in helping me serve South Dakotans throughout my time in the Senate. \"This week, my whip office chief of staff, Brendon Plack, is leaving my office after 14 years. \"He's been with me during my entire time here in the Senate - from my very first month on the job - and it's difficult to imagine the office without him. \"He started out at the bottom, as the guy who had to drive me to evening events so that I could squeeze in a little more work or a few more phone calls to South Dakota on the way. \"But he was always cheerful about it - and even better, he drove well and he never ran out of gas. \"(That may not sound like a big deal, but having been subsequently stranded on the way to an event after running out of gas, I appreciate Brendon's preparedness.) \"Brendon soon moved up to legislative correspondent, and then legislative assistant. \"And then up from there. \"Policy director. Legislative director. Staff director. Chief of staff. \"He has been an indispensable part of my team. \"No job has ever been too big for Brendon; no task too hard. \"It doesn't matter how long the hours get - he's always willing to put in the work that needs to be done. \"And he stays cheerful through it all, lifting everyone else up with him. \"He's a natural leader, who is not only exceptionally talented himself but is great at spotting talent in others. \"He helped me put together an outstanding team for the whip office, and he has helped me maintain an outstanding team in my personal office. \"In politics, you meet people who are great at the nuts and bolts of policy and know every detail of an issue. \"And you meet people who aren't as focused on the details but who have an ability to see the big picture and how what we're doing fits our larger goals. \"You don't always meet people who can do both. \"But Brendon has always been able to get into the nuts and bolts of a policy and at the same time see the bigger picture. \"One of the things I've appreciated most about Brendon is the fact that no matter what we're doing, South Dakota is at the forefront of his mind. \"As a native of Madison, South Dakota, and the son of a farmer, Brendon has a keen insight into South Dakotans' priorities. \"And whether it's tax reform or energy legislation or agriculture, Brendon is always thinking about how we can serve South Dakota on the national stage. \"And he's played a key role in so many of the things I've been able to get done for South Dakota here in Washington. \"Now, I've described a pretty outstanding individual here. \"But Brendon is not without his flaws. \"He is a long-time Vikings fan. \"Over the past 14 years, I've tried hard to convince him that he should be rooting for the Packers, but so far I haven't gotten anywhere. \"Fortunately, our shared appreciation for the tuba has helped us get over our major disagreements on football. \"Both Brendon and I are tuba players from way back ... although I think Brendon is a little more accomplished than I am. \"I never made it beyond the high school marching band, but Brendon went to Augustana University in South Dakota on a music scholarship and played in the concert band. \"I just learned he actually lost his tuba scholarship to dedicate time to my campaign. \"Mr. President, as I said earlier, it's hard to think of my office without Brendon. \"He will be deeply missed. \"But I look forward to watching him excel in all his future endeavors. \"And I know he may enjoy having a little more time to spend with his wife Lindsay and his little ones Timmy and Katie Lou. \"Days on the Hill can be very long. \"Mr. President, if you ask Brendon how he got into politics, he'll tell you about the meeting he attended in college where I was the guest speaker. \"That meeting, Brendon says, got him interested in politics for the first time. \"Shortly after, he applied to work on my first Senate campaign, and the rest, as they say, is history. \"To hear Brendon tell it, attending that meeting was a lucky day for him. \"But I know that it was an even luckier day for me, and for the people of South Dakota. \"Mr. President, I yield the floor.\""}, {"title": "AJX AgJunction adds task management to Wheelman", "article": "AgJunction Inc (TSX:AJX) Shares Issued 118,561,641 Last Close 9/11/2019 $0.50 Thursday September 12 2019 - News Release Mr. Jeff Morris reports WHEELMAN AUTOSTEERING NOW SUPPORTS TASK MANAGEMENT Task management is now available for AgJunction Inc.'s Wheelman Pro and Wheelman Flex products with the latest free update to the Whirl app. The new task management feature helps farmers keep track of the different tasks they perform when using Wheelman on their farm.

The government is partnering with Trillium Health Partners, the Region of Peel, Peel District School Board, Dufferin-Peel Catholic District School Board, Peel Public Health and Peel Children's Centre to raise awareness, shorten wait times, standardize suicide screening, improve transitions for youth from the emergency department to the community, and help families better navigate the system. In Ontario, about 14 per cent of high school students reported having seriously contemplated suicide in the past year and about four per cent reported having attempted suicide, the government said in a release. On World Suicide Prevention Day, Health Minister Christine Elliott, Education Minister Stephen Lecce and Children, Community and Social Services Minister Todd Smith announced the program at Mississauga YMCA on Tuesday. To date, the project has also received over $3 million in support from donors in the community, Elliott said. \"Our government continues to deliver on our promise to make mental health and addictions a priority, especially for children and youth, our most vulnerable patients,\" Elliott said. \"Combined with funding from project partners, our government's funding will help raise awareness, equip community leaders and families with the tools to better support children and youth experiencing mental health challenges, provide better connected care and fill critical service gaps.\" Premier Doug Ford gave brief remarks at Canada's Outdoor Farm Show in Woodstock -- where he took shots at city-slickers and marvelled at the latest farm technology -- before he and Agriculture Minister Ernie Hardeman hosted a roundtable with Ontario farmers. The premier addressed the struggles farmers are facing due to international labour disputes, and said he hoped to learn from farmers what their issues were, as he is not an agriculture expert. \"We're here to listen, to support each and every one of you,\" he said, adding that Hardeman, as well as Parliamentary Assistants Toby Barrett and Randy Pettapiece, were the \"all-star team for the agriculture industry.\" \"Each and every one of you, you're experts. You're experts in your field,\" Ford said, in what may or may not have been a pun. Ford spoke about the province's labour shortage, claiming Ontario is short 200-250,000 workers. \"It's a good thing but it's also a tough thing,\" he said, boasting that his government created the conditions for companies and farmers to \"thrive.\" Ford said the new technology farmers are using is going to attract young people to the profession. \"I wish I could bring every single person from the City of Toronto to this show here, and show them what high tech equipment that the farming industry is using now,\" he said. \"Because honestly, the majority of people don't have a clue.\" Sensing the crowd might be on his side, Ford continued, \"They don't have a clue. They're in the bubble -- downtown Toronto's bubble, I call it. And I love getting out of the bubble and meeting the real folks, as I say, out there.\" Ford said the farming industry contributes $47.7 billion to Ontario's GDP. \"I don't think some of these city folks understand how important farming is. I think people take it for granted,\" he said. \"They go into the store and see the shelves stocked and they think it just all of a sudden appears there. A lot of hard work, innovation, technology now is going into farming.\" Ford signed off by noting his recent trade discussions with the United States, pushing for an end to tariffs on Canadian products. \"If we all work together, everyone benefits. As soon as we start putting up barriers on both sides of the border, it doesn't work,\" he said, adding that \"the Americans, they understand.\" More investments are coming to Ontario farmers through the Canadian Agricultural Partnership (CAP) -- this time in a bid to improve the province's soil health while reducing phosphorous entering waterways. On Tuesday, federal Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau, along with her provincial counterpart Hardeman, announced almost $240,000 under the partnership for the enhancement of soil protection and support for precision agriculture technology research. One project will see the Grain Farmers of Ontario receive over $60,000 to evaluate soil type, elevation, treatment and frost damage on cover cropping, which the government said will help reduce phosphorous entering the Lake Erie watershed, and prove a concept of using precision agriculture technologies to facilitate field research. \"Our government is investing in cutting-edge technology and research that help Canadian farmers adopt greener practices, including soil protection,\" Bibeau said in a release. \"This commitment to sustainable solutions will help the industry as a whole continue to grow and prosper in the long term.\" Hardeman was equally enthusiastic. \"From long-term to new users, we're committed to implementing systems and technology to protect the province's soil and water. This research will help develop the latest techniques and knowledge in managing soil health across the province,\" the provincial agriculture minister said. \"Our government is happy to invest in solutions that support best practices, so we can continue to protect our precious resources.\" Keith Currie, the president of the Ontario Federation of Agriculture, and co-chair of Environmental Collaboration Ontario, welcomed the funding. \"By working together with the government and other interested groups, farmers are protecting our natural resources for future generations. This funding is another important way to support actions from farmers,\" he said. \"Our livelihoods depend on healthy soil and clean water; protecting the environment in which we live and work is a critical priority for our sector.\""}, {"title": "11% of H1 Canadian VC investments go to agri: CVCA", "article": "Protectionism and increased scrutiny of foreign investment into the US encourage investors to look at Canada, as appetite for direct institutional investment also grows. The Canadian Venture Capital and Private Equity Association says agriculture-related businesses accounted for more than 10 percent of Canadian venture capital investment in the first half of 2019. While the overall venture capital market in Canada has seen a consistent expansion over the past five years, agriculture's role in it has been flat, CVCA vice-president for research and industry advancement Darrell Pinto told Agri Investor. \"Roughly between 6 to 10 percent is the sweet spot for agriculture in terms of share of total dollars from venture capital,\" said Pinto. Many Canadian venture capital firms invest across industries, Pinto explained, adding that one firm standing out for its focus on ag is Calgary-headquartered Avrio Capital. The entire Canadian VC market is only about 10 percent of the size of its US counterpart, according to Pinto, who described the asset class as having developed gradually over the past 20 years. Recently, he added, protectionism and increased scrutiny of foreign investment in the United States has helped encourage growth, with more international LPs beginning to explore Canada's venture capital market, often through funds. \"They are looking around for dealflow everywhere in the world, as well as here,\" said Pinto. \"It seems there is this international diversion that is happening as a result of what is happening politically in the United States.\" \"It's a signal that institutions are seeing greater returns in this asset class [venture capital], both directly or indirectly through funds,\" said Pinto."}]
