The academic expertise and skills will be harnessed through the \"brain gain\" project during the eight-day working visit by Malaysian King Tuanku Mizan Zainal Abidin to Montreal and Toronto from Saturday. Three memorandums of understanding are expected to be signed during the visit between Canada's McGill University and University of Guelph, and Malaysia's Sultan Zainal Abidin University, Mara Technology University and Putra University Malaysia. The memorandums, among others, involve exchange of academic staff as well as training for master's degree, PhD and post-doctoral students and laboratory staff from Malaysia at the two Canadian institutions. The King's special task visit is organised by YDSM. YDSM, chaired by Tuanku Mizan, is a recipient of grants under the brain gain project under the auspices of the Academy of Sciences Malaysia and the Science, Technology and Innovation Ministry. YDSM Board of Trustees member Prof Dr Makhdzir Mardan said among areas of collaboration with the two Canadian universities were research and innovation in biosteel silk gene, precision farming and food technology, super hospital model concept and telemedicine services. He said the brain gain initiative was to reciprocate visits by scientists from both universities last year. He added that the collaboration would help enhance the human capital of Malaysian universities through programmes such as exchange of academic staff and students as well as joint research. \"The exposure will open up avenues for bigger networking opportunities in selected skills in agriculture, medicine and nutrition sciences,\" he said. Tuanku Mizan's presence would add stature to the collaboration, he said, adding that although the visit would not solve the brain drain problem in such field, the trip could provide a critical mass in the sharing of knowledge between Malaysian and foreign scientists.

To discuss our second-quarter results and the outlook for the remainder of 2010, I will hand over the call to President of Hemisphere GPS, Steve Koles. STEVEN KOLES, PRESIDENT AND CEO, HEMISPHERE GPS INC.: Thank you, Cory, and good morning, everyone. This morning we reported our financial results for the second quarter of 2010. Revenues were up 8% compared to the second quarter of 2009, and sequentially over the first quarter of 2010 by 3%. While this doesn't represent our normal seasonal profile where Q2 is typically lower than Q1, it was still less than we had been anticipating. Revenues came in below our internal expectations, primarily as a result of lower purchasing activity in Canada due to record flooding in western Canada and in the US, as well as some delayed orders which had been expected to ship before the end of the quarter. It is estimated that 20% of western Canadian farmland will go unplanted, or if planted will not produce crops this year, causing farmers to lose over $3 billion. Weakness in agriculture commodity prices for grains during the quarter also impacted overall confidence for the farming sector. In general we tend to experience a direct correlation between optimism levels within the farming committee and our sales levels. And since we generate the majority of our sales directly from the end user, we tend to experience real-time fluctuations with the market optimism or pessimism. On gross margins and earnings, we experienced impacts from foreign exchange volatility resulting in gross margins of 43% and a net loss of $1.9 million. While these results were below our expectations, the overall direction of the business is certainly up. As stated in our Q1 call, we believe we have been through the worst of the decline in the agriculture sector and continue to see indications of this. We maintain a more positive outlook for our back half of the year, expecting unusual strength and still project growth for the year as a whole over 2009. Let me now speak to the second quarter and our market segments, and I will allow Cam to provide more detail later in the call. While North American revenues were moderately lower year-over-year for the reasons I just mentioned, we have seen a strengthening in our international sales, with growth compared to the second quarter of 2009. Sales to customers in Europe and Australia increased following declines in these markets in the first quarter. The introduction of the North American Outback Guidance distribution model in the Australian market has contributed to growing Australian sales. Sales to other markets including South America and China were up significantly compared to the second quarter of 2009, continuing the strong growth seen in the first quarter. Revenues from the precision products segment grew moderately versus the second quarter of 2009, with continued strength in sales of Vector heading sensor products and GPS boards sold to OEM customers. So the first half of 2010 has been characterized by strong international sales, while North America continues to lag somewhat but on an improving basis. While we saw very weak grain commodity prices in the first half of the year, prices have significantly strengthened in July. For example, wheat prices went from a 52-week low at the end of June to a 52-week high in July, based on production impacts from the flood conditions in North America and the recent ban on Russia's wheat exports. This 42 increase in the price of wheat during the month of July represents the biggest monthly gain in over 50 years. Other grains such as soybeans and particularly corn have also shown significant recent strength, with record levels of corn being imported by China, a trend which is expected to grow significantly over the coming years. We are very encouraged to see the continued strength in the South America, Asia and Australian regions. These regions are becoming a larger part of our aggregate revenue stream but are not yet large enough to offset weaknesses in our North American markets. However, international revenues have grown to nearly 1/3 of our annual revenues. We are still just scratching the surface of market penetration in Brazil, Argentina, as well as China and Eastern Europe, and we continue to penetrate new markets, including Russia and India. We expect these markets to generally deliver higher growth numbers as a percentage basis than North America and Western Europe, as those newer markets adopt the efficiencies and value of high-tech precision agriculture employing GPS-enhanced accuracies. In addition to an improved outlook for the overall agriculture markets for the remainder of 2010, several of our new products are shipping in the third and fourth quarters, and initial demand indicates additional incremental revenue opportunities for the year. Shipments of Outback eDriveX auto steering system have been very good. eDriveX delivers a new level of precision steering and control performance in the industry and opens up new market segments for our portfolio. eDriveX steers more demanding farming practices, including high precision planting, strip tilling and bedding, requiring centimeter level of accuracy at a wide range of speeds. End-user feedback on eDriveX has been very positive. In the quarter we expanded our offering installation kits to address a wider set of tractors and combines. Auto steering is the number one revenue generator for our business. We expect this to continue, as adoption rates for auto steering still lag guidance installation numbers, making all of our auto steering products well-positioned to up-sell to new and existing customers. A recent study by a Successful Farming at agriculture.com suggests that 20% of those farmers surveyed plan to purchase auto steering technology before the end of this year. If this is true, this could represent a significant resurgence of buying that the precision agriculture industry hasn't seen since the peak of 2008. In the same survey, 25% of farmers cited cost as their biggest concern when it comes to investing more in precision ag technology, which bodes well for our value proposition and approach to market through our Outback brand. The pull-through effect from auto steering to the other parts of our portfolio is also very positive, including other new products such as dual-frequency receivers, guidance systems, and integrated section controls. Our new Earthworks business unit that designs and manufactures products for the construction market progressed towards increased tractions in the back half of the year. Our Earthworks product line is focused on machine guidance and control of earth moving machinery, inclusive of snow cats for ski resorts. While Earthworks is still in a preliminary stage of channel development and ramping now generation, we can develop our Earthworks product line by leveraging the expertise and experience from our proven technology applications currently used in agriculture and marine markets to meet the needs of the Earthworks sector. This is a high-value niche market for us. In addition to our recently launched Earthworks X200 excavator machine-guidance systems, new offerings to be announced later this quarter at Earthworks will include the X300 three-dimensional excavator guidance system, blade applications, as well as new Earthworks partnerships and channel developments. We believe there is a very significant market for us in the Earthworks sector, and that will become a larger part of our future growth capability, with very incremental R&D investment. To discuss each of the business units -- or business segments and their financial results in more detail, I will now hand off the call to Cam Olson. CAMERON OLSON, SVP AND CFO, HEMISPHERE GPS INC.: Thanks Steve, and good morning everyone. I will provide a brief overview of the second-quarter financial results. Revenues of $15.6 million in the second quarter were up by 8% from the same quarter of 2009 and up by 3% from the first quarter. Revenues from the agriculture segment were $12,740,000, up by 8% from the second quarter of 2009 and up by 2% from the first quarter. International sales were strong, with growth in European and Australian agriculture markets driven by global economic circumstances, weather and lower grain prices. Growth in other markets, including South America and China, was over 100% in the quarter. South America in particular was our strongest region, as revenues grew by over 200%, with Brazil and Argentina driving the growth. Revenues from the precision products segment were $2,817,000, up by 5% over 2009. Sales of Vector heading sensor products to the marine markets and GPS boards to OEM customers continued to lead the growth in this segment. For the quarter our regional sales were as follows -- in the United States revenues were $6.0 million, down 6% versus 2009. In Canada, $3.5 million, down 17%. In Europe, $2.6 million, up 24%. Australia -- $0.9 million, up 58%. And other regions including South America and China, $2.6 million, up 107%. As we review the rest of the P&L, the primary story versus 2009 is the impact of foreign exchange rates, with Canadian and Australian dollars in the first half of 2010 strengthening by 14% and 23%, respectively, against the US dollar compared to the first half of 2009. Our translated costs denominated in Canadian and Australian dollars have grown by a corresponding amount. Compared to the second quarter of 2009, we estimate that these foreign currency swings have had a negative impact on operating earnings of about $1.3 million, with $0.8 million impact on margins and $0.5 million impact on operating expenses. Gross margins were 43% in the second quarter, down from 50% in the second quarter of 2009. Consistent with what we've seen in the prior three quarters, the primary driver of lower margins has been the strength of the Canadian dollar over the last year. As I've explained in prior quarters, lower revenues than originally forecast in 2009 resulted in a significant reduction in inventory turnover during 2009. As a result, inventory acquired during the first half of 2009, when the US dollar FX rate was over CAD1.20, were carried into 2010. Because we have a Canadian dollar measurement currency, US dollar revenues earned during the second quarter are converted into Canadian dollars using the second-quarter foreign-exchange rate, which averaged about CAD1.03. However, when inventories are sold and brought into Canadian dollar cost of sales, they are recorded at the weighted average historical foreign exchange rate applicable over the period that those inventories were acquired. Although those weighted-average rates have been coming down, they still reflect the impact of early 2009 rates. We estimate that this foreign currency translation issue had a negative impact on gross margins in the second quarter of approximately 5.5% compared to the second quarter of 2009. This issue has largely worked its way through the P&L, and we now expect that the impact over the last half of the year should be less than 1%, barring any significant strengthening of the Canadian dollar. I'm very hopeful that I won't need to explain this issue again in our third-quarter conference call. In addition to the impact of foreign currency, gross margins are also lower in 2010 as a result of product mix and program-related pricing discounts. Operating expenses were $8.5 million for the quarter, up by $0.9 million compared to the second quarter of 2009 but consistent with our first quarter. Total headcount at June 30 was 225 employees, down by 16 employees or 7% from 241 at June 30, 2009. Although there are a variety of different items impacting operating expense, the most significant are lower headcount and the strengthening Canadian and Australian dollars. Lower headcount has resulted in lower people-related costs. However, offsetting this has been an increase in operating expenses of about $550,000 resulting from the changes in FX rates. We are carefully managing our operating expenses in light of the slower pace of economic recovery, as illustrated by our headcount numbers. While we continue to exercise controls over discretionary costs, we believe we are at the right balance of prudent cost management versus the capacity to respond as the recovery begins to accelerate. We will continue to monitor our costs carefully and respond appropriately to future economic turns. Turning to the balance sheet, our cash balance at June 30 was $7.9 million, down by $1.2 million from March 31 and by $0.5 million from December 31. $0.9 million of cash was used in operations during the quarter, including a payment of $0.6 million to settle our foreign currency hedge at June 30. $0.2 million was used for capital expenditures during the quarter. As planned, we have continued to draw down physical inventory levels, with inventory declining by about $1.2 million during the quarter. Since March 2009, when inventory levels reached a high of CAD22.6 million, we have reduced Canadian-dollar inventory levels by 27% and are approaching more normal levels. That's my report. Back to you, Steve. STEVEN KOLES: Thank you, Cam. In terms of the health of the precision agriculture industry and our largest segment, we are seeing elements of a positive ag cycle, even super cycle, in gradual development. For the North American farm sector, the USDA projects net farm income will be $63 billion in 2010, up by 12% from 2009 and the fifth-highest year ever. Optimism of potential cash receipt by farmers is very important, which is why the recent commodity price strength is key. A recent report from the USDA on the index of prices received versus paid by farmers indicates that for the month of July alone the index strengthened by six basis points for crops, which is up 13% from the previous month. Other positive factors for the remainder of the year and into 2011 include the health of crops that were successfully planted across North America, new product releases with 14 new products launched in the past 18 months, new strategic customer opportunities, continued strength in South America, Asia and Australia, as well as significant order backlog strength for the back half of the year, which is 70% higher than the same period in 2009. Based on all these conditions, as I've just outlined, we continue to anticipate a stronger-than-usual closing six months, and as we stated during our Q1 earnings call, we still expect double-digit percentage revenue growth for the full year. Such full-year growth indicates an unusually strong back half of the year for us, which we expect to offset the lower first-half sales levels with much more balanced seasonality this year. Historically, the first half is nearly 50% stronger than the back half, but we believe the relative strength expected in the back half will enable us to grow at least 10% for the full year. Recent commentary from our customers, industry competitors support a continued improvement in the precision ag market throughout the remainder of the year and into 2011. Our objectives for the back half of the year are to maximize the revenue opportunity and capture the emerging upside agriculture cycle. Our Outback business model being tied directly to real-time market order flow bodes well for Hemisphere GPS to see this market upside first. Revenue traction will be key to ensure our path back to profitability. We also plan to continue to prudently manage costs in order to mitigate, as much as possible, the impacts on foreign exchange on growth margins in earnings we've experienced for the first half of the year. Finally, our efforts are also focused on increasing our long-term commercialization success with OEMs, new strategic customers and partners, as well as new market niches. Evidence of this commercialization success will be made throughout the remainder of the year. While we are disappointed with both the revenue growth levels and earnings impacts from foreign exchange during the first half of 2010, we have increased confidence the fundamentals of our business are more robust now compared to the last 18 months, leading to a positive trajectory as we move through the rest of 2010 and into 2011. At this point, I will ask the operator, Andrea, to assist me in opening the call to any questions. OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) [Matt Rennie], Wellington West. MATT RENNIE, ANALYST, WELLINGTON WEST: So the flooding out west, how much of that has affected your sales as far as deferred sales versus lost sales altogether? -- if you can put that into number terms for me a little bit. STEVEN KOLES: Well, that's a -- is a great question and a tough one to answer. Time will obviously tell. I think from a segment perspective regionally Canada was down fairly significantly, the most significantly in terms of other regions for the quarter, I think down around 17%. Reuters published, I think on the weekend, that there is an estimate of farmers losing up to $3 billion as a result of the flooding, and about 20% of the western Canadian farmland will either go unplanted, or if it was planted, it's not going to produce a crop. So I think it's safe to say we're going to treat those as less of a deferred opportunity and probably more of a lost opportunity for 2010, although I will say that we're -- with stronger wheat prices, particularly with those who have been able to get planted, probably less so in Saskatchewan but more into Alberta and Manitoba, as well as into the US, and particularly down in Texas, the cash flow impacts will be fairly significant. MATT RENNIE: Right. And then given the flooding in China and the Russian drought, and I think a lot of people are calling for corn prices to continue to skyrocket throughout the year, and what sort of revenue potential do you see in the Asian market in the second half of this year? STEVEN KOLES: Well, as you saw by the percentage growth rates, we -- very pleased to see the amount of traction we are starting to generate now in terms of the multiple millions of dollars of revenue generated in what we are bucketing as other international, which is a large part of China. That's -- it's still going to be slow progress I think in the Chinese market. We -- as we've commented in other calls, we do have a number of different distributors on the ground in China going after the market in different ways, either by segment, by geography, or targeting OEMs in the China market. We do see that as one of our major markets over the long term. For the back half we're going to stay somewhat conservative in terms of the revenue that might be generated, but certainly we expect, at least from a percentage growth rate, a similar-oriented trajectory. MATT RENNIE: Okay, that's great. Thanks a lot guys. OPERATOR: Pardeep Sangha, PI Financial. PARDEEP SANGHA, ANALYST, PI FINANCIAL: Just if you can provide me a bit of clarity here, in the past you've said the two things you've set as for the goals for this year is double-digit growth for the year and also profitability for the year. Now, you've sort of reiterated double-digit growth for the year. I was hoping you could delve a little bit more in terms of the profitability for the year and what your view on that is now going forward. STEVEN KOLES: Yes, thanks, Pardeep. Certainly it was our objective to achieve a return to profitability for 2010. Given the first two quarters and the impacts of FX that we have to then build against, certainly that's going to be challenging. Our new -- reset objective really is going to be minimum breakeven for the back half of the year, and we will certainly be driving towards maximizing the revenue growth and controlling our costs in order to achieve this -- less so for how we end 2010 but more to some degree the momentum that we can generate into 2011. PARDEEP SANGHA: Okay. Do you think you could have a goal of maybe EBITDA-positive for the year? STEVEN KOLES: Again, I think some degree of challenge given the FX impacts, but as you heard from Cam, we have only a limited amount of the inventory wash-through effect ahead of us, and certainly we will drive toward that as best we can. It will be a challenge though. PARDEEP SANGHA: Okay. And the other thing I just want a bit more clarity on what is the better-than-usual back half of the year, and if you can sort of -- if I look at your historical records, 2008 was your best back half of the year, and essentially if you're going to achieve double-digit growth for the year, you're basically going to have to put up a record back half of the year, better than 2008 even. Am I interpreting this correctly? STEVEN KOLES: From a raw dollar perspective, our expectation would be in lines of producing a back-half record, yes. PARDEEP SANGHA: Okay. Your cash balance generally in the first half of the year, you've built up your cash reserves, and then you're declining for the second half of the year. This year you have not been able to build up your cash reserves over the first half of the year. How do you feel about your current cash balance going into Q3 and Q4? And I appreciate the comments you've already made about the inventory, and I appreciate that as well. STEVEN KOLES: Yes, I think we've done a pretty good job of converting the inventory from a working capital perspective into cash. We've done lots of scenario planning and cash forecasts inside of those scenario planning, and we believe that we have adequate cash to fund the business as we move through the back half of 2010 and into what we would expect would be a cash-generation period back -- starting in -- moving from Q4 into Q2. PARDEEP SANGHA: Okay. A final question, just if you wouldn't mind making some commentary with regards to M&A activity in your sector, what you are seeing in the industry in general by your competitors, and then in particular what you're doing with regards to yourselves. Are you looking at the potential for acquisitions? Or if there is anybody who has been asking you about acquiring you. STEVEN KOLES: Well, thank you. Obviously you appreciate I wouldn't be able to comment on the very last question. You know, I wouldn't say that we have been active in exploring strategic growth opportunities, whether those be strategic alliances that may move into more discreet M&A oriented projects. I think there is a degree of tire-kicking going on in the market. There hasn't been a significant amount of activity, other than some dealer consolidations for some of the big iron names out there. I do think there is some opportunity for some degree of industry consolidation, and we certainly want to be a player in that. OPERATOR: Peter Prattas, Fraser Mackenzie. PETER PRATTAS, ANALYST, FRASER MACKENZIE: I just wanted to focus a little more on the other geographic category, where you saw sales more than double. Can I ask, was the majority of that growth driven more by South America or by China? STEVEN KOLES: The majority -- I think Cam actually commented on this, and I will let Cam speak here in a second, but the majority of that growth did come from -- if I were to isolate a specific region, it would be Brazil, with probably Argentina and China as a bit of a second-place tie. PETER PRATTAS: Great. And can you comment on which products specifically are driving the growth in each of those geographic regions, China and Brazil? STEVEN KOLES: Well, it's -- well, those are at -- it's a great question, and because the answer is quite a bit different. In China we are still very much in kind of early-stage adoption, if I look it -- at the market from a macro perspective. What a mean by that is, we still have mostly guidance systems being sold into China, which is a great way to seed the market in terms of them being able to go back to sell auto steering as an enhancement to that. [I've got to think] that we do have some larger end ex state farms or state farms in China that we are working with that are actually evaluating or testing our full portfolio of products, right from even our highest-end products, eDriveX as an example. So -- but for the most part China is still a guidance-only adoption sort of curve dynamic right now, whereas Brazil -- actually Brazil -- furthest end of the spectrum. We have some very advanced farmers and customers in Brazil that have very challenging terrain in many respects in terms of the soybean market there more specifically. And what I mean by that -- so inertial compensation to compensate for elevation changes and terracing for -- through auto steering as an example, that's really where eDriveX is intended to perform extremely well. So we have a lot of testing going on in Brazil, and a lot of the high-end farmers have pushed our products to the max there during testing periods. So I would say that in Brazil the higher end of the market is starting to take off more substantially than China at this point. PETER PRATTAS: Great. Thanks very much, Steve. OPERATOR: Nick Agostino, Mackie Research Capital. NICK AGOSTINO, ANALYST, MACKIE RESEARCH CAPITAL: Yes, good morning. Just a couple of quick questions. First of all, I noticed on the income statement there was a $200,000-plus restructuring charge. Can you just provide some color around that? STEVEN KOLES: (multiple speakers) CAMERON OLSON: The restructuring costs are related to internal restructuring that we've put in place over the last six months, and the restructuring charges relate to essentially people termination and severance costs to put that restructuring into place. NICK AGOSTINO: So no change in headcount in the current quarter, just previously announced headcount reductions? STEVEN KOLES: (multiple speakers) No, there were a couple of reductions in the quarter, Nick, and it's fair to say that the decline even from 2009, there has been probably more focused in, say, our operations department, as we were building less products, obviously requiring less people in manufacturing and distribution. We've also started to work in streamlining the organization at more of the management and executive level as well. NICK AGOSTINO: Okay. And on the R&D side it looks like you're up to about $2.5 million this last quarter. It looks like R&D has been trending higher. Obviously you've put new product on the market with eDriveX and certainly on the Earthworks side. Is the $2.5 million going to be the new run rate? Is it going to go higher? Or is it a case of, you guys have done some heavy lifting as of late, and now you probably will pull back on the pedal on the R&D? STEVEN KOLES: Well, certainly we have been working on a strategic plan of record on the R&D side. The products that we are developing now are orders of magnitude more complicated than things that we have invented years ago, so the time frame from an R&D perspective are longer, and as a result the things that even though we've gone through a down market in the past 18 months, we wanted to come out of the -- that market with a stronger portfolio than going into. So we haven't wanted to second-guess our plan of record on that. Now, that being said, we do have -- we have produced a tremendous amount of innovation over the past while, as I've mentioned in my comments, around 14 new products in the past 18 months, and I think in the quarter we did have more -- a bit of a one-time materials expense relating to some of that final development, but certainly as we expect on the go-forward basis, those one-time elements would be monetized out or normalized out, I should say, but we would be looking from a business-model perspective to target around 12% of revenues as our more normalized run rate for R&D investment. NICK AGOSTINO: Okay. And on the accounts receivables side, talking about the cash, it looks like typically your receivables spike in Q1 and draw down during the course of the year. This time around it looks like your receivables actually moved higher in Q2. Should we expect to revert back to the norm? Or is there just no predictability around receivables this year? CAMERON OLSON: Yes, the receivables were a little bit higher in the second quarter. We [didn't] have stronger revenues in the second quarter of this year, so that's kind of the key driver of that one. We would expect that receivables will trend along with the revenue levels, so we do expect good revenue levels over the last couple of quarters, so we would expect receivables to be correspondingly higher than prior years, but as a ratio to revenues, probably fairly consistent with what we've seen in the past. NICK AGOSTINO: Okay. And the last question -- obviously you guys are calling for about $28 million, $29 million in revenues for the second half of the year. Typically Q3 is a very weak quarter for you guys. Should we be looking at Q4 as being a materially strong quarter where you're going to make up -- where that's going to allow you to reach the guidance for the second half of the year? Or should we be looking at the second half of the year as being more equally distributed? STEVEN KOLES: I actually believe there will still be some seasonality in terms of Q3 to Q4. It's -- for those farmers in North America that have gotten successful crops planted, they will be obviously in harvest mode as we move into September here, so that's always going to be some impact and creating some seasonality. I still think we will have a stronger Q3 than we've seen in the past, obviously. So to answer your question, I think there will still be some seasonality between Q3, Q4, with Q4 being stronger for sure -- in fact, probably much stronger. But I still think we will see some good traction in Q3 as well. NICK AGOSTINO: Okay. So do you think that maybe Q4 -- if I look at the numbers, Q4 could turn out to be your strongest quarter on the entire year, is what you might be suggesting? STEVEN KOLES: That could be, potentially, yes. NICK AGOSTINO: Okay. That's it. Thank you. OPERATOR: Barry Richards, Paradigm Capital. BARRY RICHARDS, ANALYST, PARADIGM CAPITAL: Steven, you've been working on distribution now for a couple of years. I wondered if you could just comment on your progress expanding the distribution channels. STEVEN KOLES: Thanks, Barry; good question. It's really been a twofold effort. There is areas where regionally we are starting from a greenfield strategy and trying to find appropriate distribution. Now, that is largely international, and we've made some pretty good progress there in expanding our efforts. Particularly of note would be Australia, where we've essentially built a dealer network now over the first half of the year that's now starting to hit its stride in terms of the generation of revenue growth again for us for that market -- rather than being reliant upon a single distributor to do that market exclusively. The channel development also in ag also applies even to the US, where in markets we have been very strong in broad acre crop environments, which has us very focused in the Midwest. But high accuracy markets -- there's going to be fruits and vegetables. Cotton is an example. These are in some ways new markets for us regionally. So the nice thing about eDriveX is not only is it a great product, it has great pull-through revenue potential. But it's also a great, leading entree to be able to do continued dealer development and dealer recruitment. So that would be the ag side. Then of course on the Earthworks side, it's a similar story in terms of we are now I think closing in on 50 kind of representative locations across North America in terms of dealer coverage and working to expand that. Chameleon -- you'll have some -- you'll see some announcements from us on that shortly announcing some of those stronger regions. But we've also started to get now traction internationally. In fact we've had some interest down in South America on the Earthworks side, as well as in China. So we will work to continue to develop the Earthworks side in parallel and leverage as much of the ag distribution channel as best we can. BARRY RICHARDS: And second question -- can you remind us of what your targets are for gross margins post this period of clearing out older inventory? So whenever that is, when we get back to normalized margins, what is your target range from margins? STEVEN KOLES: When we look at our strategic plan on a go-forward basis, we still look at a business model that we believe is achievable to have 50-plus-percent gross margins. As we get past flooding or ramping through the inventory impacts of 2010, we certainly expect we can get back to that 50% gross margin level as we move into 2011. BARRY RICHARDS: Thanks and good luck. OPERATOR: David Delleo, Canaccord. DAVID DELLEO, ANALYST, CANACCORD GENUITY: I know you guys haven't given guidance beyond the end of this year, but you talk about a seasonality change and a strong back half of this year. Are you able to comment at all about when do you think you can potentially get back to your record revenue levels of 2008? And is that really going to be a function of US and Canada markets coming around, or can international really get you there? STEVEN KOLES: Well -- and thanks, David; great question. I think our target -- our original strategic plan target was to get to be $100 million topline business by 2010. Obviously the past 18 months and the recessionary impacts and the situation in agriculture hasn't allowed us to do that. Our resetting that target, can we get back to that by 2011? I think that's probably overly aggressive. I do think that in 2011 it could certainly be our year to be able to get back to a record revenue level, exceeding 2008, and we are seeing some good indicators to be able to support that. And your point is valid in that our traction on the international side, if we can keep that up through the back half of this year, the momentum will help lift that significantly on the international side, so we are much less reliant on North American revenues, although I do believe 2011 will be a stronger year in North America. DAVID DELLEO: Okay, thanks. That's helpful. That's it for me. OPERATOR: As there are no further questions in the queue, I turn the call back over to Mr. Koles for closing remarks. STEVEN KOLES: Well, I would like to thank everyone for their continued support, and I look forward to reporting to you again on our third-quarter results later this fall.

This was stated by Dr. Qamar-uz-Zaman, Head Precision Agriculture Research Department of Engineering at Nova Scotia Agriculture College (NSAC) Truno, Canada, while addressing the participants as during inaugural session of an international seminar and workshop on \"Spatial Variability and Precision Agriculture\" at New Senate Hall of University of Agriculture Faisalabad (UAF) here on Friday. He said, to meet the purpose, one way is to investigate the soils and treat them according to their productive potential as considerable variations in the soil properties within a field and their corresponding effects on crop yields data have been recognized. Dr. Qamar told that the time has gone when the farmers can bear the expenses of applying crop inputs uniformly, but we need to shift ourselves to real time ground measurement, yield mapping and then applying inputs very efficiently and timely. He told that he has utilized farmers experience in combination with aerial photos to define areas to similar soil properties and soil zones based on topography have also been used for management zones. He said that Pakistan can save millions of US dollars on importing the chemicals and fertilizers as the new technology VRA showed a 40 percent reduction in fertilizers application and limiting water soil contamination along with environmental pollution. Professor Dr. Iqrar Ahmad Khan Vice Chancellor (VC) UAF told that from July 1, 2009 to June 30, UAF organized 147 national and international seminars at this campus under a continuous process of professional development. He revealed that UAF has submitted 590 projects of Rs 14908.721 million to various national and international funding agencies. He emphasized the scientists to evolve and adopt such a technology to access the level of moisture and then drop the seed where moisture is good and apply the inputs according to size of tree as and when needed. He said that precision agriculture is all about conserving natural resources against the increasing pressure on fixed land and natural resources. He termed the new technology a solution of an old problem and said that precision agriculture teaches us new economics which is the future of system and mankind. He said that flood irrigation is a wasteful trend which needs to be transformed by furrow irrigation. He urged the young scientists to explore new avenues to solve the problems of mankind by their innovative ideas. There is no limit of imagination and we need to follow the imaginations to touch the goals, UAF needs day dreamers that such dreams should be come true, he added. Dr. Iqrar revealed that he intends to set up an Institute of Precision Agriculture at UAF campus to address the emerging issues confronting our agriculture and whole life cycle of the region. Earlier, in his welcome address, UAF Director Research Dr. Allah Bakhsh told that UAF earned a huge recognition and thus declared the Second Best University of the country in terms of publication of research papers in the journals having impact factor and indexed by the ISI web of knowledge. He told that our water storage capacity is very limited that is of 30 days only compared to 120 to 200 days of India, 500 days of South Africa and 900 days on Colorado and Murray Darling rivers of USA. In this context the only option left with us is to increase the crop yield per unit of land and per unit of water, he emphasized. Dr. Allah Bakhsh revealed that UAF is going to pursue its agenda of internationalization by developing joint degree programs, research proposals, developing course and lab for precision agriculture and developing collaborations by delivering video lectures and many more with Nova Scotia Agriculture College (NSAC) Truno, Canada. Dean Faculty of Agricultural Engineering and Technology Dr. Rae Niaz Ahmad thanked the participants and termed the seminar timely while Assistant Director Research Dr. Abdul Rasheed conducted the inaugural session of 10-day International Seminar and Workshop which will continue up to August 16."}, {"title": "Farming gets high-tech; Innovations in agricultural world on display", "article": "Remote controls, high-tech sensors and HD displays.

To discuss first quarter results and the outlook for the remainder of 2010, I'll hand over the call to the President of Hemisphere GPS, Steven Koles. STEVEN KOLES, PRESIDENT AND CEO, HEMISPHERE GPS INC.: Good morning everyone. This morning we reported our financial results for the first quarter of 2010. Relative weakness in the US and Europe resulted in fairly soft revenues from our outback precision guidance line for agriculture. Combined, North America and Europe account for approximately 84% of our revenues from the agriculture market, so when either of these markets move in a particular direction, it is reflected in our revenue level. Both regions showed some weakness in the quarter. Our North American revenues were down 22% year-over-year, and Europe was down approximately 32%. Europe has been struggling economically, and the weakening euro since the new year has been eroding purchasing power. From a segment perspective, agriculture revenues decreased 21%, given with the weaker results in North America, Europe and Australia. In North America some of the variables which impacted Q1 results included weaker commodity prices, which reduced customer optimism in purchasing. There were also varied regional weather conditions in North America during Q1. In some regions field conditions were too wet for planting or field work. In some regions weather was quite favorable, and this resulted in farmers being engaged in the fields early with planting and field work, causing them to be unavailable for purchasing. According to the USDA, at the end of April 68% of the nation's corn had already been planted. This is 36 percentage points ahead of last year and 28 points ahead of the five-year average. The previous record for this time of year was 63% in 2004. This is potentially positive for us since planting will be completed early this year, leaving more time in the second quarter and the rest of the year for efficiency planning. In contrast to market conditions in North America, we saw relative strength out of the South American markets, particularly Brazil and Argentina. Year-over-year sales to Brazil were up 338%, and South America as a whole was up 212%. These regions are becoming a larger part of our aggregate revenue stream but are not yet large enough to offset weakness in our North American and European markets. However, international revenues did -- for Q1 did grow to a record portion of our overall revenues at 30%. We are still just scratching the surface of market penetration in Brazil, Argentina, as well as China and Eastern Europe. We've also made inroads into areas like Russia and India. We expect these markets to generally deliver higher growth numbers than North America and Western Europe as those newer markets play catch-up. As you can see, overall in the first quarter global agriculture markets had a greater degree of regional variation than usual. We have seen similar commentary from our customers and competitors. Economic and currency volatility, along with weather, continue to be the primary factors. During this period we've made efforts to control costs. As an example, we have rolled back headcount from 262 now to levels of 227. Certainly it will be difficult to adjust our expenses in real time if we weren't managing to below our budget levels. So what does this mean for the rest of 2010? Actually the remainder of 2010 is looking quite a bit different for us. Internally we have seen an increase in orders and backlog. These numbers are quite a bit ahead of last year at this time, indicating an unusually strong back half of the year, which we expect more than set the lower first-quarter sales levels. We can already see that the second quarter will be stronger than the first quarter. This presents an unusual seasonal pattern for us in 2010. Generally our first quarter is the strongest for the year, but we are going to see a much more balanced seasonality this year. Historically the first half is nearly 50% stronger than the back half. But we believe they may be about even this year, eroding some of the seasonality out of the business. Again, we've seen similar commentary from our customers and competitors in this regard. Based on the current levels of sales and backlog order activity, it is our expectation still for double-digit revenue growth for the full year, and as I just commented, with a much different seasonal profile than we've typically have seen. In addition to an improved outlook for the overall agriculture markets for the remainder of 2010, several of our new products began shipping in the second and will be continuing in the third quarters. [Initial] demand indicates additional incremental revenue opportunities for the year. Some of the bigger challenge may include supply chain and manufacturing related, as components in the electronics industry, are indeed in short supply. While the world and Hemisphere GPS still have a ways to come through the slower economic recovery, we are seeing evidence that the first quarter represented the worst of it or the bottom and expect to see a general improvement moving forward. The US agriculture sector remains our most important market in terms of revenue contribution, at approximately 54% of total 2009 agricultural years for the full year, and 49% of our overall revenues in 2009. The outlook for the US and North America is indeed improving. In fact many reports are forecasting the emergence of a new, long-term agriculture super cycle beginning to develop. According to the latest report from the USDA, corn planting status looks not only to be ahead of previous years but also to be very healthy, as corn emergence statistics yield as of April 30. Corn farms represent our biggest single market, so these metrics bode very well for our outlook. Accordingly the price of corn is also important to this market, and the recent strength starting in late April for corn commodity prices is also positive. We are seeing (technical difficulty) a similar (technical difficulty) for soybean planting as well. I am pleased to report that significant interest in our latest auto-steering offering, the new eDriveX, began in Q1. Demand began building in the fourth quarter, and following a controlled release of initial shipments in the first quarter, we are now in full commercial shipping status. In fact we are announcing a fuller set of eDriveX installation kits tomorrow. EDriveX provides a new level of precision steering and control performance and can accurately steer more demanding farm practices, including high precision applications that require a centimeter level of accuracy at a wide range of speeds. Auto steering has become the number one revenue generator for our business. We expect this strength to continue as adoption rates for auto steering still lag guidance, making all of our auto-steering products well positioned to up-sell to new and existing customers. Our installed base of OUTBACK Guidance units today is well over 60,000 units. The pull-through effect from auto steering for other parts of our portfolio is also very positive, including other new products such as dual frequency receivers, guidance systems, and integrated section control. So far, I have spoken almost exclusively about agriculture markets. While it's currently the largest part of our overall revenue stream, Hemisphere GPS is not an agriculture-only company. We are a technology company who also serves growing markets including marine, GAF, and now earthworks, which I will speak to further shortly. Each of these markets tend to be less volatile for us than agriculture and provide an important diversification for the business. Sales to non-agriculture markets, the precision products segment, grew 18% in the quarter, led by increased sales of vector heading sensor products, as well as GPS boards to OEM customers. We have done well on the industrial side of the marine market. We have been successfully moving into the consumer or leisure side of the market through an OEM relationship with Volvo Penta and other initiatives. Precision products revenues include sales to marine, GIS, OEMs and other customers. Revenues for these products continue to benefit from a focus on expanding and improving the quality of precision product sales channels around the world, as well as the introduction of new products, including dual frequency GPS products. To discuss each of these business segments in more detail, I'll now hand off the call to Cam Olson. CAMERON OLSON, SVP AND CFO, HEMISPHERE GPS INC.: Thanks Steve, and good morning. I'll provide a brief overview of the first-quarter financial results. Revenues in the first quarter were down by 16% from the same quarter of 2009. Revenues from our precision products segment were $2,587,000, up by 18% over 2009. Sales of vector heading sensor products and GPS boards led the growth in this segment. Revenues from the agriculture segment were $12,481,000, down by 21% from the first quarter of 2009. Cautious spending continued to impact the North American, European and Australian agriculture markets, driven by global economic circumstances, weather, and lower grain prices. South America was our strongest region, as revenues grew by over 200%, with strong revenue growth in Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay. For the quarter our regional sales were as follows. In the United States, $7.96 million, down by 24%. Canada, $2.63 million, down by 12%. Europe, $2.1 million, down 32%. Australia, $0.37 million, down 38%. And other regions including South America and China, $2 million, up 165%. Gross margins were 45.2% in the first quarter, down from 52.4% in the first quarter of 2009 and up from 43.3% in the fourth quarter. As outlined in our press release and consistent with the impact we saw in the third and fourth quarter last year, the primary driver of low margins has been the dramatic foreign-exchange swings seen over the last year. With lower revenues than originally forecast in 2009, we realized a significant reduction in inventory turnover during 2009. As a result, much of the US dollar inventory sold by the company during the first quarter was acquired during the first and second quarter of 2009, when the US dollar was substantially stronger than it was during the third and fourth quarter. Because we have a Canadian dollar measurement currency, US dollar revenues earned during the first quarter are converted into Canadian dollars using the fourth quarter -- or first quarter foreign exchange rate, which averaged about $1.04. However, when inventories are sold and brought into Canadian dollar cost of sales, they are recorded at the weighted average historical foreign exchange rate applicable over the period those inventories were acquired, which was approximately $1.20 in the first half of last year. We estimate that this foreign currency translation issue had a negative impact on gross margins in the first quarter of approximately 4%. This issue had a much less pronounced impact prior to the second half of 2009, as significant foreign exchange rate moves haven't been combined with slower inventory movement. While this issue will continue to have impact on margins in 2010, the impact is declining as the weighted average historical FX rate reflected in our US dollar inventory has been coming down each quarter. For the full year, based on the movement of foreign exchange rates over 2009 and so far in 2010, we estimate that this issue will have an impact on full year 2010 gross margins of about 2%, compared to about 1.5% in 2009. Operating expenses were $8.4 million for the quarter, up by $0.6 million compared to the first quarter of 2009. As Steve mentioned, total headcount at March 31, 2010 was 227 employees, down by 35 or 13% from 262 at March 31, 2009, with a reduction of 17 employees in our manufacturing department and 18 employees in other functions. Unfortunately the impact of these reductions on our operating expense has been substantially offset by the impact of the weakening US dollar on translated expenses. About 40% of the company's operating expenses are denominated in Canadian and Australian dollars. The average US dollar foreign exchange rate for the first quarter weakened by about 16% compared to the Canadian dollar relative to the first quarter of 2009. Similarly, US dollar foreign exchange rate weakened by about 27% against the Australian dollar during this period. These changes have a negative impact on reported operating expenses as the Canadian and dollar -- the Canadian and Australian dollar expenses are converted and reported in US dollars at a stronger rate. The estimated impact of these foreign exchange rate changes on US dollar translated operating expenses was an increase of about $0.5 million. Turning to the balance sheet, our cash balance at March 31 was $9.1 million, up by $0.7 million from December 31. As expected, cash was generated from a decline in inventory and other working capital changes. Capital expenditures used $265,000 of cash in the quarter. As planned we have been drawing down physical inventory levels over the last four quarters, when measured in our Canadian dollar measurement currency. However, as outlined in the press release this morning, the significant weakening of the US foreign exchange rate over the last four quarters offsets this decline when reported in our US dollar reporting currency. We expect that physical inventories will continue to draw down to more normal levels over 2010. That's my report. Back to you Steve. STEVEN KOLES: I mentioned earlier that we recently diversified the company with the launch of our new earthworks business. The earthworks business designs and manufactures a product line focused on machine guidance control of earthmoving machinery. We commonly refer to this as the bucket and blade business. We are also working with guidance applications with snow cats and ski resorts and vehicles for open pit mining. Earthworks is embryonic today. But we believe that we can effectively leverage our R&D from tractor-based machine control technology. We did not need to build these solutions from scratch. We are leveraging our proven technology applications currently used in agriculture, aerial applications, and marine markets to meet the needs of the earthworks sector. This is a high-value niche market for us. There's also significant leverage that we can apply between the precision agriculture and earthworks segments from a channel perspective. Our first earthworks product, the Earthworks X200 excavator machine guidance system, improves operator accuracy, simplifies machine operations, and reduces excavation rework. The X200 guides the operator with a graphical display of the excavator bucket relative to the desired grade. As part of our initiatives in this market, we also have an alliance with Pro EX Ltd. out of the UK. Other new offerings coming soon in earthworks will include the X300 3-dimensional excavator guidance system, blade applications, as well as additional earthworks partnerships. With a very significant addressable market opportunity, earthworks will become a large part of our future growth capability and with very incremental R&D investment. At this point I will ask the operator to assist us in opening the call to any questions. OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions). Barry Richards, Paradigm Capital. BARRY RICHARDS, ANALYST, PARADIGM CAPITAL: Steven, you touched on backlog a couple of times, and you seem to have a higher than normal level of confidence in the backlog. Can you just talk about the products specifically that are contributing significantly to the backlog and maybe which regions are also contributing? STEVEN KOLES: Regionally -- tough for me to break down in terms of having that information in front of me. I will say that a big part of the backlog now and what has been building has been in the new products. For those that have followed us carefully, with the controlled release of eDriveX, we've now gone to more full order status on that. We've been accepting orders internally for some time, and those have started to churn themselves out into the rest of the quarter and as well as into Q3 and Q4. So eDriveX is going to be one of the most key products from a backlog perspective, as well as the pull-through effect that it has in other products, whether it be guidance systems, like Outback S3, or other new products like our A220/A221 dual frequency platform that also we'll be able to pull through eDriveX sales. BARRY RICHARDS: Understood. And you touched on the US market, obviously soft in the quarter. What should we look for, indications that we might have improving sales in that region? STEVEN KOLES: Well, it really comes down to confidence of the farmer. So two big factors that we've learned are indicators of that, number one, are commodity prices. Certainly we've seen a little bit of strength over the past couple of weeks, maybe correlated to energy prices. Certainly we will be watching that. The other is the continued health of planting status. So as we look at areas that have already planted, I think the estimates are up to about 20% of emergence by the end of April. That's about 15 percentage points ahead of 2009 and about 10 percentage points ahead of the five-year average. So we continue to watch that. And the health of the corn crop is a pretty good indicator, and as we get into an area where we don't have a lot of replanting, again, I think farmer confidence will continue to grow in North America. BARRY RICHARDS: The last question, obviously a difficult quarter, but it looked like regionally your performance was similar to some others. Were there any changes in the competitive landscape in the quarter or over the last couple of quarters, versus say this time last year? STEVEN KOLES: I wouldn't say anything significant. Again, we don't see evidence of major price competition. We do see new products coming out, as we've been obviously strengthening our portfolio as well. So it's really -- the competitive drive is really about additional capabilities and interoperabilities between components -- on a given tractor in the case of precision agriculture. So those would be the sort of competitive dynamics that we see. Not a major change, not a lot of price competition, but certainly more focus on new products like we've been focusing on as well. BARRY RICHARDS: Thanks and good luck. OPERATOR: Peter Prattas, Fraser Mackenzie. PETER PRATTAS, ANALYST, FRASER MACKENZIE: We saw operating expenses move up slightly higher this quarter, and I know you've talked about the foreign exchange impact there. But do you see any opportunities to reduce OpEx in any of the categories while your sales remain depressed currently? CAMERON OLSON: On the operating expense side, last year we implemented a number of initiatives to bring our expenses down in some areas where we saw opportunity. We closed an office in Texas, which caused some of the headcount to come down. We also reduced headcount in a number of areas including manufacturing. So the key areas where we saw opportunity, we have identified. And as we are looking forward and with our expectations on revenues for this year, we think we are at a point where we are fairly comfortable. I'll hand it over to Steve for his thoughts on the same question. STEVEN KOLES: Yes. As I commented, obviously managing operating expenditures is difficult to do in real-time to directly match to revenue profiles. As I mentioned, we are actually operating below our budget level, even with the FX impacts that Cam mentioned. But certainly we are driving to manage those expenses down continually, given the quarterly results, and try to match the full-year revenue. So we certainly have opportunity to push expenses down a little bit further, and we will continue to manage that vis-a-vis how revenues track against our budget. PETER PRATTAS: My second question relates to inventory. We didn't see much of a movement in that balance over Q4, and again, you talked about the foreign currency impact there. But can you go over how the inventory age profile has changed over the last three months? CAMERON OLSON: Sure. As we move through Q4 and Q1, we are building new inventory to support the stronger demand that we typically see in the busy season over the first half of the year. So as we went into the season this year, we did have a significant inventory of product based on the build during the first half of last year, which we referred to. But we are supplementing that with additional inventory built to support expected demand during the first half. As is going to be outlined in our MD&A, the inventory has moved from about CAD21 million -- or CAD23 million last March to about CAD17.7 million at the end of this March. So we have brought down the inventory significantly over the year. Unfortunately at the same time the exchange rate has moved by just about 20%, just about fully offsetting the true reduction that we are seeing in the inventory. Today, compared to a year ago, our inventory level relative to revenue expectations is much more in line. STEVEN KOLES: In fact, I'll jump in with a little bit more color. Our inventory situation is very interesting right now, where we still have a few SKUs of products where we do have ample inventory. The good news is that they are still predominantly finished goods and will in -- continued in the market for some time. So we will just continue to whittle them away and bring them down in a more normalized level. The other part, though, is frankly with the newer products and some of the allocation and shortages issues in electronic space, is trying to build new products to ramp up to demand and meet some of our backlog that we commented on earlier is we almost have a push/pull dynamic on the inventory side, which makes it interesting but one we're driving forward. PETER PRATTAS: Thanks very much. OPERATOR: Pardeep Sangha, [PH] Financial. PARDEEP SANGHA, ANALYST, PI FINANCIAL: Just a question around profitability. If you can give me sort of your sense of what you might be expecting for profitability for this year. STEVEN KOLES: I appreciate the question. In the past we've talked about our expectations for revenue growth and a return to profitability. It is still our objective to achieve a return to profitability in 2010. That is not our formal guidance, but we will driving towards this in the twofold areas, to maximizing the revenue growth and capitalizing on the backlog that we have for the rest of the year, as well as controlling costs and managing down expenses in order to try to achieve that objective. PARDEEP SANGHA: So let me just make sure I understand this properly. So by saying return to profitability, you are saying that you hope to get to zero-cent EPS for fiscal '10? STEVEN KOLES: That is our objective internally, yes. PARDEEP SANGHA: And Q1 is always the quarter which you drive the most profitability. In this quarter you had a $0.03 EPS loss, which makes it extremely difficult for you to achieve zero-cent EPS for the year. Is that correct? STEVEN KOLES: Well, I guess the way I would comment on that goes back to our -- the revenue profile that we see throughout the year occurring. And I recognize that as we are confident in that backlog and getting back to a double-digit revenue growth perspective, I realize that won't be easy for people to believe that forecast, given our typical front half/back half weighting. Obviously it will be up to us to prove that, but we do expect to see quite a bit of different seasonality to the business that is going to change what you are commenting on in terms of where we typically generate revenue and profitability in the first quarter. PARDEEP SANGHA: Okay, thanks, that's it for me. OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions). Jeff Rath, Canaccord. JEFF RATH, ANALYST, CANACCORD ADAMS: Steve, just expanding on some questions that were already asked. What do you anticipate your revenue mix will -- so you've kind of given us a sense to where you hope or what your revenue target will be for the full year. What do you expect the mix of your revenues to be like, approximately, as it relates to sort of your end markets that you talked about earlier? Is that something you can provide us? STEVEN KOLES: I don't think it's going to be out of the typical bases for what we have seen in the past. I would suggest it's going to be in the order of sort of north of 2/3 to 3/4 within agriculture, precision products, and then making up a bulk of the remaining, which frankly we see continued strength in the precision side of the business. And then some marginal revenue growth in the earthwork side of things. Our targets are -- and expectations are probably low for earthworks in 2010. It's really going to be a 2011 year for earthworks as we work to build the distribution and more product development on that side of the business. JEFF RATH: The second question I had was just again expanding on a comment you made earlier about that guidance is now the most important or the biggest revenue contributor for the company going forward and that that market remains relatively low in penetration. Can you share with us both what you think sort of North American market penetration rates are in the -- both in the guidance and in the auto steering? And I apologize, it was auto steering that was more important. So what I'm trying to get a handle on is, where do you think penetration rates now stand in both guidance and auto steering in your core markets? Thanks. STEVEN KOLES: And yes, it was steering that we'd commented on, and we'll continue to feed those, we continue to build more capability there. Actually the answer to your question, I just saw the Purdue study -- Purdue University study that comes out every year that we point to, and so based on their analysis -- and it's a fairly thick study -- but it would suggest that -- as a reminder, we use to -- last year I believe we were in the 35% market penetration overall for farms over 500 acres for guidance. I believe it was around 10% for steering. We see that now to about 38% for guidance, so it's kind of -- not as steep a growth path in 2009 for guidance as we've seen in the past. But steering did move pretty significantly up to about 18%. So still significant opportunities for additional adoption growth there, particularly on the steering side. JEFF RATH: Great, thanks very much. OPERATOR: Robert Winslow, Wellington West. ROBERT WINSLOW, ANALYST, WELLINGTON WEST: I think I missed the comment earlier on your China growth, what you'd seen year-over-year in terms of sales growth. What was that number, Cam? CAMERON OLSON: It was over 200% in China. ROBERT WINSLOW: 200 plus percent. Okay. Great. And Steve, maybe you can just spend a few minutes or a minute just highlighting again your China strategy, how that's unfolding, what you're learning as you grow there, and perhaps give us a sense of how China is looking this quarter. Are you continuing to see strong numbers there? STEVEN KOLES: Great question. Yes, we've certainly learned a lot in China over the past probably eight to 12 months. We continue to -- learnings that we've used there are that we are continuing to use multiple distribution partners that are going after the market in multiple ways. Some are going after segments, whether that be more mainstream farms versus state farms. Others are going after more regional pockets, say the inner Mongolia area as an example. And we've -- each of those are still very embryonic as we roll things out. We've added Chinese character sets into the -- into our products, but we've also learned that even adding -- even the plastic overlays to ensure that they have a Chinese character set versus English language on the console itself is something that we've also added in. And then to your last question, do we see additional growth there, even in second quarter? Absolutely. In fact we do have orders in Q2 for a number of products that will include those Chinese overlays, as I mentioned. We've been demoing eDriveX actually over there just this past week to some of the state farms and are getting some very good indications of interest there, where -- that the high-end product, even in that market, is something that seems to be generating a lot of traction. ROBERT WINSLOW: Great. Can you give us a sense of product mix? Generally are they leaning more towards the lower-end price -- lower-priced product? STEVEN KOLES: Yes, from a sheer volume perspective it's going to be the lower-end, entry-level product for us that we've been focusing a lot of this Chinese character conversion on. That will drive the bulk of the volume for sure. ROBERT WINSLOW: Now -- and I guess it's still early days for you in your China strategy, but is it fair to say that right now you take your components, the brunt of which are manufactured in China, they come to Canada for assembly, and then you ship them back to China? Or are you doing assembly over there to save some of that transportation cost? Or are you not at that scale yet? STEVEN KOLES: No, in fact we -- now it's an inflection point where the products even that I just commented on are being developed in China as a finished good, not just the components (multiple speakers) [of it]. So those -- we have the opportunity to start moving in terms of shipping them back to North America and then shipping back to the China for fulfillment is essentially keep them more local. ROBERT WINSLOW: Great. And then the last thing, I understand right now China, having some dry weather in the southwest and then some very cold weather in the north, so not ideal growing conditions, or at least planting conditions right now for the Chinese growers. But presumably you're coming off such a low base here that you can still see pretty heady growth. Are you -- is that fair to say? STEVEN KOLES: Well yes. These are still very much early days for us in China. We talk about these large percentages of growth, but we are talking about moving off of a very small base. Our strategy there is long term and includes us interfacing with government officials in the (multiple speakers) Ministry of Agriculture. This is not an overnight strategy that we expect is going to drive immediate results. This is definitely long term. As we've seen in North America and Europe, you will have weather patterns that impact things positively and negatively in various regions. And China is a very large market from that perspective. We expect to see that same sort of variability from a weather perspective, which we obviously can't control. ROBERT WINSLOW: Yes. That was probably a silly question for me to ask, given how early days it is for you in China. But I've been on the phone long enough. So just one last question -- and I'll get back off here -- is the India strategy, what can you tell us about how things are progressing there? Thanks. STEVEN KOLES: Similar approach that we've taken to China. Starting to work with as many partners and sort of big brothers as we can in that market. We do see again an interesting polarized approach to that market where you've got larger -- I'll call them corporate farms that are pretty significant, and then you've got the very small, very low end farms. We see opportunities for both, probably in the near term the larger corporate farms, and we've -- in fact we've heard some -- there are some opportunities there moving forward in terms of tenders that we are progressing on. OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions). Barry Richards, Paradigm Capital. BARRY RICHARDS: Steven, you pursued a more aggressive R&D strategy the last couple of years. You did launch a number of new products in the quarter. Does that mean you're slowing down your R&D efforts? Could we see R&D spending go lower? Or do you continue to aggressively pursue new opportunities? STEVEN KOLES: Well, we're definitely on an innovation strategy here. We definitely used the opportunity in 2009, and I recognize that we need to be patient on that. But on continuing to invest in building strength into the portfolio so that when macro factors return and we get a little bit more of a tail wind from the market, we've got a -- we come up stronger than we were before. Certainly we have more R&D initiatives planned. The things that we're working on now are more complicated and therefore longer development cycles than we've had in the past. But we've also been working to adapt ourselves internally in terms of more agile oriented development processes and testing and verification, so that we can actually bring new products out more effectively. I think as things stabilize, yes, we've had probably higher percentage from a business model perspective in R&D in the past 12 to 18 months. From a normalized perspective, we believe the level needs to be about 11% to 12% for continued innovation to remain competitive. BARRY RICHARDS: And the second question, can you just compare the trends in the OEM markets with the aftermarket? Was there any difference in the quarter? Or everything was pretty much the same? STEVEN KOLES: Actually if you -- breaking out our agriculture segment business, I would say that the aftermarket was probably a little weaker than OEMs. Where we had a little bit of strength was actually on the OEM side of things, as that sort of sub segment is a little bit more stable than the volatility in the aftermarket. BARRY RICHARDS: Thanks and good luck. OPERATOR: There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to you for your closing remarks.

All amounts in this news release are expressed in US dollars. For the first quarter ended March 31, 2010, Hemisphere GPS reported a 16% decrease in revenues to $15.1 million, versus $18.0 million in the first quarter of 2009. Hemisphere GPS reported a net loss of $1.7 million, or $(0.03) per share (basic and diluted), in the first quarter of 2010 compared to net earnings of $1.6 million, or $0.03 per share (basic and diluted), in the first quarter of 2009. Agriculture segment revenues decreased by 21% as a result of weakened agricultural equipment spending in North America, Europe and Australia. The Company's North American agriculture sales were 22% lower in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the first quarter of 2009. Similarly, European and Australian sales were 32% and 38% lower respectively. Sales in other regions of the world showed very strong growth being up by 165% driven by sales in South America and China - both up in excess of 200%. Revenues from the Company's Precision Products segment grew by 18% in the first quarter lead by increased sales of Vector heading sensor products, as well as GPS boards, to OEM customers. \"Economies around the world are recovering at different rates and the agriculture sector experienced varied geographical trends globally during the first quarter,\" stated Steven Koles, President and CEO of Hemisphere GPS. \"While agriculture revenue in South America was very strong, North America, Europe and Australia were quite weak as heavy planting activity and weak commodity prices tempered purchasing. Operationally, we entered the second quarter initiating full commercial shipping of several key new products, including the new eDriveX. Based on these new products and associated order backlog, we expect revenue in 2010 to reflect a different seasonal profile than has been typical for our company - with significant relative strength in the back half.\" First quarter gross margins of $6.8 million, or 45.2%, were down from $9.4 million, or 52.4%, for the same quarter of 2009. Margins decreased year-over-year primarily as a result of the impact on inventory of the significant weakening of the US dollar over the last year. Much of the US dollar inventory sold by the Company during the first quarter was acquired during the first and second quarter of 2009 - when the US dollar was much stronger. The Company estimates that this had a negative impact on gross margins in the quarter of approximately 4%, in part because the first quarter of 2010 realized an opposite impact from FX rates. Operating expenses were $8.4 million in the first quarter, an increase of $0.6 million, or 7%, compared to the first quarter of 2009. Research and development expense for the quarter increased year-over-year by $0.3 million to $2.4 million. Sales and marketing expenses were essentially flat over the first quarter of 2009 at $3.2 million. General and administrative expenses increased over the first quarter of 2009 by $150 thousand or 10%. Total headcount at March 31, 2010 was 227 employees, down from 262 at March 31, 2009 with a reduction of 17 employees in the manufacturing department and 18 employees in other functions. However, the impact of these reductions on operating expenses has been substantially offset by the impact of the weakening US dollar on translated expenses. At March 31, 2010, Hemisphere GPS held cash of $9.1 million, as compared to $8.4 million at December 31, 2009. Working capital at the end of the first quarter was $27.3 million.

In this context, the potential of UV-induced fluorescence of green plants for corn-weed discrimination was evaluated,\" researchers in Canada report. \"A total of 1 440 spectral signatures of fluorescence were recorded in a greenhouse from three plant groups (four corn hybrids, four dicotyledonous weed species and four monocotyledonous weed species) grown in a growth chamber. With multi-variate analysis, the full information contained in each spectrum was first reduced to the scores calculated from five principal components. Then, a linear discriminant analysis was applied on these scores to classify spectra on a species/hybrids basis and, subsequently, the resulting classes were aggregated according to the three plant groups. This two-step process minimized the error generated by heterogeneous groups such as dicotyledonous weeds. The output of this classification shows the significant potential of UV-induced fluorescence for plant group discrimination as the success rate reached 91.8%. No error was observed between corn and dicot weeds and most of the errors between corn and grasses came from confusion between the hybrid Pioneer 39Y85 and Setaria glauca L. (Beauv.). Analysis also determined that the position of the fluorescence sensor on the leaf and the plant age had negligible effects on the efficiency of fluorescence to discriminate plant groups,\" wrote L. Longchamps and colleagues, Laval University. The researchers concluded: \"The factors to consider for transferring the results about UV-induced fluoro-sensing from laboratory to the field are discussed.\" Longchamps and colleagues published their study in Precision Agriculture (Discrimination of corn, grasses and dicot weeds by their UV-induced fluorescence spectral signature.

All amounts in this news release are expressed in U.S. dollars. For the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, 2009, Hemisphere GPS reported a 16-per-cent increase in revenues to $12.1-million, versus $10.5-million in the fourth quarter of 2008. Hemisphere GPS reported a net loss of $2.4-million, or four cents per share (basic and diluted), in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared with a net loss of $2.6-million, or five cents per share (basic and diluted), in the fourth quarter of 2008. The similar loss on increased revenues is the result of marginally higher operating costs, research and development investment, a lower foreign exchange gain and the impact of the weakening U.S. dollar on gross margins. \"We were pleased with the fourth quarter,\" stated Steven Koles, president and chief executive officer of Hemisphere GPS. \"It was our first quarter of growth in five quarters, and was in fact, the second-best fourth quarter ever, second only to fourth quarter 2007. We are encouraged by positive signals heading into 2010 compared to the weakness of 2009. However, balanced by weaker commodity prices and harsh weather conditions, real visibility remains somewhat difficult at this point,\" added Mr. Koles. \"More clarity should be available by the end of the first quarter.\" Throughout 2009 in general, sales in all areas of business were impacted by uncertainty associated with the decline in global financial markets. Management believes that the weather-driven late harvest in the United States also reduced overall agriculture customer purchasing activity during the quarter. A weaker U.S. dollar effectively increases the purchasing power in international markets, notably South America, Europe and Australia, which could positively influence sales. International revenues did in fact show a strong performance with growth of 55 per cent compared with the fourth quarter of 2008 with particular strength in Asia, South America and Europe. This is a marked improvement following the 34-per-cent decrease in international revenues for the first three quarters of the year. North American revenues were essentially even year over year, but an improvement compared with the first three quarters of 2009 where Hemisphere's North American revenues were down more than 30 per cent year over year. In its December, 2009, report Agricultural Income and Finance Outlook, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) projects that net farm income will be $57.0-billion for 2009, down by 34.5 per cent from record 2008 net farm income of $87.1-million. Net farm income is forecasted by the USDA to grow in 2010. Fourth quarter gross margins were 43.3 per cent compared with 45.9 per cent in 2008. Margins were lower primarily as a result of the impact of the significant weakening of the U.S. dollar. The weakening of the U.S. dollar reduced effective gross margins for the quarter, as a majority of the U.S. dollar inventory held by the company during the fourth quarter was acquired during the first and second quarter -- when the U.S. dollar was much stronger. The company estimates that this had a negative impact on gross margins in the quarter of approximately 6 per cent, in part due to the fourth quarter of 2008 having an opposite foreign exchange impact. Offsetting the negative impact of foreign exchange rates, gross margins were positively impacted during the quarter by cost reductions in the manufacturing department, product mix and by higher software revenues compared with 2008. As inventory turnover improves and foreign exchange rates become more stable, foreign exchange rate changes should have a smaller impact on gross margins. Operating expenses were $7.4-million in the fourth quarter, an increase of $100,000, or 2 per cent, compared with the fourth quarter of 2008. Research and development expense for the quarter increased by $100,000 to $2.4-million. Investment in research and development is critical to maintain and expand the company's portfolio of technology and products. Sales and marketing expenses decreased by $200,000 or 8 per cent from the fourth quarter of 2008 as a result of lower head count and other cost reduction initiatives, offset by higher commissions. General and administrative expenses increased from the fourth quarter of 2008 by $200,000 or 15 per cent. At Dec. 31, 2009, Hemisphere GPS held cash of $8.4-million, as compared with $7.9-million at Sept. 30, 2009. Inventory levels decreased from $19.3-million at Sept. 30, 2009, to $17.8-million at the end of December, 2009, which is up from inventory of $14.0-million at Dec. 31, 2008. Inventory was originally built in anticipation of strong sales during the first half of the year, which is historically the strongest buying season for Hemisphere GPS. Softer than anticipated sales did not draw down inventory levels as expected. Physical inventory levels reported in the company's Canadian dollar measurement currency peaked in March and have drawn down since. However, the weakening U.S. dollar has offset this trend for reported inventory levels. Quarter-end inventory has reflected the following levels and rates in the \"Levels and rates\" table.  Management expects a further draw down of inventory throughout 2010. For the 2009 year, Hemisphere GPS reported revenues of $53.6-million, a 26-per-cent decrease from revenues of $72.7-million for the same period in 2008. Gross margin for the 2009 year was 48 per cent, compared with 51 per cent in 2008. Year-over-year expenses decreased by $1.0-million to $30.4-million. The company reported a net loss in the 2009 year of $5.9-million, or 11 cents per share (basic and diluted), compared with net income of $6.1-million, or 11 cents per share (basic and diluted) in 2008. Following cost reduction initiatives implemented during the 2009, total head count at Dec. 31 was 231, down 10.5 per cent from 258 employees at Dec. 31, 2008. Some of the cost savings from such activities have been offset by the weaker U.S. dollar, which results in higher Canadian and Australian expenses when converted to U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. Working capital at Dec. 31, 2009, was approximately $27.6-million. Fourth quarter operational highlights: - Sales to non-agriculture markets through the Precision Products segment were less impacted during 2009 with a decline of just 7 per cent in the year. These revenues include sales to marine, GIS, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and other customers. Revenues for these products continue to benefit from a focus on expanding and improving the quality of Precision Products sales channels around the world as well as the introduction of new products, including dual frequency GPS products. - The company's auto-steering products showed a smaller decline than other categories, including basic guidance products, as product sales represent both sales to new customers and buy-up sales to existing customers who own Outback Guidance units. As in 2008, the Outback eDriveTC auto-steering product was the largest single revenue-generating product for the company. - During the quarter, Hemisphere GPS's investment in research and development resulted in new product introductions. Further product introductions are scheduled for commercial release during the first quarter of 2010. - Hemisphere GPS announced the Outback eDriveX auto-steering system delivering a new level of precision steering and control performance. EDriveX utilizes the company's world-class Celestia sensor fusion technology, to steer more demanding farming practices including high-precision planting, strip tilling and bedding, requiring centimetre-level accuracy at a wide range of speeds. Outback eDriveX provides more uniform treatments, reduces waste, conserves fuel and reduces driver fatigue; all of which reduce cost and extend time in the field. EDriveX opens up new opportunities with aftermarket and OEM customers. - Hemisphere GPS launched its plug-and-play G100 all-in-one steering and guidance system for auto-steer ready agricultural vehicles. The first version of the G100 software is compatible with the AGCO Auto-Guide Ready tractors, while future GPS 100 software releases will be compatible with additional agricultural equipment. - Hemisphere GPS launched the Outback A220 smart GPS antenna, an all-in-one GPS receiver and antenna for both aftermarket and OEM applications. Powered by Hemisphere GPS's dual-frequency Eclipse GPS receiver technology, it provides fast, portable, submetre and decimetre differential GPS (DGPS) as well as centimetre real-time kinematic (RTK) positioning accuracy. Indications are that centimetre-level steering systems are the fastest-growing segment of precision agriculture. Outback eDriveX and Outback A220 are positioned ideally for this marketplace. Growers can capture a quick return on investment with this level of precision control to increase production and reduce waste. - Hemisphere GPS and CLAAS Agrosystems, one of the world's leading manufacturers of agricultural technology, launched Outback Sts in Europe. CLAAS Agrosystems is providing its customers a customized version of the Hemisphere GPS Outback Sts guidance system named Copilot TS.

"}, {"title": "Hemisphere GPS Reports 16% Revenue Growth for Q4 2009", "article": "CALGARY, March 2 /CNW/ -- CALGARY, March 2 /CNW/ - (TSX: HEM) Hemisphere GPS, a designer and manufacturer of advanced GPS products, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2009. All amounts in this news release are expressed in US dollars. For the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2009, Hemisphere GPS reported a 16% increase in revenues to $12.1 million, versus $10.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. Hemisphere GPS reported a net loss of $2.4 million, or $(0.04) per share (basic and diluted), in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to a net loss of $2.6 million, or ($0.05) per share (basic and diluted), in the fourth quarter of 2008. The similar loss on increased revenues is the result of marginally higher operating costs, R&D investment, a lower foreign exchange gain and the impact of the weakening US dollar on gross margins. \"We were pleased with the fourth quarter,\" stated Steven Koles, President and CEO of Hemisphere GPS. \"It was our first quarter of growth in five quarters, and was in fact, the second best Q4 ever, second only to Q4, 2007. We are encouraged by positive signals heading into 2010 compared to the weakness of 2009. However, balanced by weaker commodity prices and harsh weather conditions, real visibility remains somewhat difficult at this point\", added Koles. \"More clarity should be available by the end of the first quarter.\" Throughout 2009 in general, sales in all areas of business were impacted by uncertainty associated with the decline in global financial markets. Management believes that the weather-driven late harvest in the United States also reduced overall agriculture customer purchasing activity during the quarter. A weaker US dollar effectively increases the purchasing power in international markets, notably South America, Europe and Australia, which could positively influence sales. International revenues did in fact show a strong performance with growth of 55% compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 with particular strength in Asia, South America and Europe. This is a marked improvement following the 34% decrease in International revenues for the first three quarters of the year. North American revenues were essentially even year-over-year, but an improvement compared to the first three quarters of 2009 where Hemisphere's North American revenues were down more than 30% year-over-year. In its December 2009 report Agricultural Income and Finance Outlook, the US Department of Agriculture (\"USDA\") projects that net farm income will be $57.0 billion for 2009, down by 34.5% from record 2008 net farm income of $87.1. Net farm income is forecasted by the USDA to grow in 2010. Fourth quarter gross margins were 43.3% compared to 45.9% in 2008. Margins were lower primarily as a result of the impact of the significant weakening of the US dollar. The weakening of the US dollar reduced effective gross margins for the quarter, as a majority of the US dollar inventory held by the Company during the fourth quarter was acquired during the first and second quarter - when the US dollar was much stronger. The Company estimates that this had a negative impact on gross margins in the quarter of approximately 6%, in part due to the fourth quarter of 2008 having an opposite foreign exchange impact. Offsetting the negative impact of foreign exchange rates, gross margins were positively impacted during the quarter by cost reductions in the manufacturing department, product mix and by higher software revenues compared to 2008. As inventory turnover improves and foreign exchange rates become more stable, foreign exchange rate changes should have a smaller impact on gross margins. Operating expenses were $7.4 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of $0.1 million, or 2%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. Research and development expense for the quarter increased by $0.1 million to $2.4 million. Investment in research and development is critical to maintain and expand the Company's portfolio of technology and products. Sales and marketing expenses decreased by $0.2 million or 8% from the fourth quarter of 2008 as a result of lower headcount and other cost reduction initiatives, offset by higher commissions. General and administrative expenses increased from the fourth quarter of 2008 by $0.2 million or 15%. At December 31, 2009, Hemisphere GPS held cash of $8.4 million, as compared to $7.9 million at September 30, 2009. Inventory levels decreased from $19.3 million at September 30, 2009 to $17.8 million at the end of December 2009, which is up from inventory of $14.0 million at December 31, 2008. Inventory was originally built in anticipation of strong sales during the first half of the year, which is historically the strongest buying season for Hemisphere GPS. Softer than anticipated sales did not draw down inventory levels as expected. Physical inventory levels reported in the Company's Canadian dollar measurement currency peaked in March and have drawn down since. However, the weakening US dollar has offset this trend for reported inventory levels. Quarter-end inventory has reflected the following levels and rates:  Management expects a further drawdown of inventory throughout 2010. For the 2009 year, Hemisphere GPS reported revenues of $53.6 million, a 26% decrease from revenues of $72.7 million for the same period in 2008. Gross margin for the 2009 year was 48%, compared to 51% in 2008. Year-over-year expenses decreased by $1.0 million to $30.4 million. The Company reported a net loss in the 2009 year of $5.9 million, or $(0.11) per share (basic and diluted), compared to net income of $6.1 million, or $0.11 per share (basic and diluted) in 2008. Following cost reduction initiatives implemented during the 2009, total headcount at December 31st was 231, down 10.5% from 258 employees at December 31st, 2008. Some of the cost savings from such activities have been offset by the weaker US dollar, which results in higher Canadian and Australian expenses when converted to US dollars for reporting purposes. Working capital at December 31, 2009 was approximately $27.6 million.

It wants to leave behind its status as a shortline tractor manufacturer known for its large 4-wds to become a full-line ag equipment company. Versatile announced its plans in January at its second annual dealer meeting held in Las Vegas. More than 185 dealers from across the U.S. and Canada got their first look at six new products on display: a 575-hp 4-wd tractor, three fixed-frame, mechanical-front-wheel-drive (MFWD) tractors, a scraper tractor, and a self-propelled sprayer. All products can be factory-equipped with a new Versatile Precision Agriculture System, called VPAS, manufactured by Raven Industries (see sidebar). Versatile Marketing Manager Adam Reid says this is the first time in recent history that a product other than tractors has carried the Versatile brand name. \"Thirty to 40 years ago Versatile was also known for grain augers, pull-type sprayers, disks and, most notably, swathers,\" he says. \"There was even a pull-type combine at one point.\" He says the new self-propelled sprayer is the beginning of the company's expansion into complementary products designed for large-acreage growers. \"It's part of a bigger strategy to become a viable alternative to the 'main line' suppliers, and we're not shy about our ambitions,\" he states. Record sales The aggressive plans are partly attributable to the company's aggressive new leader, Dmitry Lyubimov, a 35-year-old Russian businessman who came on board as president in 2007 when Russian Combine Factory Rostselmash Ltd. bought the majority share of Buhler Industries. Lyubimov has been credited for transforming the tractor maker from a production-driven to a market-driven company, complete with financing programs, product specialists, field sales managers, a new parts warehouse, and all the other elements that contribute to being a world-class player. The company also made hefty investments in research and last year brought two new tractor models to the market under the Versatile brand name. As a result of these initiatives, the company recorded its highest sales volume in its history last year, garnering $278 million compared to $232 million in 2008. Now the plan is to sell even more product by expanding into areas other than tractors. Self-propelled sprayer The Versatile SX275 self-propelled sprayer is the first of the new line extension. The 1,200-gal., stainless steel sprayer is essentially the same Redball model 7830, which Redball released in 2007. Versatile bought the rights to the product last year when Redball filed for bankruptcy. The Versatile SX275 sprayer has a new Cummins engine to replace its previous John Deere engine to be consistent with the Versatile tractor line. Everything else is the same. Bigger 4-wd Versatile, best known for its 4-wds, introduced its largest model yet this year -- the 575 High Horsepower Tractor (HHT). Rated at 575 engine hp with a 610-hp power bulge, it is one of the largest articulated 4-wd tractors in the industry. Eric Allison, Versatile director of sales, says the 575 is a heavy pulling tractor designed for large-acreage farmers who need more power than the 435 and 535 HHT can offer. \"We're almost following the lead of implement manufacturers,\" Allison says. \"With the 84-ft. air drills now used in Canada, the 535 won't cut it anymore, especially on the hills.\" Allison says the tractor also has enough power to pull the new, heavier disk rippers now used to cut stalks left by genetically modified crops like Bt corn. It features the same heavy frame and 15-liter Cummins QSX engine as the other 4-wds in the HHT line, but it has a bigger cooling package to cut down on heat and make the engine run more efficiently. \"It is a Flex Air cooling package, which means the fan tilts as needed to provide adequate airflow,\" Allison says. \"A button will reverse the fan to blow out the opposite direction.\" It also features a Grizzly powershift transmission, supplied by Caterpillar, which is the same transmission that is in the other HHT models. But it has been redone and beefed up to handle the added power. Three new MFWDs Although 4-wd tractors are the company's biggest sellers, the biggest growth segment in tractors is fixed-frame, MFWD row-crop tractors, which are known for their maneuverability. Allison says this market segment is bigger than the 4-wd segment and has more players. \"Currently Versatile is selling five 4-wds to every one row-crop tractor,\" Allison says. \"We need to reverse that.\" To get a larger market share, the company added three new MFWD models to the two models it introduced last year. The new 190 and 220 models fill out the lower end of this lineup, and the 305 tops it off at 305 engine hp. The three new models will complete the changeover from the old Genesis line, which Versatile acquired from New Holland when it merged with Case IH. Allison says in the past 15 years, since that acquisition, Versatile lost share in the MFWD market because it did not devote enough research to keep the line current. The new Versatile models are the company's attempt to recoup that loss. The new models, like the other Versatile models released last year, feature a new 6.7-liter Cummins engine to replace the Ford engines that are no longer made. The 190 and 220 feature a new ZF partial powershift transmission to allow for more gears (24 vs. 18). Model 305 features a 16-speed full powershift Univance transmission, which has a bump shift lever to allow for faster or slower speeds in a single movement. More dealers, products As part of its expansion plans, Versatile is looking for more dealers to sell its product line. \"Currently 250 dealers sell the Versatile line,\" says North America sales manager Steve Fulton. \"We'd like to expand that, especially in the Midwest.\" The company signed up 15 new dealers in the past 12 months in the Midwest. The goal is to have one dealer per 60-mile radius. Lyubimov says Versatile will introduce more new products in 2011. The company is looking to acquire a seeding company, preferably one out of the United States. It also plans to import combine brands made by parent company Rostselmash Ltd. \"It's not a secret that our Russian company owns 80% of the combine market in Russia,\" Lyubimov says. Its brand names include Acros and Vector. Rostselmash makes both conventional and rotary combines in a range of class sizes. Two years ago it released its largest model yet, a Class 8 rotary combine, under the brand name Torum. The combine is undergoing testing for North America. Lyubimov says the combine and seeding equipment will subscribe to the same market niche as its tractors. \"Our strategy has been to make a simple, reliable product that it is easy to fix,\" he says. \"We will continue on the same path.\" Factory-equipped guidance and steering INTEGRATED GUIDANCE and steering is now offered as a factory-installed option on all Versatile brands under the name VPAS (Versatile Precision Agriculture System) through a recent agreement with Raven Industries. Under the agreement, all Versatile tractors can now be factory-equipped with Raven's automated steering and guidance products, starting with its Cruizer field computer with integrated GPS and a hydraulic steering system called SmarTrax. Price: $9,500. The new precision farming platform also will be a factory option on Versatile's new SX275 self-propelled sprayer. The machine comes equipped with a Raven 4400 sprayer controller for basic product application control and data logging. Buyers can upgrade to the Raven Envizio Pro, a 6.4-in. color touch-screen field computer, coupled with the Switch Pro device for GPS-guided section control, boom height control and steering control. This OEM supplier agreement is the first Raven has entered, allowing Versatile to put its name on Raven products. Raven's General Manager Matt Burkhart sees the agreement as a good fit for both companies. \"It's no secret that Versatile wants to be a full-line ag equipment manufacturer, and we are a full-line precision ag provider,\" he says. \"So we are ready to supply them with the technology.\" NEW FOR 2010 SPRAYER Versatile SX275 self-propelled sprayer.
